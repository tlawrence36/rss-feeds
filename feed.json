      "Actor Kim Sae-ron\u2019s death adds to the list of celebrity deaths in South Korea that underscore the enormous pressure they face under the gaze of a relentlessly unforgiving media that pounces on their every misstep",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In the about 1,000 days between her drunken-driving crash in May 2022 and her death, South Korean mainstream news organizations published at least around 2,000 stories on film actor Kim Sae-rom.",
      "They illustrate how the local media often cover a celebrity\u2019s fall from grace. Previously one of the brightest young stars in South Korean cinema, Kim was condemned and ridiculed for driving drunk; for talking about her financial struggles after losing roles; for taking a job at a coffee shop; for attempting a comeback in theater; for going out with friends instead of \u201cshowing remorse\u201d; and for being seen smiling on set while shooting an indie movie.",
      "After the 24-year-old actor was found dead at her home Sunday, the headlines predictably swung to calling for changes to the way celebrities are treated in the public arena.",
      "Kim\u2019s death, which police consider a suicide, adds to a growing list of high-profile celebrity deaths in the country, which some experts attribute to the enormous pressure celebrities face under the gaze of a relentlessly unforgiving media that seizes on every misstep.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: In South Korea, callers can receive 24-hour counseling through the suicide prevention hotline 1577-0199, the \u201cLife Line\u201d service at 1588-9191, the \u201cHope Phone\u201d at 129 and the \u201cYouth Phone\u201d at 1388.",
      "___",
      "Here's a look at the intense pressure faced by South Korean celebrities who fall from grace.",
      "South Korea is notoriously harsh on its celebrities, particularly women.",
      "Kim rose to stardom as a child actor with the 2010 hit crime thriller \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d and garnered acclaim and popularity for her acting in movies and TV dramas for years.",
      "But that changed after May 18, 2022, when Kim crashed a vehicle into a tree and an electrical transformer while driving drunk in southern Seoul. She posted a handwritten apology on Instagram and reportedly compensated around 60 shops that lost power temporarily because of the crash, but that did little to defuse negative coverage and she struggled to find acting work.",
      "When a Seoul court issued a 200 million won ($139,000) fine over the crash in April 2023, Kim expressed her fears about the media to reporters, saying many articles about her private life were untrue.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m too scared to say anything about them,\u201d she said.",
      "In the wake of Kim's drunken-driving crash, celebrity gossip channels on YouTube began posting negative videos about her private life, suggesting without providing evidence that she was exaggerating her financial straits by working at coffee shops, and arguing that social media posts showing her socializing with friends meant she wasn't showing enough remorse.",
      "Other entertainers, especially female, have struggled to find work after run-ins with the law, including drunken driving or substance abuse, and experts say many of them are reluctant to seek treatment for mental health problems like depression, fearing further negative coverage.",
      "Kwon Young-chan, a comedian-turned-scholar who leads a group helping celebrities with mental health issues, said celebrities often feel helpless when the coverage turns negative after spending years carefully cultivating their public image. Kwon, who stayed with Kim's relatives during a traditional three-day funeral process, said her family is considering legal action against a YouTube creator with hundreds of thousands of subscribers for what they describe as groundless attacks on Kim's private life.",
      "Peter Jongho Na, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, lamented on Facebook that South Korean society had become a giant version of \u201cSquid Game,\u201d the brutal Netflix survival drama, \u201cabandoning people who make mistakes or fall behind, acting as though nothing happened.\u201d",
      "The National Police Agency said officers found no signs of foul play at Kim's home and that she left no note.",
      "But a spate of high-profile deaths has sparked discussions about how news organizations cover the private lives of celebrities and whether floods of critical online comments are harming their mental health. Similar conversations happened after the 2008 death of mega movie star Choi Jin-sil; the death of her former baseball star husband, Cho Sung-min, in 2013; the deaths of K-Pop singers Sulli and Goo Hara in 2019; and the death of \u201cParasite\u201d actor Lee Sun-kyun in 2023.",
      "Sensational but unsubstantiated claims like from social media are widely recycled and amplified by traditional media outlets as they compete for audience attention, said Hyun-jae Yu, a communications professor at Seoul\u2019s Sogang University.",
      "Struggling with a sharp decline in traditional media readership, he said, media turn to covering YouTube drama as the easiest way to drive up traffic, often skipping the work of reporting and verifying facts.",
      "Following the 2019 deaths of Sulli and Goo Hara, which were widely attributed to cyberbullying and sexual harassment both in the public and media, lawmakers proposed various measures to discourage harsh online comments. These included expanding real-name requirements and strengthening websites\u2019 requirements to weed out hate speech and false information, but none of these proposed laws passed.",
      "South Korean management agencies are getting increasingly active in taking legal action to protect their entertainers from online bullying. Hybe, which manages several K-Pop groups including BTS, publishes regular updates about lawsuits it\u2019s filing against social media commentators it deems malicious.",
      "But Yu said it's crucial for mainstream media companies to strengthen self-regulation and limit their use of YouTube content as news sources. Government authorities could also compel YouTube and other social media platforms to take greater responsibility for content created by their users, he said, including actively removing problematic videos and preventing creators from monetizing them.",
      "The South Korean office of Google, YouTube's parent company, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Heo Chanhaeng, an executive director at the Center for Media Responsibility and Human Rights, said news organizations and websites should consider shutting down the comments sections on entertainment stories entirely.",
      "\u201cHer private life was indiscriminately reported beyond what was necessary,\u201d Heo said. \"That\u2019s not a legitimate matter of public interest.\u201d",

      "A famous YouTuber in India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on a YouTube show last week",
      "NEW DELHI -- A famous YouTuber in India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on a YouTube show, raising questions about freedom of speech in a country where digital creators in the past have come under fire for their content.",
      "The controversy began last week when social media influencer and YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia made remarks to a participant on a comedy show about his parents' personal relationship. The joke was quickly condemned by social media users, public figures and political leaders.",
      "Multiple police complaints were filed against Allahabadia and Samay Raina, who hosts the show \u201cIndia\u2019s Got Latent.\u201d Both of them, along with some other participants on the show, were summoned by police for questioning and the issue was also raised in Parliament.",
      "On the show, Allahbadia asked a contestant: \u201cWould you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?\u201d",
      "Allahbadia, who has interviewed senior Indian ministers and Bollywood celebrities on his YouTube channel, has since apologized for the comments. Raina, meanwhile, has removed all videos of the show from his YouTube channel and said he was \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the authorities.",
      "India\u2019s Supreme Court on Tuesday shielded Allahbadia from arrest but said his conduct showed \u201clack of responsibility\u201d and was \u201ccondemnable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is something that is dirty in his mind that has been vomited by way of this program,\u201d the judge hearing the case said.",
      "The court also ordered Allahbadia to surrender his passport at a police station and barred him from leaving the country.",
      "The case, however, prompted a parliamentary panel to write to the country's Information Technology Ministry seeking steps to amend existing laws to clamp down on such content.",
      "One lawmaker also asked Parliament to enact a law to regulate social media platforms, raising fears that the controversy will be used by the federal government to regulate online content.",
      "Indian content creators on social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram and X are worried after the government last year proposed draft legislation that aims to overhaul and regulate broadcasting services in the country. The legislation, if enacted into law, would apply to all content creators including YouTubers.",
      "Many content creators, journalists and digital experts say it could lead to censorship, stifle free speech and significantly expand the government\u2019s powers to regulate digital media content.",
      "\u201cI think we are facing a threat that this particular incident might be a trigger point for obscenity laws,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, a digital policy analyst and founder of the tech website MediaNama.",
      "In Allahbadia's case, observers say the controversy was blown out of proportion and could lead to a chilling effect on India\u2019s comedy scene.",
      "\"The morality of the audience and the current political atmosphere is a very strong determining factor that decides whether our jokes are acceptable or not. And once a perception has been made about your content, no one can control its outcome. It is troubling,\u201d said Anurag Minus Verma, a cultural critic based in New Delhi.",
      "This is the not the first time Indian comedians have come under fire for their jokes and faced police crackdowns or their shows being cancelled.",
      "Stand-up comedy has become hugely popular in recent years in India, but a swelling tide of nationalism under Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's rule has also put comedians under scrutiny for making fun of politicians or making references to religion or national icons.",
      "In 2021, comedian Vir Das faced police complaints for his \u201cI Come from Two Indias\u201d show, which was critical of India over its fight against COVID-19, crimes against women and crackdowns on comedians. During his show, Das described India as a country where people \u201cworship women during the day but gang rape them at night.\u201d",
      "That same year comedians Munawar Faruqui and Nalin Yadav were arrested by police for making allegedly objectionable remarks about Hindu deities while performing in an Indian state that\u2019s ruled by Modi\u2019s party. Faruqui was jailed for a month."

      "In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry, MGM Amazon announced that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control",
      "NEW YORK -- In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry, Amazon MGM announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",
      "Financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\u201cWith my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\u201d Wilson said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\u201d",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.5 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007 concluded with 2021's \u201cNo Time to Die,\u201d Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",
      "The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in the more than 50-year history of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting a new James Bond film. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theatres around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \u201cWe are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "\u201cWatson\u201d is an unusual TV medical procedural",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea for a new TV show came to Craig Sweeny as he was driving. The producer and screenwriter, thinking about how to put his own stamp on a medical series, had to pull over when a familiar figure popped into his mind: Sherlock Holmes.",
      "Why not combine a hospital procedural with the lore of Britain's greatest detective? It would have a medical mystery every week and also tell stories of Holmes' good friend, Dr. John Watson. It was a mashup of two popular draws, the TV equivalent of peanut butter and jelly.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re sort of each their own show-worthy premise in a way. And we\u2019re blessed to have both. So they compete for space in a really interesting way,\u201d says Sweeny.",
      "So was born \u201cWatson,\u201d a CBS series starring Morris Chestnut as the titular character who leads a team of medical detectives set in a present-day Pittsburgh populated with Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s characters.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those blessed moments,\u201d says Sweeny, who was well-versed with the world of Holmes after executive producing and writing for \u201cElementary,\u201d a contemporary update.",
      "\u201cWatson\u201d is not alone among the networks jazzing up the tried-and-true procedural. While the traditional form remains the bedrock of modern TV \u2014 think the prime-time blocks of \u201cNCIS,\u201d \u201cFBI\u201d and \u201cChicago Med\u201d \u2014 new twists are emerging.",
      "ABC\u2019s \u201cDoctor Odyssey\u201d is a medical procedural aboard a luxury cruise ship and NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Hunting Party\u201d mashes up \u201cThe Blacklist\u201d and \u201cCriminal Minds.\u201d CBS has Kathy Bates in \u201cMatlock\u201d playing an underestimated, retirement-age lawyer \u2014 with the twist that she\u2019s really a hard-charging mom out for vengeance.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something really pleasurable about the self-contained, 43-minute procedural that gives you a beginning, middle and end, a little bit of a mystery and the fun of watching something get figured out,\u201d says Jonathan Tolins, a playwright, TV writer and showrunner. \u201cI think that the audience is so familiar with it that it does reward you if you come up with a sort of fun twist on it.\u201d",
      "Tolins' own current take on the procedural is CBS' \u201cElsbeth,\u201d which takes the quirky character Elsbeth Tascioni from \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d and plops her down in a \u201cColumbo\u201d-style police procedural.",
      "Elsbeth, played by Carrie Preston, is a sleuth in bright colors and a bucket hat, blunt and unpredictable, playing off the guest star of the week. Tolins says the writers and camera crew try not to make her feel like the show's lead, even though she's the very title.",
      "\u201cI said early on that I think the show works best when it feels like a CBS police procedural with Elsbeth thrown into it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe talked about always keeping her sort of out of the center of the frame in wide shots.\u201d",
      "Another elevated procedural with a quirky lead character is ABC\u2019s \u201cHigh Potential,\u201d a police show starring a genius \u2014 but this time, she\u2019s a single mom of three who has an IQ of 160 and is played by Kaitlin Olson.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a bit of a unicorn,\u201d says Todd Harthan, executive producer and showrunner. \u201cYou throw a unicorn into the bullpen with a bunch of detectives and they go, \u2018What are we supposed to do with this colorful creature with the horn coming out of her head?\u2019\u201d",
      "Supercharging procedurals comes as streaming increasingly offers subscribers a highly curated selection of unconventional, relatively short series with big names and high production values.",
      "\u201cI think that, inevitably, the innovations that streaming is doing bleed into what happens in network TV and challenge what we\u2019re doing to compete for eyeballs in a healthy way,\u201d says Sweeny.",
      "Procedurals are often referred to as the comfort food of TV, offering a predictable, solvable hour with a familiar cast. So strong is our attachment to the form that streaming services have also been stretching their form with shows like the also \u201cColumbo\u201d-like \u201cPoker Face\u201d on Peacock and Max's \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d which takes a medical show like \u201cER\u201d and breaks it down into different hours of a hospital shift, like \u201c24.\u201d",
      "Harthan believes the gap between the streaming and network may be closing as networks offer writers a bit of a longer leash to try different things and streaming looks enviously at the broad audiences that networks pull.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re always sort of learning and trying to glean certain things from different shows that are very different than the one you\u2019re working on day-to-day,\u201d Harthan says. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the growth of doing what we do for a living.\u201d",
      "Showrunners caution that mixing different elements into a show to raise the level can't be done willy-nilly. The creator of \u201cWatson\u201d notes that its hero was already a doctor in the world of Sherlock Holmes, so making him head of a clinic makes sense.",
      "\u201cIt is an exotic combo, but it\u2019s also very organic,\u201d says Sweeny. \u201cMechanically you don\u2019t have to force anything into place. Everything\u2019s already there.\u201d",
      "A few years ago, the term \u201cgourmet cheeseburger\u201d was given to streaming shows that were both premium and commercial \u2014 take \u201cBridgerton\u201d \u2014 and network TV may be going through their own gourmet cheeseburger phase.",
      "\u201cThe more the two converge, the better,\u201d says Robert King. He and his wife, Michelle King, are the prolific creators of shows on networks (\u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d \u201cEvil\u201d and \u201cElsbeth\u201d) and streaming (\u201cHappy Face\u201d).",
      "\u201cWe love working in both and we don\u2019t start with, \u2018Oh, we must do a network show,\u2019 or, \u2018We must do a streaming show.\u2019 It's very much, \u2018This idea we have fits more comfortably either in network or in streaming,\u2019\u201d says Michelle King.",
      "Robert King considers one of the greatest TV hybrids to be \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d which mixed a comic premise with violence and put it into a serialized format. It was a hit for HBO but was originally pitched to a network, Fox.",
      "\u201cI do think the hybrid goes back to \u2018The Sopranos,\u2019 at least and I\u2019m sure beyond that,\u201d he says.",
      "Tolins, who leads the \u201cElsbeth\u201d writing room, recently got some nice feedback about his elevated procedural skills. CBS did a focus group about the new season's premiere episode, which starred \u2014 spoilers \u2014 Nathan Lane as the killer of an obnoxious operagoer.",
      "\u201cOne of the women who saw it afterwards kept saying, \u2018This is network? I\u2019m going to have to watch more network television,\u2019 which of course was very, very satisfying for all of us listening,\u201d Tolins says."

      "Christoph Waltz\u2019s Danny Dolinski is the one at an unwelcome crossroads in the film. He\u2019s only partially healed from a hand injury that\u2019s rendered him dependent on pills and unable to aim a gun as well as he used to. Dolinski also seems to be in the throes of a full crisis: We meet him not on the job, or even in flashback to his pre-injury glory, but out clubbing. The next morning, Dolinski emerges in a bathrobe to gaze proudly upon the several much younger women who have spent the night.",
      "But a room full of scantily clothed model-types who seem to be there willingly is only a temporary balm for poor Dolinski. While he might still be a viable specimen for the 20-something party girls of London, his game does not hold the same appeal in the workplace. Soon he\u2019ll be getting the dreaded \u201cwe\u2019re going younger\u201d talk from his boss, and she\u2019s talking about him, not his love interests. This is a guy who is certain he\u2019s got a lot left to give in the assassin game, and not as a mentor to a \u201chitman prodigy,\u201d as Cooper Hoffman\u2019s character Wihlborg is described.",
      "Is a familiar conceit like the wise veteran and the cocksure newcomer tired or a classic? Well, it\u2019s all in the execution. And \u201cOld Guy,\u201d stylishly filmed though it may be, is not one of the better attempts, likely hampered by the script from Greg Johnson. Generational clashes should be easy enough comedic fodder for a screenwriter and two capable actors, but here it lands with a thud. One likes to drink! The other doesn\u2019t even like to be around alcohol! The more serious ethical questions about hitman etiquette are similarly inelegant. Take this gem from Wihlborg: \u201cWhere I come from one does what one needs to do to survive. That includes killing a kid.\u201d",
      "Hoffman, so perfect leading \u201cLicorice Pizza,\u201d is not served well by this script, which never quite justifies why he\u2019s such a prodigy at such a young age and doesn\u2019t give him or Waltz any room to play off one another in a natural way. Waltz also can\u2019t seem to choose a lane with Danny, an eccentric hedonist with a soul who doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to kill kids on the job. He\u2019s also working with his normal accent which is all well and good until the movie very unnecessarily introduces his Irish mother.",
      "And because action movies of this variety need a woman, Lucy Liu, who deserves much, much better than this (they all do, but mostly her), goes along for the ride. Her character Anata is the glamorous manager of a Soho karaoke bar that might also be a front for a brothel, but that\u2019s never really explored. What is deemed important here is that she\u2019s Dolinski\u2019s longtime confidante, and tags along on their mission to Belfast for\u2026wait for it\u2026a date. It\u2019s a very strange little subplot in which Anata does go to this date only to be broken up with. The guy she\u2019s been seeing is not connected to the larger plot in any way, except as the narrative push to have her ultimately fall in Dolinski\u2019s arms.",
      "West is an action and studio system veteran behind \u201cCon Air,\u201d \u201cLara Croft: Tomb Raider\u201d and various Jason Statham vehicles. There's lots of shoot-em-up action and bullets to the head for anyone looking for that, but not much more to hang on to. \u201cOld Guy\u201d feels very of this moment in the fact that it looks good and has a good cast and yet can\u2019t seem to deliver something that\u2019s either entertaining or meaningful. But unlike so many of its peers, this one amazingly was not made by a streamer.",
      "\u201cOld Guy,\u201d a The Avenue release in limited theaters and on VOD Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201clanguage, violence, some drug use.\u201d Running time: 93 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

      "Weeks before the book's release, Puchner himself received some very surprising news, from Oprah Winfrey, who told him that she had chosen \u201cDream State\u201d for her book club.",
      "\u201cI got a phone call from a number I didn't recognize,\" the author said during a recent interview. \u201cWhen the caller said she was Oprah Winfrey I nearly dropped the phone I was so baffled. I was expecting to talk to my publicist, and at first, I didn't believe her. But then she started to talk in that inimitable way.\u201d",
      "The 54-year-old author is an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University who hopes the Winfrey endorsement might mark a shift from years \u201ctoiling in obscurity,\u201d wishing only that he could attract enough readers to keep writing. \u201cDream State\u201d is the fourth book from Puchner, whose previous works include the story collections \u201cMusic Through the Floor\u201d and \u201cLast Day on Earth\u201d and the novel \u201cModel Home,\u201d a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award in 2011.",
      "Puchner's latest work, published Tuesday, is a love triangle among two old college friends and the woman they both have wished to marry. Set mostly in Montana and California, the 432-page narrative extends half a century from his characters' early years to approaching old age as all contend with their feelings for each other and how they imagine they might otherwise have turned out.",
      "\u201cThis is the kind of book you won\u2019t want to put down written by a brilliant storyteller,\u201d Winfrey said in a statement. \u201cSpanning fifty years, \u2018Dream State\u2019 is an exquisite examination of the important relationships we have in our lives \u2014 love, marriage, friendship \u2014 and how life can turn out so differently than we expected.\u201d",
      "Puchner is a Baltimore resident who says the book was inspired in part by a disastrous wedding he once attended that he re-imagined for \u201cDream State\u201d and by a house in Montana that he and his wife and two children stay at in the summer. The book touches upon the damages caused by climate change that he has witnessed over the years in Montana, whether drought or hotter temperatures.",
      "\u201cI know that I wanted to write about this place that I love and what was happening to it,\u201d he says.",
      "Winfrey established her book club in 1996 and currently presents it in partnership with Starbucks. Her conversation with Puchner took place in a Starbucks in the Empire State Building and the video podcast can be seen on Winfrey's YouTube channel."

      "The trial of the only suspect ever charged in the 1996 killing of rap icon Tupac Shakur has been postponed",
      "LAS VEGAS -- A Nevada judge on Tuesday postponed the murder trial of the only suspect ever charged in the 1996 killing of rap icon Tupac Shakur for nearly a year, saying she had little choice given new developments presented by his defense attorneys and the need to ensure a fair trial.",
      "The trial of Duane \u201cKeffe D\u201d Davis, previously set for next month in Las Vegas, has been rescheduled for Feb. 9, 2026. The judge ordered prosecutors and the defense to return to court over the summer for a status hearing.",
      "\u201cIt looks like there are quite a few things that are left to be done to get this case prepared so that Mr. Davis can have effective assistance of counsel,\u201d Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny said during a short hearing.",
      "When asked by the judge if he was OK with moving the trial that far out, Davis agreed.",
      "Davis' defense team filed a motion Friday seeking more time, saying critical investigative work had to be done and witnesses needed to be interviewed to ensure he gets a fair trial. The lawyers said a private investigator identified witnesses who can testify that Davis was not at the scene of the shooting.",
      "Attorney Carl Arnold, who is leading the defense, said the case involves decades-old allegations and critical facts have yet to be fully examined.",
      "On the night of Sept. 7, 1996, Shakur was in a BMW being driven by Death Row Records founder Marion \u201cSuge\u201d Knight. They were waiting at a red light when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted.",
      "Davis, an ex-gang leader who is accused of orchestrating Shakur\u2019s killing near the Las Vegas Strip, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and has been jailed since his September 2023 arrest.",
      "Davis has acknowledged in interviews and in his tell-all memoir that he provided the gun used in the drive-by shooting and that he was in the car. But his court filings say his descriptions in recent years of orchestrating the shooting were \u201cdone for entertainment purposes and to make money.\u201d",
      "Arnold has argued that Davis never should have been charged because of immunity agreements that Davis says he reached years ago with federal and local prosecutors while living in California.",
      "Prosecutors disagree, saying they have strong evidence against Davis and any immunity agreement was limited.",
      "Defense attorneys also are raising questions about the manner of Shakur's death, saying they have witness information indicating that he was in stable condition after the shooting and died suddenly after being hospitalized for a week. They want to consult medical and forensic experts to evaluate potential alternative causes of death."

He\u2019s just the hired muscle, quietly observing and reacting to the quickly devolving situation around him. And yet you can\u2019t take your eyes off of this stranger.",
      "Up until that point it\u2019s been the Mikey Madison show, a chronicle of her character Ani\u2019s whirlwind romance with the spendy, wild son of a Russian oligarch. Igor arrives at the turning point, the end of the honeymoon and the beginning of a swift descent into a chaotic, all-night manhunt. And soon he establishes himself not just as an intriguing outsider, but the soul of the film: The henchman with a heart.",
      "It\u2019s a performance that has caught many off guard: An introduction to a fresh face with an undeniable star quality that has earned him nominations from the Oscars, the Screen Actors Guild and the BAFTAs. But Borisov, 32, is only a newcomer in some parts of the world. Already a star in Russia, Borisov broke through on the international scene in the Cannes title \u201cCompartment No. 6\u201d as the uncouth miner sharing a cramped room with a Finnish student on a long train ride through Russia.",
      "That was the performance that made filmmaker Sean Baker take note and give him a call about participating in what would become \u201cAnora.\u201d Baker has described his secret weapon, who quickly becomes the beating heart and soul of the film, as the \u201cRussian Ryan Gosling.\" Borisov is flattered, but also little confused by the comparison.",
      "\u201cI love Ryan Gosling and very interested to work with him one day. I\u2019ve seen his films. He plays very, very cool. But I don\u2019t know what he means,\u201d Borisov laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s ask Sean.\u201d",
      "Baker, for his part, knew he had a ringer in Borisov but doesn\u2019t show his hand from the top. He strings the audience along, letting them feel like they\u2019re discovering something too. The 28-minute real-time home invasion scene where we meet Igor was actually Borisov\u2019s first to film. It was rehearsed and discussed in detail before the cameras started rolling. In all, it took about eight days to film and three months to edit.",
      "\u201cWe discussed everything trying to find the balance humor and scares and drama and comedy because it\u2019s important for this scene to,\" Borisov said. \u201cBut for me I\u2019m just thinking about a real person named Igor and a real person named Anora.\u201d",
      "He and Baker spoke a lot about Igor\u2019s past, his story, his dreams and his clothes. The white Nike sneakers as contrast to Igor\u2019s all black outfit, he thought, were particularly poignant \u2014 a symbol of Igor\u2019s soul. He liked that his director would ask him if he thought Igor might do this or that instead of just telling him to do something.",
      "But Borisov is not the kind of actor who thinks that he has much interesting to say or explain about his performance. If he could, he said, he\u2019d be a writer. For him, it\u2019s the work that does the talking.",
      "\u201cThe most important is what do you feel when you see the film,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so important what we were discussing.\u201d",
      "The week that Borisov spoke to the AP was the week \u201cAnora\u201d had emerged as the frontrunner in an awards race that had previously been wide open. The supporting actor category however, competitive as it may be with nominees like Edward Norton, Guy Pearce and Jeremy Strong, has been considered Kieran Culkin\u2019s to lose for some time now. But it\u2019s still significant: Borisov is the first Russian actor to get an Oscar nomination since Mikhail Baryshnikov\u2019s nod in 1977 for \u201cThe Turning Point.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that it means something for a lot of people and that\u2019s why it means a lot for me,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople could feel some hope maybe inside them, maybe proud inside them, you know? \u201c",
      "It\u2019s been a wild ride since Cannes and the end is now in sight. Soon he\u2019d be leaving for London, to attend the BAFTAs, and in two weeks Los Angeles for the Oscars. The accolades and nominations have been exciting, though the impulse to keep the conversations going with all the interesting people he\u2019s met along the way has led to more than few late nights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a crazy, crazy time,\u201d he said.",
      "It\u2019s too early for him to talk publicly about how much the raised profile has impacted his career, but, he teased \u201clife is changing.\u201d And if he\u2019s being completely honest, he\u2019s happiest about simply getting to spend more time with the people he made the film with.",
      "\u201cMaybe it looks like kind of stupid because you could say that \u2018man, it\u2019s awards, it\u2019s big opportunities for you, why are you talking about spend time with your friends?\u2019\u201d Borisov said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s kind of stupid, but for me, it\u2019s still important to spend this time with them together. Because without this stuff, we will go to live our life separately. And it will be one day, of course, and I\u2019m kind of sad about this but it just will come. Now we\u2019re still together and I\u2019m happy about this.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe broader discussion in the media has made patients very aware and very concerned about these things,\u201d Knutter said.",
      "Oklahoma\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday voted 6-2 against advancing a proposal to allow murder charges against women who obtain abortions, with possible punishments including the death penalty and life in prison.",
      "A week earlier, North Dakota\u2019s House rejected a measure with similar features 77-16.",
      "Groups including the National Right to Life Committee and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America have for years been urging lawmakers not to consider those measures, arguing that women are often coerced into abortion and should not be punished.",
      "Some conservative lawmakers see it differently.",
      "\u201cWhile the abortion clinics no longer offer or perform abortion, there is a massive loophole in Oklahomans' laws,\u201d Sen. Dusty Deevers, who sponsored the Oklahoma measure, told the judiciary committee during a hearing Wednesday. \u201cNamely, they don\u2019t apply to the mothers themselves.\u201d",
      "Deevers said his approach is the only way to stop the flow of abortion pills prescribed by doctors in other states via telehealth and shipped in. A survey conducted for the Society of Family Planning, which advocates abortion access, found that there were nearly 1,000 abortions via telemedicine in Oklahoma in the second half of 2023. The Guttmacher Institute, another research organization that supports abortion rights, has found that by 2023, more than 6 in 10 abortions in the formal healthcare system nationally involved pills.",
      "Democrats and some Republicans on the committee had concerns, including that the law could lead to criminal investigations of women who have miscarriages, that such an extreme approach could rally support for a state constitutional amendment to allow abortion, or that enforcement would be hard.",
      "Similar measures in Idaho and Indiana appear unlikely to advance. Bills have also been introduced in South Carolina and Texas.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 08:56:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Spending all day standing can take a toll on a worker&rsquo;s body",
    "story": [
      "Spending all day standing can take a toll on a worker\u2019s body",
      "NEW YORK -- While traveling in Europe, Margaux Lantelme noticed something different about the store cashiers: they did their work sitting down. It was a stark contrast to Chicago, where Lantelme works the register at REI and cashiers typically spend eight hours a day on their feet.",
      "For Lantelme, a former kayaking instructor, prolonged standing can trigger flare-ups of chronic pain that limit her mobility. She requested a chair to use during her shift and got one. But after a change in management, she had to fill out paperwork to keep the chair, which required multiple doctor visits and insurance co-payments over a period of months. She's still waiting for final approval.",
      "\u201cNot having access to a chair without approval from a doctor, which costs money and time and energy, is really ridiculous,\u201d Lantelme said. \u201cI personally think that people should be able to have access to seating at work anytime they need it.\u201d",
      "Standing for long periods can lead to low back pain, fatigue, muscle pain and leg swelling, and it can increase the risk of cardiovascular problems and pregnancy complications, according to a review conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Researchers there concluded that movement, whether walking or shifting from a standing to a seated or leaning position, appeared to be the best way of reducing those health hazards.",
      "Being on one's feet for an extended time also can lead to chronic venous insufficiency, a disease in which damaged veins impact blood circulation, according to the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses, which represents operating room nurses.",
      "The association recommends trying \u201cfatigue-reducing techniques such as alternate propping one foot on a footstool, the use of anti-fatigue mats, using a sit-stand stool and wearing supportive footwear,\u201d said Lisa Spruce, senior director of evidence-based perioperative practices at AORN.",
      "Many jobs besides nursing require extended standing: department store sales clerks, hairdressers, surgeons, restaurant cooks and airport workers are just some of the people who perform their roles on their feet.",
      "Cecilia Ortiz, 43, used to work as an airport wheelchair attendant in Phoenix. \u201cIt takes a really hard toll on the knees,\u201d she said. The break room had three or four chairs, which wasn\u2019t enough for everyone, so workers often went to the hallway and sat on the floor, Ortiz said.",
      "She said she once got written up by her boss for sitting down at an electronic device charging station for 15 minutes after she'd been on her feet for five hours without a break.",
      "Ortiz now works for a warehouse that provides supplies to the airport, and when she needs to sit, she can.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not so strict over there. If we needed to sit down for any reason there wouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Ortiz said.",
      "Her former employer, Prospect Airport Services, said it adheres to all local, state and federal labor regulations regarding breaks. \"Our employees are welcome to take their breaks and meals in our designated break room or in any common-use space throughout the airport,\" company spokesperson Jackie Reedy said. \"This policy allows our employees to choose the location that best suits their needs.\u201d",
      "Unionized workers at the Barnes & Nobles store in Manhattan's Union Square have made access to chairs and the right to sit down under certain conditions a part of their negotiations for their first contract.",
      "\u201cThe longer I\u2019ve been at the job, I\u2019ve started noticing knee issues, especially because we do a lot of bending down and standing back up when we\u2019re shelving books and showing customers things and creating displays,\u201d bookseller Bear Spiegel, 28, said. \u201cBeing able to have a stool available would be really useful just so I could rest my knees for a couple of minutes throughout the day while I\u2019m doing things on the computer while I\u2019m at the registers.\u201d",
      "Spiegel\u2019s coworkers suggested wearing a knee brace and athletic tape, and those solutions have helped, but it\u2019s hard for him to predict what days he\u2019ll need the extra support because his symptoms vary each day, he said.",
      "\u201cThere have been days that I\u2019ve requested a stool and thankfully my managers have allowed me to take them out and use them when needed,\u201d Spiegel said.",
      "Barnes & Noble uses chairs or stools routinely for those working off the sales floor when it\u2019s sensible to do so, but a lot of a bookseller\u2019s work is done on the move, including unpacking, sorting and shelving books, a company spokesperson said.",
      "The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents about 100,000 workers, has been pushing to include in the contracts it negotiates, including at Barnes & Noble, a guaranteed right to sit during work that can be done seated, said Stuart Appelbaum, the union's president.",
      "During one bargaining session, an employer objected to the demand. Union negotiators used a break that emptied the conference room to underline their position. \u201cThe employer came back and saw we had removed all chairs from the negotiating table,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cI think the point was made.\u201d",
      "In the end, the union got the chairs it wanted written into the contract, he said.",
      "Around the turn of the 20th century, most states in the U.S. had laws requiring seating for female workers. Women were increasingly entering the workforce, and there was a fear that if their jobs were too physically taxing, they might not become pregnant, said Eileen Boris, a labor historian and professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",
      "Women were seen as the \u201cmothers of the human race, and thus we have to protect motherhood,\u201d Boris added. \u201cAlmost every state had laws, but they weren\u2019t enforced.\u201d",
      "Those laws were repealed over time because they applied only to women. One reason was that the women's movement was pushing for equal rights, rather than special treatment, Boris said.",
      "Labor movements in other countries were more successful in establishing requirements about seating. \u201cThe English shop movement was much stronger and had more men in it than the U.S.,\" Boris said.",
      "In 1964, the International Labour Organization, a U.N. agency, adopted workplace standards requiring employers to furnish sufficient and suitable seats, as well as reasonable opportunities for workers to use them. More than 50 countries ratified the agreement, but the U.S. was not one of them.",
      "Today, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon and Wisconsin are among the states with \u201cright to sit\u201d laws that obligate employers to provide suitable seating for all workers, regardless of gender, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "The city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, approved an ordinance in October that requires manufacturers, retail stores, laundromats, hotels, restaurants, hairdressers, barbers and skin care professionals to let workers sit down as along as sitting doesn\u2019t interfere with their duties. A statewide bill also was introduced in Michigan last fall.",

    "story": [
      "New York is suing several large electronic cigarette distributors for allegedly selling vaping flavors that can appeal to children",
      "New York on Thursday sued some of the country\u2019s biggest distributors of electronic cigarettes, accusing the companies of violating state laws that prohibit the sale of vaping flavors and designs that appeal to children.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James announced the lawsuit targeting middlemen that distribute fruit- and candy-flavored e-cigarettes like Puff Bar and Elf Bar to hundreds of convenience stories and gas stations across the state. The approach differs from past litigation by New York and other states, which targeted vaping manufacturers, such as Juul Labs.",
      "Widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping trend, Juul has paid more than $1 billion to settle dozens of state and local lawsuits and investigations into its early marketing practices, which included launch parties and product giveaways. The company stopped selling flavors like mango and mint in 2019 and is no longer popular with teens.",
      "Instead, Chinese-made disposable e-cigarettes like Elf Bar have become the top choice among high school and middle school students. None of the products are approved by federal health regulators but they continue shipping into the U.S., often mislabeled as batteries, cell phones or other products.",
      "The state\u2019s nearly 200-page legal complaint points to \u201cwidespread evidence of illegal conduct, including documents showing illegal shipments of flavored vapes to New York.\u201d The filing also includes photos of brightly colored e-cigarettes that resemble soft drinks and candy and come in flavors like \u201cfruity bears freeze,\u201d \u201ccotton candy,\u201d and \u201cstrawberry cereal donut milk.\u201d",
      "New York banned all vaping flavors other than tobacco in 2020.",
      "\u201cFor too long, these companies have disregarded our laws in order to profit off of our young people, but we will not risk the health and safety of our kids,\u201d James said in a statement.",
      "The lawsuit seeks hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from the companies, as well as a permanent ban on their sales of flavored vapes in New York.",
      "In 2022 litigation, the co-founder of Buffalo-based Demand Vape told a federal judge that his company had sold more than $132 million worth of Elf Bar e-cigarettes in the past year. The company that makes Elf Bar is based in Shenzhen, China, and sells flavors including \u201cstrawberry mango\u201d and \u201clemon mint.\u201d",
      "Despite the continued availability of disposable e-cigarettes, the vaping rate among U.S. teens has fallen to a 10-year low of under 6%, according to federal figures released last year. Government health officials attribute the drop to more aggressive U.S. enforcement, including hundreds of warning letters sent to retail stores selling unauthorized vaping products.",

    "summary": "A U.S. aid freeze is threatening the lives of HIV-positive orphans at Nyumbani Children&rsquo;s Home in Nairobi",
    "story": [
      "A U.S. aid freeze is threatening the lives of HIV-positive orphans at Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home in Nairobi",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Two-year-old Evans was brought to the Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home in Nairobi, Kenya a year ago, suffering from HIV and tuberculosis. With no family to care for him, Evans was referred to the orphanage by a health center after he stopped responding to medical treatment.",
      "Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home is the reason Evans is still alive. But political decisions made thousands of miles (kilometers) away might spell the end of his short life. Nyumbani provides him and around 100 other children with antiretroviral medication, which they have been receiving from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Kenyan government.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order to freeze USAID\u2019s funding means Nyumbani\u2019s access to life-saving antiretroviral drugs, which stop the HIV virus from replicating in the body, may end soon.",
      "Trump\u2019s order seeks to review almost all U.S. foreign aid for 90 days and his administration has moved to shut down USAID. The effects are beginning to set it in, with thousands of people losing their jobs globally and humanitarian programs around the world disrupted.",
      "For children at Nyumbani Children's Home, it's a life and death situation.",
      "As he plays with other preschoolers, Evans is oblivious to his uncertain future, despite the worry on his caregivers\u2019 faces.",
      "The tiny graves at one end of the orphanage compound are a bleak reminder of what a future without USAID looks like for the children. It's a scenario Sister Tresa Palakudy \u2014 who has been looking after children here for 28 years \u2014 is well familiar with having worked at the orphanage before USAID started helping.",
      "\u201cWhen we started caring for them, they didn\u2019t look like they had life in them,\u201d she said. \u201cOne after another, they died. It was so painful, and I don\u2019t want to see that happen again.\"",
      "When Nyumbani, which means \u201cHome\u201d in Swahili, was started in 1992 by Christian missionaries, antiretroviral medication had not been introduced. Back then, it operated as a rescue center for orphaned and abandoned children living with HIV, offering largely palliative care.",
      "The 2003 inception of the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, provided new hope for children living with HIV around the continent, including the orphans at Nyumbani. PEPFAR\u2019s humanitarian aid to combat HIV in Kenya was funded largely by USAID.",
      "\u201cUSAID started bringing ARVs free of charge,\u201d said Palakudy. \u201cWe put all our children on ARVs and their lives changed. They became healthy and were able to go to school and live like other children.\u201d",
      "Over the last two decades, the U.S government, through PEPFAR, has spent more than $8 billion on HIV/AIDS treatment for close to 1.3 million people in Kenya.",
      "USAID and PEPFAR have been critical to operating Nyumbani, having donated more than $16 million to the home between 1999 and 2023. This has enabled the home to reach up to 50,000 children through the rescue center, as well as its two outreach programs Lea Toto and Nyumbani Village. The aid included direct funds to the home, which was used to run the two outreach programs.",
      "Direct funding from USAID was discontinued in 2023, about the same time the orphanage came under scrutiny over allegations of sexual abuse of children by volunteers and staff members.",
      "According to a Washington Post report, six former residents claimed that administrators at the home covered up allegations of sexual abuse. The home disputed the claims of a cover up, insisting that all allegations were handled according to protocols including reporting to local authorities and providing counseling to affected residents.",
      "Executive Director Judith Wamboye said investigations by the Kenyan police were inconclusive. The discontinuation of the funds was not related to the investigations and was in line with a change in USAID policy to channel aid through the government rather than directly to organizations.",
      "The policy change affected all organizations receiving funding. Rather than giving money directly to non-governmental organizations, funding would be channeled through government programs that catered to similar needs. As a result, Nyumbani scaled down its outreach programs and referred beneficiaries to government institutions.",
      "With the discontinuation of direct funding from USAID, the two outreach programs under Nyumbani were scaled down and children in the program were referred to other centers. However, Nyumbani has still been reliant on USAID to supply the lifesaving PEPFAR HIV treatment drugs for free.",
      "\u201cThe future is uncertain,\u201d said Wamboye. \u201cThe Kenyan government announced that they only have ARV stocks to last six months.\u201d",
      "According to data from amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, about 1.3 million people are on HIV/AIDS treatment in Kenya, and 1,602 orphans and vulnerable children in Kenya are dependent on PEPFAR. amfAR warns that President Trump\u2019s freeze on foreign aid could sever their access to critical medical care.",
      "One such child is Mercy, who has been under the care of Nyumbani for the last 12 years. The ARVs saved her life. \u201cI had a very weak immune system,\" she said. \"This led me to contracting many serious illnesses like tuberculosis and skin diseases.\u201d",
      "Mercy was placed on HIV treatment, giving her a lifeline, but recent news on the freeze order has her scared for her life.",
      "\u201cI am very afraid that previous illnesses that I experienced when I was young will reoccur. And now that I have finished high school and am ready to join college, I am scared it will ruin everything,\u201d she said.",
      "On average, the children's home requires $1,139 per child annually for HIV treatment. In addition to antiretrovirals, the home needs reagents to enable regular testing of the viral load in the children, as well as medicines to treat opportunistic illnesses, which are common among HIV patients.",
      "Wamboye said that should PEPFAR be discontinued permanently, the cost of ARVs could go up and become unaffordable, which will mean children living with HIV will die.",
      "\u201cThis is a life-saving situation and we cannot sit and wait and bargain on human life. So for us, it\u2019s about human life, the lives that we need to save. Something needs to be done urgently,\u201d she said.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 21:30:31 -0500",
    "summary": "The freeze on U.S. foreign aid ordered by President Donald Trump has effectively halted one of the world's most successful responses to a disease",
    "story": [
      "The freeze on U.S. foreign aid ordered by President Donald Trump has effectively halted one of the world's most successful responses to a disease",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Florence Makumene held a plastic container of HIV medication and wondered if it would be her last as fears swelled of a return to a time decades ago when millions across sub-Saharan Africa died of AIDS.",
      "As a young adult in Zimbabwe, Makumene watched loved ones succumb to a diagnosis of HIV that was viewed back then as a death sentence. But the 53-year-old didn\u2019t have to suffer the same fate when she tested positive in 2016. A community group funded by the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, ensured she enrolled in lifesaving treatment.",
      "\u201cPeople around me, including my own children, had written me off and were preparing to bury me, but I bounced back stronger,\u201d Makumene said.",
      "PEPFAR has been credited with saving more than 26 million lives and helping change the course of AIDS globally since being introduced in 2003. But the 90-day freeze on foreign aid ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump effectively halted one of the world\u2019s most successful responses to a disease, although his administration subsequently promised waivers to keep lifesaving treatment going. A judge has ordered the administration to lift the freeze.",
      "In Africa, thousands of U.S.-funded health workers have been laid off and clinics have closed, restricting access to HIV testing and treatment. African health officials and experts have pleaded for PEPFAR to resume, fearing services that have become a key part of the health care system will be stripped in a way that sets countries back decades.",
      "\u201cPeople are finding doors closed. They are desperate,\u201d said Simon Bwanya of the Zimbabwe National Network of People Living with HIV.",
      "Globally, AIDS-related deaths have been reduced by 69% since the peak in 2004 and new HIV infections have been reduced by 60% since 1995, according to the United Nations AIDS program. Many experts see PEPFAR, which was introduced by Republican President George W. Bush, as a key part of that turnaround, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the most severely affected region.",
      "\u201cPEPFAR is the most efficient deployment of health resources I have seen,\u201d said professor Francois Venter of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, who has worked in the HIV sector in South Africa, the country with the most people living with HIV, for more than 20 years. \u201cI challenge anyone to tell me how we could have used the money better.\u201d",
      "PEPFAR\u2019s focus is Africa and the vast majority of lives have been saved there, largely through a program that helps get medication that keeps HIV in check to millions of people. Now their ability to keep taking that medication is in peril.",
      "The nongovernmental organization that helps Makumene has been closed for weeks, as has almost every PEPFAR-funded NGO across Africa while their fates are decided in Washington.",
      "\u201cWe are like orphans; we have no one to turn to,\u201d said Makumene, who has a small stockpile of medication. \u201cI fear we might be going back to the old days when being HIV (positive) was equated with death.\u201d",
      "She is one of some 20 million people worldwide who receive antiretroviral medications, or ARVs, with PEPFAR help. The drugs keep HIV from spreading in the body. Stopping them lets the virus start multiplying again and could lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains.",
      "\u201cHIV is a simple disease,\u201d Venter said. \u201cYou stop your ARVs, you get AIDS.\u201d",
      "Without the drugs, HIV can rise again to detectable levels in a person's blood, increasing the chance of its spread.",
      "United Nations AIDS program Executive Director Winnie Byanyima told The Associated Press in an interview that the funding freeze could bring a surge in AIDS and has caused \u201cpanic, fear and confusion\u201d in many African countries.",
      "PEPFAR funds thousands of NGOs but also directly supports countries\u2019 public health systems \u2014 in many cases, by paying the salaries for tens of thousands of health workers who are part of the national HIV programs.",
      "In South Africa, PEPFAR pays for 15,000 HIV-specialist health workers in government hospitals and clinics. They represent just 5% of the total number of health workers in South Africa\u2019s HIV response program but are crucial components: doctors and nurses providing ARVs, social workers and counselors, along with community-based workers reaching people far from hospitals and clinics. Removing them breaks the system.",
      "\u201cCritical health care infrastructure is being dismantled, clinics forced to close, frontline workers without support, all while lives hang in the balance,\u201d said Sibongile Tshabalala, chairperson of the Treatment Action Campaign, one of a coalition of HIV advocacy groups that have come together since the funding freeze.",
      "The coalition said basic HIV services, including testing and treatment, were \u201ccrumbling\u201d in one of the country\u2019s main hospitals in Johannesburg.",
      "The South African government said it is looking at plans to avert a crisis by finding money to keep the health workers in place. Other African countries face even bigger problems.",
      "In Kenya, more than 40,000 workers face being laid off after the aid freeze, officials said. In Lesotho, a small, poor nation in southern Africa, 1,500 health workers \u2014 about 7% of the country's entire health staff \u2014 have already been dismissed. Lesotho's Health Ministry has asked final-year medical students and recent graduates to volunteer at local health centers to stand in for them.",
      "On Jan. 28, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced waivers to keep lifesaving treatment and other parts of PEPFAR going. Rubio has said he is a \u201csupporter of PEPFAR\u201d \u2014 though he has some questions about it \u2014 and the Trump administration wants to see it continue.",
      "Last week, a federal judge ordered the administration to temporarily lift the foreign funding freeze and rejected the argument that the administration was offering waivers to allow some funding to keep flowing. The judge cited testimony that no such waiver system yet existed.",
      "Officials with the U.S. Agency for International Development, which provides much of PEPFAR's funding, and aid groups say they know of no payments getting through for that or any program.",
      "Experts and health activists have also criticized the content of the waivers published by the Trump administration, which restrict access to treatment for some.",
      "As well as ARVs, PEPFAR funds pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a newer preventive medication. But the waivers only allow PEPFAR-funded NGOs to give PrEP to pregnant or breastfeeding women and not to gay men or sex workers, high risk groups for contracting and spreading HIV. Contraception services through PEPFAR have also been halted.",
      "\u201cThe fight against HIV is not over yet,\u201d said Dr. Kebby Musokotwane, director general of the National AIDS Council in Zambia. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of progress that has been made, but there\u2019s still a lot that needs to be done.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:48:30 -0500",
    "summary": "There was a time not long ago that the exercise mantra in gyms was &ldquo;no pain, no gain.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "There was a time not long ago that the exercise mantra in gyms was \u201cno pain, no gain.\u201d",
      "If you ever turned on the TV in the 2000s after midnight, you might have seen an informercial for P90X.",
      "The exercise program promised shredded abs and bulging biceps for anyone who pushed themselves to their limits for 90 days of 90-minute workouts. So it may come as a surprise that its creator, Tony Horton, now preaches the benefits of rest and warns against overtraining.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know then what I know now,\u201d said Horton, who had spent the \u201990s training celebrities. \u201cBack then it was all about warm-ups and cool-downs, and telling them to eat better and get off the hooch.\u201d",
      "His evolution reflects a broader shift in the exercise industry away from a \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d mentality that once dominated but often led to injury. Instead, the current buzzword in fitness is \u201crecovery.\u201d",
      "Horton \u2014 who at 66 still exudes a boyish exuberance \u2014 noted that P90X did include recovery days with stretching and low-impact movement such as yoga. But these days, he prioritizes mindfulness as much as exercise, and the time between workouts is filled with plenty of good sleep, plunges in frigid water baths, using foam rollers on tight muscles, relaxing in a sauna, and other activities in the name of recovery.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get the recovery and the rest part right, then you\u2019re never going to be able to be consistent with the fitness end of things,\u201d Horton said.",
      "Before Horton, Jane Fonda had pushed home exercisers to \u201cfeel the burn,\u201d while bodybuilders lifted weights to the point of muscle failure. Now, the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Academy of Sports Medicine, two of the largest organizations certifying personal trainers, emphasize recovery methods.",
      "NASM\u2019s \u201cFitness and Wellness\u201d certification includes training in \u201cholistic health and wellness including physical, mental, social and emotional well-being.\u201d",
      "The industry has learned from research that shows the benefit of proper rest, said Stan Kravchenko, founder of the OneFit personal training platform. During deep sleep, the body repairs muscle tissue, and studies show that well-rested people perform better and are less likely to get injured.",
      "But rest is only part of recovery. Kravchenko said personal trainers used to focus only on specific exercises a client could do during their workout. Now, they\u2019re more like life coaches who also give exercise advice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more about your lifestyle, how you eat, how you sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you stressed? What do you do for living? Are you working from a desk? So it\u2019s taking a little bit more like a broad approach.\u201d",
      "The \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d motto is great for athletes who can handle intense workouts and are looking to get stronger, but not everyone needs to push themselves that hard, Horton said. It depends on the goal.",
      "Michael Zourdos, chair of exercise science and health promotion at Florida Atlantic University, said lifting weights \u201cuntil failure\u201d may build bigger muscles, but isn\u2019t needed to increase strength. \u201cThere is a difference between training for health and training for elite performance benefits,\u201d he said.",
      "To realize the health benefits of a workout, it\u2019s still necessary to push yourself, Horton said: \u201cIn the muscles, the lungs, your heart, there\u2019s gotta be a certain amount of strain.\u201d",
      "There is a big difference, however, between discomfort and acute pain. If discomfort crosses into sharp pain in joints, tendons or muscles, stop that movement.",
      "People\u2019s needs vary depending on their goals and bodies. But Kravchencko offered a few general guidelines:",
      "For lifting weights, he recommends allowing 48 hours of recovery time per muscle group, and doing a maximum of 10 sets per muscle group per week. During the workout, he said, it\u2019s best to rest for two to three minutes between sets, as opposed to old advice to wait only a minute before exercising the same muscles.",
      "In between workouts, it\u2019s not necessary to stay still.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to do walking, jogging, very light yoga, stretching, pilates, core exercises,\u201d Kravchencko said. \u201cThat\u2019s all fine, because it\u2019s not specifically targeting the areas you\u2019ve targeted before.\u201d",
      "Horton and Kravchencko both mentioned a recovery practice not typically associated with weightlifting \u2014 meditation. Taking a few quiet minutes every morning helps you deal with the physical and emotional stress of life that can get in the way of wanting to exercise, they said.",
      "Horton recommends establishing a mindfulness routine even before formalizing an exercise plan because it will lay the groundwork to be consistent.",
      "\u201cWhat is your strategy to get to get healthy and to get fit and to stay that way?\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of it has to do with letting the pendulum swing the other way.\u201d",

      "Vatican officials said that Pope Francis had developed pneumonia in both lungs, further complicating the pontiff\u2019s recovery",
      "LONDON -- Vatican officials said late Tuesday that Pope Francis had developed pneumonia in both lungs, further complicating the pontiff\u2019s recovery. The 88-year-old pope was hospitalized Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, doctors said he had developed a mix of infections in his respiratory tract.",
      "On Wednesday, the Vatican said Pope Francis \u201chad a tranquil night, woke up and had breakfast,\u201d saying he was in good spirits. Here\u2019s a look at what a pneumonia diagnosis can mean and potential treatments doctors might be trying:",
      "Pope Francis was admitted to Rome\u2019s Gemilli hospital in \u201cfair\u201d condition on Friday after his bronchitis worsened. On Monday, doctors said he had developed a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, or a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms were growing in his respiratory tract.",
      "Late Tuesday, the Vatican said a chest scan showed he had developed pneumonia in both lungs, requiring additional medication.",
      "Bronchitis occurs when the airways in the lung, known as the bronchial tubes, become inflamed, leading to coughing and mucus production. That infection can sometimes spread to the lungs, resulting in pneumonia, an inflammation of the lungs that's typically caused by an infection.",
      "Doctors say pneumonia in anyone can be serious, but for someone of the pope\u2019s age, it\u2019s particularly worrying.",
      "\u201cOne of the risk factors for more serious infection, like older age, meaning anyone over 65,\u201d said Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Even though the pope lost part of his right lung decades ago, McCormack said that shouldn\u2019t necessarily compromise his recovery, adding that she would be more concerned about any possible signs of weakness in His Holiness.",
      "\u201cBeing a more frail older person can increase your risk of having complications,\u201d she said, noting that having to use a wheelchair could be considered a sign of frailty. The pope has relied on a wheelchair for more than two years.",
      "It appears, however, that the pope is not bed-bound. He has been able to get out of bed and his heart function is good, according to a Vatican official.",
      "Beyond antibiotic drug therapy, there are multiple treatments available, including supplemental oxygen and therapies to support the lungs and body while it\u2019s trying to recover.",
      "Dr. Andrew Chadwick, a respiratory and intensive care specialist at Oxford University Hospital in Britain, said steroids and antibiotics would be the core elements of the pope\u2019s care, alongside nursing care and chest physiotherapy.",
      "Physiotherapy can help patients clear the fluids building up in their lungs, particularly if they aren\u2019t very mobile themselves.",
      "McCormack of Johns Hopkins said that severe cases of pneumonia were typically treated for about one to two weeks but that recovery in an older person could extend beyond that.",
      "Mainly, they\u2019ll be hoping that the pope\u2019s condition doesn\u2019t deteriorate further.",
      "\u201cWhile we give antibiotics and other therapies, we\u2019re waiting for the body to respond,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cIf he just stays as he is while he\u2019s fighting off the infection and has a gradual recovery, that lack of worsening would be an encouraging sign.\u201d",
      "Dr. Maor Sauler, who specializes in adult pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, said that antibiotics typically need the lungs to be working to recover from infections, including pneumonia, but the ability of lungs to recover diminishes with age.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone has pneumonia, there\u2019s a good chance we can treat it,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it is also one of the leading causes of death. And so there are also situations where, despite our best efforts, we cannot clear the infection.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "At least 29 recruits have died during basic training at law enforcement academies nationwide in the last decade",
      "Ronald Donat\u2019s longtime dream of becoming a police officer was in jeopardy.",
      "The 41-year-old struggled to stand after completing a flurry of pushups, sprints and pullups in the notoriously grueling start of physical training that recruits call \u201cHell Day.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou are dead!\u201d classmates recall a sergeant berating Donat, ordering him to sit on concrete at the suburban Atlanta police academy.",
      "Donat, a Haitian immigrant on his third attempt to land a law enforcement job, assured instructors he wasn\u2019t giving up. He managed to get off the ground and rejoin recruits in a bear crawl exercise. But he soon went limp.",
      "One hundred minutes after training began that October 2021 morning, he was dead, according to records obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Donat is among at least 29 recruits who died during basic training at law enforcement academies around the country in the last decade, an AP investigation found. Most died of exertion, dehydration, heat stroke and other conditions tied to intense exercise \u2014 often on the first day of training, like Donat. Others died several weeks in, sometimes after suffering trauma during boxing or use-of-force drills or collapsing during high-stakes timed runs on hot days.",
      "Experts and police advocates were surprised by AP\u2019s findings \u2014 based on an extensive review of lists of law enforcement deaths in every state, workplace safety records and news reports \u2014 and said many of the deaths were preventable. No federal agency or outside organization comprehensively tracks recruit deaths, unlike officers who die in the line of duty.",
      "\u201cTraining shouldn't have one death, much less 29,\" said David Jude, a retired Kentucky State Police academy commander and instructor. \u201cTo hear that number, it is shocking.\"",
      "Black recruits represented nearly 60% of those who died, a striking disparity given that federal data show Black officers make up 12% of local police forces. Many carried sickle cell trait, a condition most prevalent among Black Americans that increases the risk of serious injury following extreme exertion.",
      "Overall, the deaths amount to a tiny percentage of the nation\u2019s 800,000 sworn officers but highlight another hazard in a profession where shootings, car accidents and other dangers are part of the job.",
      "AP\u2019s tally shows the deaths have grown at a time when departments are tapping an older and more diverse pool of applicants to address officer shortages. More than two-thirds of the deaths occurred since 2020.",
      "A Texas recruit collapsed minutes after instructors denied his request for water, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t get water in a fight,\u201d video obtained by AP shows.",
      "An Arkansas cadet died after he was forced to run wearing long pants in the scorching midday sun. A North Carolina trainee\u2019s temperature was 106 degrees an hour after his death, when he had no water breaks during an hourlong obstacle course.",
      "Citing similar cases, one expert warned in a medical journal in mid-2023 of a \u201ctroubling spate of exertional collapse and death\u201d of police trainees.",
      "\u201cThis sad tragedy is preventable, but will not become so until our police chiefs begin to heed the message,\u201d wrote Dr. Randy Eichner, a retired University of Oklahoma professor who has long studied exertion-related deaths.",
      "But deaths have only continued to mount. At least five were recorded in 2024, including a New York City recruit who died of heat stroke, a Kentucky man who exerted himself during water-based survival training and a Massachusetts cadet who became unresponsive during defensive tactics training.",
      "Police leaders say some deaths can be prevented through improved awareness and practices, acknowledging that the field needs to better screen for and accommodate health conditions that put recruits at risk and to rein in unnecessarily harsh drills.",
      "\u201cNot only are we potentially putting students in danger, but we\u2019re also putting instructors in precarious situations where they may not know about the risks,\u201d said Jude, an expert witness in the 2022 death of 38-year-old Jonesboro, Arkansas, recruit Vincent Parks.",
      "Jude cited a law passed in Arkansas, amid outrage over video showing Parks collapsing while training on a hot afternoon, as a positive step. It requires trainers be educated on heat exhaustion, dehydration and symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest, and mandates that instructors remove cadets from physical activities if they faint or lose consciousness.",
      "AP's investigation found instances in which recruits who were in serious medical distress were pushed to continue training before they died. In addition to calling off drills in such cases, academy leaders must ensure adequate hydration and breaks and limit training when heat makes it unsafe, experts said.",
      "Bill Alexander, CEO of the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, said the number of deaths could be reduced but probably not eliminated given the nature of policing, which can require chasing and arresting combative suspects.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re training people physically and if you\u2019re training them hard, you\u2019re going to have these very rare medical events,\u201d said Alexander, who previously led an academy in Maryland.",
      "Still, some leaders say the field needs urgent action to better protect recruits.",
      "\u201cIt was just heartbreaking. I\u2019ll never forget it. And I\u2019ll do anything at all to get this message out,\u201d said Sheriff Charmaine McGuffey of Hamilton County, Ohio, who witnessed the 2023 death of 36-year-old Marcus Zeigler after he collapsed during a training run. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about life or death.\u201d",
      "When Ronald Donat arrived at the Gwinnett County Police Department Academy in Lawrenceville, Georgia, he thought he\u2019d finally found his place in law enforcement.",
      "He always wanted to become an officer, but his wife, Sharline Volcy, said she initially discouraged him due to safety concerns when their children were young. Both immigrated from Haiti in the 1990s to New Jersey, where they met at church.",
      "Donat earned a college degree and worked various jobs, including installing satellites and cable, but longed for the responsibility and community service that policing would bring.",
      "He finally applied but was initially passed over. When Gwinnett County recruited applicants from New Jersey, Donat applied because he already had a sister living in Georgia, Volcy said.",
      "Georgia's second-largest police agency, Gwinnett County has held hiring events around the country as it struggles to fill hundreds of vacancies. It\u2019s offered bonuses to combat the officer shortage, which grew during the coronavirus pandemic and 2020 protests against police brutality.",
      "A physician who evaluated Donat for the department concluded he was healthy, with no concerning conditions, according to a form the doctor submitted to the state's police standards agency. Following the normal process for the county and most U.S. police departments, the doctor didn\u2019t screen Donat for sickle cell trait.",
      "Donat began working out with other recruits, passed a state-mandated physical fitness test and was given badge 2423. He smiled for a selfie in a squad car. He shared advice with a classmate: \u201cNever give up.\u201d",
      "Up to 3 million Black citizens in the U.S. have sickle cell trait, yet many adults with the genetic condition don't know their status, researchers say. Unlike people with sickle cell disease, they carry only one gene for sickle cell, and one normal gene.",
      "The condition, which is diagnosed through a blood test, doesn\u2019t usually affect their daily lives. But it can cause decreased blood flow and muscle breakdown after intense exertion, dehydration or high body temperatures. In very rare cases, that can result in collapse and death.",
      "The NCAA and U.S. military now screen recruits for the condition, which has contributed to some deaths during football practices and boot camps. Researchers say exertional deaths among college athletes plummeted after NCAA-mandated testing and precautions went into effect in 2010, while the impact of the military programs is under review. Slowly building intensity, resting between drills, remaining hydrated during workouts and responding quickly to signs of distress are recommended.",
      "Most police departments have no such screening programs. Many longtime law enforcement trainers say they\u2019ve never heard of the condition, which AP found was cited as a contributing factor in several deaths and serious injuries of recruits.",
      "McGuffey, the Ohio sheriff, said the cause of Marcus Zeigler\u2019s death was initially a mystery. Before his collapse in May 2023, Zeigler was in peak condition and a top recruit, she said.",
      "The sheriff said she learned about sickle cell trait afterward from another employee, who himself had been seriously injured during academy training. She asked the coroner to investigate whether Zeigler had the condition. After ruling that Zeigler died of exertional heatstroke, the coroner's office added sickle cell trait as a contributing factor.",
      "Since the death, Hamilton County has started screening recruits for the condition, which costs $75 per test.",
      "For Donat and his 27 classmates, academy staffers planned an intense hourlong workout -- a first-day ritual designed to test physical and mental fitness.",
      "Pushups. Flutter kicks. More pushups. Hill sprints. Burpees. Pullups. Bear crawls.",
      "Trainers say the exercises set the tone for the monthslong academy, which seeks to instill a never-quit mindset and prepare recruits for the most dangerous aspects of policing. But the military-style drills have long led to allegations of harsh treatment that cross the line into hazing.",
      "The risks were so well-known that an ambulance usually sat nearby on the first day at the Gwinnett County academy. But that year, a major declined the staff\u2019s request, saying an ambulance would create the perception of danger, according to statements in an internal investigation report.",
      "Donat kept up with classmates for 45 minutes but became exhausted during a set of pullups and couldn\u2019t complete the next exercise, air squats.",
      "An instructor ordered Donat to sit: \u201cYou are dead!\u201d six recruits recalled him screaming, according to the investigation.",
      "The instructor insisted that he told Donat \u201cYou are done!\u201d Either way, it was intended as a reminder, the investigation found, that giving up on police work could lead to death.",
      "Donat didn\u2019t want to quit. Three minutes later, he got up with the help of another recruit and got in formation for a 25-foot bear crawl. \u201cEverything is all right, Donat,\u201d a recruit assured him. But Donat collapsed and stopped breathing.",
      "A paramedic on scene quickly treated Donat with oxygen and chest compressions. An ambulance arrived 10 minutes later.",
      "After Donat was pronounced dead at a hospital, instructors wondered whether his life could have been saved with an ambulance on site.",
      "Hours after Donat died, Gwinnett County released a statement saying Donat had been \u201cinstructed by supervising staff to rest\u201d after becoming lethargic.",
      "A fellow recruit who saw that statement on the news questioned the claim, texting classmates, \u201cas far as I know I never heard that or saw that.\u201d One responded that Donat was last seen in the planking position before his collapse.",
      "A county medical examiner ruled Donat died of natural causes, saying he had an enlarged heart prone to abnormal rhythms. That shocked his wife, Volcy, who said her husband was a fit soccer player with no known heart issues.",
      "The autopsy report didn\u2019t mention sickle cell trait. Volcy believes her husband had it \u2013 she\u2019s learned their daughters do, she said, and she has tested negative. Today, Gwinnett County still doesn\u2019t screen recruits for the condition, spokesperson Sgt. Collin Flynn said.",
      "The department\u2019s investigation, completed weeks after Donat\u2019s death, found no policy violations and resulted in no disciplinary action. A major who led the investigation concluded, \u201cI cannot imagine a scenario, had different actions been taken, that would have changed the tragic death of Recruit Donat.\u201d",
      "Still, the department now requires an ambulance with emergency responders on scene during the first day of physical training, Flynn said. Changes to the workout allow instructors to keep a closer eye on those who are struggling, he said.",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration didn\u2019t investigate because local government agencies aren\u2019t under its jurisdiction. That\u2019s the case in many states, which have not extended workplace safety protections to municipal employees such as police officers.",
      "Because most of the recruits in AP\u2019s investigation hadn\u2019t been sworn in as officers before they died, their names don't appear on the national memorial for deceased officers or some state memorials. And many of their families can\u2019t qualify for death benefits.",
      "Aware of those stakes last year, the police chief in Knoxville, Tennessee, summoned a judge to the hospital room of unconscious recruit Wisbens Antoine.",
      "On that February night, a fellow recruit took the oath on behalf of Antoine, who\u2019d collapsed during training a week before graduation.",
      "Hours later, Officer Antoine, 32, died.",
      "Like Donat, he was a Haitian immigrant who left behind a wife and two daughters.",
      "In Gwinnett County, officials honored Donat by adding his name to its Fallen Heroes Memorial in 2022. But his name isn't on federal or state memorials. Donat\u2019s family was ineligible for state death benefits because he hadn\u2019t graduated.",
      "Congress in 2021 passed a law allowing trainees\u2019 relatives to be eligible for the same federal death benefits as those of sworn officers. The program includes a payment of nearly $450,000, plus college assistance.",
      "But three years later, Volcy said, she\u2019s still awaiting a ruling from the Department of Justice on her application for benefits, which she said she desperately needs to afford college tuition and other expenses.",
      "Volcy was unaware of the investigation into her husband\u2019s death until AP gave her the report last year. She said the department put recruits like Donat \u2013 and their families \u2013 at risk.",
      "\u201cIt is disappointing to know that excessive strain and physical activities brought an end to his life,\u201d Volcy said. \u201cWhat was supposed to be a new beginning, a lifetime achievement, a dream come true turned children into orphans, a wife into a widow and a lifetime of grief.\u201d"

      "MANILA, Philippines -- A village in the densely populated Philippine capital region launched a battle against dengue Wednesday by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos \u2014 dead or alive.",
      "The unusual strategy adopted by the Addition Hills village in Mandaluyong City reflects growing concern after the nearby city of Quezon declared an outbreak of the mosquito-borne illness over the weekend. Eight more areas reported an upsurge in cases of the potentially deadly viral infection.",
      "At least 28,234 dengue cases have been recorded in the Philippines this year up to Feb. 1, a 40% increase compared to the same period last year, according to health department statistics. Quezon City declared a dengue outbreak Saturday after deaths this year reached 10 people, mostly children, out of 1,769 residents infected.",
      "A urban village of more than 100,000 residents living in crowded neighborhoods and residential condominium towers, Addition Hills has done clean-ups, canal de-clogging and a hygiene campaign to combat dengue. But when cases spiked to 42 this year and two young students died, village leader Carlito Cernal decided to intensify the battle.",
      "\u201cThere was an alarm,\u201d Cernal told The Associated Press. \u201cI found a way.\"",
      "Residents will get a reward of one Philippines peso (just over 1 cent) for every five mosquitos or mosquito larva they turn in, Cernal said.",
      "Critics warned the strategy could backfire if desperate people start breeding mosquitoes for the reward. Cernal said that was unlikely because the campaign would be terminated as soon as the uptick in cases eases.",
      "As the campaign began, about a dozen mosquito hunters showed up at the village office. Miguel Labag, a 64-year-old scavenger, handed a jug with 45 dark mosquito larvas squirming in some water and received a reward of nine pesos (15 cents).",
      "\u201cThis is a big help,\u201d Labag said, smiling. \u201cI can buy coffee.\u201d",
      "Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical countries worldwide. It can cause joint pain, nausea, vomiting and rashes, and in severe cases can cause breathing problems, hemorrhaging and organ failure. While there is no specific treatment for the illness, medical care to maintain a person\u2019s fluid levels is seen as critical.",
      "Officials in another village in Quezon City were considering releasing swarms of frogs to eat mosquitoes.",
      "Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said it\u2019s crucial to clean up mosquito breeding sites, and for anyone who might be infected to seek immediate medical attention. Despite an increase in dengue infections, the Philippines has managed to maintain low mortality rates, he said.",
      "Dengue cases surged unexpectedly ahead of the rainy season, which starts in June, likely because of intermittent downpours that have left stagnant pools of water where dengue-causing mosquitos can breed, Health Undersecretary Alberto Domingo said, adding that climate change was likely contributing to off-season downpours."

      "Republicans are weighing billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, jeopardizing health care coverage for some of the 80 million U.S. adults and children enrolled in the safety net program",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans are weighing billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, threatening health care coverage for some of the 80 million U.S. adults and children enrolled in the safety net program.",
      "The signing up of millions of additional Americans for taxpayer-funded health care coverage like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's marketplace during the Biden administration was lauded by Democrats as a success. But Republicans, who are looking to slash federal spending and offer lucrative tax cuts to corporations and wealthier Americans, now see a big target ripe for trimming. The $880 billion Medicaid program is financed mostly by federal taxpayers, who pick up as much as 80% of the tab in some states. And states, too, have said they're having trouble financing years of growth and sicker patients who enrolled in Medicaid.",
      "To whittle down the budget, the GOP-controlled Congress is eyeing work requirements for Medicaid. It's also considering paying a shrunken, fixed rate to states. All told, over the next decade, Republican lawmakers could try to siphon billions of dollars from the nearly-free health care coverage offered to the poorest Americans.",
      "Weeks before Congress began debating those changes, Republican governors in Arkansas, Ohio and South Dakota were making moves to implement Medicaid work rules of their own, likely to be approved by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "And other cuts could be on the way. Already on Friday, the Republican administration announced it would shrink the Affordable Care Act's navigator program annual budget by 90% to $10 million. Navigators are stationed throughout the country to help people enrolled in ACA and Medicaid coverage and have helped boost enrollment in health care programs.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has floated the idea of tying work to Medicaid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s common sense,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cLittle things like that make a big difference not only in the budgeting process but in the morale of the people. You know, work is good for you. You find dignity in work.\u201d",
      "But about 92% of Medicaid enrollees are already working, attending school or caregiving, according to an analysis by KFF, a health policy research firm.",
      "Republicans have suggested a work requirement similar to the conditions for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps. Those ages 16 to 59 must work or volunteer at least 80 hours a month if they are not in school, caring for a child under age 6, disabled, pregnant or homeless. On average, a SNAP enrollee's monthly household income is $852, and the enrollee typically receives $239 in benefits.",
      "During a GOP House retreat last month at Trump's golf resort in Doral, Florida, Republicans said the requirement could motivate people to find employment \u2014 maybe even a job that comes with health insurance.",
      "Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said the spending cuts should not be \u201con the back of the poor and needy\" but instead target those who shouldn't be getting the benefit.",
      "\u201cWhy should somebody literally sit on the beach and surf, buy their sandwiches from the food truck with their food stamps and then pick up low-cost housing and so on, while writing a book,\" Issa said, noting that he was describing a constituent from more than a decade ago.",
      "Other cuts on the table include a proposal to change the federal government's reimbursement to a per-person limit.",
      "That would shift the costs to states, which might be forced to make tough choices about who or what they cover, said Joan Alker, executive director of the Georgetown Center for Children and Families.",
      "\u201cPeople still have health care needs even if you cut their coverage,\u201d Alker said. \u201cTheir health care needs are not going to go away.\u201d",
      "Cuts to the program could also prompt upset, with just over half of U.S. adults saying the government spends \u201ctoo little\u201d on Medicaid. Only 15% say it\u2019s spending \u201ctoo much,\u201d according to a January Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration largely blocked states from enacting work rules of their own and required 10 states to remove the requirement for Medicaid coverage.",
      "With Trump now back in charge, some Republican-led states are pressing ahead of Congress to add work rules again. Governors in Arkansas, Iowa and Ohio have announced they'd pursue approval from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to introduce work requirements again. And last fall, South Dakota voters signed off on a plan to add a work rule.",
      "When Arkansas enacted a work requirement during the Trump years, about 18,000 people lost coverage. The rule was later blocked by a federal judge and Biden's Democratic administration.",
      "Some people lost coverage because they had trouble accessing the state's website to log their hours or had other procedural problems, said Trevor Hawkins, an attorney with Legal Aid of Arkansas. The organization sued on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries who were dropped from coverage.",
      "\u201cThese hoops, these things are very consequential,\u201d Hawkins said \u201cThere were a lot of people having hard times.\u201d",
      "In Georgia, 47-year-old Paul Mikell is all too familiar with those hoops.",
      "He's enrolled in Georgia's Pathways to Coverage plan, which offers Medicaid for a slice of impoverished people who make just too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid. Georgia, which has not expanded Medicaid like most other states, requires that people work, volunteer or go to school for 80 hours a month in exchange for accessing the expanded health coverage.",
      "Mikell makes 15-mile (24-kilometer) monthly drives to a government office where he reports his work hours. Sometimes, he said, when he goes online to check whether his hours were logged, they\u2019re not there.",
      "He likened navigating the online system to a battle \u2014 one fought on a computer at the library or borrowed from a friend.",
      "In Idaho, where lawmakers are considering a state work rule and a three-year limit for Medicaid benefits, family physician Peter Crane estimates about two-thirds of his patients are enrolled in the program.",
      "Many work on farms, on ranches or in the local phosphate mines. Before the state expanded Medicaid to cover those with incomes of up to 138% of the poverty level, many of his uninsured patients avoided the doctor entirely. One ignored abdominal pain for months, to the point of needing hospitalization for a severe gallbladder infection, he said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not outliers,\" Crane said of those enrolled in Medicaid during a state hearing last week. \u201cThey\u2019re hardworking citizens of our state who are employed and running small businesses.\u201d",
      "Democrats are warning of the side effects for health care facilities, including rural hospitals and nursing homes. Hospitals have benefited from increased enrollment in health insurance programs such as Medicaid because it guarantees payment for a patient's treatment.",
      "\u201cHospitals will close, including in rural America and urban America and the heartland of America,\u201d House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York warned during a recent speech on the House floor. \u201cNursing homes will be shut down, and everyday Americans, children, seniors, those who are suffering with disabilities, will be hurt.\u201d",

      "A push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program may soon get a boost from new Trump Administration officials",
      "A push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the U.S. program that helps low-income families pay for nutritious food has been tried before \u2014 but it may soon get a boost from new Trump administration officials.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the newly confirmed health and human services secretary, and Brooke Rollins, the new agriculture secretary, have both signaled that they favor stripping such treats from SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.",
      "Kennedy has been most vocal, calling for the government to stop allowing the nearly $113 billion program that serves about 42 million Americans to use benefits to pay for \u201c soda or processed foods.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe one place that I would say that we need to really change policy is the SNAP program and food stamps and in school lunches,\u201d Kennedy told Fox News host Laura Ingraham last week. \u201cThere, the federal government in many cases is paying for it. And we shouldn't be subsidizing people to eat poison.\u201d",
      "In one of her first interviews after being confirmed, Rollins said she looked forward to working with Kennedy on the issue.",
      "\u201cWhen a taxpayer is putting money into SNAP, are they OK with us using their tax dollars to feed really bad food and sugary drinks to children who perhaps need something more nutritious?\u201d Rollins said. \u201cThese are all massive questions we're going to be asking and working on in the coming months and years.\u201d",
      "But removing certain foods from SNAP \u2014 known for years as food stamps \u2014 isn't as simple as it sounds.",
      "The program is run by the USDA, not HHS, and is administered through individual states. It is authorized by the federal Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which says SNAP benefits can be used for \u201cany food or food product intended for human consumption,\u201d except alcohol, tobacco and hot foods, including those prepared for immediate consumption.",
      "Excluding any foods would require Congress to change the law \u2014 or for states to get waivers that would let them restrict purchases, said Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research group. Over the past 20 years, lawmakers in several states have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for bottled water, soda, chips, ice cream, decorated cakes and \u201cluxury meats\u201d like steak.",
      "\u201cNone of those requests have ever been approved under either Republican or Democratic presidents,\u201d Bergh said.",
      "In the past, Agriculture Department officials rejected the waivers, saying in a 2007 paper that no clear standards exist to define foods \u201cas good or bad, or healthy or not healthy.\u201d In addition, the agency said restrictions would be difficult to implement, complicated and costly. And they might not change recipients' food purchases or reduce conditions such as obesity.",
      "Anti-hunger advocates point to research that shows SNAP recipients are no more likely than other low-income Americans to buy sugary drinks or snack foods. And they say that limiting food choices undermines the autonomy and dignity of people who receive, on average, about $187 per month \u2014 or about $6.16 per day, according to latest figures.",
      "\u201cThis is just another way to cut benefits,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino, a deputy director at the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cIt's like, how do we restrict people more? How do we stigmatize them more?\u201d",
      "Bills are pending in Congress and in several states to restrict SNAP benefits from paying for soda, candy and other items.",
      "Rep. Josh Breechan, an Oklahoma Republican, sponsored the Healthy SNAP Act.",
      "\u201cIf someone wants to buy junk food on their own dime, that\u2019s up to them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what we\u2019re saying is, \u2018Don\u2019t ask the taxpayer to pay for it and then also expect the taxpayer to pick up the tab for the resulting health consequences.\u2019\u201d",
      "One SNAP recipient said she uses her monthly $291 benefit to buy necessities such as meat, oil, milk and coffee. Martina Santos, 66, of New York City, supplements those foods with fresh vegetables and fruits from a pantry run by the West Side Campaign Against Hunger, where she's also a volunteer. Because she has diabetes and other health conditions, she said she understands the importance of using the benefits only for nutritious options.",
      "\u201cFor me, SNAP is to be used toward healthy food to get people to avoid all the disease they\u2019re having around right now: obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure,\u201d Santos said.",
      "In Kansas and elsewhere, bills that would ban soft drinks and candy highlight some of the challenges of such changes.",
      "Several pending bills seek to keep SNAP from paying for soft drinks, but they would continue to allow drinks containing milk, milk alternatives like soy or almond milk, or drinks with more than 50% vegetable or fruit juice. Candy is characterized as any unrefrigerated, flourless preparation of \u201csugar, honey or other natural or artificial sweeteners in combination with chocolate, fruits, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings in the form of bars, drops or pieces.\u201d",
      "By that definition, Kit Kat and Twix bars, which contain flour, wouldn't be banned. And juices that contain high amounts of sugar, but are more than half fruit juice by volume, would be allowed.",
      "Such conundrums have stymied changes to the SNAP program for decades. But this moment could be different, said Dr. Anand Parekh, chief medical officer of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank based in Washington, D.C.",
      "The momentum behind Kennedy's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement could spur a new focus on solutions to poor diets that account for leading risk factors for early disease and death.",
      "\u201cWhen we talk about the SNAP program, we have to remind people that the \u2018N\u2019 stands for nutrition,\u201d Parekh said. \u201cIt's about time that both parties can come together and see what are the innovations here to improve diet quality and nutrition.\u201d",

      "\"This is a huge, huge issue,\" said Matthew Smeltzer, a managing partner of Capstone Recruiting Advisors, a company that helps hospitals, physician practices, and other employers find and hire doctors. \"It probably hits small towns the hardest, just because most people would prefer to live in a midsize or large community.\"",
      "",
      "In this challenging environment, Havana leaders are hoping that want ads and rent-free perks will make their small town stand out and persuade a doctor to practice here.",
      "",
      "Wilkerson describes the community, just south of the Georgia border, as an ideal place to raise a family. Its country roads are lined with farms, pastures, and churches. Main Street downtown features antique stores, gift shops, a general store, and restaurants.",
      "",
      "\"Everything you would imagine a Hallmark movie to be is kind of where we live,\" Wilkerson said. \"It's people who still care and look out for each other, and neighbors are actually friends.\"",
      "",
      "Offering generous incentives was how town leaders got Newberry to practice in Havana in 1993. The town gave Newberry an initial deal similar to the one it's offering now, and later began providing him about $15,000 a year in financial support.",
      "",
      "Newberry, who served about 2,000 patients, declined to be interviewed. \"I'm just retiring!\" he said in an email, adding that \"the town has chosen unconventional ways\" of recruiting a doctor.",
      "",
      "By subsidizing office space and the use of medical equipment to attract a doctor, Havana is looking out for the needs of its residents, Wilkerson said.",
      "",
      "Without a town doctor, some of Newberry's former patients now have to travel to Tallahassee, about a 30-minute drive southeast of Havana. Others are seeing doctors in Quincy, about a 20-minute drive west.",
      "",
      "\"Our hope is that they'll come back when we find us a new doctor,\" Havana Mayor Eddie Bass said.",
      "",
      "Susan Freiden, a former town manager who retired in 2006, said having a local doctor is also important to meet the needs of the town's low-income residents, many of whom are older adults. \"Not everybody can get to Tallahassee to get a doctor,\" she said. \"Not everybody has transportation.\"",
      "",
      "But it remains to be seen whether rent-free office space and equipment are enough to attract a doctor to Havana. The town's recruitment campaign has drawn a lot of interest from nurse practitioners, but few primary care physicians have applied for the position.",
      "",
      "Town leaders say they're holding out hope of finding a family physician, who can practice and prescribe medications independently.",

      "\"We would really, you know, prefer to have a true doctor that can handle it all for us,\" Bass said.",
      "",
      "Smeltzer, the physician headhunter, said primary care physicians are in especially low supply.

      "\"If someone wants to practice in a small town, they're more likely to go to where they have ties, whether it's themselves or their spouse or significant other,\" he said.",
      "",
      "The challenge for a community of Havana's size, Smeltzer said, is that \"there may literally be nobody from that town that went to med school. Or, if there is, maybe it's one. But were they a primary care physician?\"",
      "",
      "Still, there is a silver lining. Smeltzer said young physicians are placing a high value on work-life balance and meaningful relationships with their patients  --  qualities that may give an edge to a small-town, independent practice.",

      "\"We hear quality of life and work-life balance far more in the last 3 to 5 years than we ever heard before,\" he said, \"and that's almost in lockstep with compensation in terms of what they're focusing on.\"",

    "story": [
      "In the rural villages of South Africa, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s sudden freeze on foreign aid impacts hundreds of thousands of HIV patients",
      "UMZIMKHULU, South Africa -- At a rural village in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province, unemployed 19-year-old Nozuko Majola is trying to figure out if she has enough money for the one-hour ride to collect her much-needed HIV medication, usually delivered to her home that can't be easily reached due to rough, untarred roads.",
      "Majola is one of millions of patients in South Africa affected by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s global foreign aid freeze, raising worries about HIV patients defaulting on treatment, infection rates going up and eventually a rise in deaths.",
      "In 2024, think tank Human Sciences Research Council released figures showing that Majola's province recorded the second-highest HIV prevalence in the country, at 16%, with at least 1,300 young people estimated to contract the disease every week.",
      "KwaZulu-Natal also had the highest number of people living with HIV in South Africa in 2022, about 1,980,000. The country counts more than 7.5 million people infected with the virus that causes AIDS \u2014 more than any other nation.",
      "There are 5.5 million South Africans receiving antiretroviral treatment, whose funding is now in question after Trump suspended the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. It contributes more than $400 million a year to South Africa's HIV programs and nongovernmental organizations, about 17% of the total funding, according to the Health Ministry.",
      "Globally, PEPFAR is credited with saving at least 26 million lives since its inception in 2003, according to the U.N. AIDS agency.",
      "Last week, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to temporarily lift the funding freeze, while the U.S. Embassy in South Africa said PEPFAR projects would resume under a limited waiver. However, aid groups dealing with HIV have already shuttered with closure notices hanging at the entrances and PEPFAR-branded vehicles standing idle, with patients diverted to struggling health facilities.",
      "Most of the PEPFAR funding is channeled through non-governmental organizations, which run programs that compliment health care services provided by the government.",
      "For Majola and other HIV patients in the Umzimkhulu region, where unemployment is rife and most people rely on subsistence farming and government welfare grants, the aid freeze has disrupted their lives.",
      "\u201cThings will be tough around here, and a lot of people will default on their treatment because we really struggle with transport,\" she said. \u201cThe mobile clinics hardly come here.\u201d",
      "The freeze has hurt various groups that can no longer provide treatment, causing an influx of patients to already overstretched public facilities. Along with the medication, these programs also allowed health personnel to test HIV patients in far-flung villages, which has been a lifeline for many, especially those afraid to visit public facilities due to the social stigma attached to HIV.",
      "In addition, nearly 15,000 health workers whose salaries are funded through PEPFAR are left wondering if they have lost their livelihoods.",
      "About an hour away in the district of Umgungundlovu, which the think tank says has the highest number of HIV cases in South Africa, HIV counselors gathered in a small office discussing how best to assist patients like Majola. A manager at a nearby health clinic wondered how to handle the administrative work that is piling up after PEPFAR-funded workers withdrew.",
      "\u201cPeople who were doing administration and data capturing, whose salaries were funded by PEPFAR, have left. We are a small facility and we cannot handle such a workload,\u201d said the manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.",
      "Nozuko Ngcaweni has been on HIV treatment for about 30 years. One of her children was also infected and died at age 17. She said the aid suspension already impacted her community and many missed their treatment.",
      "\u201cNot long ago, we said by 2030, we want to see an HIV-free generation. But if things remain as is, we will not achieve that. We will have to deal with deaths,\u201d she said.",
      "Mzamo Zondi, a provincial manager of the Treatment Action Campaign, which advocates for access to HIV treatment for the poor, has been monitoring the impact of the aid freeze in Umgungudlovu.",
      "\"Our response (to HIV) is likely to falter as we struggle to stop newly infected cases,\" he said. \u201cThis is a matter of life and death.\u201d",

      "A court in Argentina has dropped charges of criminal negligence against three of the five people indicted in connection with the death of Liam Payne, the former One Direction singer who fell from a third-floor hotel balcony in Buenos Aires last October",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- A court in Argentina dropped charges of criminal negligence against three of the five people indicted in connection with the death of Liam Payne, the former One Direction singer who fell from a third-floor hotel balcony in Buenos Aires last October, according to a ruling obtained by The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "In its decision issued Wednesday, the Argentine federal appeals court ordered the other two defendants in the case to remain in custody. They are facing prosecution on charges they supplied the famed British boyband star with narcotics.",
      "The ruling drops charges against three key defendants: Rogelio Nores, an Argentine businessman with U.S. citizenship who had accompanied Payne during his trip in Buenos Aires; Gilda Martin, the manager of the Casa Sur Palermo Hotel where Payne died on Oct. 16; and Esteban Grassi, the hotel\u2019s main receptionist.",
      "The charge of negligent homicide carries a sentence of one to five years in prison in Argentina.",
      "A toxicology report from tests taken after an autopsy revealed that Payne, 31, had alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his system when he fell from the balcony.",
      "Prosecutors argued that Nores had failed to comply with his duties of care by leaving Payne alone while inebriated. The court sided with defense attorneys who contended that Nores had no legal, moral or social duty to care for Payne. He also was outside the hotel at the time of his friend's death.",
      "The two hotel employees, Martin and Grassi, were in the Casa Sur lobby on Oct. 16 when they saw Payne severely intoxicated and decided to take him to his room with the help of others, investigators determined.",
      "Prosecutors said that the men should have kept Payne away from his hotel room, where a balcony posed a clear danger, until the singer could receive proper medical care. On Wednesday, the court ruled that prosecutors failed to prove how taking Payne to his hotel room \u201cconstituted unlawful, unruly, clumsy, reckless, imprudent or negligent conduct.\"",
      "The court also ordered the other two defendants in the case \u2014 Ezequiel David Pereyra, a former employee at Casa Sur Hotel and Braian Paiz, a waiter who had served Payne at an upscale Buenos Aires restaurant \u2014 to remain in detention on charges that they supplied Payne with narcotics in the days, even hours, leading up to his death.",
      "Because the charge they face carries a sentence of four to 15 years in prison, the court said that preventative detention was justified.",
      "Payne's sudden death drew an outpouring of grief around the world from heartbroken fans of One Direction, among the best-selling boy bands of all time.",

      "Trump also expressed understanding of Putin\u2019s key demand on the pivotal issue of Ukraine\u2019s prospective NATO membership that the U.S. and other alliance members previously described as irreversible. \u201dThey\u2019ve been saying that for a long time that Ukraine cannot go into NATO,\u201d Trump said of Russia. \u201cAnd I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d",
      "Putin invaded on Feb. 24, 2022, after demanding that NATO abandon membership for Ukraine and pull back the alliance\u2019s troops on NATO\u2019s eastern flank -- actions rejected by the West.",
      "He claimed his move was necessary to safeguard Russia\u2019s security interests and protect Russian speakers in Ukraine. Kyiv and its allies denounced his move as an unprovoked act of aggression. Ukrainians saw it as Moscow's attempt to destroy their national sovereignty and identity.",
      "Russian troops reached the outskirts of Kyiv early in the invasion but pulled back a month later amid heavy losses and Ukraine's attacks on supply lines. More humiliating setbacks came in September and October 2022, when a Ukrainian counteroffensive forced Russia to pull back from large parts of the Kharkiv region in the northeast and the Kherson region in the south.",
      "Fortunes changed in 2023 when a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south failed to cut Russia's land route to the Crimea Peninsula, which Moscow illegally annexed from Kyiv in 2014.",
      "Russia seized the combat initiative last year with offensives along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front, making slow but persistent gains. In the fall, Russian forces captured the most territory since the opening of the war.",
      "Moscow also pummeled Ukrainian infrastructure with waves of missiles and drones, destroying much of its power generating capacity.",
      "Ukraine struck back in August with an incursion into Russia's Kursk region to try to distract Moscow's forces in the east and gain more leverage in potential peace talks. Ukraine still holds some of those gains, but its limited resources are stretched, making it difficult to defend strongholds in the east.",
      "While Zelenskyy earlier demanded Russia\u2019s full withdrawal from all occupied areas as a precondition for talks, he later acknowledged Kyiv can\u2019t immediately reclaim all its territory. He said Ukraine won't abandon its goal of joining NATO \u2014 even though Trump dismissed that as \u201cimpractical\u201d \u2014 and Zelenskyy emphasized needing reliable Western security guarantees and a robust European peacekeeping force to prevent Russian attacks.",
      "Trump\u2019s call with Putin and ensuing Russia-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia shattered the Biden administration's \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d policy. Trump blamed Kyiv for failing to make a deal with Moscow that could have prevented the war, praised Russia's military might and even suggested that Ukraine \u201cmay be Russian someday.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine won\u2019t accept any deal negotiated without Kyiv and insisted that European allies must participate in peace talks. He dismissed a U.S.-proposed draft agreement that would give Washington a large share of Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals as too focused on U.S. interests and had no security guarantees for Kyiv.",
      "Trump\u2019s approach stunned European allies, whose shock deepened when Vice President JD Vance sharply rebuked them at the Munich security conference over free speech and migration.",
      "While the Trump administration said European allies weren't welcome at the peace talks, it encouraged them to provide security guarantees for Kyiv in what former British ambassador Nigel Gould-Davies called a contradictory approach.",
      "Washington \"has signaled that the U.S. alone will negotiate an end to the war but also that Europe alone must pay for and enforce an outcome it has not played a role in deciding,\u201d said Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "Putin's key goals remain much the same \u2014 that Ukraine renounce joining NATO and enforce the use of the Russian language to keep the country in Moscow's orbit \u2014 but now wants Kyiv to withdraw its forces from the four regions Moscow has seized but doesn't fully control.",
      "He said a peace agreement could be broadly based on a draft negotiated early in the war that obliged Ukraine to declare neutrality, scale down its military and protect Russian language and culture. Those talks collapsed in April 2022 with no deal.",
      "Putin ruled out a truce, arguing it would benefit Kyiv. But some Kremlin-watchers believe he could accept it if Kyiv agrees to hold elections after a ceasefire.",
      "Trump echoed Putin's line that Zelenskyy, whose term expired last year, needs to face voters, while Kyiv maintains elections are impossible to hold amid a war. Trump escalated that notion Wednesday by posting on social media that Zelenskyy was \u201ca Dictator without Elections.\u201d",
      "Putin could hope an election would weaken Zelenskyy and lead to political instability, said Tatiana Stanovaya, senior fellow at Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.",
      "\u201cIn his view, most potential outcomes would be advantageous for Moscow \u2014 whether through heightened political infighting, possible protests, or a fragile victory for a new president,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Jack Watling of London's Royal United Services Institute says Ukraine faces \u201ca politically divisive election, economic paralysis due to a lack of foreign direct investment, and coercive threats from Russia to restart the war\u201d after a truce.",
      "It's unclear who would monitor any potential ceasefire.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said NATO should play no role and that any European troops taking part should not be covered by NATO\u2019s charter obliging allies to aid of any member under attack -\u2013 conditions that could dampen European enthusiasm about the mission.",
      "While the U.K. and others signal readiness to deploy troops for such a mission, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said after the U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia that Moscow won't accept troops from any NATO members in a peacekeeping force.",
      "Some reports suggested Chinese or Brazilian troops as part of a monitoring force, but those countries haven\u2019t signaled any intention of participation.",
      "Many believe Putin is no rush to make a peace deal.",
      "\u201cNegotiations appear desirable but by no means necessary for Russia to achieve its goals in its war against Ukraine,\u201d Stanovaya wrote.",
      "\u201cVirtually any outcome will be a good result for Moscow,\u201d she said, pointing at the erosion of Western unity and reduced Western support for Kyiv amid Moscow\u2019s gains.",
      "\u201cPutin has repeatedly made it clear that he believes Russia can achieve its goals in Ukraine without any U.S.-brokered deal,\u201d Stanovaya noted. \u201cAs far as he is concerned, Moscow simply needs to wait until Ukraine falls apart of its own accord, after which the Russian army will crush any remaining resistance among the Ukrainian army.\u201d",

      "Hong Kong\u2019s largest pro-democracy party took an initial step toward dissolving on Thursday",
      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong\u2019s largest pro-democracy party took an initial step toward dissolving Thursday, in the latest sign of the Chinese territory's narrowing space for civil society groups following Beijng's crackdown on dissent.",
      "The Democratic Party's central committee decided to set up a task force to look into the procedures involved in dissolving the party. A final decision would require approval of the party's members.",
      "Party Chairperson Lo Kin-hei said at a news conference late Thursday that party leaders made the decision based the current political situation and social climate, and said the party did not have any acute financial burdens.",
      "\u201cWhen we have to move toward this direction, we, of course, feel it is a pity. I believe every member cherishes the existence of the Democratic Party in Hong Kong,\u201d he said.",
      "Founded in 1994, the Democratic Party is one of the few pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong, where political activism has faced a stern crackdown from China's central government in Beijing following anti-government protests by Hong Kongers in 2019.",
      "Its prominent party members include Martin Lee, nicknamed the city\u2019s \u201cFather of Democracy,\u201d Albert Ho, former leader of a now-defunct group that organized Tiananmen vigils, and journalist-turned-activist Emily Lau.",
      "Over the years, the party has long been seen as a moderate opposition party that once maintained friendly relationships even with Beijing officials. Some of its former members had become top government officials, while radical members had criticized the party for being too mild.",
      "But following the massive protests that rocked the Chinese territory in 2019, the city's political environment changed drastically. Months of social unrest triggered Beijing to impose a national security law \u2014 which authorities insist is necessary for the city\u2019s stability.",
      "Since the law took effect in 2020, dozens of civil society groups have shut down, including the city\u2019s once second-largest pro-democracy party and a decades-old group that organized the annual vigil to commemorate Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen crackdown in 1989. Many leading activists were prosecuted under the law, including members of the Democratic Party. Others were forced into self-exile or silenced.",
      "Last year, some of the party\u2019s former lawmakers were convicted and sentenced over their roles in an unofficial primary election in the city\u2019s largest national security case. That verdict drew criticism from foreign governments though Beijing defended it.",
      "In recent years, the party has had limited influence over the city\u2019s politics after the authorities overhauled the electoral rules in changes they said ensured that \u201cpatriots\u201d administered Hong Kong, and that effectively barred pro-democracy candidates from running for seats in district councils.",
      "Despite the changing climate, the party pressed on with its work. It continued holding news briefings on livelihood issues and even submitted opinions on proposed national security legislation to the government before the law was enacted last March.",
      "In Thursday\u2019s news conference, Lo said disbandment would require support from 75% of the attending members of a general assembly. The party now has 400 members, but typically not all members attend general meetings. In the past, the party has had both successful and failed attempts to secure enough votes to change its constitution, he said.",
      "When the former British colony was returned to China's rule in 1997, the governing principle of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d was supposed to guarantee Western-style civil liberties and autonomy not enjoyed by mainland Chinese territories.",
      "But Lo said his party's interpretation of this governing principle may differ from that of the Beijing government. He said he hoped these different views could remain in society, saying that societies improve only with diverse voices.",
      "\u201cThe path to democracy is always difficult,\u201d Lo said. \u201cI have confidence in Hong Kongers and Hong Kongers can always find ways to handle different matters.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "U.N. special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen has said that formation of a \u201cnew inclusive government\u201d in Damascus by March 1 could pave the way for lifting sanctions imposed by western countries",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- Creating an inclusive government in Syria in coming weeks will help determine whether Western sanctions are lifted as the country rebuilds after the ouster of former President Bashar Assad, the U.N. special envoy to Syria said Thursday.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping is that with a truly new inclusive government in place on the 1st of March, this will help us in lifting sanctions\u201d imposed on Syria by Western countries during Assad's rule, Geir Pedersen told The Associated Press in an interview during a visit to Damascus.",
      "After Assad was toppled in a lightning rebel offensive in December, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, set up an interim administration comprising mainly members of its \u201csalvation government\u201d that had ruled in northwestern Syria.",
      "The country\u2019s de facto authorities said at the time that a new government would be formed through an inclusive process by March. In January, former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa was named Syria\u2019s interim president after a meeting of most of the country\u2019s former rebel factions.",
      "In recent weeks, a committee has been holding meetings in different parts of Syria in preparation for a national dialogue conference to chart the country's political future, the date of which has not yet been announced.",
      "Pedersen said that in his first meeting with al-Sharaa in December, al-Sharaa had insisted that the interim government would rule for only three months, although Pedersen warned him the timeline was tight.",
      "\u201cI think the important thing is not whether it is three months or not, but it is whether they will deliver on what they have said all along, that this is going to be an inclusive process where all Syrians will be included,\u201d Pedersen said.",
      "The U.S. and European countries have not lifted sanctions that were imposed on the Syrian government under Assad\u2019s rule, which the new authorities have said is handicapping their ability to rebuild the country after nearly 14 years of civil war and restore essential services like state electricity. Officials from some Western countries have said they want to see if the interim rulers will follow through on their promises of inclusive governance and protecting minorities.",
      "Organizers of the national dialogue have said the conference will include all segments of Syrian society except for Assad loyalists and the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led force in the northeast that has so far refused to dissolve and be absorbed into the new national army. The SDF is currently in negotiations with the central government, and Pedersen said he hopes to see a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d to the impasse.",
      "Pedersen said he is also concerned about a security vacuum following the disbanding of the former national army and security services by the country\u2019s new rulers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very important that the new structures of the state are coming in place quickly and that there is an offer to those who are no longer in service of the army or the security services, that there are other job opportunities and that people do not feel that they are excluded from the future of Syria,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.N. envoy said he also remains concerned about Israel\u2019s incursions into Syrian territory since the fall of Assad. The Israeli army has seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in the Golan Heights established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement with Syria and has also made forays beyond the buffer zone. The U.N. has said that Israel is violating the agreement.",
      "Israeli officials have said they took the action to protect Israel\u2019s security and that their presence would be temporary.",
      "Pedersen said the security concerns are being addressed and \u201cthere is really, in my opinion, no argument for why the Israelis should be staying.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe solution is very simple. The Israelis need to withdraw,\u201d he said."

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared in court Thursday for a hearing where his lawyers contested his arrest on a criminal charge alleging he was orchestrating a rebellion when he briefly imposed martial law in December.",
      "Security was heightened as the motorcade transporting Yoon arrived at the Seoul Central District Court and dozens of his supporters rallied nearby.",
      "The preliminary hearing will involve discussions of witnesses and other preparations for his criminal trial, and the court was also to review the request by Yoon\u2019s lawyers to cancel his arrest and release him from custody. Such challenges are rarely successful.",
      "Yoon was indicted Jan. 26 on the rebellion charge carrying a potential punishment of death or life in prison. In South Korea, presidents have immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but not on charges of rebellion or treason.",
      "The indictment alleges his imposition of martial law was an illegal attempt to shut down the National Assembly and arrest politicians and election authorities. The conservative Yoon has said his martial law declaration was intended as a temporary warning to the liberal opposition and that he had always planned to respect lawmakers\u2019 will if they voted to lift the measure.",
      "Yoon's presidential powers were suspended when he was impeached Dec. 14, and South Korea's Constitutional Court is nearing a decision on whether to formally remove him from office or dismiss the Assembly\u2019s impeachment and reinstate him.",
      "Martial law was lifted about six hours after Yoon declared it but has caused political turmoil, disrupted high-level diplomacy and tested the resiliency of the country\u2019s democracy. Yoon\u2019s conservative supporters rioted at the Seoul Western District Court after it authorized his arrest last month, while his lawyers and ruling party have openly questioned the credibility of courts and law enforcement institutions handling the case.",
      "Yoon has continued to express contempt for his liberal rivals for obstructing his agenda and endorsed baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud to justify his ill-fated authoritarian push.",
      "Yoon\u2019s defense minister, police chief and several military commanders have also been arrested and indicted on rebellion, abuse of power and other charges related to the martial law decree, which involved hundreds of heavily armed troops deployed to the National Assembly and National Election Commission offices.",

      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered X to pay 8.1 million Brazilian reais ($1.4 million) in fines for failing to comply with judicial orders, according to a judicial ruling.",
      "The ruling, signed on Wednesday and made public by the court on Thursday, said the social media platform refused to provide registration data for a profile attributed to Allan dos Santos, an ally of former President Jair Bolsonaro accused of spreading falsehoods.",
      "In July 2024, De Moraes ordered both X and Meta to block and ban the account and provide the data. X said it had blocked the account but could not deliver the requested information, arguing that its operators didn't collect it and that the user had \u201cno technical connection point with Brazil.\u201d",
      "De Moraes rejected the argument and, in early August, imposed a daily fine of 100,000 Brazilian reais ($17,500) if the social media platform failed to provide the data. By October, the total fine for noncompliance had reached 8.1 million Brazilian reais.",
      "X appealed but later notified the court that it would pay the fine. In Wednesday\u2019s ruling, the justice ordered the company to pay the full amount immediately. It is unclear from the decision reviewed by The Associated Press whether X provided the requested registration data.",

      "Last year, De Moraes ordered X's nationwide shutdown after the company said it was removing all remaining Brazil staff in the country, saying de Moraes had threatened its legal representative in the country with arrest. The country's law requires foreign companies to have a local legal representative to receive notifications of court decisions and swiftly take any requisite action \u2014 particularly, in X\u2019s case, the takedown of accounts.",
      "The social media was reinstated a month later, after complying with orders to block certain accounts from the platform, name an official legal representative and pay fines imposed for not complying with earlier court orders.",
      "Elon Musk, the social media owner, and De Moraes, a foe of former president Jair Bolsonaro, sparred for months over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. Musk called the judge an enemy of free speech and a criminal. But de Moraes\u2019 decisions have been repeatedly upheld by his peers \u2014 including his nationwide block of X."

      "Canada is listing seven Latin American criminal organizations as terrorist entities under the criminal code, giving Canadian law enforcement another tool in the fight against fentanyl trafficking, authorities say",
      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- Canada is designating seven Latin American criminal organizations as terrorist entities under the country's Criminal Code, giving Canadian law enforcement another tool in the fight against fentanyl trafficking, Public Safety Minister David McGuinty said Thursday.",
      "The list includes Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, Jalisco New Generation Cartel and La Nueva Familia Michoacana, and was announced a day after the U.S. government formally designated eight Latin American organized crime groups as \u201cforeign terrorist organizations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe measures will help keep fentanyl off Canadian streets and from entering the United States,\u201d McGuinty told a news conference.",
      "The announcement was Canada's latest response to U.S. President Donald Trump 's claim that the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigration into the U.S. were behind his threats of imposing a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods \u2013 with the exception of 10% on energy.",
      "Trump has paused the implementation of those tariffs until at least March 4.",
      "U.S. border patrol statistics show that less than 1% of all fentanyl seized is found at the northern border. But Canadian officials have expressed a willingness to do more to combat the deadly synthetic opioid.",
      "The other organizations designated as terrorist groups are Cartel del Golfo and Carteles Unidos, also from Mexico; Tren de Aragua, in Venezuela, and the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, which started in California but became a dominant criminal force in El Salvador.",
      "The designation effectively freezes a group\u2019s assets and property.",
      "\u201cBanks and brokerages will freeze these entities' assets, which can then be the subject of seizure, restraint or forfeiture,\u201d said McGuinty.",
      "It is also an offense to knowingly participate in, or contribute to, any activity of a listed terrorist group.",
      "The listing process begins with intelligence reports that indicate whether an organization has knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity.",
      "McGuinty said listing a group as a terrorist entity follows a rigorous process that \u201cmust meet a legal threshold.\u201d",
      "If the public safety minister believes that threshold has been met, the minister may recommend to the federal cabinet that the organization be added to the list.",
      "RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme said the RCMP has intelligence indicating that crime cartels operate in Canada.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s also strong intelligence that Canadians have actually moved to Mexico and South America to facilitate the transport of certain commodities into Canada,\u201d Duheme said.",
      "Canada recently appointed Kevin Brosseau, a former member of the RCMP and a former national security and intelligence adviser, as its fentanyl czar to help stop drugs entering the U.S.",
      "The Canadian government has also announced it is spending $1.3 billion Canadian dollars (US$910 million) on increased border security, including new helicopters, technology and personnel.",

      "\u201cThere is no doubt that this is, not unprecedented, but an unusual event,\u201d Marles told Sky News television.",
      "Marles said Australian navy ships and air force planes were monitoring the Chinese ships\u2019 movements through international waters that are in Australia's exclusive economic zone, the area beyond its territorial waters where a nation has exclusive economic rights.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re entitled to be where they are; Australia is also entitled to be prudent and we are monitoring very closely what the activities of the task group are,\u201d Marles told reporters.",
      "\u201cWhat we will do whenever this mission is over on the part of the Chinese task group is engage in a full assessment of what the Chinese were seeking to achieve in respect of this mission,\u201d he added.",
      "In Beijing, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun was asked at a media briefing on Wednesday about the Chinese warships' location and replied he was not aware of the situation. The Chinese Embassy in Australia did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.",

      "She did not specify how the New Zealand military would monitor the Chinese shipping.",

      "\u201cThis is part of a broader power projection from the PLA-Navy and we should expect to see more of this in the Pacific and in the Indian Ocean,\u201d Parker said.",
      "The Chinese deployment comes as the head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command Adm. Samuel Paparo visits Australia this week.",
      "Parker said the timing was likely coincidental given the Chinese deployment would have been planned well in advance and the United States doesn\u2019t release information about their senior officers\u2019 travel until close to the visit.",
      "\u201cWithout knowing exactly where the ships are going, the point of this deployment, I think, is to demonstrate to Australia that they have the capability to come down and operate in our maritime domain,\u201d Parker said.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told a news conference he was not worried by reports of Chinese warships off Sydney.",

      "TORONTO -- Former paramedic Peter Carlson is still having difficulty putting into perspective the shuddering jolt he and 79 others aboard Delta Air Lines flight 4819 experienced earlier this week.",
      "One moment, the 40-year-old was looking forward to arriving in Toronto where he was speaking at an Ontario paramedic chiefs convention. The next, he was hanging \u2014 strapped only by his seatbelt \u2014 looking down at the airplane\u2019s ceiling, attempting to assess the chaos around him.",
      "As blood flowed from a gash on the back of Carlson's head, he noticed other injured passengers, including one pinned beneath a seat behind him. There was an overwhelming smell of jet fuel as it streamed down the window next to his seat by the plane\u2019s right wing which was sheared off during Monday's crash landing at Toronto\u2019s Pearson International Airport.",
      "\u201cIt was a forceful impact, a sideways movement and suddenly just inverted,\u201d Carlson told The Associated Press on Wednesday. \u201cAnd the only mission was to get out.\u201d",
      "Carlson's friend and convention chairman Michael Nolan, 53, was waiting to pick him up when he spotted a plume of black smoke in the distance.",
      "\u201cAre you OK? Something's going on on the runway,\u201d Nolan texted Carlson, not realizing it was his plane.",
      "Carlson responded that he was on the tarmac.",
      "At first, Nolan thought it meant Carlson's plane had landed. Then his friend sent a follow-up text with a picture of his fellow passengers evacuating the upside-down plane.",
      "\u201cMy heart just sank ... knowing that was his reality was absolutely shocking to me and really brought it home,\u201d said Nolan, a paramedic chief in a county north of Ottawa.",
      "Instead of just attending a convention about the role paramedics play in the world, the two men found themselves in the middle of a real-life emergency.",
      "Nolan rushed to a triage area to assist in treating injured passengers, greeting his friend of over a decade with a big hug.",
      "Carlson's paramedic instincts also kicked in, even though he\u2019s held a so-called desk job for the past decade.",
      "\u201cI was comfortable with how my body and mind empowered me to do what I needed to do at that point,\u201d he said. \u201cI was able to see the objective nature of the challenge in front of us, which was to get away from the threat.\u201d",
      "Though credited for helping in the evacuation, Carlson deferred praise to the four crew members who shepherded the passengers to safety. That everyone survived astounds him, especially after seeing videos posted online of the Mitsubishi CRJ-900 jet touching down heavily and skidding down the runway before flipping over.",
      "\u201cEven without seeing that, it\u2019s remarkable,\u201d Carlson said, noting he bruised his ribs and has several cuts and bruises on his legs.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m deserving of going into miracle territory, but it sure feels ...\u201d he added, before pausing to find the appropriate word. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d",
      "The last of the 21 injured passengers was released from the hospital on Thursday.",
      "The cuts and bruises will heal, but the mental trauma left Carlson wondering whether he could muster enough resolve on Wednesday to still deliver his address.",
      "\u201cIt took me a lot of personal motivation to leave my room,\u201d he said. \u201cThis morning, I just couldn\u2019t. I was quite emotional about this whole thing and just really want to be home.\u201d",
      "And yet, deliver Carlson did \u2014 giving a 20-minute speech in which he outlined his background and influences in paramedicine, the significance of the job and the difference paramedics can make.",
      "Whatever anxieties he felt didn\u2019t show.",
      "Though Carlson longed to be back home in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with his wife and three children, his nerves were eased being among his working family of paramedics and Nolan.",
      "National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Cindy Woodhouse welcomed Carlson on Tuesday into a drumming circle of healing.",
      "A day later, Ontario paramedic chiefs association president Greg Sage honored Carlson's efforts on the airplane with a certificate.",
      "\u201cI think every single one of us in this room would hope that if we personally were faced with what Pete was, that we would respond in a similar manner,\u201d Sage said. \u201cI think he\u2019s inspired all of us.\u201d",
      "Carlson's trip to Toronto began with a hug with Nolan during a very trying time. Two days later, the two shared a more joyous hug onstage after Carlson accepted his award to a standing ovation.",
      "\u201cI was not as present the last couple of days as I had hoped to be,\u201d Carlson apologized to the crowd.",
      "\u201cGiven the events as they've played out, I can't think of a better group of people in terms of taking care of one another in their community and myself,\" Carlson said. \"So just a very big thank you.\u201d"

      "\u201cEvery death of a pope \u2026\u201d starts another, indicating a rare occurrence.",
      "But the one most frequently heard when a pope is actually sick is perhaps the darkest: \u201cThe pope is fine until he\u2019s dead.\u201d",
      "That one's been making the rounds as Pope Francis nears a week in Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital, battling pneumonia and a complex respiratory infection.",
      "While the Vatican has been providing twice-daily updates on his condition and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said they \u201cjoked around as usual\u201d during her visit Wednesday, all kinds of reports \u2014 true and not \u2014 abound about Francis' health.",
      "They've taken on a life of their own in an age of chat groups, conspiracy theories and internet memes \u2014 not to mention the perennial Roman fixation on the pope and who might succeed him.",
      "It doesn\u2019t help that the Oscar-nominated movie \u201cConclave\u201d is in theaters and has made everyone an expert in the arcane rules and spectacular drama involved in a papal election. Or that Francis recently extended the term of the dean of the College of Cardinals rather than find someone new to fill a key job during the next papal transition. Or that at 88, he is one of the oldest popes ever.",
      "Francis still has a ways to go to outlive Pope Leo XIII, who died in 1903 at 93. But he\u2019s on track to equal or surpass Pope Gregory XII, perhaps best known for being the most recent pope to resign until Pope Benedict XVI did so in 2013. Gregory was 88 when he stepped down in 1415 to end the Western Schism, according to online resource Catholic Hierarchy.",

      "The Vatican hasn't allowed any member of Francis' medical team to appear on camera or give detailed updates on his health, and no photos of him have been released since his Feb. 14 hospitalization.",
      "But to understand how entwined the pope is in Italian life, one only needs to consider another tradition religiously observed by Italians: the annual Sanremo song festival, a weeklong series of shows on RAI television in which viewers vote for their favorite rising vocalists who perform nightly in the kitschy, sometimes bawdy contest.",
      "When it opened last week, it made even more headlines than usual because Francis \u2014 already sick with bronchitis but not yet in the hospital \u2014 appeared on the show in a pre-taped video, a publicity coup for Sanremo and a papal first.",
      "When popular Italian blog Dagospia subsequently claimed the video had been made nearly a year earlier for another event, near-hysteria broke out among Vatican watchers. The apparent deception suggested that Francis\u2019 latest illness was much worse than it seemed, and raised questions about the solidity of the papacy if an old video had been released without the pope\u2019s knowledge.",
      "As it turns out, Dagospia was wrong. The video was legit, recent and recorded for Sanremo. But it was true that Francis\u2019 bronchitis was indeed much worse than it seemed. By week's end, he was hospitalized with a lung infection that turned into pneumonia.",
      "The episode though underscored the truism that the papacy is a matter of general public knowledge, interest and debate here, and that speculating about the pope's current health and who might be next is a national pastime.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m certainly very, very worried,\u201d said Maurizio Di Folco, who was being treated Tuesday at the same hospital. \u201cI wish him a speedy recovery and we\u2019re praying for him deeply. A very good pope. A great pope! We hope he\u2019ll be with us for a long time to come.\u201d",
      "But elsewhere, Francis\u2019 right-wing critics are circulating alarmist -\u2013 and wholly uncorroborated -\u2013 stories about his condition. Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, a Francis nemesis who was excommunicated for schism last year, revived his conspiracy about the legitimacy of Francis\u2019 2013 election, calling for the CIA to investigate what he claims was a \u201cDeep State\u201d plot to elect him.",
      "Francis knows this dynamic well.",
      "\u201cSome wanted me dead,\u201d he told Slovakian Jesuit priests in 2021, referring to what he learned while he was hospitalized that year for intestinal surgery. \u201cI know there were even meetings among priests who thought the pope was in worse shape than what was being said. They were preparing the conclave.\u201d",
      "It's considered poor taste to discuss publicly who's up or down in the papal stakes of a future conclave, much less to start plotting one. But privately, Rome is abuzz with such conversations. Taxi drivers chat about it with passengers, doctors with patients, butchers with customers.",
      "For now, Francis is holding on. Thursday's bulletins said he had breakfast sitting up in an armchair and was working with aides after blood tests showed a \u201cslight improvement\u201d in his inflammation.",
      "\u201cThere is a greater measure of transparency, but even that is not complete,\u201d said Christopher Bellitto, a church history professor at Kean University in New Jersey. \u201cSurely everyone with aging parents and grandparents said, \u2018that\u2019s pneumonia\u2019 before the Vatican did.\u201d",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday she will propose constitutional reforms aimed at protecting Mexico\u2019s sovereignty after U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration designated six Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "The U.S. designations have stirred worry in Mexico that it could be a preliminary step toward U.S. military intervention on Mexican territory in pursuit of the cartels, something Mexico sharply rejects.",
      "\u201cThe Mexican people will not accept under any circumstances interventions, interference or any other act from abroad that could be harmful to the integrity, independence and sovereignty of the nation,\u201d Sheinbaum said.",
      "On Thursday, the designation of eight Latin America-based criminal organizations was published in the U.S. Federal Register, carrying out a Jan. 20 executive order by Trump. The U.S. hopes the designation, something usually reserved for terrorist groups with political rather than economic objectives, will increase pressure on the groups.",
      "Sheinbaum said during her daily press briefing Thursday that Mexico also wouldn\u2019t allow outside involvement in investigations or prosecutions without authorization and collaboration of the Mexican government.",
      "Former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Sheinbaum\u2019s predecessor, had already written into Mexican law limits to how foreign agents could operate in Mexico, limiting their independence and requiring that Mexican authorities be informed of their movements. Sheinbaum proposes enshrining those limits in the constitution.",
      "\u201cWhat we want to make clear in the face of this designation is that we do not negotiate sovereignty,\u201d Sheinbaum said. \u201cThis cannot be an opportunity for the United States to invade our sovereignty.\u201d",
      "Her administration also proposed reforming the constitution to apply the most severe penalties available under law to foreigners involved in the building, smuggling and distribution of guns. Mexico has long demanded that the U.S. do more to prevent the flood of guns into Mexico from U.S. gun shops and manufacturers.",
      "Her Morena party and its allies hold majorities in both chambers of Congress and have been able to pass a number of other constitutional reforms."

      "Diplomats including Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi are expected to attend the gathering, while the U.S. will be represented by acting ambassador to South Africa Dana Brown.",
      "The European Union, the United Nations and the African Union, which is part of the G20, will also be in attendance.",
      "Rubio snubbed the meeting after an executive order by U.S. President Donald Trump stopped foreign aid to the country over a law that the White House said amounts to discrimination against the country\u2019s white minority. The U.S. is also displeased with South Africa's case against Israel at the International Court of Justice.",
      "South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola has said that Rubio\u2019s decision was \u201cnot a complete boycott of South Africa\u2019s G20.\" He said the U.S. would be represented in Johannesburg this week \u201cin one form or shape or another.\u201d",
      "U.S. Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent has also confirmed his will not attend a meeting of G20 finance ministers scheduled to take place in South Africa next week.",
      "Bessent said on the social media platform X that he would not participate in the event because of obligations in Washington. A senior Treasury official will attend in his place, he said.",
      "Analysts say that Rubio and Bessent's absence signalled the U.S was pulling back from the G20 and demonstrated how strained relations are.",
      "\u201cI think if we want to really know what message the US administration is trying to send, you have to know whether the treasury secretary will come next week or not. And if he chooses not to come as well, that\u2019s a quite serious sign,\" said political analyst Daniel Bradlow.",
      "President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to officially open and address the gathering under the theme \u201cSolidarity, Equality and Sustainability,\" which Rubio has described as a diversity, equality and inclusion framework \u2014 one that the new Trump administration vocally opposes.",

      "Pannir Selvam Pranthaman was arrested in 2014 for having 52 grams (about 1.8 ounces) of heroin and sentenced to death in 2017. He is due to be hanged on Thursday, making him the fourth person to be put to death in the Southeast Asian country this year alone; two others were executed for drug-related crimes and one for murder.",
      "Singapore\u2019s strict laws mandate the death penalty for anyone caught carrying more than 15 grams (0.5 ounces) of heroin and 500 grams (17.6 ounces) of cannabis. However, critics say the laws only target low-level traffickers and couriers.",
      "Pannir's family, lawyers, some Malaysian lawmakers and various rights groups noted that the Singapore court had found that he was merely a courier transporting the substance. The 36-year-old has said he didn't know he was carrying drugs. Still, the court had to hand down the death sentence after prosecutors refused to issue Pannir a certificate of substantive assistance, vouching that he helped their investigation, which would have spared him the noose, they said.",
      "\"This process violates the right to a fair trial, as it placed the decision between a life-or-death sentence in the hands of the prosecution\u2013which is not a neutral party in the trial,\u201d Amnesty International said. \u201cWe urge the Singapore government to immediately end its unlawful resort to the death penalty and immediately establish a moratorium on all executions.\"",

      "Behind bars, Pannir has written letters, songs and poems about the anguish of being on death row and hopes of a second chance, she said. His family has shared some of his songs, which were replicated by several Malaysian singers.",
      "Activists in Malaysia will hold a vigil outside the Singapore High Commission in Kuala Lumpur later Wednesday. Another vigil will be held simultaneously at a park in Singapore to protest Pannir\u2019s execution and the death penalty, as well as to remember those hanged by the city-state."

      "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan wants to remove all Afghan refugees from the country and they face expulsion in the near future, the Afghan embassy in Islamabad warned Wednesday.",
      "The embassy issued a strongly worded statement about Pakistan\u2019s plans, saying Afghan nationals in the capital, Islamabad, and the nearby garrison city of Rawalpindi have been subjected to arrests, searches, and orders from the police to leave the twin cities and relocate to other parts of Pakistan.",
      "\u201cThis process of detaining Afghans, which began without any formal announcement, has not been officially communicated to the Embassy of Afghanistan in Islamabad through any formal correspondence,\u201d it said.",
      "\u201cUltimately, officials from Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that there is a definitive and final plan to deport all Afghan refugees not only from Islamabad and Rawalpindi but also from the entire country in the near future,\u201d the embassy said.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Pakistani government on the embassy statement.",
      "The latest development follows Pakistan\u2019s threat to deport Afghans living in the country illegally. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif approved a deadline of March 31 to deport those awaiting relocation to third countries unless their cases are swiftly processed by the governments who have agreed to take them.",
      "The Afghan embassy criticized \"the short timeframe\" given and \"the unilateral nature of Pakistan\u2019s decision\u201d.",
      "Besides the hundreds of thousands living illegally in Pakistan, some 1.45 million Afghans are registered with the UNHCR as refugees. Pakistan says those who were registered earlier had their stay extended until June 2025, and will not be arrested or deported at least until the extension expires.",
      "Earlier this month, Shafqat Ali Khan, the spokesman at Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said: \u201cThis resettlement problem can\u2019t be indefinite. So, for us, the Afghans who are here, awaiting resettlement, also has to be a transitory phase. This is not a permanent thing.\u201d",
      "He said Pakistan has been collaborating with Western countries to expedite the resettlement program and \u201cwill continue to do that.\u201d",
      "In the past three years, tens of thousands of Afghans have fled to Pakistan. Many of them were approved for resettlement in the U.S. through a program that helps people at risk because of their work during the war with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. However, after U.S. President Donald Trump paused U.S. refugee programs last month, around 20,000 Afghans are now in limbo in Pakistan.",
      "They have been facing harassment and arrest since October 2023, when Pakistan began cracking down on foreigners living in the country illegally.",
      "Although the government said the campaign was not aimed at Afghans, they make up the majority of foreigners in Pakistan.",
      "The International Organization for Migration reported an increase in deportation of Afghans in January.",
      "The IOM this week said Afghans were being deported from Islamabad and Rawalpindi. It said there was a 13% increase in Afghans returning home from Jan. 16 to 31 compared to the first two weeks in January. It said 824,568 Afghans have returned home since 2023.",
      "Ahmad Shah, a member of an Afghan advocacy group, urged Pakistan on Wednesday to allow Afghans waiting for relocation to continue living in Islamabad at least until the Trump administration makes a final decision about their fate.",
      "He said it would be hard for them to visit Western embassies in the Pakistani capital if they were moved to other areas."

      "Noboa, according to a statement from the communications secretariat, ordered the foreign ministry to seek cooperation agreements with \u201callied nations\u201d that would allow \u201cthe incorporation of special forces\u201d on a temporary basis as support for the Ecuadorian police and armed forces. He also urged the opposition-controlled National Assembly to back his initiative.",
      "The statement did not say which countries Ecuador would seek military assistance from.",
      "The spike in violence across the South American country is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. Mexican, Colombian and Balkan cartels have set down roots in Ecuador and operate with assistance from local criminal gangs.",

But the rate remained far higher than the 6.85 per 100,000 people in 2019, and the country is already on track to exceed that number this year. January was Ecuador\u2019s deadliest month on record, with 731 homicides.",
      "The conservative Noboa earlier this month won one of two spots in an April runoff election.",

      "Turski survived the Lodz ghetto, where he and his family were forced to live, two death marches and imprisonment at the Nazi German concentration camps Buchenwald and Auschwitz-Birkenau, which was in German-occupied Poland. In all, he lost 39 relatives in the Holocaust.",
      "Unlike many Jewish survivors who left postwar Poland, Turski chose to remain. He was on the political left his entire life, and was a member of the communist party.",
      "He was among a dwindling number of Holocaust survivors and spoke during observances last month marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp.",
      "However, it was a stark warning about the dangers of indifference at the anniversary five years earlier that brought him international attention and raised his moral profile among his supporters. Turski said at the time that the Holocaust did not \u201cfall from the sky\u201d all at once but took hold step by step as society\u2019s acceptance of small acts of discrimination eventually led to ghettos and extermination camps.",
      "He also called on people to not remain indifferent when minorities are discriminated against, when history is distorted and when \u201cany authority violates the existing social contract.\u201d",
      "Many in Poland interpreted his words as a critique of the right-wing government in power at the time. However, those on the political right criticized him for using the Auschwitz anniversary to comment on the political situation, and some even suggested that Turski lacked the moral authority for such a warning because he belonged to Poland\u2019s communist party before 1989.",
      "Citing the words of another survivor, Roman Kent, Turski described what should be the Eleventh Commandment of the Bible: \u201cThough shalt not be indifferent.\u201d",
      "Poland\u2019s conservative President Andrzej Duda paid tribute to Turski, saying: \u201cHe consistently spoke about the need to cultivate sensitivity to evil. May his memory be honored!\u201d",

      "His father and brother died in the gas chambers, while his mother was sent to work at the Bergen Belsen camp in northern Germany, and Turski was dispatched to work on roads in the Auschwitz-Birkenau area before being sent on two death marches. He was liberated at Terezin close to death from exhaustion and typhus.",
      "In September 1945, he returned to Poland, a committed communist who rejected an offer to go to the West and wanted to help build a socialist Poland.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The IRS will lay off roughly 7,000 workers in Washington and around the country beginning Thursday, a person familiar with the plans told The Associated Press.",
      "The layoffs affect probationary employees with roughly one year or less of service at the agency and largely include workers in compliance departments, according to the person, who was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday. Compliance work includes ensuring that taxpayers are abiding by the tax code, filing their returns and paying their taxes, among other duties.",
      "The layoffs are part of the Trump administration's intensified efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection. They come despite IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season being told earlier this month that they would not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until mid-May, after the taxpayer filing deadline.",
      "It's unclear how the layoffs may affect tax collection services this year. As the nation's revenue collector, the IRS was tasked during the Biden administration with targeting high-wealth tax evaders for an additional stream of income to the U.S., which is $36 trillion in debt. By the end of 2024, the IRS collected over $1.3 billion in back taxes from rich tax dodgers.",
      "The IRS has roughly 90,000 employees total across the United States, according to the latest IRS data. Racial minorities make up 56% of the IRS workforce, and women represent 65%.",
      "In addition to the planned layoffs, the Trump administration intends to lend IRS workers to the Department of Homeland Security to assist with immigration enforcement. In a letter sent earlier this month, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to borrow IRS workers to help with ongoing immigration crackdown efforts.",

      "He said at an investment conference in Miami that the administration is considering a concept in which 20% of the savings produced by DOGE\u2019s cost-cutting efforts goes to American citizens and another 20% goes to paying down the national debt.",
      "Trump also said the potential for dividend payments would incentivize people to report wasteful spending.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll be reporting it themselves,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey participate in the process of saving us money.\u201d",
      "Later, as he flew back to Washington aboard Air Force One, he was asked by a reporter about the plan floated by Musk.",
      "\u201cI love it,\" the Republican president told reporters on the plane.",
      "A day earlier, Musk wrote on his social media platform that he \u201cwill check with the President\u201d in response to a suggestion that Trump and Musk should announce a \u201dDOGE Dividend\" that would send a refund to taxpayers from part of the savings created by DOGE. Its efforts have already led to thousands of federal government employees being fired or laid off.",

      "The La Guajira region in northern Colombia, home to the Indigenous Wayuu community, holds vast potential for renewable energy, especially wind power, but projects have faced resistance",
      "CABO DE LA VELA, Colombia -- Giant wind turbines tower over a cemetery sacred to Zoyla Velasquez and her Indigenous Wayuu community, native to the La Guajira region in northern Colombia.",
      "This arid, wind-swept region, dotted with cacti and roaming herds of goats, holds immense potential to position Colombia as a wind and solar energy leader. However, resistance from the Wayuu community has stalled many proposed projects by multinational companies and the government. The Wayuu have concerns about the environmental and cultural impacts and the lack of prior consultation in what's one of the nation\u2019s poorest regions. Now, these companies are also eyeing the region\u2019s offshore wind farm prospects.",
      "\u201cThis cemetery is sacred to us, the Wayuu,\u201d 64-year-old Velasquez said in Spanish, though she is more comfortable speaking in her native Wayuunaiki. Wayuu leaders say what is threatened isn\u2019t the cemetery itself but the spirituality of the territory. \u201cIt is here that the bones of our ancestors rest. That's what matters most to us.\u201d",
      "The region could generate approximately 15 gigawatts of wind energy, according to Colombia\u2019s Mining and Energy Planning Unit, which could power up to an estimated 37.5 million homes annually. It's part of Colombia\u2019s just energy transition, aiming to replace fossil fuels with renewables while supporting vulnerable groups like Indigenous peoples. The Wayuu say this isn\u2019t happening.",
      "Construction started on the La Guajira 1 wind farm \u2014 which looms over the cemetery near Cabo de la Vela \u2014 in 2020 after a mix of legal processes, government backing, and controversial negotiations and unsatisfactory prior consultation. It faced significant opposition from the Wayuu and has been producing electricity since 2022, but is not yet hooked up to the interconnected system.",
      "\u201cWayuu spirituality is the fundamental base of our life and existence,\u201d said An\u00edbal Mercado, a \u201cPalabrero,\u201d head of the regional Wayuu council. He wasn't part of the consultations due to his staunch opposition. \u201cIf something disturbs the peacefulness of our dead, they\u2019re affecting spiritual peace and tranquility. And as long as (the turbines) are there, there is going to be direct violation, anxiety and impact.\u201d",
      "______",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This is part of a series of on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change.",
      "______",
      "A lot of the population also preserve traditional, semi nomadic ways of living on \u201crancherias,\u201d which are thatched-like roofed huts, made from dried cacti and mud, herd cattle and goats, and many are armed. They also have a traditional governance system and laws based on their cultural and spiritual practices.",
      "Critics warn that the government\u2019s push to expedite approvals for other developments could escalate tensions.",
      "\u201cLa Guajira has been very sought after by these companies,\u201d Samuel Lanao, head of Corpoguajira, La Guajira\u2019s environment authority told The Associated Press in Riohacha, the region's capital. \u201cWhen a foreign company enters these territories with the intention of exploiting renewable energies, there is always going to be a clash.\"",
      "Colombia's government has committed to respecting Indigenous rights through legal frameworks like the 1991 Constitution, which recognizes Indigenous autonomy, and international agreements that ensure their right to prior consultation and participation in decisions that affect them. The 2016 Peace Agreement also touched on Indigenous communities\u2019 rights, land restitution, and participation in political processes.",
      "Social issues have begun to spook companies, with 57 planned projects stalled, according to Indepaz, a Bogot\u00e1-based development organization with extensive research on the matter. While some projects are Colombian, the majority involve international companies from Brazil, Europe, U.S. and Canada.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear they\u2019re worried. There\u2019s been a slowdown in the progress of these energy transition projects precisely because of that conflict,\u201d Lanao said. \u201cI believe that the national government plays an important role in achieving a community-company agreement.\u201d",
      "Colombia\u2019s environment ministry did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The region is home to Cerrejon, one of the largest open-pit coal mines in the world and a major player in Latin America\u2019s mining sector, which has been in operation since 1985. The mine has just nine years left in its lifespan, and its closure, without alternative plans in place, will deal a significant blow to the region\u2019s economy.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine what this energy transition means to us,\u201d Lanao said. \u201cThis renewable energy sector comes to supply the income that the coal exploitation gives us today in La Guajira.\u201d",
      "Developing wind projects in Guajira is key to guaranteeing a reliable supply of electricity in Colombia, says Margarita Nieves, founder of Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network and La Guajira native.",
      "Nieves added for La Guajira, it represents an opportunity to have a new industry that will generate employment, position it as a center for the production of goods and services for the wind energy sector, and contribute to meeting the electricity demand of its inhabitants.",
      "But the issue is also causing internal friction within the Wayuu community which stems from differing views on economic benefits, with some supporting development for financial gain.",
      "The AP spoke to several Wayuu families living near wind turbines who do not oppose the companies operating there, as they have received financial assistance and housing.",
      "Others are not convinced.",
      "\u201cAn old saying goes that if you\u2019ve never owned a chicken, manure looks like an egg to you,\u201d Mercado, the Palabrero, said when asked about those in the community who accept help from the companies, which is much less than what he'd consider fair compensation.",
      "\u201cThere are many communities that have never had anything. In the midst of so much need, so much crisis, so much hunger, any little penny that they are being offered now seems like a miracle cure and the greatest wealth in the world to them,\u201d he said.",
      "Companies are now carrying out studies for offshore wind farms, which is also enraging the Wayuu, especially traditional fishers, known as Apalanchii.",
      "Lanao, of the environmental authority, says just because the project is in the sea, it does not mean the communities do not have influence.",
      "The Apalanchii use traditional fishing techniques, with nets, hooks and sometimes spearfishing. It is not only a means of sustenance but also a culturally important activity which they say ties them to their ancestors and the land.",
      "\u201cWe are really worried about the offshore wind farms,\u201d said fisherman Aaron Laguna Ipuana, 57, during an early morning fishing trip in Cabo de la Vela with his crew. \u201cThey're going to displace us and the sea is everything to us. It sustains us.\"",
      "Mercado says the government needs to do more to ensure Wayuu people are involved.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that these projects continue and that the government is letting them go ahead, without even coming to say what is going to happen and what is in the interest of the Wayuu people,\" said Mercado.",
      "\u201cThe Wayuu defend their territory with blood and death, if necessary,\u201d he said.",
      "At the cemetery, Velasquez, dressed in a traditional Wayuu robe and headscarf, gently strokes and observes the graves alongside her sister and young niece. In the background, the turbine blades continue to turn.",
      "\u201cThe nobility of a Wayuu is used by companies,\u201d Velazquez says. \u201cMay they do something good for us ... the way we want it.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 08:54:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits with its competitive prices an increasingly strong magnet for inflation-weary shoppers, but this year appears to come with new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape",
    "story": [
      "Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits with its competitive prices an increasingly strong magnet for inflation-weary shoppers, but this year appears to come with new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape",
      "NEW YORK -- Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits with its competitive prices an increasingly strong magnet for inflation-weary shoppers, but 2025 appears to come with new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "The outlook from the nation's largest retailer for 2025 is as much as 27 cents below analyst projections for per-share earnings and for the quarter, Walmart's expectations are as much as 7 cents below Wall Street projections.",
      "Its sales outlook is also disappointing, potentially a reflection of rising challenges ahead as consumers pull back on spending and President Donald Trump's tariffs on China and other countries threaten the low-price model that is the core of Walmart's success.",
      "Walmart has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Groceries account for roughly 60%, of its U.S. business, according to the company\u2019s most recent annual report, meaning a huge chunk of sales are not reliant on goods made in China or elsewhere.",
      "Still, shares tumbled nearly 9% before the opening bell Thursday and it pulled other big retailers down with it. The retail sector is the biggest decliner in premarket trading and Target slid 2%.",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly financial results and numbers could provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper, particularly amid new trade barriers that according to most economists threaten to reignite inflation. Consumers over the past year have increasingly focused more on necessities rather than TVs, furniture or appliances. They've become much more discerning about big-ticket purchases because of higher costs for credit as well as for groceries.",
      "Walmart has flourished in that environment, using its clout to keep prices down. It's gained market share, notably among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart\u2019s online offerings and paid membership, Walmart +, have also drawn wealthier customers",
      "\u201cWe have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an eCommerce business driven by faster delivery times,\u201d said CEO Doug McMillon. \u201cWe\u2019re gaining market share, our top line is healthy, and we\u2019re in great shape with inventory.\u201d",
      "Still, Walmart could be faced with challenges with the new tariffs carrying more economic risks than during Trump's first term. If Americans are hit by a new wave of price increases, economists say, and with 70% of the U.S. economy driven by consumers a broad pullback in spending would have ramifications beyond Walmart\u2019s sales.",
      "Government data last week revealed a sharp drop in January retail sales as cold weather kept more Americans indoors. But it was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest in a year. Sales were revised higher for December, possibly indicating a pullback by consumers after a holiday season splurge.",
      "Yet grocery prices, a sore point for American households, continued to rise.",
      "Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, reported earnings of $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31. That compares with $5.49 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share for the most recent quarter was 66 cents.",
      "Sales rose 4.1% to $180.55 billion in the quarter.",
      "Analysts expected 65 cents per share on sales of $180.07 billion in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet.",
      "For Walmart\u2019s U.S. division, comparable store sales \u2014 which include online and stores open for the past 12 months \u2014 rose 4.6% in the U.S., a bit lower than the 5.3% in the previous quarter. The retailer had a 4.2% jump in the U.S. in the second quarter and 3.8% in the first quarter.",
      "Global e-commerce sales rose 16% in the latest quarter, notably slower than the 27% increase in the third quarter.",
      "Walmart expects first quarter earnings per share of between 57 cents and 58 cents, well below the 64 cents Wall Street was expecting, and for the year. Walmart expects earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. That\u2019s also off the $2.77 that analysts are predicting, according to FactSet.",
      "It forecast a 3% to 4% increase in quarterly sales or between $166.35 billion and $167.97 billion. That could be a letdown for industry analysts, who had expected sales of $167.05 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Walmart expects sales to be up anywhere between 3% to 4% for the current year, or between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That too falls short of the $708.72 billion that analysts predicted, according to FactSet.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Wednesday he is considering buying used Boeing aircraft \u2014 perhaps from an overseas seller \u2014 to use as Air Force One when he's aboard, as he fumes over the U.S. plane-maker's delays in producing two specially modified ones for presidential use.",

      "Birkenstock sandals are ubiquitous in the summer",
      "BERLIN -- Birkenstocks: they are ubiquitous in the summer, comfy and very German, come in many colors and shapes, look sometimes chic and sometimes shabby. But can these sandals be considered art?",
      "That's what Germany's Federal Court of Justice had to decide on Thursday, and it ruled they're just comfy footwear.",
      "Birkenstock, which is headquartered in Linz am Rhein in western Germany and says its tradition of shoemaking goes back to 1774, had filed a lawsuit against three competitors who sold sandals that were very similar to its own.",
      "The shoe manufacturer claimed its sandals \u201care copyright-protected works of applied art\" that may not simply be imitated. Under German law, works of art enjoy stronger and longer-last intellectual property protections than ordinary consumer products.",
      "The company asked for an injunction to stop its competitors from making copycat sandals and order them to recall and destroy those already on the market The defendant companies were not identified in the court statement.",
      "Before Germany's highest court for civil trials weighed in this Thursday, the case had been heard at two lower courts, which disagreed on the issue.",
      "A regional court in Cologne initially recognized the shoe models as works of applied art and granted the orders, Cologne's higher regional court later overturned the orders on appeal, German news agency dpa reported.",
      "The appeals court said it was unable to establish any artistic achievement in the wide-strapped sandals with the big buckle.",
      "On Thursday, the Federal Court of Justice sided with Cologne's higher regional court and dismissed the case. In its ruling, it wrote that a product can't be copyrighted if \"technical requirements, rules or other constraints determine the design.\"",

      "\u201cFor the copyright protection of a work of applied art \u2014 as for all other types of work \u2014 the level of design must not be too low,\u201d the court wrote. \u201cPurely technical creation using formal design elements is not eligible for copyright protection.

      "An idea first proposed on social media has bubbled up to the White House and received President Donald Trump\u2019s enthusiastic endorsement: Take some of the savings from billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s drive to cut government spending and return it to taxpayers",
      "WASHINGTON -- An idea first proposed on social media has bubbled up to the White House and received President Donald Trump's enthusiastic endorsement: Take some of the savings from billionaire Elon Musk's drive to cut government spending and return it to taxpayers.",
      "\u201cI love it,\u201d Trump said late Wednesday on Air Force One, when asked about the proposal.",
      "If Musk's target of $2 trillion in spending cuts is achieved by next year, supporters of the idea say that about one-fifth of those funds could be distributed to taxpaying households in checks of about $5,000.",
      "But before you start planning for a windfall, budget experts say such huge savings \u2014 nearly one-third of the federal government's annual spending \u2014 are highly unlikely. And sending out a round of checks \u2014 similar to the stimulus payments distributed by Trump and then President Joe Biden during the pandemic \u2014 could fuel inflation, economists warn, though White House officials dismiss that concern.",
      "With the annual budget deficit at $1.8 trillion last year and Trump proposing extensive tax cuts, there will also be significant pressure to use all the savings to reduce that deficit, rather than pass on part of it.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposal:",
      "James Fishback, founder of investment firm Azoria Partners which he launched at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, promoted the idea Tuesday on X, formerly known as Twitter, prompting Musk to respond that he would \u201ccheck with the president.\u201d Fishback said there have also been \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d conversations about the issue with White House officials.",
      "Musk has estimated that his Department of Government Efficiency has cut $55 billion so far \u2014 a tiny fraction of the $6.8 trillion federal budget. But DOGE\u2019s public statements so far haven't verified the presumed savings, and its claims that tens of millions of dead people are fraudulently receiving Social Security have been disproven.",
      "Fishback supports having the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determine how much DOGE saved. If DOGE cuts $500 billion by July 2026, he said, then the checks would be $1,250, rather than $5,000.",
      "\u201cWe uncovered enormous waste, fraud and abuse,\u201d Fishback said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd we are going to make good and pay restitution and then rewrite the social contract between the taxpayer and the federal government.\u201d",
      "Fishback supports sending out checks, rather than using all the money to reduce the deficit, because it would encourage Americans to seek out wasteful government spending \u201cin their communities, and report it to DOGE.\u201d",
      "OK, let\u2019s slow down. According to the proposal, DOGE must first complete its work, slated to be done by July 2026. Once that happens, one-fifth of any savings could be distributed later that year to the roughly 79 million households that pay income taxes. About 40% of Americans don\u2019t pay such taxes, so they wouldn\u2019t get a check.",
      "Color most economists and budget experts skeptical that its focus on \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse\u201d can actually reduce government spending by much. Budget-cutters from both parties have sought to eliminate \u201cwaste\u201d \u2014 which doesn't have much of a political constituency \u2014 for decades, with little success in reducing the deficit.",
      "One of the biggest moves by the Trump administration so far has been to fire tens of thousands of government workers, but such changes aren't likely to produce big savings.",
      "\u201cOnly a small share of total spending goes to federal employees,\u201d said Douglas Elmendorf, former director of the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cThe big money is in federal benefits and in federal taxes and those are not in DOGE\u2019s purview.\u201d",
      "In November, John DiIulio Jr., a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in an essay for the Brookings Institution that \"eliminating the entire federal civilian workforce would leave in place about 95% of all federal spending and the $34 trillion national debt.\u2019\u2019 DiIulio noted that government contractors and nonprofits that receive government funds now employ three times as many people as the federal government's 2.2 million employees.",
      "Trump and his economists blame Biden's $1,200 stimulus checks, distributed in the spring of 2021, for fueling the worst spike in inflation in four decades. Yet they maintain that sending checks stemming from reduced government spending wouldn't boost inflation.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said Thursday that since the money would have been spent by the government anyway, having it spent by consumers would be a wash. Biden and Trump's stimulus checks during the pandemic were deficit-financed, which can be more inflationary.",
      "But Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, and an economist in the Biden White House, said that more government checks are \u201cthe last thing we need economically right now.\u201d",
      "The U.S. unemployment rate is now much lower than in 2021, Tedeschi said, which means that businesses could struggle to hire enough workers to meet the additional demand created by a round of checks. Worker shortages can push up prices.",
      "Yet some Democrats agree with Hassett, but for different reasons.",
      "\"I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d be inflationary because I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d be big enough,\u2019\u2019 said Elaine Kamarck, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.",
      "Kamarck, who worked with Vice President Al Gore to cut government waste in the Clinton administration, dismissed the DOGE dividend as \u201cridiculous.\"",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no money there, and certainly not enough money to make a big contribution to taxpayers,\" she said. \u201cThe guy just says things,\" she added, referring to Musk."

      "Lammy was speaking to reporters after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov addressed other senior diplomats in a closed-door session at the G20 foreign ministers meeting in Johannesburg.",
      "\"I have to say when I listened to what the Russians and what Lavrov have just said in the chamber this afternoon, I don\u2019t see an appetite to really get to that peace,\u201d Lammy said.",
      "Lammy said Lavrov left his seat in the meeting room when it was Lammy's turn to speak. No details of Lavrov's speech were released.",
      "The two-day G20 gathering on Thursday and Friday comes days after landmark bilateral talks between the United States and Russia over ending the war in Ukraine. Those talks sidelined Washington\u2019s European allies and Ukraine, who weren\u2019t involved.",

      "In his own speech, which was released by the U.K. Foreign Office, Lammy criticized Russia for what he called \u201cTsarist imperialism.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou know, mature countries learn from their colonial failures and their wars, and Europeans have had much to learn over the generations and the centuries,\u201d Lammy said, according to the transcript from the U.K. Foreign Office. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid to say that Russia has learned nothing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was hoping to hear some sympathy for the innocent victims of the aggression. I was hoping to hear some readiness to seek a durable peace. What I heard was the logic of imperialism dressed up as a realpolitik, and I say to you all, we should not be surprised, but neither should we be fooled.\u201d",
      "Lammy referred to Lavrov's speech as \u201cthe Russian gentleman\u2019s tired fabrications.\u201d",

      "The United Kingdom, France, Germany and the European Union have all pledged continued support for Ukraine and were expected to reinforce that position at the G20 meeting.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who led those talks with Lavrov in Saudi Arabia this week, was a high-profile absentee from the meeting. Rubio boycotted amid U.S. tensions with host South Africa over some of its policies, which the Trump administration has labeled anti-American. The U.S. was represented by Dana Brown, its acting ambassador to South Africa.",
      "The G20 is made up of 19 of the world's major economies, the European Union and the African Union. Others attending the meeting in South Africa included EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, who repeated France's condemnation of Russia in an op-ed published by several media outlets.",
      "The Russian Foreign Ministry did release details of a bilateral meeting Lavrov held with China's Wang. Afterwards, Lavrov said Russia's relations with China \"have become and remain an increasingly significant factor in stabilizing the international situation and preventing it from sliding into total confrontation,\u201d according to a statement from the ministry.",
      "The G20 is supposed to bring developed and developing countries together to foster global cooperation. But the grouping often struggles to reach any meaningful consensus because of the disparate interests of the U.S., Europe, Russia and China. Cooperation was further undermined by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "South Africa holds the G20's rotating presidency this year and in a speech opening the meeting, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said that it was an opportunity for the G20 \u201cto engage in serious dialogue\u201d against a backdrop of geopolitical tensions and war, climate change, pandemics and energy and food insecurity.",

      "A judge has approved an emergency plan to keep Britain\u2019s largest water company afloat and averted a possible temporary government takeover",
      "LONDON -- A judge approved an emergency plan Tuesday to keep Britain\u2019s largest water company afloat, averting the possibility of a temporary government takeover.",
      "Thames Water, which serves 16 million customers in and around London, was seeking court approval for about 3 billion pounds ($3.8 billion) in rescue loans to prevent it from being nationalized when it runs out of cash next month.",
      "Justice Thomas Leech ruled in the High Court in London that the company's restructuring proposal was a better alternative for the public than having Thames Water become insolvent and come under government administration, or a competing plan by a small group of investors.",
      "\u201cThere is a public policy in favor of rescuing the Thames Water Group and giving the market a chance to agree a permanent restructuring plan before the government is forced to fund a special administrator,\" Leech said.",
      "Leech gave permission to appeal to the smaller group of creditors who had proposed a plan that they said would be cheaper and a member of Parliament pushing for a government takeover.",
      "Without the funding, Thames Water would run out of money next month, which could force the government to temporarily take the reins. Both the government and Thames Water said water would continue flowing to customers regardless of what happens.",
      "The decision was applauded by Thames Water Chairman Adrian Montague as a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d to strengthen the company's finances.",
      "Thames Water has been the focus of criticism from consumers and politicians who say the company was the author of its own misfortune, paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries and bonuses to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs.",
      "Company executives say the fault lies with regulators who kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of the cash it needed to fund improvements.",
      "Thames Water and the industry that manages water and wastewater services have been the subject of nationwide disgust and outrage over rampant sewage spills in rivers and along the coast.",
      "\u201cThis national scandal is a disaster for Thames Water billpayers and the environment,\" said Charles Watson, chairman of River Action, an environmental group. \u201cInstead of recognizing now is the time for a special administration of Thames Water, the decision saddles customers with the responsibility for funding billions of junk-rated debt while its executives, investors and shareholders escape responsibility.\"",
      "Ofwat, which regulates water companies in England and Wales, in December approved a 35% increase in Thames Water\u2019s consumer charges over the next five years. The company argued that bills needed to rise by 53% in order to finance needed projects and provide the financial returns necessary to attract investors.",
      "The company faces massive penalties for sewage discharges, including a fine of more than 100 million pounds ($126 million) by Ofwat in August for failing to manage its wastewater treatment.",
      "Leech had been considering competing proposals to provide credit to the cash-strapped utility \u2014 one from Thames Water and a second supported by a smaller group that claimed the company's plan was too expensive and favored bigger investors. Creditors holding most of the company\u2019s debt backed the company deal.",
      "Critics of the plan said the high interest rate \u2014 9.75% \u2014 would enrich creditors who are making the loans, a point noted by the judge.",
      "\u201cThe costs of finance and adviser fees in the present case are very high. Indeed, they might be described as eye-watering,\u201d Leech said. \u201c50% of the scheduled loans go round in a circle and back into the pockets of the plan creditors.\u201d",
      "Still, Leech said the alternative of government administration, which he said was preferable to the so-called Plan B, wasn't as attractive as the company plan.",
      "Charlie Maynard, a member of Parliament from the Liberal Democrat party who had argued in court for the government takeover, said he planned to appeal the ruling, insisting that the short-term bailout wasn't in the long-term interest.",
      "\u201cThis restructuring is simply throwing good money after bad,\" Maynard said. \u201cThe money from our bills which is being spent on interest repayments is desperately needed to repair water infrastructure, improve customer service and clean up our rivers.\u201d"

      "Dubbed the \u201cHurricane,\u201d the engine makes 420 horsepower in standard-output specification, more than the 5.7-liter V8 available in the old Charger. We also expect Dodge will follow it up later with a high-output engine making 550 horsepower.",
      "The Honda Prelude was a showcase of Honda design and engineering in the 1980s and 1990s. But after the 2001 model year, it disappeared from the automaker\u2019s lineup. A quarter of a century later, it\u2019s finally coming back.",
      "The all-new 2026 Honda Prelude will be a hybrid. We expect Honda will use the hybrid powertrain that it uses in the hybrid versions of the CR-V and Civic. Honda hasn\u2019t said how much power it will make or what kind of fuel economy you can expect. However, the Prelude will come with a Honda S+ Shift feature that the company says will make the it more fun to drive than your typical hybrid.",
      "With few exceptions, most electric SUVs are best driven on the pavement instead of off-road. Jeep plans to change that with the upcoming 2026 Recon, a bold and boxy EV with promising trail-rated off-roading capability and a similar open-air driving experience to a Wrangler.",
      "Jeep recently featured the Recon in a commercial starring Harrison Ford. Beyond that, however, the company has provided few details. We don\u2019t know how much range the Recon will have or how much it will cost. But we do know it will come with all-terrain tires, skid plates, a power-opening top, and removable windows and doors. And with trail guide maps embedded into the infotainment system and electronic locking axles, the Jeep Recon should be ready to rock on the path less traveled.",
      "Boasting one of the most appropriate vehicle names in history, the Ram Ramcharger is a full-size pickup truck equipped with electric motors and a battery pack. So far, that\u2019s just like a Ford F-150 Lightning. The trick is that it also has a gasoline-fueled V6 engine to eliminate the problem of range anxiety.",
      "Ram\u2019s range-extending powertrain solution sounds complex, but there is a simple explanation of how it works. When the battery is out of charge, the gas engine serves as a backup generator, allowing the Ramcharger to travel an estimated 690 miles before requiring electricity or gasoline to continue the journey. In theory, you can drive the Ramcharger without ever visiting an EV charging station, or you can skip traditional gas stations altogether.",
      "Better yet, there aren\u2019t any downsides when it comes to capability. Ram says the Ramcharger can tow up to 14,000 pounds and zoom to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds.",
      "Current Rivian trucks and SUVs are expensive, but the upcoming R2 SUV addresses that with a target price of $45,000. Smaller than the existing R1S but equipped with the same rugged, high-tech good looks, the Rivian R2 holds five people and travels more than 300 miles on a full battery. It comes with all-wheel drive and a healthy 9.8 inches of maximum ground clearance to help you out when going off-road.",
      "With rear vent windows and back glass that powers down into the tailgate, the Rivian R2 will give the Jeep Recon some competition. Just remember the R2\u2019s doors don\u2019t come off like the Recon\u2019s. As for timing, it should be available in the first half of 2026.",
      "We like these five upcoming models for their nostalgic appeal, technological innovation, or promise of fun no matter where you\u2019re going or what you\u2019re doing. At least one of them, the Jeep Recon, delivers all three of those traits.",

      "Johor in Malaysia is being transformed by the construction of giant data centers",
      "JOHOR BAHRU, Malaysia -- Winson Lau has always had contingency plans. But he wasn't prepared for data centers.",
      "Lau relies on water and electricity to operate his thriving export business in Malaysia\u2019s Johor province, where he raises a kaleidoscope of tropical fish in rows of aquariums, including albino fish with red spots that can fetch up to $10,000 from collectors. His contingency plans in the event of an outage involve an intricate system of purifying wastewater through friendly bacteria and an alarm system to quickly switch to backup power.",
      "But these measures can\u2019t compete with the gigantic, power-guzzling and thirsty data centers being built in Johor. The province is on track to have at least 1.6 gigawatts of data centers at any given moment from nearly nothing in 2019, making it the fastest-growing data center market in Southeast Asia, according to a report published in April.",
      "Data centers are large, windowless buildings filled with racks of computers that need lots of electricity. To prevent overheating, they rely on energy-intensive air conditioning systems using pumped water. Increasingly used by tech companies for running artificial intelligence systems, the power demand from future facilities in Malaysia may rise to over 5 gigawatts by 2035, according to researchers at Malaysia\u2019s Kenanga Investment Bank. This is more than half of Malaysia\u2019s entire renewable capacity in 2023.",
      "Over 95% of the energy available to Malaysia in 2022 was from fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. The country is now fifth-largest exporter of liquefied natural gas globally. And with planned renewable projects, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in September that the country was \u201cconfident of a surplus of energy\u201d to fuel large projects and keep exporting.",
      "But Lau doesn't fancy the chances of his homegrown business competing against the foreign-funded behemoths for energy. Even without data centers, Malaysia is susceptible to power interruptions because of storms, including one that lasted 30 minutes last year and killed 300,000 fish, costing Lau over $1 million. He worries that data centers would result in longer outages.",
      "To survive, he is moving to Thailand and already scouting potential locations for a new fish farm.",
      "\u201cBig data center is coming and there is shortage of power,\" he said. \"It\u2019ll be crazy.\u201d",
      "Malaysia is betting that potential economic growth from data centers justifies the risk. Once touted as an Asian tiger on the cusp of becoming rich, its industries shrunk in the late 1990s after the Asian financial crisis. It has since languished in the middle-income trap. Data centers, the government hopes, will modernize its economy and indirectly create thousands of high-paying jobs.",
      "But experts worry that Malaysia, and others like Vietnam, Indonesia and India vying for billion-dollar investments from tech giants, may be overstating data centers' transformative capabilities that also come at a price: Data centers gobble up land, water and electricity while creating far fewer jobs than they promise. Most data centers provide 30 to 50 permanent jobs while the larger ones create 200 jobs at most, according to a report by the American nonprofit Good Jobs First.",
      "Add to this the rapid increase in power and water use and some experts like Sofia Scasserra, who researches digital economies at the Amsterdam-based think tank Transnational Institute, said that tech companies exploiting resources in poorer countries while extracting data from their populations to get rich is akin to \u201cdigital colonialism.\u201d She compared data extraction to silver mining in Bolivia, which enriched colonial Spain but left nothing behind for Latin America.",
      "\u201cThey are extracting data in the same way. Data doesn\u2019t even leave (behind) taxes,\u201d she said.",
      "Indeed, only a small portion of Malaysia's data center capacity is actually for Malaysian users. Through a network of submarine cables that fans out into the world, they service East Asia, China and Europe. And the data centers themselves are run by foreign companies like America\u2019s Equinix and Microsoft as well as Chinese competitor GDS Holdings that works with tech giants like Alibaba.",
      "These data centers are also on the front lines of AI competition between the U.S. and China. Shortly before he left office, U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed new rules that would limit exports of advanced AI chips made by U.S. companies like Nvidia, part of a strategy to deprive China and other U.S. adversaries from gaining access to AI technology through data centers in places likes Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Although it\u2019s unclear if the Trump administration will retain the policy, which hasn\u2019t yet taken effect, GDS Holdings saw its stock drop more than 18% on the day of the announcement.",
      "For now, artificial intelligence is driving the hunger for even more data centers, with tech companies seeking out bigger \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 sites worldwide as a part of a \u201cglobal strategy,\u201d said Rangu Salgame, chairman and CEO of Singapore\u2019s Princeton Digital Group, which is building a 170-megawatt site in Johor. Data centers larger than 40 megawatt typically need land the size of seven football fields \u2014 about enough power for 36,000 American homes, according to data center service provider Stream Data Centers.",
      "That\u2019s costly to build in rich nations like the U.S., which over time has built more data centers than any other country but where land comes at a high price. Enter Malaysia, with its inexpensive land, excess power capacity and tax incentives. The country was the fastest growing data center market in Asia Pacific in the first half of 2024, according to global real estate firm Cushman and Wakefield. This makes Malaysia the eighth-largest data center market in terms of operations and the fifth-largest behind China, India, Japan and Australia when accounting for projects already in the pipeline.",
      "Globally Malaysia ranks 14th in terms of operational capacity \u2014 still smaller than Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin \u2014 but it is on track to be among the top 10 markets in five to seven years, according to Pritesh Swamy, who heads research on data centers in Asia for the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about a region that really grew at a pace that nowhere in the world has seen,\u201d Salgame said.",
      "Next door to Malaysia is Singapore, which paused the construction of new data centers in 2019. The moratorium was over concerns that the energy-guzzling infrastructure was straining the tiny country\u2019s limited resources. In 2019, data centers consumed 7% of the total electricity in the city-state that imports both power and water while aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. They have been trying to build data centers sustainably since 2022, when the moratorium ended.",
      "In the meantime, Malaysia has stepped in to fill the void, attracting investments of over $31 billion \u2014 three times the investments for 2023 \u2014 in the first 10 months of 2024, according to research by real estate firm Knight Frank. Johor already has 22 mostly foreign data centers spanning over 21 hectares, according to the research firm Baxtel. That's the equivalent of nearly 40 football fields, although not all of the data centers are operational.",
      "The data centers that are running look anonymous from the outside. But they can be identified by the tell-tale signs of barbed wire fences, CCTV cameras and patrolling security guards. Elsewhere, a thicket of cranes and workers operating construction machinery is transforming the landscape in the sleepy province.",
      "Salgame said that he hoped data centers could accelerate clean energy growth and experts like Putra Adhiguna of the Jakarta-based think tank Energy Shift Institute agreed that this could happen, but warned that the sheer volume of unforeseen, future demand complicates the transition.",
      "\u201cAdd data centers on top of that, it just becomes much more challenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Tropical Malaysia is warmer than the countries that were initially preferred by data centers, including Ireland, and would require more water and power for cooling, said Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist, a research company studying the unintended consequences of digital trends. He said that these companies are moving to new countries after their promises of economic growth were found to be \u201cempty.\" And while new solar or wind farms can be built faster than other forms of energy, data centers need a lot of electricity from the get-go.",
      "\u201cThese big tech companies are trying to distract you from the really simple math,\u201d he said.",
      "Malaysia acknowledges that the energy demand from data centers is \u201csubstantial\u201d but believes that Johor\u2019s rise as a \u201cdata center powerhouse\u201d will make it a \u201ckey player in Southeast Asia\u2019s digital ecosystem,\u201d said Malaysian Investment, Trade and Industry minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz in an email. He added that Malaysia was writing efficiency guidelines for data centers and has a policy to let them buy clean energy directly from producers.",
      "But concerns are rising among residents about potential water shortages in the future \u2014 echoing the concerns of other developing countries like Chile. Malaysia, like much of Southeast Asia, is at risk of extreme weather including drought, according to a 2022 U.N. climate change report. Francis Hutchinson, an analyst at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said that Johor has faced recent disruptions and new stressors, like a growing population and water parks to boost tourism, could exacerbate the crisis.",
      "\u201cWater, more than power, is a potential issue,\u201d he said.",

      "The finance minister's budget speech normally takes place in February. Parliament Speaker Thoko Didiza said it was the first time that the presentation had been canceled over such a disagreement in the 31 years of South Africa\u2019s democracy after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.",
      "South Africa has a 10-party coalition in government after the long-ruling African National Congress, or ANC, lost its majority in an election last year for the first time since apartheid ended. That means it cannot pass the budget without support from other parties in Parliament.",
      "The Democratic Alliance, the country\u2019s second biggest party, said the budget postponement was over a 2% increase in value-added tax proposed by the ANC. The DA said in a statement that the tax increase \u201cwould have broken the back of our economy.\u201d",
      "The budget delay came just over a week after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered U.S. aid and assistance to South Africa to be cut over a contentious land law. The move by Trump was expected to put pressure on South Africa\u2019s government to find funds to plug gaps, especially in the public health service. South Africa was already impacted by Trump\u2019s 90-day global freeze on U.S. aid.",

      "The letter notes China manufactured more than 1,000 ocean-going vessels in 2023, while the United States made fewer than 10 ships. It adds that the Chinese shipbuilding industry received more than $100 billion in government support from 2010 to 2018, such that Chinese shipyards accounted for the majority of worldwide orders last year.",
      "\u201cAs a shipyard worker myself, out of Bath Iron Works in Maine, I have seen firsthand the crippling impacts of China\u2019s predatory actions on our domestic shipbuilding industry,\u201d Brian Bryant, the machinists and aerospace workers union president, said in a separate statement. \u201cFor decades, we\u2019ve seen everything from layoffs to shipyard closures to atrophy of our domestic shipbuilding industrial base.",
      "Trump has made control of the Panama Canal and resetting the global terms of trade with tariffs a key priority.

      "The Office for National Statistics said inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, rose to 3% in the year to January, up from the equivalent 2.5% rate the month before.",
      "The spike, which took inflation further above the bank's target of 2%, was largely due to increases in airfares, food casts and private school fees in the wake of the new Labour government's decision to impose a sales tax.",

      "President Donald Trump says his administration will ensure a major natural gas pipeline in Alaska gets built",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Since his election, President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed support for a major natural gas pipeline in Alaska \u2014 comments that have drawn fresh attention to a project that's floundered for years despite support from state leaders.",
      "Trump mentioned the pipeline at a news conference with Japan\u2019s prime minister earlier this month, drawing praise from Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy and U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, both Republicans. As proposed, the nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline would funnel gas from Alaska\u2019s vast North Slope to port, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries.",
      "Critics, however, see this as a repackaged version of a decades-old effort that has struggled to gain traction. Hurdles include the cost \u2014 an estimated $44 billion for the pipeline and related infrastructure \u2014 competition from other projects and questions about its economic feasibility. One state senator said Alaska has put around $1 billion over the years into trying to get a pipeline built.",
      "It\u2019s natural gas that\u2019s been cooled to a liquid form for shipping and storage. Natural gas, a fossil fuel, is extracted from underground.",
      "The Alaska project calls for a pipeline from the gas fields of the North Slope to south-central Alaska. A liquefaction facility in Nikiski, southwest of Anchorage, would process and export the liquefied natural gas.",
      "Trump, following his election, said his administration would ensure the project gets built \u201cto provide affordable energy to Alaska and allies all over the world.\u201d He highlighted it as a priority in an Alaska-specific executive order aimed at spurring resource development he signed on his first day in office. And during a recent news conference with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan, Trump touted the Alaska project's relative proximity to that country and said there were talks \u201cabout a joint venture of some type.\u201d He did not elaborate.",
      "Japan's Foreign Ministry, in a statement, said the meeting between the leaders \u201cwas carried out in a way that would be beneficial to both sides and confirmed that the two nations will cooperate bilaterally toward strengthening energy security, including increasing LNG exports to Japan.\u201d It did not specifically reference the Alaska project.",
      "Trump was a booster of the project during his first term. In 2017, he was there for the signing in Beijing of an agreement between then-Alaska Gov. Bill Walker and representatives of Chinese companies that called for the parties to work together on elements of the project. That effort ultimately fizzled: Walker, an independent, left office in 2018, and his successor, Dunleavy, took the project in a different direction. The project has a history of new governors taking a different tack than their predecessors; Walker did it, too.",
      "Walker called Trump\u2019s recent actions significant: \u201cWhat he has done is a tremendous boost to the awareness of the project worldwide.\u201d",
      "Currently, there is no way to bring Alaska's large gas reserves to market. The focus for decades by major companies on the North Slope has been on producing more profitable oil. The 800-mile (1,280-kilometer) trans-Alaska oil pipeline \u2014 which began operating in 1977 \u2014 is the state's economic lifeline. Gas that occurs with deposits of oil is reinjected into the fields.",
      "Changing markets and costs have been major obstacles, too.",
      "State leaders are facing the likelihood that Alaska could have to import gas to help meet the needs of its most populous region due to production constraints in the aging Cook Inlet basin in south-central Alaska, hundreds of miles (kilometers) from the North Slope. Cook Inlet is Alaska's oldest producing oil and gas basin, dating to the 1950s.",
      "Even a year ago, the idea of importing gas was widely seen by lawmakers as a humiliating possibility. But it's now being met with resignation and hopes by some that it might simply be a short-term solution until a gas line is built.",
      "Alaska House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, a Republican, said Alaskans \u201cneed to be hopeful\" and cautioned against negative thinking.",
      "\u201cWe need to watch how we talk because it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and an energy project of this size, if it was successful, would be transformative to the economic security of our state,\u201d he said.",
      "Roger Marks, an oil and gas economist in Alaska, said he can't see the pipeline project happening and said more energy should be devoted to preparing for possible imports. \u201cCreating these false expectations has just been a big distraction from what needs to be done,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Johor in Malaysia is being transformed by the construction of giant data centers",
      "JOHOR BAHRU, Malaysia -- Winson Lau has always had contingency plans. But he wasn't prepared for data centers.",
      "Lau relies on water and electricity to operate his thriving export business in Malaysia\u2019s Johor province. His contingency plans in the event of an outage involve an intricate system of purifying wastewater through friendly bacteria and an alarm system to quickly switch to backup power.",
      "But these measures can\u2019t compete with the gigantic, power-guzzling and thirsty data centers being built in Johor. The province is on track to have at least 1.6 gigawatts of data centers at any given moment from nearly nothing in 2019, making it the fastest-growing data center market in Southeast Asia, according to a report published in April.",
      "Data centers are large, windowless buildings filled with racks of computers that need lots of electricity. To prevent overheating, they rely on energy-intensive air conditioning systems using pumped water. Increasingly used by tech companies for running artificial intelligence systems, the power demand from future facilities in Malaysia may rise to over 5 gigawatts by 2035, according to researchers at Malaysia\u2019s Kenanga Investment Bank. This is more than half of Malaysia\u2019s entire renewable capacity in 2023.",
      "Over 95% of the energy available to Malaysia in 2022 was from fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. The country is now fifth-largest exporter of liquefied natural gas globally. And with planned renewable projects, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in September that the country was \u201cconfident of a surplus of energy\u201d to fuel large projects and keep exporting.",
      "But Lau doesn't fancy the chances of his homegrown business competing against the foreign-funded behemoths for energy. To survive, he is moving to Thailand and already scouting potential locations for a new fish farm.",
      "\u201cBig data center is coming and there is shortage of power,\" he said. \"It\u2019ll be crazy.\u201d",
      "Malaysia is betting that potential economic growth from data centers justifies the risk. Once touted as an Asian tiger on the cusp of becoming rich, its industries shrunk in the late 1990s after the Asian financial crisis. It has since languished in the middle-income trap. Data centers, the government hopes, will modernize its economy and indirectly create thousands of high-paying jobs.",
      "But experts worry that Malaysia, and others like Vietnam, Indonesia and India vying for billion-dollar investments from tech giants, may be overstating data centers' transformative capabilities that also come at a price: Data centers gobble up land, water and electricity while creating far fewer jobs than they promise. Most data centers provide 30 to 50 permanent jobs while the larger ones create 200 jobs at most, according to a report by the American nonprofit Good Jobs First.",
      "Add to this the rapid increase in power and water use and some experts like Sofia Scasserra, who researches digital economies at the Amsterdam-based think tank Transnational Institute, said that tech companies exploiting resources in poorer countries while extracting data from their populations to get rich is akin to \u201cdigital colonialism.\u201d She compared data extraction to silver mining in Bolivia, which enriched colonial Spain but left nothing behind for Latin America.",
      "\u201cThey are extracting data in the same way. Data doesn\u2019t even leave (behind) taxes,\u201d she said.",
      "For now, artificial intelligence is driving the hunger for even more data centers, with tech companies seeking out bigger \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 sites worldwide as a part of a \u201cglobal strategy,\u201d said Rangu Salgame, chairman and CEO of Singapore\u2019s Princeton Digital Group, which is building a 170-megawatt site in Johor. Data centers larger than 40 megawatt typically need land the size of seven football fields \u2014 about enough power for 36,000 American homes, according to data center service provider Stream Data Centers.",
      "That\u2019s costly to build in rich nations like the U.S., which over time has built more data centers than any other country but where land comes at a high price. Enter Malaysia, with its inexpensive land, excess power capacity and tax incentives. The country was the fastest growing data center market in Asia Pacific in the first half of 2024, according to global real estate firm Cushman and Wakefield. This makes Malaysia the eighth-largest data center market in terms of operations and the fifth-largest behind China, India, Japan and Australia when accounting for projects already in the pipeline.",
      "Globally Malaysia ranks 14th in terms of operational capacity \u2014 still smaller than Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin \u2014 but it is on track to be among the top 10 markets in five to seven years, according to Pritesh Swamy, who heads research on data centers in Asia for the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about a region that really grew at a pace that nowhere in the world has seen,\u201d Salgame said.",
      "Next door to Malaysia is Singapore, which paused the construction of new data centers in 2019. The moratorium was over concerns that the energy-guzzling infrastructure was straining the tiny country\u2019s limited resources. In 2019, data centers consumed 7% of the total electricity in the city-state that imports both power and water while aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. They have been trying to build data centers sustainably since 2022, when the moratorium ended.",
      "In the meantime, Malaysia has stepped in to fill the void, attracting investments of over $31 billion \u2014 three times the investments for 2023 \u2014 in the first 10 months of 2024, according to research by real estate firm Knight Frank. Johor already has 22 mostly foreign data centers spanning over 21 hectares, according to the research firm Baxtel. That's the equivalent of nearly 40 football fields, although not all of the data centers are operational.",
      "Salgame said that he hoped data centers could accelerate clean energy growth and experts like Putra Adhiguna of the Jakarta-based think tank Energy Shift Institute agreed that this could happen, but warned that the sheer volume of unforeseen, future demand complicates the transition.",
      "\u201cAdd data centers on top of that, it just becomes much more challenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Tropical Malaysia is warmer than the countries that were initially preferred by data centers, including Ireland, and would require more water and power for cooling, said Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist, a research company studying the unintended consequences of digital trends. He said that these companies are moving to new countries after their promises of economic growth were found to be \u201cempty.\" And while new solar or wind farms can be built faster than other forms of energy, data centers need a lot of electricity from the get-go.",
      "\u201cThese big tech companies are trying to distract you from the really simple math,\u201d he said.",
      "Malaysia acknowledges that the energy demand from data centers is \u201csubstantial\u201d but believes that Johor\u2019s rise as a \u201cdata center powerhouse\u201d will make it a \u201ckey player in Southeast Asia\u2019s digital ecosystem,\u201d said Malaysian Investment, Trade and Industry minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz in an email. He added that Malaysia was writing efficiency guidelines for data centers and has a policy to let them buy clean energy directly from producers.",

      "Tapestry said Wednesday that selling the brand would enable the fashion company to focus on sustaining the growth of Coach, while reinvigorating sales at Kate Spade. Meanwhile Caleres said that buying Stuart Weitzman would help accelerate sales, with the luxury brand being the lead label in its portfolio.

      "AG Ken Paxon filed a lawsuit in December in state district court and on Thursday added a filing that seeks a court order requiring gender screening for athletes and an injunction intended to prevent the NCAA from \u201cfalsely and deceptively claiming that only biological women may participate in female-specific competitions.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, the NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes, limiting competition in women's sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth.

      "Over the past year, transgender athletes have become a target of critics who say their participation in women\u2019s sports is unfair and a potential safety risk. The topic became a major talking point in Trump\u2019s re-election campaign even though there is believed to be a very small number of transgender athletes; NCAA President Charlie Baker in December said he knew of only 10 transgender athletes out of more than 500,000 across the NCAA.",

      "It began in 2009 with a half-dozen schools searching for a way to incorporate elements of those two well-known disciplines \u2014 gymnastics and cheerleading \u2014 into a showcase for female athletes. Acro, which operates in a similar space with a more traditional cheerleading-centric approach called STUNT, has become one of the fastest-growing collegiate sports in the country.",
      "Membership in the National Collegiate Acrobatics and Tumbling Association has risen from 14 teams a decade ago to over 50 schools representing over 1,200 athletes, including Duquesne, which made its debut earlier this month. The NCAA labeled \u201cacro\u201d an emerging sport in 2020. There's a chance it could be considered for NCAA championship status as early as the 2027-28 academic year.",
      "On the surface, acro's ascension seems sudden and perhaps in lockstep with a spike in interest in women's sports. The reality is it has been hiding in plain sight all along.",
      "There are currently more than 3 million girls participating in cheerleading or gymnastics (or both) in the United States. Only a small fraction, however, move on to compete collegiately.",

A few months before graduation, Gannon \u2014 a small private school in Erie, Pennsylvania \u2014 reached out to see if Soper wanted to become part of its fledgling program.",
      "\u201cI kind of thought it was a hoax,\u201d said Soper. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was real because I hadn\u2019t heard of it before.\u201d",
      "She brushed aside her initial skepticism, in part because Gannon made her feel like \u201csomebody actually wants me.\u201d Soper fell in love with the team aspect of a sport that requires trust above all else.",
      "It was much the same for McDermott, by far the most experienced athlete on the Duquesne roster after four years at Glenville State in West Virginia. She's embraced becoming a de facto assistant coach and sounding board for her freshmen-laden team. It wasn't always that way.",
      "\u201cLearning to rely on someone else (in acro) was a big challenge, a big change for me,\" said McDermott. \"But doing it for the person next to me and not just myself really makes me work like 10 times harder.\u201d",
      "It also provided McDermott with an unexpected benefit: improved mental health. She was a gymnast for 15 years before getting into acro. She loved it, sure. Yet it was also an unforgiving and sometimes monotonous grind. Acro provided a jolt.",
      "\u201cGetting to learn a whole new sport, it was frustrating at times,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was also awesome. Just like on my body, my mind. Everything was so nice and refreshing.\u201d",
      "There are a handful of specific roles on each team, with every athlete wearing a number. \u201cBases\u201d provide support through lifts or by doing backbends that allow teammates to stand on their stomachs (yes, really) while creating pyramids. \u201cTops\u201d can be lifted as high as 10-15 feet in the air and then dismount by flipping or twisting into the arms of \u201cback spots\" (like something you might see at a football game). Tumblers somersault their way from one end of the mat to the other, sometimes in synchronicity with each other.",
      "Meets are broken down into six events. The first five \u2014 compulsory, acro, pyramid, toss and tumbling \u2014 consist of multiple heats, with each heat requiring different elements. Most include at least one member of the team counting out \u201cone, two, three, four\u201d drill sergeant-style to create a tempo designed to keep everyone on time.",
      "Each routine is assigned a specific start value based on its difficulty, with a max of 10.0 like in college gymnastics. The scores are added up as the meet goes along and teams go one at a time, giving it a kind of ebb and flow you might find in a traditional \u201cball\u201d sport.",
      "It ends with the team event, in which 24 athletes spend nearly 3 minutes showcasing the skills highlighted throughout the meet, all of it set to music, not unlike competitive cheerleading.",
      "On the surface, it's a lot. Duquesne did its best during its first-ever meet on Feb. 7 against Gannon, offering a video tutorial between every event to the hundreds in the stands, a mixture of students, alumni and families with young children.",
      "Against a nonstop backbeat of up-tempo music (think Beyonce), the schools went back and forth, every routine ending with hugs and high-fives regardless of the result. Gannon, runner-up to NCATA national champion Baylor last spring, led through four events before the Dukes surged ahead after the tumbling portion.",
      "When Duquesne finished off its inaugural win with a rousing shout of \u201cGo Dukes!\u201d during the team event, Soper \u2014 sporting a red blazer and high heels \u2014 raced to celebrate with the group she reminds regularly is making history one routine at a time.",
      "Maybe some of them didn't know what acro was before Soper approached them. They only knew they didn't want their athletic careers to end, and acro allowed them to pivot.",
      "It's not gymnastics. It's not cheerleading. And it's definitely not the circus.",
      "It is something new. Something uniquely theirs.",
      "\u201cHere you're still able to find a home for yourself and a home that supports and accepts you regardless of what you look like, how talented you are,\u201d Soper said. \u201cThere's going to be a place on the team for athletes that love the sport and are passionate about it.\u201d",

      "He was fined more than 10,000 euros ($10,400) in Audiencia Nacional court and ordered not to get within 200 meters of Hermoso or communicating with her for a year.",
      "Rubiales was cleared of the charge of coercion for trying to downplay the kiss on the lips of Hermoso during the awards ceremony after the final in Sydney. The kiss sparked outrage in Spain and marred the celebrations of Spain\u2019s first Women's World Cup title.",

      "Rubiales and the other defendants said they never tried to pressure Hermoso into doing anything. They claimed she didn't give any importance to the kiss when it happened.",
      "Rubiales resigned under pressure three weeks after the scandal surfaced and was banned by FIFA for three years. He had said he was the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by \u201cfalse feminists.\u201d",
      "During his testimony he said he regretted the kiss because it wasn't the right attitude for a national federation president. He said it should not be considered sexual assault, though.",
      "The kiss prompted widespread outrage in society beyond soccer, and ignited one of the most embarrassing scandals in the history of Spanish soccer.",

      "Kevin Durant went back to the Bay Area last weekend",
      "Kevin Durant went back to the Bay Area last weekend. He's now going back to school.",
      "A nostalgic time for Phoenix's All-Star forward continues Thursday, when Durant and the Suns play San Antonio in Austin, Texas \u2014 a home game for the Spurs and a homecoming for Durant, since the game brings him back to where he played his one college season with the Longhorns.",
      "\u201cIt does mean a lot to me,\u201d Durant said. \u201cI\u2019m excited that we get to go back to play a regular-season game there. Austin is a place where I kind of started this journey, and to have so many friends and family that are still there from, what, 16, 17 years ago is pretty sweet. So, I appreciate the NBA for setting this up. This is a unique time.\u201d",
      "Durant\u2019s lone season in Austin was 2006-07, and he was college basketball\u2019s best player that year. He averaged 25.8 points and 11.1 rebounds, finishing the season ranked fourth nationally in both of those categories on his way to being selected as player of the year by The Associated Press and a number of other outlets.",
      "He declared for the draft after that season, went No. 2 overall to Seattle in 2007 and the accolades keep piling up. Durant is the only men's player in USA Basketball history to win four Olympic gold medals, he won two championships with Golden State \u2014 returning to the Bay this past weekend after being selected as an All-Star for the 15th time \u2014 and just became the eighth player in NBA history to eclipse the 30,000-point mark.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an awesome opportunity for himself \u2014 and for the city of Austin to come out and support one of our great players who is still in the prime of his career right now,\" Texas coach Rodney Terry said. \"He's scored over 30,000 points, he's one of the all-time scorers at the next level, one of the all-time scorers at the collegiate level. But to have an opportunity come back where you played collegiately, to play a professional game against one of the best organizations in all of professional sports in the Spurs, you can\u2019t ask for a better scenario.\u201d",
      "This is the third consecutive season where the Spurs have played two home games in Austin, about 75 miles northeast of San Antonio. The Spurs see Austin as part of a mega-region that they've been cultivating for years, even stretching into Mexico \u2014 and this year's home games help break up the annual rodeo road trip. The San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo typically sends the Spurs on the road for much of February, so this year's games in Austin break up that window.",
      "The Spurs also play in Austin on Friday against Detroit. The Suns got to Austin on Tuesday and one of Durant's first stops was the Longhorns' practice.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to try to roam around the city a little bit,\u201d Durant said this past weekend when asked if he had plans to check out some of his favorite places in Austin. \u201cI don\u2019t have a set schedule, but I\u2019ve got some stuff I want to see.\u201d",
      "Austin is very much a Spurs town; the team's G League affiliate plays there and plenty of fans at the Moody Center on Thursday and Friday will surely be wearing Victor Wembanyama jerseys. But there's going to be a slew of Texas jerseys and Durant garb visible in the crowd on Thursday, for good reason.",
      "\u201cTo have him come back here and be here this week and be around our guys and see our guys, I mean, you can\u2019t ask for anything better than that,\" Terry said. \"A lot of our guys' favorite player is Kevin Durant. Why they chose to come to Texas was Kevin Durant. He's had an incredible impact not only on our basketball program but also on our athletic program as a whole. He\u2019s an incredible ambassador for Texas athletics.\u201d",

      "Salah tucked away with his league-leading 24th goal of the campaign to put Liverpool ahead at Villa Park in the 29th minute, only for the leaders to fall behind by halftime following a volley by Youri Tielemans and a header from Ollie Watkins.",
      "Alexander-Arnold ran onto an inside pass from Salah and drove in a shot that deflected past Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez in the 61st as Liverpool salvaged a point, avoiding what would have been just a second league defeat of the season.",
      "Liverpool has now played a game more than second-place Arsenal, which appears to be the only other realistic challenger for the title, and has another tough away game on Sunday at Manchester City.",
      "Liverpool is seeking a 20th top-flight championship to tie the record of Manchester United.",
      "Salah is spearheading Liverpool's title charge. Not only is the Egypt forward the league's top scorer, with five more than nearest challenger Erling Haaland of Manchester City, he has more assists than anyone else with 15.",
      "Should Arsenal wind up reeling in Liverpool, the Reds may regret a big miss from Darwin Nunez after the Uruguay striker came on as a substitute. Dominik Szoboszlai ran through a squared the ball to Nunez, who had an open goal at which to aim with a left-footed shot.",
      "Nunez blazed the finish high and wide, with Liverpool manager Arne Slot barely believing what he had seen on the touchline.",
      "While drawing at Villa isn't a bad result in normal circumstances, it still means Liverpool has dropped points in back-to-back midweek games \u2014 after a 2-2 draw at local rival Everton last Wednesday.",
      "Arsenal plays first out of the top two at the weekend \u2014 at home to West Ham on Saturday \u2014 and has the chance to trim the lead to five points before Liverpool meets City.",

      "Nate Oats doesn't have much time to process what went wrong with Alabama's loss to top-ranked Auburn.",
      "Not with what awaits the fourth-ranked Crimson Tide.",
      "The loss to the rival Tigers in a 1-vs-2 matchup started a run of seven straight games against ranked opponents to close the regular-season schedule, a withering stretch even by the such-is-life standards of an Southeastern Conference with nine ranked teams. It continues with Wednesday's trip to No. 15 Missouri and Saturday's visit from No. 17 Kentucky to headline the AP Top 25 national schedule.",
      "\u201cIt's not an easy stretch, the last seven games, is probably the hardest seven-game stretch of anybody in the country at any point,\u201d Oats told reporters after the Auburn loss.",
      "\u201cWe've got three home games and three road games left in the last six games of the year. And we've got to bring it.\u201d",
      "Oats is right: no other ranked team has a remaining schedule quite like the Tide.",
      "After this week, Alabama (21-4, 10-2) hosts No. 21 Mississippi State, visits No. 6 Tennessee, hosts No. 2 Florida and then returns the trip to Auburn.",
      "As of Monday afternoon, only one team \u2014 No. 14 Michigan State \u2014 had as many as five ranked teams left on its schedule. In fact, 21 teams in the latest AP Top 25 poll had three or fewer remaining games against ranked opponents.",
      "Or, to put it another way: Alabama has more ranked opponents ahead than No. 3 Duke, No. 10 St. John's, No. 11 Wisconsin, No. 13 Purdue, No. 16 Marquette, No. 18 Clemson, No. 22 Memphis and No. 25 Louisville have combined (four).",
      "Alabama earned the No. 2 overall seed during Saturday's preliminary rankings from the committee that selects the NCAA Tournament's 68-team field. And that schedule resonated with committee chairman Bubba Cunningham when asked about what could come for Alabama.",

      "The Aggies (20-5, 9-3 SEC) rose one spot in Monday's poll to hit the highest mark of the Buzz Williams era, as well as the program's highest ranking since sitting at No. 5 on Christmas Day in 2017.",
      "Michigan State has its own doubleheader against ranked teams this week, including the latest meeting with its instate rival.",
      "The Spartans (20-5, 11-3 Big Ten) host No. 13 Purdue on Tuesday before visiting No. 12 Michigan on Friday. Michigan State won both meetings with Michigan last year, the first season sweep in the series since the Spartans took all three meetings in 2019.",
      "Round 2 of that rivalry comes with the Wolverines visiting East Lansing in the March 9 regular-season finale.",
      "No. 5 Houston is positioned to win the Big 12's regular-season race with a strong finish. The Cougars can clear a significant hurdle with Saturday's visit from No. 8 Iowa State after visiting Arizona State.",
      "The Cougars (21-1, 13-1) entered the week two games up in the loss column on No. 9 Texas Tech and No. 19 Arizona, with the Red Raiders having handed Houston its only league loss this year.",
      "Those teams, by the way, have a rematch at Texas Tech next Monday.",
      "New Mexico was the top vote-getter among unranked teams in Monday's poll. The Lobos (22-4, 14-1 Mountain West Conference) play only once this week, visiting Boise State on Wednesday.",
      "Next up is Saint Mary's, which could lock up the regular-season race in the West Coast Conference. The Gaels (23-4, 13-1) host Portland on Wednesday before visiting second-place Gonzaga (20-7, 11-3) on Saturday.",

      "Bobby Hull's widow says the Hall of Famer and two-time NHL MVP who helped the Chicago Blackhawks win the 1961 Stanley Cup had chronic traumatic encephalopathy when he died two years ago",
      "CHICAGO -- Bobby Hull, the Hall of Fame forward and two-time NHL MVP who helped the Chicago Blackhawks win the Stanley Cup in 1961, had chronic traumatic encephalopathy when he died two years ago, his widow said in a statement released on Wednesday.",
      "Researchers at Boston University\u2019s CTE Center found that Hull had stage 2 CTE when he died in 2023. He was 84.",
      "Hull struggled with short-term memory loss and impaired judgment over his final decade. He chose to donate his brain after seeing former teammate and fellow Hall of Famer Stan Mikita decline late in his life.",
      "\u201cSeeing the pain and heartache suffered by his lifetime friend Stan Mikita\u2019s family, Bobby felt strongly no other family should have to endure CTE,\u201d Deborah Hull, his wife of 39 years, said in a statement. \u201cHe insisted on donating his brain, feeling as though it was his duty to help advance research on this agonizing disease.\u201d",
      "Nicknamed \u201cThe Golden Jet\u201d for his speed and blond hair, Hull was one of the most prolific forwards in NHL history, scoring 610 times over 16 seasons with Chicago, Hartford and Winnipeg. He dazzled generations of Blackhawks fans with his shooting and skating skills and remains the franchise's career leader with 604 goals. Hull also had 303 goals while playing for the Jets in the World Hockey Association for seven seasons.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful to Bobby Hull and all of the NHL players and families who are helping us learn how to prevent, diagnose, and treat CTE,\u201d said Dr. Ann McKee, director of the Boston University CTE Center. \u201cWe encourage retired players and their families to reach out for help and care if they are concerned about CTE, as we are learning how to effectively treat symptoms, especially in mid-life.\u201d",
      "The National Hockey League Players\u2019 Association announced in November it was forming an advisory committee to help hockey players better understand CTE and the damage that concussions can do to the brain. In December, researchers at Boston University published a study of deceased male hockey players that showed 18 of the 19 NHL players examined \u2014 including Hull, Mikita, Ralph Backstrom, Bob Probert, and Derek Boogaard \u2014 had CTE. It also found the odds of developing CTE increased by 34% for each year of hockey played.",
      "A degenerative brain disease, CTE has been identified in athletes and military combat veterans who sustained concussions or repeated blows to the head. It can be diagnosed only posthumously through an examination of the brain.",

      "Novak Djokovic says a majority of tennis players have lost faith in the anti-doping authorities following Jannik Sinner\u2019s three-month ban, and there\u2019s a widespread feeling that \u201cfavoritism\u201d is being shown to the sport\u2019s biggest stars",
      "DOHA, Qatar -- Novak Djokovic says a majority of tennis players have lost faith in the anti-doping authorities following Jannik Sinner's three-month ban, and there's a widespread feeling that \u201cfavoritism\u201d is being shown to the sport's biggest stars.",
      "The 24-time major winner called on the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Tennis Integrity Agency to overhaul their processes for dealing with doping cases \u201cbecause the system and the structure obviously doesn't work.\u201d",
      "\u201cRight now there is a lack of trust generally from the tennis players, both male and female, toward WADA and ITIA and the whole process,\u201d Djokovic said at the Qatar Open.",
      "Top-ranked Sinner reached a deal with WADA on Saturday to accept a ban that will have him back playing in time for the French Open in May without having to miss a single Grand Slam tournament. That came after the International Tennis Integrity Agency had decided not to suspend Sinner for what it judged was accidental contamination by a banned anabolic steroid last March.",
      "The short ban for Sinner came after five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek accepted a one-month suspension in November after testing positive for a banned substance that she said was accidentally consumed because of a contaminated nonprescription medication. Both bans are much shorter than what other athletes in tennis and in other sports have normally received in similar cases.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a good image for our sport, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Djokovic, the long-time No. 1 in men's tennis, said. \u201cThere\u2019s a majority of the players that I\u2019ve talked to in the locker room, not just in the last few days, but also last few months, that are not happy with the way this whole process (for Sinner) has been handled.",
      "\"A majority of the players don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s fair. A majority of the players feel like there is favoritism happening. It appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers and whatnot.\u201d",
      "Sinner had been scheduled to play in Qatar before accepting the ban.",
      "The handling of Sinner\u2019s case had already raised questions about double standards, and when the ban was announced it was widely criticized by other players. The positive tests weren\u2019t publicly revealed until August because Sinner successfully appealed against being provisionally banned from playing. He then won the U.S. Open in September and the Australian Open in January.",
      "Sinner\u2019s explanation for the positive test was that trace amounts of Clostebol in his doping sample was due to a massage from a trainer who used the substance after cutting his own finger, which WADA accepted.",
      "Djokovic said he didn't question Sinner's and Swiatek's innocence but that he and other players are frustrated about the inconsistent handling of doping cases.",
      "He pointed to the case of former women's No. 1 Simona Halep \u2014 who was given a four-year ban by the ITIA in 2022 after a positive test before it was later reduced to nine months \u2014 and British player Tara Moore, who was suspended in May 2022 while an investigation lasted 18 months before an independent tribunal determined that her positive test for a banned substance was caused by contaminated meat.",
      "\u201cRight now it\u2019s a ripe time for us to really address the system, because the system and the structure obviously doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s obvious,\" Djokovic said. \u201cSo, I hope that in the ... near future that the governing bodies are going to come together of our tours and the tennis ecosystem and try to find a more effective way to to deal with these processes.\"",

    "story": [
      "A bill to ban the sale of so-called lab-grown meat might seem like a no-brainer in Nebraska, where beef is king",
      "LINCOLN, Neb. -- The prospect of banning the sale of so-called lab-grown meat might seem like a no-brainer in Nebraska, where beef is king, but some of the proposal's staunchest opposition has come from ranchers and farming groups who say they can compete without the government\u2019s help.",
      "Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen \u2014 one of the largest pork producers in the country \u2014 is behind the push to ban cultivated meat, saying he wants to protect ranchers and meat producers. The Republican governor signed an executive order last August to keep state agencies and contractors from procuring lab-created meat, even though it could be years before such products are on store shelves.",
      "A number of ranchers and meat industry groups are pushing back on the governor's plan.",
      "Dan Morgan is a fourth-generation cattle rancher from central Nebraska who supplies high-end beef to all 50 states and six countries. He welcomes companies seeking to produce lab-grown meat to \u201cjump into the pool\u201d and try to compete with his Waygu beef. Stifling competition in a free market should be anathema in a Republican-dominated state like Nebraska, he said.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like a bunch of right-wing Republicans echoing a bunch of left-wing Democrats,\u201d he said, adding that the government should be limited to regulating the new product's labels and inspecting its facilities to ensure food safety.",
      "\u201cAfter that, it's up to the consumer to make the decision about what they buy and eat.\u201d",
      "Nebraska is among about a dozen states that have introduced measures to ban the manufacture, sale or distribution of lab-grown products, according to . Two states \u2014 Florida and Alabama \u2014 have already enacted such bans.",
      "The target of the bills is \u201ccell-cultivated\u201d or \u201ccell-cultured\u201d meat, which is grown from the cells of animals in bioreactor steel tanks. The cells are bathed for weeks in nutrients, prompting them to grow and divide, turning them into skeletal muscle, fat and connective tissues.",
      "The push to ban cultivated meat comes well before the innovation could be considered an industry. While more than two dozen companies are working to develop such meat products, only two \u2014 Upside Foods and Good Meat, both based in California \u2014 have been approved by the federal government to sell cultivated chicken in the U.S. Even then, none of the companies are close to mass producing and selling the products on store shelves.",
      "In recent weeks, supporters of the Nebraska bill have shifted their arguments from industry protection to questions of safety surrounding cell-cultured meat. That includes its sponsor, state Sen. Barry DeKay, a Nebraska rancher, and Sherry Vinton, the director of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. Both testified in support of the bill at a committee hearing earlier this week, calling cultured meat \u201csynthetic food\u201d and voicing concern about possible health implications from eating it.",
      "But it's been no secret that the push for a ban is rooted in shielding Nebraska's traditional meat industry. Nebraska tops all other states for beef production and beef exports, according to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture.",
      "Pillen named the ban among his top priorities during his State of the State address last month.",
      "\u201cThe backers of these products are cut from the same cloth as the anti-farmer activists who want to put our agriculture producers out of business, and we need to recognize them as such,\u201d he said.",
      "The Association for Meat, Poultry and Seafood Innovation, the lobbying group for the emerging cultured meat industry, disputes Pillen's insistence that it's a threat to the traditional meat industry, noting studies that show global demand for meat-based protein will double by 2050.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really a complementary component here,\u201d said Suzi Gerber, executive director of the association. \u201cSo it\u2019s a little bit mystifying to me why any individual stakeholder would see this as a threat.\u201d",
      "Several farm organizations, including Nebraska Farm Bureau, Nebraska Cattlemen and the Nebraska Pork Producers, agree they're not worried about competition from the emerging industry. Those groups prefer a sister bill that would only require they be clearly labeled as lab-grown products to separate them from traditional meat. More than a dozen states have also issued similar labeling bills, and some \u2014 like Colorado \u2014 have seen ban efforts abandoned in favor of labeling measures.",
      "Paul Sherman is an attorney with the Institute for Justice, which is representing Upside Foods in its lawsuit challenging the Florida ban. He said it's no surprise most of the proposed bans are being pushed by those with connections to traditional agriculture.",
      "\u201cI think it certainly shows that the purpose of these laws isn\u2019t about protecting public health and safety,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about protecting traditional agriculture from economic competition. And that is not a legitimate use of government power.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 23:14:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients bring their own blood or choose their own donor for medical procedures under legislation gaining momentum in Utah",
    "story": [
      "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients bring their own blood or choose their own donor for medical procedures under legislation gaining momentum in Utah",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah may soon loosen its B.Y.O.B. rules, but not in the way some might hope. The acronym has taken on a new meaning in the state Legislature: \u201cBring Your Own Blood.\u201d",
      "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients use their own blood for procedures or choose their own donor under a bill that passed the state House with unanimous support Wednesday, despite concerns from the American Red Cross.",
      "Directed donations, which typically involve a patient\u2019s friend or family member giving blood for their procedure, are allowed under federal law. But the requests undergo a rigorous screening process that the bill's sponsor, an outspoken opponent of vaccines, said does not give patients enough personal choice in their medical decisions.",
      "Hospitals and blood collectors like the American Red Cross currently have broad discretion to decide whether it's safe and feasible for a patient to use their own blood or that of a chosen donor. Many facilities saw a rise in requests during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concerns about vaccine transmission that medical professionals say are unfounded.",
      "The Republican proposal, which now heads to the Senate, makes it so Utah health providers can no longer block someone from supplying their own blood, except in emergencies. Hospitals would not be liable for any injuries or deaths that may result from using the blood.",
      "Similar legislation is being considered in Texas and was floated in past legislative sessions in Iowa and Kentucky, but did not pass.",
      "\u201cThis bill was brought to me by patients who have requested to use directed blood donation, including their own blood, at Utah hospitals and have been denied,\u201d said freshman Rep. Kristen Chevrier, the bill's sponsor. \u201cTheir situations are serious and delicate.\u201d",
      "The Republican from Highland argued patients should be able to receive blood from people they trust, rather than go through blood banks that do not disclose to patients their donor's medical history.",
      "Before her election to the Legislature, Chevrier led multiple anti-vaccine organizations that warned against taking COVID-19 shots and fought against vaccination requirements imposed by schools and employers. She and other supporters have acknowledged that the bill would let patients who are weary of COVID-19 vaccines handpick donors with a similarly unvaccinated status.",
      "According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, justification for such requests \u201cis not supported by any medical or scientific evidence.\u201d Vaccine components do not replicate through blood transfusions or alter a blood recipient's DNA, meaning an unvaccinated patient could not receive the COVID-19 vaccine via a vaccinated donor's blood.",
      "Requests to use blood from a known donor are often driven by a patient\u2019s preference rather than a medical need, said Daniel Parra of the American Red Cross, the largest blood collector in Utah. An increase in those requests would divert resources away from those requiring lifesaving care, he cautioned.",
      "\u201cThis bill would create unnecessary and harmful impacts on the delivery of lifesaving blood to patients,\u201d Parra told The Associated Press. \u201cWhile this bill may be well-intentioned, it offers no public health benefit and could negatively impact patient care.\u201d",
      "Kristina Pexton, a blood transfusion specialist at a Utah hospital, told lawmakers at a recent committee hearing that she worried the bill would place a strain on the system.",
      "Directed donations also carry a greater risk than the community blood supply, Parra warned. Family and friends may feel pressure to donate and might not be fully transparent about their health history, which he said increases the risk of the recipient contracting an infectious disease.",
      "There is no evidence that patients can select safer donors than the volunteer blood system provides. Still, several residents told lawmakers the choice was important to them.",
      "\u201cSomething so personal as our health care, something that is especially as personal as blood, we should always have that choice,\u201d said Gayle Ruzicka."

    "story": [
      "A new and massive study finds that climate change is melting the world\u2019s mountain glaciers faster than ever",
      "Climate change is accelerating the melting of the world's mountain glaciers, according to a massive new study that found them shrinking more than twice as fast as in the early 2000s.",
      "The world's glaciers lost ice at the rate of about 255 billion tons (231 billion metric tons) annual from 2000 to 2011, but that quickened to about 346 billion tons (314 billion metric tons) annually over about the next decade, according to the study in this week\u2019s journal Nature.",
      "And the last few years, the melt has accelerated even more, hitting a record 604 billion tons (548 billion metric tons) lost in 2023, the last year analyzed.",
      "The study drew on an international effort that included 233 estimates of changes in glacier weight. In all, the world's glaciers have lost more than 7 trillion tons of ice (6.5 trillion metric tons) since 2000, according to the study.",
      "\u201cThe thing that people should be aware of and perhaps worried about is that yes, the glaciers are indeed retreating and disappearing as we said they would. The rate of that loss seems to be accelerating,\u201d said William Colgan, a glaciologist for the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland and one of about 60 authors of the study.",
      "Glaciers in Alaska are melting at the fastest rate of any of the 19 regions studied, losing about 67 billion tons (61 billion metric tons) of ice a year, producing the biggest net ice loss, the study found.",
      "In the past 24 years, Central Europe\u2019s glaciers have lost the highest percentage of ice of any region, now 39% smaller than they were in 2000, the paper said. Colgan said he worries most about the Alps because \u201celevated summer temperatures have been hammering the Alps. \u201d",
      "Fifteen years ago, scientists were worried most about the Andes and the Patagonia glaciers, but the Alps have shrunk so fast they could eventually disappear, Colgan said.",
      "\u201cGlaciers are apolitical and unbiased sentinels of climate change, and their decline paints a clear picture of accelerated warming,\u201d said Gwenn Flowers, a professor of Earth Sciences at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who wasn't part of the study.",
      "University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos, who also wasn't part of the study, said glaciers shrank and grew in the past for local, well-understood reasons that were not climate change. What's happening now is different and clear, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s due to greenhouse gas increases caused directly by coal, oil, and natural gas burning. ... No amount of rhetoric, tweeting, or proclamation will change that.\u201d",
      "Scambos, Flowers and other outside scientists called the assessment sobering and accurate but not surprising.",
      "Colgan said that many places \u2014 such as those in the U.S. West \u2014 are seeing extra water now from fast-melting glaciers and benefiting from that boost, but that will soon disappear as the glaciers melt beyond a point of no return.",
      "Melting glaciers contribute more to sea level rise than ice loss in either Greenland or Antarctica. Only the expansion of water as it warms plays a bigger role in sea level rise, the paper said.",
      "The overall glacier loss rate is similar, if maybe slightly less, than that found by earlier and less comprehensive studies. But this new work will probably trigger new predictions that will be even gloomier in the future because of better information and worsening warming, Colgan said.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re losing 5.5% of the global ice volume in just over 20 years, clearly that\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Colgan said. \u201cThat's going to catch up with you.\u201d",
      "The more than 600 billion tons of glacier loss in 2023 \u201csounds incredible now, but it might sound pretty normal in 10 years from now,\u201d Colgan said. \u201cMountain glaciers as a whole can flip into collective ice loss pretty darn quick.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is investigating delays and cost overruns in California\u2019s high-speed rail project",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The Trump administration is once again targeting California's controversial high-speed rail project, with federal transportation officials on Thursday announcing an investigation and possible withdrawal of about $4 billion in federal funding.",
      "Voters first approved $10 billion in bond money in 2008 for a project designed to shuttle riders between San Francisco and Los Angeles in less than three hours. It was slated to cost $33 billion and be finished by 2020. But the project has been beset by funding challenges, cost overruns and delays.",
      "Now, state officials are focused on a 171-mile (275-kilometer) stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced, which is set to be operating by 2033. The entire San Francisco to Los Angeles line will now cost an estimated $106 billion to finish and officials hope to complete it in the next 20 years if there is money.",
      "\u201cI am directing my staff to review and determine whether the (California High-Speed Rail Authority) has followed through on the commitments it made to receive billions of dollars in federal funding. If not, I will have to consider whether that money could be given to deserving infrastructure projects elsewhere in the United States,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at a news conference in Los Angeles.",
      "President Donald Trump canceled nearly $1 billion in federal funding for the high-speed rail project in 2019, during his first term. The Biden administration later restored the funding and, in December 2023, allocated $3.3 billion more.",
      "Losing that money would be a major blow to the project. The rail authority's most recent business plan counts on receiving up to $8 billion in federal money to help close a funding gap.",
      "Ian Choudri, CEO of the California\u2019s High-Speed Rail Authority, which oversees planning and funding for the project, said he welcomes the investigation.",
      "\u201cWith multiple independent federal and state audits completed, every dollar is accounted for, and we stand by the progress and impact of this project,\u201d Choudri said.",
      "He said the project has created nearly 15,000 jobs and that more than 50 major structures have been completed so far.",
      "Several Republican Congress members have taken aim at the project over its costs. On Thursday, Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, who represents 3rd Congressional District that stretches alongside much of the state\u2019s border with Nevada and includes Sacramento\u2019s northeastern suburbs, called the California high-speed rail \u201cthe worst public infrastructure failure in U.S. history.\u201d",
      "\"There is no plausible scenario where the cost to federal or state taxpayers can be justified. It is past time to stop throwing good money after bad, and we must formally end this project,\u201d said Kiley, who introduced a bill earlier this year to make the project ineligible for further federal funding.",
      "Kiley joined Duffy in Los Angeles' Union Station for the announcement of the probe. Those present were interrupted at times by booing by about 30 demonstrators. The protesters also chanted \u201cbuild the rail!\u201d and held up signs that read \u201cCA has no king\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t delay our train.\u201d",
      "Eli Lipmen, executive director of Move LA, an organization that advocates for efficient public transit systems, said the high-speed train project remains popular among many Californians.",
      "\u201cThey said they\u2019re going to start an investigation, but come on, this is a sham investigation,\u201d Lipmen, who was at Union Station during the announcement, told KABC-TV.",
      "Greg Regan and Shari Semelsberger, president and secretary-treasurer of the Transportation Trades Department coalition that includes all the country's rail unions, said the project is the most ambitious and innovative transportation project in the country and urged Trump to become \u201ca Builder-in-Chief by bringing high-speed rail to America.\u201d",
      "\u201cBuilding ambitious projects requires bold leadership and a commitment to getting the job done. Just last year, President Trump complained that the United States does not have bullet trains similar to Japan. We agree with him that it is past time for our country to have these kinds of modern, efficient, high-capacity transportation systems,\" they said in a statement.",

      "Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has been erupting on and off for nearly two months since it burst to life on Dec. 23. The eruption has been taking place at the volcano's summit crater inside Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. No residential areas have been threatened by lava.",

      "Apple has released a sleeker and more expensive version of its lowest priced iPhone in an attempt to widen the audience for a bundle of artificial intelligence technology that the company has been hoping will revive demand for its most profitable product lineup.",
      "The iPhone 16e unveiled Wednesday is the fourth-generation of a model that\u2019s sold at a dramatically lower price than the iPhone\u2019s standard and premium models. The previous bargain-bin models were called the iPhone SE, with the last version coming out in 2022.",
      "Like the higher-priced iPhone 16 lineup unveiled last September, the iPhone 16e includes the souped-up computer chip needed to process an array of AI features that automatically summarize text, audio and create on-the-fly emojis while smartening up the device\u2019s virtual assistant, Siri. It will also have a more powerful battery and camera.",
      "All those upgrades will translate into a higher starting price for an iPhone 16e at $600, a 40% increase from $430 for the last iPhone SE. But iPhone 16e will be more affordable than the cheapest standard iPhone 16 at $800. The new phone will be available in stores Feb. 28, but can be pre-ordered beginning Friday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re so excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone experience to even more people,\u201d said Kaiann Drance, an Apple vice president in charge of promoting a device lineup that accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.",
      "Although Apple has been hyping its foray into AI since last June, the complete set of features still haven\u2019t been released in the U.S. and the technology still isn\u2019t even available in some parts of the world.",
      "The delays in making the iPhone\u2019s AI \u2014 dubbed \u201cApple Intelligence\u2019\" \u2014 more widely available through free software updates dinged the Cupertino, California, company during the past holiday when sales of the device dipped slightly from their 2023 levels.",
      "Apple has primarily been losing the ground in China, where it hasn\u2019t yet specified when the iPhone's AI technology will be available. But the company recently struck an AI partnership with Alibaba in China that could pave the way for the technology coming to iPhones in that country this spring.",
      "Besides being able to handle AI for the first time, the iPhone 16e has a different look from previous SE models. It boasts a 6.1-inch display screen, slightly larger than the 4.7-inch display on SE model and no longer has a home screen button like the SE had. The new iPhone 16e will rely include a facial recognition option for unlocking the device, just like the higher priced models do.",
      "Apple's shares edged up during Wednesday's late mornng trading to nearly $245, below the stock's peak price of roughly $260 reached in late December.",

      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Huawei on Tuesday held a global launch for the industry\u2019s first tri-foldable phone, which analysts said marked a symbolic victory for the Chinese tech giant amid U.S. technology curbs. But challenges over pricing, longevity, supply and app constraints may limit its success.",
      "Huawei said at a launch event in Kuala Lumpur that the Huawei Mate XT, first unveiled in China five months ago, will be priced at 3,499 euros ($3,662). Although dubbed a trifold, the phone has three mini-panels and folds only twice. The company says it's the thinnest foldable phone at 3.6 millimeters (0.14 inches), with a 10.2-inch screen similar to an Apple iPad.",
      "\u201cRight now, Huawei kind of stands alone as an innovator\" with the trifold design, said Bryan Ma, vice president of device research with the market intelligence firm International Data Corporation.",
      "Huawei reached the position despite \u201cnot getting access to chips, to Google services. All these things basically have been huge roadblocks in front of Huawei,\u201d Ma said, adding that the \u201cresurgence we're seeing from them over the past year has been quite a bit of a victory.\"",
      "Huawei, China\u2019s first global tech brand, is at the center of a U.S.-China battle over trade and technology. Washington in 2019 severed Huawei\u2019s access to U.S. components and technology, including Google\u2019s music and other smartphone services, making Huawei's phone less appealing to users. It has also barred global vendors from using U.S. technology to produce components for Huawei.",
      "American officials say Huawei is a security risk, which the company denies. China\u2019s government has accused Washington of misusing security warnings to contain a rising competitor to U.S. technology companies.",
      "Huawei launched the Mate XT in China on Sept. 20 last year, the same day Apple launched its iPhone 16 series in global markets. But with its steep price tag, the Mate XT \u201cis not a mainstream product that people are going to jump for,\u201d Ma said.",
      "At the Kuala Lumpur event, Huawei also unveiled its MatePad Pro tablet and Free Arc, its first open-ear earbuds with ear hooks and other wearable devices.",
      "While Huawei\u2019s cutting-edge devices showcase its technological prowess, its long-term success remains uncertain given ongoing challenges over global supply chain constraints, chip availability and limitations on the software ecosystem, said Ruby Lu, an analyst with the research firm TrendForce.",
      "\"System limitations, particularly the lack of Google Mobile Services, means its international market potential remains constrained,\u201d Lu said.",
      "IDC's Ma said Huawei dominated the foldable phone market in China with 49% market share last year. In the global market, it had 23% market share, trailing behind Samsung's 33% share in 2024, he said. IDC predicted that total foldable phone shipments worldwide could surge to 45.7 million units by 2028, from over 20 million last year.",
      "While most major brands have entered the foldable segments, Lu said Apple has yet to release a competing product.",
      "\u201cOnce Apple enters the market, it is expected to significantly influence and stimulate further growth in the foldable phone sector,\u201d Lu added."

      "Why did humans start speaking? Scientists suggest genetics played a big role \u2013 and they say the evolution of this singular ability was key to our survival.",
      "A new study links a particular gene to the ancient origins of spoken language, proposing that a protein variant found only in humans may have helped us communicate in a novel way. Speech allowed us to share information, coordinate activities and pass down knowledge, giving us an edge over extinct cousins like Neanderthals and Denisovans.",
      "The new study is \u201ca good first step to start looking at the specific genes\u201d that may affect speech and language development, said Liza Finestack at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved with the research.",
      "What scientists learn may someday even help people with speech problems.",
      "The genetic variant researchers were looking at was one of a variety of genes \"that contributed to the emergence of Homo sapiens as the dominant species, which we are today\u201d said Dr. Robert Darnell, an author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Darnell has been studying the protein \u2013 called NOVA1 and known to be crucial to brain development \u2013 since the early 1990s. For the latest research, scientists in his lab at New York's Rockefeller University used CRISPR gene editing to replace the NOVA1 protein found in mice with the exclusively human type to test the real-life effects of the genetic variant. To their surprise, it changed the way the animals vocalized when they called out to each other.",
      "Baby mice with the human variant squeaked differently than normal littermates when their mom came around. Adult male mice with the variant chirped differently than their normal counterparts when they saw a female in heat.",
      "Both are settings where mice are motivated to speak, Darnell said, \u201cand they spoke differently\" with the human variant, illustrating its role in speech.",
      "This isn't the first time a gene has been linked to speech. In 2001, British scientists said they had discovered the first gene tied to a language and speech disorder.",
      "Called FOXP2, it was referred to as the human language gene. But though FOXP2 is involved in human language, it turned out that the variant in modern humans wasn't unique to us. Later research found it was shared with Neanderthals. The NOVA1 variant in modern humans, on the other hand, is found exclusively in our species, Darnell said.",
      "The presence of a gene variant isn't the only reason people can speak. The ability also depends on things like anatomical features in the human throat and areas of the brain that work together to allow people to speak and understand language.",
      "Darnell hopes the recent work not only helps people better understand their origins but also eventually leads to new ways to treat speech-related problems.",
      "University of Minnesota's Finestack said it\u2019s more likely the genetic findings might someday allow scientists to detect, very early in life, who might need speech and language interventions.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The Agriculture Department is scrambling to rehire several workers who were involved in the government's response to the ongoing bird flu outbreak that has devastated egg and poultry farms over the past three years.",
      "The workers were among the thousands of federal employees eliminated on the recommendations of billionaire Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency, which is working to carry out Trump\u2019s promise to streamline and reshape the federal government.",
      "Republican Rep. Don Bacon said the administration should be more careful in how it carries out the cuts.",
      "\u201cWhile President Trump is fulfilling his promise to shed light on waste, fraud, and abuse in government, DOGE needs to measure twice and cut once. Downsizing decisions must be narrowly tailored to preserve critical missions,\u201d said Bacon, who represents a swing district in Nebraska.",
      "The bird flu outbreak has prompted the slaughter of roughly 160 million birds to help control the virus since the outbreak began in 2022. Most of the birds killed were egg-laying chickens, so that has driven egg prices up to a record high of $4.95 per dozen on average. The federal government has spent nearly $2 billion on the response, including nearly $1.2 billion in payments to farmers to compensate them for their lost birds.",
      "A USDA spokesperson said the department \u201ccontinues to prioritize the response to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\u201d and several key jobs like veterinarians, animal health technicians and other emergency response personnel involved in the effort were protected from the cuts. But some employees of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were eliminated.",
      "\u201cAlthough several APHIS positions supporting HPAI were notified of their terminations over the weekend, we are working to swiftly rectify the situation and rescind those letters,\u201d the department spokesperson said.",
      "Politico and NBC News reported that the jobs that were eliminated were part of an office that helps oversee the national network of labs USDA relies on to confirm cases of bird flu and other animal diseases. It wasn't immediately clear how many workers the department might be trying to rehire and whether any of them worked at the main USDA lab in Ames, Iowa.",
      "\u201cAt a time when producers are already grappling with the bird flu, the public is facing high prices, and all Americans are on edge about what broader spread of this virus could mean, the last thing the administration should have done was to eliminate these positions,\" Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. \"USDA must rehire these crucial personnel immediately.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials said this week that the USDA might change its approach to the bird flu outbreak, so that maybe entire flocks wouldn't have to be slaughtered when the disease is found, but they have yet to offer many details of their plan.",

But the number of civilians killed has also soared, fueling fears that these tools are contributing to the deaths of innocent people.",

However, Israel's recent wars mark a leading instance in which commercial AI models made in the United States have been used in active warfare, despite concerns that they were not originally developed to help decide who lives and who dies.",
      "The Israeli military uses AI to sift through vast troves of intelligence, intercepted communications and surveillance to find suspicious speech or behavior and learn the movements of its enemies. After a deadly surprise attack by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, its use of Microsoft and OpenAI technology skyrocketed, an Associated Press investigation found. The investigation also revealed new details of how AI systems select targets and ways they can go wrong, including faulty data or flawed algorithms. It was based on internal documents, data and exclusive interviews with current and former Israeli officials and company employees.",
      "\u201cThis is the first confirmation we have gotten that commercial AI models are directly being used in warfare,\u201d said Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute and former senior safety engineer at OpenAI. \u201cThe implications are enormous for the role of tech in enabling this type of unethical and unlawful warfare going forward.\u201d",

The amount of data it stored on Microsoft servers doubled between that time and July 2024 to more than 13.6 petabytes \u2014 roughly 350 times the digital memory needed to store every book in the Library of Congress. Usage of Microsoft\u2019s huge banks of computer servers by the military also rose by almost two-thirds in the first two months of the war alone.",
      "Israel\u2019s goal after the attack that killed about 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages was to eradicate Hamas, and its military has called AI a \u201cgame changer\u201d in yielding targets more swiftly. Since the war started, more than 50,000 people have died in Gaza and Lebanon and nearly 70% of the buildings in Gaza have been devastated, according to health ministries in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "The AP\u2019s investigation drew on interviews with six current and former members of the Israeli army, including three reserve intelligence officers. Most spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss sensitive military operations.",
      "The AP also interviewed 14 current and former employees inside Microsoft, OpenAI, Google and Amazon, most of whom also spoke anonymously for fear of retribution. Journalists reviewed internal company data and documents, including one detailing the terms of a $133 million contract between Microsoft and Israel\u2019s Ministry of Defense.",
      "The Israeli military says its analysts use AI-enabled systems to help identify targets but independently examine them together with high-ranking officers to meet international law, weighing the military advantage against the collateral damage. A senior Israeli intelligence official authorized to speak to the AP said lawful military targets may include combatants fighting against Israel, wherever they are, and buildings used by militants. Officials insist that even when AI plays a role, there are always several layers of humans in the loop.",
      "\u201cThese AI tools make the intelligence process more accurate and more effective,\u201d said an Israeli military statement to the AP. \u201c\u2060They make more targets faster, but not at the expense of accuracy, and many times in this war they\u2019ve been able to minimize civilian casualties.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military declined to answer detailed written questions from the AP about its use of commercial AI products from American tech companies.",
      "Microsoft declined to comment for this story and did not respond to a detailed list of written questions about cloud and AI services provided to the Israeli military. In a statement on its website, the company says it is committed \u201cto champion the positive role of technology across the globe.\u201d In its 40-page Responsible AI Transparency Report for 2024, Microsoft pledges to manage the risks of AI throughout development \u201cto reduce the risk of harm,\u201d and does not mention its lucrative military contracts.",
      "Advanced AI models are provided through OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, through Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform, where they are purchased by the Israeli military, the documents and data show. Microsoft has been OpenAI's largest investor. OpenAI said it does not have a partnership with Israel's military, and its usage policies say its customers should not use its products to develop weapons, destroy property or harm people. About a year ago, however, OpenAI changed its terms of use from barring military use to allowing for \u201cnational security use cases that align with our mission.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s extremely hard to identify when AI systems enable errors because they are used with so many other forms of intelligence, including human intelligence, sources said. But together they can lead to wrongful deaths.",
      "In November 2023, Hoda Hijazi was fleeing with her three young daughters and her mother from clashes between Israel and Hamas ally Hezbollah on the Lebanese border when their car was bombed.",
      "Before they left, the adults told the girls to play in front of the house so that Israeli drones would know they were traveling with children. The women and girls drove alongside Hijazi\u2019s uncle, Samir Ayoub, a journalist with a leftist radio station, who was caravanning in his own car. They heard the frenetic buzz of a drone very low overhead.",
      "Soon, an airstrike hit the car Hijazi was driving. It careened down a slope and burst into flames. Ayoub managed to pull Hijazi out, but her mother \u2014 Ayoub\u2019s sister \u2014 and the three girls \u2014 Rimas, 14, Taline, 12, and Liane, 10 \u2014 were dead.",
      "Before they left their home, Hijazi recalled, one of the girls had insisted on taking pictures of the cats in the garden \u201cbecause maybe we won\u2019t see them again.\u201d",
      "In the end, she said, \u201cthe cats survived and the girls are gone.\u201d",
      "Video footage from a security camera at a convenience store shortly before the strike showed the Hijazi family in a Hyundai SUV, with the mother and one of the girls loading jugs of water. The family says the video proves Israeli drones should have seen the women and children.",
      "The day after the family was hit, the Israeli military released video of the strike along with a package of similar videos and photos. A statement released with the images said Israeli fighter jets had \u201cstruck just over 450 Hamas targets.\" The AP\u2019s visual analysis matched the road and other geographical features in the Israeli military video to satellite imagery of the location where the three girls died, 1 mile (1.7 kilometers) from the store.",
      "An Israeli intelligence officer told the AP that AI has been used to help pinpoint all targets in the past three years. In this case, AI likely pinpointed a residence, and other intelligence gathering could have placed a person there. At some point, the car left the residence.",
      "Humans in the target room would have decided to strike. The error could have happened at any point, he said: Previous faulty information could have flagged the wrong residence, or they could have hit the wrong vehicle.",
      "The AP also saw a message from a second source with knowledge of that airstrike who confirmed it was a mistake, but didn\u2019t elaborate.",
      "A spokesperson for the Israeli military denied that AI systems were used during the airstrike itself, but refused to answer whether AI helped select the target or whether it was wrong. The military told the AP that officials examined the incident and expressed \u201csorrow for the outcome.\u201d",
      "Microsoft and the San Francisco-based startup OpenAI are among a legion of U.S. tech firms that have supported Israel\u2019s wars in recent years.",
      "Google and Amazon provide cloud computing and AI services to the Israeli military under \u201cProject Nimbus,\u201d a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021 when Israel first tested out its in-house AI-powered targeting systems. The military has used Cisco and Dell server farms or data centers. Red Hat, an independent IBM subsidiary, also has provided cloud computing technologies to the Israeli military, and Palantir Technologies, a Microsoft partner in U.S. defense contracts, has a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d providing AI systems to help Israel\u2019s war efforts.",
      "Google said it is committed to responsibly developing and deploying AI \u201cthat protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.\u201d Dell provided a statement saying the company commits to the highest standards in working with public and private organizations globally, including in Israel. Red Hat spokesperson Allison Showalter said the company is proud of its global customers, who comply with Red Hat's terms to adhere to applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Palantir, Cisco and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. Amazon declined to comment.",
      "The Israeli military uses Microsoft Azure to compile information gathered through mass surveillance, which it transcribes and translates, including phone calls, texts and audio messages, according to an Israeli intelligence officer who works with the systems. That data can then be cross-checked with Israel\u2019s in-house targeting systems and vice versa.",
      "He said he relies on Azure to quickly search for terms and patterns within massive text troves, such as finding conversations between two people within a 50-page document. Azure also can find people giving directions to one another in the text, which can then be cross-referenced with the military\u2019s own AI systems to pinpoint locations.",
      "The Microsoft data AP reviewed shows that since the Oct. 7 attack, the Israeli military has made heavy use of transcription and translation tools and OpenAI models, although it does not detail which. Typically, AI models that transcribe and translate perform best in English. OpenAI has acknowledged that its popular AI-powered translation model Whisper, which can transcribe and translate into multiple languages including Arabic, can make up text that no one said, including adding racial commentary and violent rhetoric.",
      "\u201cShould we be basing these decisions on things that the model could be making up?\u201d said Joshua Kroll, an assistant professor of computer science at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, who spoke to the AP in his personal capacity, not reflecting the views of the U.S. government.",
      "The Israeli military said any phone conversation translated from Arabic or intelligence used in identifying a target has to be reviewed by an Arabic-speaking officer.",
      "Errors can still happen for many reasons involving AI, said Israeli military officers who have worked with the targeting systems and other tech experts. One intelligence officer said he had seen targeting mistakes that relied on incorrect machine translations from Arabic to Hebrew.",
      "The Arabic word describing the grip on the launch tube for a rocket-propelled grenade is the same as the word for \u201cpayment.\u201d In one instance the machine translated it wrong, and the person verifying the translation initially didn\u2019t catch the error, he said, which could have added people speaking about payments to target lists. The officer was there by chance and caught the problem, he said.",
      "Intercepted phone calls tied to a person\u2019s profile also include the time the person called and the names and numbers of those on the call. But it takes an extra step to listen to and verify the original audio, or to see a translated transcript.",
      "Sometimes the data attached to people\u2019s profiles is wrong. For example, the system misidentified a list of high school students as potential militants, according to the officer. An Excel spreadsheet attached to several people\u2019s profiles titled \u201cfinals\u201d in Arabic, contained at least 1,000 students\u2019 names on an exam list in one area of Gaza, he said. This was the only piece of incriminating evidence attached to people\u2019s files, he said, and had he not caught the mistake, those Palestinians could have been wrongly flagged.",
      "He said he also worried that young officers, some still younger than 20, under pressure to find targets quickly with the help of AI would jump to conclusions.",
      "AI alone could lead to the wrong conclusion, said another soldier who worked with the targeting systems. For example, AI might flag a house owned by someone linked to Hamas who does not live there. Before the house is hit, humans must confirm who is actually in it, he said.",
      "\u201cObviously there are things that I live peacefully with and things that I could have done better in some targeted attacks that I\u2019m responsible for,\u201d the soldier told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s war, things happen, mistakes happen, we are human.\u201d",
      "Tal Mimran served 10 years as a reserve legal officer for the Israeli military, and on three NATO working groups examining the use of new technologies, including AI, in warfare. Previously, he said, it took a team of up to 20 people a day or more to review and approve a single airstrike. Now, with AI systems, the military is approving hundreds a week.",
      "Mimran said over-reliance on AI could harden people\u2019s existing biases.",
      "\u201cConfirmation bias can prevent people from investigating on their own,\u201d said Mimran, who teaches cyber law policy. \u201cSome people might be lazy, but others might be afraid to go against the machine and be wrong and make a mistake.\u201d",
      "Among U.S. tech firms, Microsoft has had an especially close relationship with the Israeli military spanning decades.",
      "That relationship, alongside those with other tech companies, stepped up after the Hamas attack. Israel\u2019s war response strained its own servers and increased its reliance on outside, third-party vendors, according to a presentation last year by the military\u2019s top information technology officer. As she described how AI had provided Israel \u201cvery significant operational effectiveness\u201d in Gaza, the logos of Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services appeared on a large screen behind her.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already reached a point where our systems really need it,\u201d said Col. Racheli Dembinsky, commander of the Center of Computing and Information Systems, known by its Hebrew acronym, Mamram.",
      "One three-year contract between Microsoft and the Israeli Ministry of Defense began in 2021 and was worth $133 million, making it the company's second largest military customer globally after the U.S., according to a document reviewed by the AP. The Israeli military is classified within Microsoft as an \u201cS500\u201d client, meaning that it gets top priority as one of the company's most important customers globally.",
      "The Israeli military's service agreements with Microsoft include at least 635 individual subscriptions listed under specific divisions, units, bases or project code words. Subscription names reviewed by the AP included \u201cMamram\u201d and \u201c8200,\u201d an elite intelligence unit known for its technological prowess.",
      "One urgent Azure support ticket filed about two weeks after the Oct. 7 attack asked for delays of planned maintenance outages for the rest of the year due to the war, because any downtime could have \u201ca direct impact on life-saving systems.\u201d The request was flagged as being from \u201cGlilot \u2013 8200,\u201d a highly secure army base that houses Unit 8200, responsible for clandestine operations, collecting signal intelligence and code decryption, cyber warfare and surveillance.",
      "Records show Microsoft\u2019s global Azure support team responded to about 130 direct requests from the Israeli military through the first 10 months of the war. Microsoft\u2019s consulting services unit also works closely with Israel\u2019s military, which represented half of that section\u2019s overall revenue, an internal document said.",
      "Within Israel, a team of at least nine Microsoft employees is dedicated to serving the military\u2019s account. Among them is a senior executive who served 14 years in Unit 8200 and a former IT leader for military intelligence, according to their online resumes. Microsoft data is housed in server farms within two massive buildings outside Tel Aviv, enclosed behind high walls topped with barbed wire. Microsoft also operates a 46,000-square-meter corporate campus in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, and another office in Gav-Yam in southern Israel, which has displayed a large Israeli flag.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces has long been at the forefront of deploying artificial intelligence for military use. In early 2021, it launched Gospel, an AI tool that sorts through Israel\u2019s vast array of digitized information to suggest targets for potential strikes. It also developed Lavender, which uses machine learning to filter out requested criteria from intelligence databases and narrow down lists of potential targets, including people.",
      "Lavender ranks people between 0 and 100 based on how likely it is they are a militant, said an intelligence officer who used the systems. The ranking is based on intelligence, such as the person\u2019s family tree, if someone\u2019s father is a known militant who served time, and intercepted phone calls, he said.",
      "In May 2021, the Israeli military launched what Israeli intelligence officials described as their \u201cFirst AI War,\u201d an 11-day bombing campaign against Hamas. At the time, Israeli military officials described AI as a \u201cforce-multiplier,\u201d allowing them to carry out far more airstrikes than in prior conflicts.",
      "A 2021 post by the Israeli military also described the stakes surrounding the use of AI in war: \u201cUnlike in the realms of AdTech and Gaming, wrong decisions in the realm of intelligence may cost lives,\u201d it read. The same post described the military\u2019s incorporation of AI approaches to analyze the emotional tone of communications, a technique experts have found can fail to pick slang, jargon or nuance in people\u2019s speech.",
      "The relationship between tech companies and the Israeli military also has ramifications in the U.S., where some employees have raised ethical concerns.",
      "In October, Microsoft fired two workers for helping organize an unauthorized lunchtime vigil for Palestinian refugees at its corporate campus in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft said at the time that it ended the employment of some people \u201cin accordance with internal policy\u201d but declined to give details.",
      "Hossam Nasr, one of the employees fired by Microsoft who works with the advocacy group No Azure for Apartheid, said he and former colleagues are pushing for Microsoft to stop selling cloud and AI services to the Israeli military.",
      "\u201cCloud and AI are the bombs and bullets of the 21st century,\u201d Nasr said. \u201cMicrosoft is providing the Israeli military with digital weapons to kill, maim and displace Palestinians, in the gravest moral travesty of our time.\u201d",
      "In April, Google fired about 50 of its workers over a sit-in at the company\u2019s California headquarters protesting the war in Gaza.",
      "Former Google software engineer Emaan Haseem was among those fired. Haseem said she worked on a team that helped test the reliability of a \u201csovereign cloud\u201d \u2014 a secure system of servers kept so separate from the rest of Google\u2019s global cloud infrastructure that even the company itself couldn't access or track the data it stores. She later learned through media reports that Google was building a sovereign cloud for Israel.",
      "\u201cIt seemed to be more and more obvious that we are literally just trying to design something where we won\u2019t have to care about how our clients are using it, and if they\u2019re using it unfairly or unethically,\u201d Haseem said.",
      "Google said the employees were fired because they disrupted work spaces and made colleagues feel unsafe. Google did not respond to specific questions about whether it was contracted to build a sovereign cloud for the Israeli military and whether it provided restrictions on the wartime use of its AI models.",
      "Gaza is now in an uneasy ceasefire. But recently, the Israeli government announced it would expand its artificial intelligence developments across all its military branches.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. tech titans keep consolidating power in Washington. Microsoft gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai got a prime seat at the president\u2019s inauguration. And OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met with the president on Trump\u2019s second full day in office to talk up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for AI infrastructure.",
      "In a new book set to be published Tuesday, Palantir CEO Alexander Karp calls for the U.S. military and its allies to work closely with Silicon Valley to design, build and acquire AI weaponry, including \u201cthe unmanned drone swarms and robots that will dominate the coming battlefield.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fate of the United States, and its allies, depends on the ability of their defense and intelligence agencies to evolve, and briskly,\u201d Karp wrote, according to an advance copy obtained by the AP.",
      "After OpenAI changed its terms of use last year to allow for national security purposes, Google followed suit earlier this month with a similar change to its public ethics policy to remove language saying it wouldn\u2019t use its AI for weapons and surveillance. Google said it is committed to responsibly developing and deploying AI \u201cthat protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.\u201d",
      "As tech companies jockey for contracts, those who lost relatives still search for answers.",

    "summary": "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is planning to endorse a statewide ban on cellular devices in public schools",
    "story": [
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is planning to endorse a statewide ban on cellular devices in public schools",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is aiming to improve student achievement, social interaction and the mental health of public school students by proposing a statewide ban on cellphones in classrooms, an idea that is rapidly gaining traction nationally regardless of political persuasion.",
      "The Democrat's top education aide, Martin Torres, said Pritzker is expected to endorse \u201cscreen-free schools\u201d during his combined State of the State/Budget address at noon Wednesday.",
      "Legislation introduced in both houses of the General Assembly would require school districts to set policies that ban personal wireless devices during class time, with notable exceptions, create a means for secure but accessible storage of phones and tablets, and review those guidelines at least every three years.",
      "Eight states have policies that ban or limit schoolhouse cellphone use. Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio. Iowa, Kentucky and Michigan are among the 15 states where bans or other restrictions have been proposed.",
      "The Pew Research Center has found that seven in 10 high school teachers in the U.S. consider cellphone distraction a major classroom problem.",
      "Torres, Pritzker's deputy governor for education, told The Associated Press that at least 10 Illinois school districts have adopted screen-free policies, and they have had positive results.",
      "\u201cStudents are more engaged, they\u2019re more attentive in class. There\u2019s improved participation in classroom dynamics,\u201d Torres said. \u201cThis is a proposal that\u2019s going to help teachers with instruction. It\u2019s going to reduce screen time. It\u2019s going to reduce social media exposure. And there\u2019s research that suggests that social media is linked with anxiety, depression, body dissatisfaction.\u201d",
      "The legislation, which would require policies be in place by the 2026-2027 school year, has enough flexibility in the plan to allow school districts to develop a policy that best suits them.",
      "Pritzker's idea is to ban wireless devices during instructional periods unless there is an emergency or a need to respond to a threat. They would also be allowed when a teacher approves their use, when a physician deems it essential for a student, for an individual special education plan or to help English learners.",
      "This school year, Peoria schools adopted a plan in which each student is issued a neoprene pouch with a magnetized lock that only teachers or administrators can open. Midway through the school year, a survey of 8,000 students from grades 5 to 12 found they had more focus, more engagement and reduced distractions, Superintendent Sharon Desmoulin-Kherat said.",
      "She said that in an email, a teacher reported: \u201cI am looking into students' eyes who have never looked up from a screen before.\u201d",
      "Illinois was way ahead of the curve on the issue, but it then backpedaled. Legislation banned cellphones as early as the 1990s when cellular devices were new, expensive and thought to be the domain of drug dealers. As technology improved, they were seen as vital links to the outside, particularly family, and in 2002, the Legislature reversed itself and approved their presence in schools.",
      "Despite being turned off and locked up, Peoria students retain ready access when necessary, Desmoulin-Kherat said, noting one of the few concerns parents had was being able to reach their children in an emergency.",
      "\u201cJust like the old days, you can call the office,\u201d Desmoulin-Kherat said. \u201cYou can send an email. You don't need a cellphone to be able to communicate with your family.\u201d",

      "Marine experts have given up hope of rescuing more than 150 false killer whales that stranded on a remote beach on Australia\u2019s island state of Tasmania",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Marine experts have given up hope of rescuing more than 150 false killer whales that stranded on a remote beach on Australia\u2019s island state of Tasmania, officials said on Wednesday.",
      "Experts including veterinarians were at the scene on Wednesday near Arthur River on Tasmania\u2019s northwestern coast where 157 whales were discovered on an exposed surf beach on Tuesday afternoon, the Department of Natural Resources and Environment said.",
      "Unfavorable ocean and weather conditions, which prevented the whales from being rescued on Wednesday, were forecast to persist for days, incident controller Shelley Graham said.",
      "\"We have been out in the water this morning and have relocated and attempted to refloat two whales but didn\u2019t have success as the ocean conditions weren\u2019t allowing the animals to get past the break. The animals are continuously restranding,\u201d Graham said in a statement.",
      "Marine biologist Kris Carlyon said the survivors would be euthanized.",
      "\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful,\u201d Carlyon said.",
      "The department said there were 136 survivors on Wednesday morning but that assessment was revised down to 90 within a few hours.",
      "The inaccessibility of the beach, ocean conditions and challenges to getting specialist equipment to the remote area complicated the response.",
      "The young whales weighed as little as 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds), while the adults weighed 3 metric tons (3.3 U.S. tons).",
      "Department liaison officer Brendon Clark said the stranding was the first by false killer whales in Tasmania in since 1974. That was a pod of more than 160 whales that landed on a beach near Stanley on the northwest coast. Strandings in Tasmania are usually pilot whales.",
      "Clark declined to speculate on why the latest pod might have stranded. Carcasses of dead whales would be examined for clues, he said.",
      "A helicopter reconnaissance on Tuesday afternoon determined that there were no other whales within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of the stranded pod, he said.",
      "Some could have been stranded for as long as 48 hours by early Wednesday.",
      "Arthur River local resident Jocelyn Flint said her son had discovered the stranded whales around midnight while fishing for shark.",
      "She said she had gone to the scene in the dark hours of the morning and returned after dawn but the whales were too big to attempt to refloat them.",
      "\u201cThe water was surging right up and they were thrashing. They\u2019re just dying, they\u2019ve sunk down in the sand,\u201d Flint said Wednesday morning. \u201cI think it\u2019s too late.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are little babies. Up one end, there\u2019s a lot of big ones. It\u2019s sad,\u201d she added.",
      "In 2022, 230 pilot whales stranded further south on the west coast at Macquarie Harbor.",
      "The largest mass-stranding in Australian history occurred in the same harbor in 2020 when 470 long-finned pilot whales became stuck on sandbars. Most of the beached whales died on both occasions.",
      "The reasons for the beachings are unclear. Reasons could include disorientation caused by loud noises, illness, old age, injury, fleeing predators and severe weather."

      "William Ray Lucas, who led the NASA facility that shouldered much of the blame for the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, has died. Lucas was 102.",
      "Lucas died Monday at his home in Huntsville, Alabama, according to an obituary published Friday by Laughlin Service Funeral Home in Huntsville. A funeral service has been set for March 1 on what would have been his 103rd birthday, funeral director Bryan Peek said Saturday.",
      "Lucas was director of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville when the Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, just 73 seconds after liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida. It was the deadliest U.S. space flight disaster at that time.",
      "The explosion killed all seven crew members, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, who had been tapped to become the first U.S. civilian to travel to space. Her inclusion on the flight meant thousands of schoolchildren across the country were watching the Challenger's launch and witnessed the televised disaster in real time.",

      "Lucas pushed back on the criticism, telling reporters a month after the explosion that it was too soon to pinpoint the cause of the explosion, adding, \u201cI think it was a sound decision to launch.\"",
      "But within months he had resigned, just days ahead of the release of a commission report blaming faulty design of the booster rockets.",
      "The explosion and resulting shakeup within NASA overshadowed what was an otherwise stellar career for Lucas, who was born and raised in rural western Tennessee and graduated from high school in 1939 as the class valedictorian. He earned a bachelor of science degree from Memphis State College, served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and later earned a doctorate in metallurgy from Vanderbilt University.",
      "Lucas began his career in the guided missile development division of the U.S. Army's Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville. He became a charter member of the Marshall Space Flight Center when it was established in 1960 before rising through the ranks to become its director in 1974."

Turner in his letter said the company was using Gulf of America to follow \u201clongstanding maps policies impartially and consistently across all regions\" and that the company was willing to meet in person with the Mexican government.",

      "Mexico has argued that the mapping policy violates Mexican sovereignty because the U.S. only has jurisdiction over around 46% of the Gulf. The rest is controlled by Mexico, which controls 49% and Cuba, which controls around 5%. The name Gulf of Mexico dates back to 1607 and is recognized by the United Nations.",
      "In response to Google's letter, Mexican authorities said they would take legal action, writing that \u201cunder no circumstance will Mexico accept the renaming of a geographic zone within its own territory and under its jurisdiction.\"",
      "The renaming of the body of water by Trump has flared tensions between Mexico and the U.S. at a pivotal time for the neighboring allies.",

      "Last week, the White House barred Associated Press reporters from several events, including some in the Oval Office, saying it was because of the news agency\u2019s policy on the name. The AP is using Gulf of Mexico to ensure that names of geographical features are recognizable around the world but also acknowledging Trump\u2019s renaming of it as well.",

      "A U.S. official with knowledge of the negotiations said a new version of the deal between the two countries has been put on the table.",
      "The document currently on the table is a work in progress after the Trump administration initially proposed Ukraine provide the U.S. government with 50% of the revenue from some of its key resources, including minerals, oil, gas and ports a week ago, according to a draft document reviewed by ABC News and a Ukrainian official familiar with the matter.",
      "The proposal hanging between the two countries comes at a critical time in the U.S. and Ukraine's relationship under the Trump administration and an even more critical time in the almost three-year war since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy's team was presented with the initial document with almost no warning when U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent visited Kyiv on Feb. 12, prompting widespread criticism that the Trump administration was seeking to strong-arm the country into an exploitative deal, a Ukrainian official said. The purported original draft document, reviewed by ABC News, contained no mention of future security guarantees for Ukraine, suggesting the country should give up access to its resources as payback for the American aid already rendered.",
      "That document was obtained by ABC News from a Ukrainian source.",
      "After Zelenskyy refused to sign the initial deal, Trump escalated criticisms, calling him a \"dictator\" and questioning his legitimacy as Ukraine's leader, echoing talking points of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy has held his ground, both thanking the U.S. for continued support and saying that he believes Trump is living in a \"disinformation space.\"",
      "\"I told them to show the security guarantees, and then we talk about the percentage. They said 50% and I replied NO. I can't sell the country off. I'm just a manager. Tomorrow, the country will have another manager, so I can't sell it. Besides, around 20% of resources are in Russia-occupied territory,\" Zelenskyy said during a press conference Wednesday.",
      "During the meeting between Trump's Special Envoy to Ukraine, Russian Gen. Keith Kellogg and Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Thursday, the two discussed the proposal again, a Ukrainian official said. After the meeting with Kellogg, Zelenskyy's team is now working on an updated agreement, a Ukrainian official told ABC News.",
      "A proposed agreement",
      "A couple of hours before Zelenskyy met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Kyiv on Feb. 12, a proposed agreement from the U.S. asking Ukraine to agree to give the U.S. 50% of the revenue from some of its most valuable natural resources was sent over. Zelenskyy and his team had almost no time to review the document, but they were asked to sign it during the meeting that day, a Ukrainian official told ABC News.",
      "The official said Zelenskyy refused.",
      "Zelenskyy was due to meet two days later with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Munich, Germany. But after Zelenskyy sent a revised proposal ahead of the meeting, Vance and Rubio threatened to cancel it, a Ukrainian official said. Zelenskyy's team asked them to read it first, the official said, and the meeting eventually went ahead. A U.S. official familiar with the discussions denied these details.",
      "An alleged draft document, reviewed by ABC News, of the initial proposal from the U.S. government dated Feb. 7 requests the U.S. government receive \"50% of the financial value received\" by the government of Ukraine from \"resources of Ukraine, including: mineral resources, oil and gas resources, ports\" and \"other infrastructure (as agreed),\" the draft document states. A U.S. official familiar with the matter said these details align with the US's initial proposal to Ukraine.",
      "The alleged draft document, at the top, states the U.S. \"has provided significant financial and material support to Ukraine since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022.\"",
      "\"We won't confirm or deny terms of ongoing discussions. These discussions work best between the interested parties, not through the media,\" a White House official said when asked about the authenticity of the document.",

The fact that he hasn't come to the table, that he hasn't been willing to take this opportunity that we have offered. I think he eventually will get to that point, and I hope so very quickly.\" Trump's National Security Advisor Michael Waltz said Thursday at a White House briefing.",
      "\"There can be, in my view, nothing better, for Ukraine's future and for their security than to have the United States invested in their prosperity long term,\" Waltz said.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:10:08 -0500",
    "summary": "The IRS has begun laying off more than 6,000 new and newly promoted employees across the country as part of the push to slash the federal government, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "The agency has begun laying off more than 6,000 new employees, sources say.",
      "The Internal Revenue Service on Thursday began laying off more than 6,000 new and newly promoted employees across the country, sources familiar with the planning told ABC News, as part of President Donald Trump's campaign to shrink the federal workforce that could have potential consequences for the current tax filing season.",
      "The layoffs, impacting roughly 6%-7% of the agency's 100,000-person workforce, began midday Thursday primarily outside the Washington, D.C., area, with thousands of employees facing layoffs at offices in Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Tennessee, New York, and beyond, sources told ABC News.",
      "As of Thursday morning, over 500 terminations were expected in Texas; over 600 in New York; over 400 in Georgia; and over 300 in each Florida, Tennessee, and Philadelphia, one source said.",
      "Layoffs could continue into Friday at some IRS offices around the country if weather conditions prevent managers and employees from getting to work, according to an email sent to managers of probationary employees and obtained by ABC News.",
      "The layoffs arrive in the middle of tax season as millions of Americans are filing their returns and hoping for timely refunds -- but the exact impact on filing season is not yet clear.",
      "Teams within the IRS being impacted by the layoffs include members of the small business/self-employed unit and clerks in various units, sources told ABC News.",
      "Also impacted are members of the appeals team, whose role is to \"resolve disputes, without litigation\" with taxpayers, according to the IRS website, as well as employees with the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent organization within the IRS that helps to \"protect taxpayer rights\" and advocate for taxpayers who have issues with the IRS or are experiencing financial hardship.",
      "Ahead of the layoffs, the IRS combed through an initial list of approximately 15,000 probationary employees to try to ensure that no one being laid off this week plays a \"direct\" role in filing season, sources said. But there are still widespread concerns within the IRS that the firings could ultimately cause delays.",
      "One former IRS commissioner told ABC News it's \"unrealistic\" to think firings could occur during filing season and that the process would still run entirely smoothly.",
      "\"The bottom line: Forever, it has been an absolute rule of thumb that you keep things stable during filing season. Because it's delicate,\" the former commissioner said. \"And the idea that nearly 10% of the entire IRS workforce is being laid off right in the middle of filing season is extremely risky.\"",
      "The former commissioner said filing season is like an assembly line with incoming and outgoing products: There are incoming tax forms and correspondence, and outgoing credits, refunds, and balance-due notices.",
      "\"There are layers of indirect support that go into that -- that could be technology, other types of logistics, supply chains. If you lose that capacity, it will diminish productivity,\" the former commissioner said. \"Filing season is all hands on deck. Something could break down. You could need to surge resources to one area of service. Things don't always go as planned at the assembly line.\"",
      "\"We can expect Americans to experience a return to slower refunds, to longer waits on hold, to dropped calls,\" Vanessa Williamson, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said on a call with reporters Thursday. \"It's going to be a real impact on customer service right as taxes are due this year.\"",
      "One probationary worker expecting to be fired told ABC News that \"termination of probationary employees could prolong audits.\"",
      "Another agency official said morale at the IRS is \"low\" and that they expected remaining workers to \"protest internally in ways that could impact filing season.\"",
      "On Thursday morning, a union representing IRS employees distributed a letter to members with instructions on what to do if they receive a termination letter.",
      "\"Print out everything in your Employee Personnel File that verifies when you started your job,\" the email said. \"Print last three paystubs and W-2. Print your annual appraisal. Keep your printed copies at home.\"",
      "An IRS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News",
      "Cuts to the IRS workforce could also impact the agency's ability to close the tax gap -- hundreds of billions of dollars in unpaid taxes that the government is owed but go uncollected because of lax enforcement.",
      "The IRS projects that the gross tax gap in 2022, the most recent year data is available, was $606 billion.",
      "Sources told ABC News that they expect further IRS layoffs after tax season, and senior Trump administration officials have said that Trump wants to dismantle the tax-collecting agency entirely, which would require congressional approval.",
      "\"His goal is to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the outsiders pay,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Fox News Wednesday night, referencing Trump's proposal to create an \"External Revenue Agency\" to collect tariffs on foreign imports.",
      "Experts say that abolishing the IRS would be extraordinarily difficult, and that it's the sole government agency that collects the taxpayer money Trump is using to pay for his priorities, including border enforcement.",
      "The IRS also would have to oversee any repayments to taxpayers envisioned by Trump and DOGE head Elon Musk, who recently floated the idea that Americans should receive a percentage of the savings generated from the widespread government cuts.",
      "\"I love it. A 20% dividend, so to speak, for the money that we're saving by going after the waste, fraud and abuse and all of the other things that are happening,\" Trump said this week. \"I think it's a great idea.\"",
      "The IRS cuts come two years after the agency received tens of billions of dollars in funding from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which the IRS said helped it hire more customer service representatives -- thereby cutting in half the average time needed to process taxpayer correspondence from 7 months to 3.5 months.",
      "At the end of fiscal year 2024, the IRS employed a total of 100,433 people -- including accountants, managers, lawyers and other staff -- which was up from about 90,000 the year before.",

      "He said his job \"modernized\" IRS data infrastructure and streamlined compliance work, noting the irony in that the stated mission of the federal workforce cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is precisely to make the government more efficient.",
      "Sources told ABC News the IRS is expected to lay off more than 6,000 probationary employees across the country starting Thursday -- about 6% of the total IRS workforce. One source familiar with the matter told ABC News more than 100 people are being fired across the Washington offices, including more than 60 terminated from IRS headquarters.",
      "However, the layoffs are expected nationwide, with hundreds expected in Texas, New York, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Pennsylvania.",
      "When asked whether he thought the firings would affect this tax filing season, the fired worker said: \"You can only imagine with so many people being let go and so much information and potential being lost that people probably can expect disturbances.\"",
      "\"I wish there was more thought put into the long-term impact that some of these decisions will have on not just the American taxpayers but the American people,\" he added.",
      "He said he's worked in a variety of industries, including doing nanotechnology research, biotechnology research and engineering, but that he felt the most motivation and mission while working for the federal government.",
      "Another IRS employee who was wiping away tears described the impact she believed this will have on the future of the IRS. While she still has a job, she said these layoffs are \"gutting\" the IRS and will mean less enforcement and fewer people to respond to concerns from taxpayers.",
      "She also noted that much of the IRS workforce is older and near retirement age. The probationary workers who were recently hired included the \"best and the brightest\" who represented the future of the IRS, she said, adding that all of that is now being taken away.",
      "Another fired IRS worker told ABC News he was just three weeks shy of no longer being a probationary employee. He disputed Musk's and Trump's claims that the firings are improving efficiency.",
      "\"I know that the people that I have worked with \u2026 work really hard, and so \u2026 if you're measuring efficiency by productivity, certainly not. If you're measuring efficiency by morale, absolutely not,\" he said. \"I accepted this role in order to help our country fight bad guys.\"",

      "Workers caught up in the mass firings have received conflicting information.",
      "When Laura, a federal employee for the Department of Agriculture in the Midwest, got an email offering her a chance to resign with pay through September or otherwise face the prospect of termination, she took it.",
      "Laura had been in rural development, helping people access home ownership, for about six months. She knew mass terminations were likely to effect her because she was a probationary worker, a government status for employees with less than a year in their role.",
      "\"I saw the writing on the wall,\" said Laura, who declined to use her last name out of fear of retaliation.",
      "But one week after she received confirmation of her acceptance into the \"deferred resignation program,\" she woke up to an email informing her she'd been terminated anyway.",
      "\"No phone call, no nothing,\" she said. Then, like many federal employees, Laura immediately lost access to her work communications.",
      "Laura is part of a group of federal employees across multiple agencies who were suddenly fired last week due to their probationary status, despite having accepted the offer from a government-wide email titled \"Fork in the Road.\"",
      "The federal workers have since faced days of conflicting information from their agencies about their futures, with many, like Laura, in the dark without access to their work email.",
      "Roughly 200,000 government employees were categorized as probationary, the group targeted by the Trump administration's first wave of mass firings last week. Neither the White House nor the federal agencies have publicly disclosed how many of them were laid off, and within that group, it's not clear how many people were mistakenly terminated despite accepting the \"Fork in the Road\" offer, which about 75,000 workers did, according to the White House.",
      "Some federal workers have since been contacted by their agencies on their personal email and cell phone, informing them that they still qualify and need to opt-in again by Friday. But they worry that others who were terminated will slip through the cracks, unaware that they can still qualify for the deferred resignation program.",
      "\"It's all very disorganized,\" Laura said. \"My best piece of advice is definitely reach out to your leadership.\"",
      "For Laura, it was only through her own patchwork research that she found out that she might still be eligible for the offer and then called her supervisor, who confirmed.",
      "She'd found a colleague on LinkedIn, Nick Detter, who worked as a natural resource specialist for the Department of Agriculture in Kansas. Detter, also a probationary employee, had taken the deferred resignation program for the same reason as Laura -- and, like her, still received a termination notice.",
      "But Detter had refused to turn in his work laptop, hanging on to his email communications until there was more clarity on the deferred resignation program.",
      "Detter told Laura he'd received an email on Tuesday afternoon, days after she'd been terminated and had to turn in her access to work communications, which said that the department \"intend[ed] to honor the terms of the [deferred resignation program].\"",
      "Detter, who'd spoken to multiple news outlets about his situation, continued to get a flood of messages from colleagues who were in the same position.",
      "One colleague said his supervisor had explicitly told him that probationary employees were never supposed to qualify for the deferred resignation program, so to take the termination letter as final.",
      "But then Detter and his colleagues received another email, nearly a week after their initial terminations, apologizing for the \"lack of, or conflicting information\" and the \"confusion\" that being fired may have caused.",
      "\"This notice serves to clarify that as an employee on probationary or trial period status who may have opted into the Deferred Resignation Program (DRP), you are NOW eligible to participate in DRP,\" the email said.",
      "\"We apologize for the lack of, or conflicting information, surrounding the DRP and any confusion your termination notice may have caused.\"",
      "The email instructed recipients to reply by Feb. 21 with \"your continued intention to participate,\" and said employees would be reinstated by Feb. 24.",
      "Still, many questions remain for the federal workers, like whether they'll receive a paycheck for the days they were unsure of their work status, or whether they can have confidence that they'll receive one going forward.",
      "Already, the process had been tumultuous. They had watched as the Office of Personnel Management, the human resources arm of the government, sent FAQs reassuring federal workers that the program was legitimate and encouraging them to take it. Billionaire Elon Musk, who had sent a near-identical email to employees at Twitter after he took it over, also enthusiastically supported the offer.",
      "But many unions pushed back, warning their employees that there was no precedent for such a move and that people who accepted it could be left high and dry. A legal challenge delayed the program timeline, pausing it and pushing the deadline to accept the offer to Feb. 12, but ultimately allowing it to proceed. And then, mass terminations across dozens of agencies began.",
      "\"I don't know that I have a ton of confidence in the offer after this experience,\" Laura said. At this point, she said, she's holding on to the benefit of being able to at least say she resigned, rather than was terminated, if she needs to filed for unemployment or apply for other jobs.",
      "Detter said he initially had high hopes for the restructuring outlined in the Fork in the Road email, encouraged by pledges to increase efficiency and have more merit-based systems for promotions and pay.",
      "\"But in my experience over the last month with this whole thing, that's not what this has been. This has just been slash and burn,\" he said.",
      "Even after receiving the email apologizing for the mistake, a lawyer for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said he still felt that he was in the same situation as when he'd first been fired a week ago.",
      "The former CFPB employee said he took the deferred resignation offer because he was working remotely, which the Fork in the Road email warned would no longer be tolerated. As the primary income earner for his wife and young children, he wanted to \"play it conservatively,\" he said.",
      "\"But the sand keeps shifting every day,\" he said.",
      "Though his supervisors have told him that he will now get the deferred resignation offer despite his termination last Tuesday and he has signed a contract, he said there is reason to be skeptical.",

      "\"I'm effectively in the same position I was a week ago when I was just terminated, feeling like I need to support a family of four. I still need to find a job, I still need to find a sure thing,\" he said.",

      "Hundreds of workers were informed that their terminations had been rescinded.",
      "Following the flurry of federal firings over the weekend as a part of President Donald Trump's mission to decrease the federal government with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, hundreds of government workers were informed that their terminations had been rescinded.",
      "Employees from the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Agriculture received notice that they were no longer fired from their government positions.",
      "On Feb. 13, hundreds of staffers at the National Nuclear Security Administration were fired in the wave of mass Trump administration terminations, but the following day, the Department of Energy paused the firings of hundreds of employees who work for the key agency maintaining the U.S. nuclear stockpile, according to sources.",
      "However, Department of Energy officials were unable to get in touch with some critical nuclear workers as they frantically attempt to rehire them, according to an internal email obtained by ABC News.",
      "But on Tuesday, all but 28 of the roughly 300 fired NNSA employees had been rehired, multiple sources told ABC News.",
      "The Department of Veterans Affairs, which fired 1,000 probationary employees earlier this week, is also working to rehire a number of employees who worked on the Veterans Crisis Line, Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., posted on X.",
      "\"My office has personally spoken with dismissed federal employees that worked for the Veterans Crisis Hotline and supported the VA claims process,\" Duckworth, joined by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said on a press call with reporters Wednesday afternoon.",

      "Several employees at the Department of Agriculture working on bird flu were notified they had been fired over the weekend, but the department is working to rescind those termination letters and \"swiftly rectify the situation,\" according to a statement from the USDA on Tuesday.",
      "And just hours after about 950 employees at the Department of Health and Human Service's Indian Health Service had been told verbally they were had been laid off on Feb. 14, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. rescinded the terminations, and an official notice of the IHS layoffs was reportedly never sent.",
      "Last week, while speaking in the Oval Office beside Trump, Musk acknowledged that he and DOGE \"will make mistakes, but we'll act quickly to correct any mistakes.\"",
      "The White House acknowledged on Sunday night that some federal government employees who took the \"Fork in the Road\" buyout offer were also, subsequently, fired or let go -- and that this was an error.",
      "An Office of Personnel Management official told ABC News that some employees who responded to the buyout offer ahead of the deadline last week may have received termination notices by mistake but that the buyout agreements would be honored for those personnel.",
      "But in regard to the hiring and rehiring of federal employees, the Trump administration and DOGE have not characterized such decisions as \"mistakes.\"",
      "When asked on Tuesday if Trump was concerned over employees who were terminated and rehired over the weekend, specifically the nuclear weapons security workers, the president said, \"No, not at all.\"",
      "\"I think we have to just do what we have to do,\" Trump said, arguing that their work has been \"amazing.\"",
      "\"If we feel that, in some cases, they'll fire people and then they'll put some people back -- not all of them, because a lot of people were let go,\" he continued, before touting that decreasing the size of the government is part of the reason he was elected.",
      "Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for policy, defended the process of firing and rehiring employees, calling it \"pretty standard when you're downsizing the government\" and saying he \"wouldn't use the term mistake.\"",
      "\"You make cuts, you assess those cuts, you see who needs to be rehired, who needs to be kept, who needs to be reevaluated,\" Miller told CNN on Tuesday afternoon.",

    "summary": "The descendants of seven presidents commemorate Presidents' Day in Florida by sharing anecdotes about their ancestors and hopes for the future.",
    "story": [
      "The Society of Presidential Descendants wants to remind Americans of their duty.",
      "The idea of Carter, Truman, Eisenhower, McKinley, Roosevelt and Grant taking a vacation together in Florida might sound like a fantasy, but the Society of Presidential Descendants makes it happen every year.",
      "It's a club that you literally have to be born into. Each Presidents Day, first families meet up at a historic spot called the Little White House in scenic Key West.",
      "\"The first time we did anything like this was in 2010 with Margaret Hoover, President Hoover's great granddaughter, and her husband,\" Clifton Truman, the oldest grandson of 33rd President Harry Truman, told ABC News. \"And the next year, we added Susan Ford and Luci Baines Johnson.\"",
      "Since 2018, the group has met annually and amassed 75 direct descendants from 26 presidents. They know their families are wrapped up in the nation's history.",
      "\"Susan Ford said, I wasn't sure, that the job was sort of twofold. One, to keep up with the legacy -- your ancestor's legacy -- to preserve that, promote it, defend it,\" Clifton said. \"But the second part of the job is to do something with it on your own, make it your own in some way.\"",
      "Part of the preservation is sharing stories with eager audiences at Harry and Bess Truman\u2019s second home. The Little White House is a museum now, but Clifton used to come here with his grandparents in the '60s.",
      "Their names carry a lot of weight, and a great deal of responsibility. Tweed Roosevelt, the great grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt, the nation's 26th commander in chief, recounted being held to a higher standard in school.",
      "\"'Mr. Roosevelt, it's all right for the other boys to do that. But it's not all right for you to do it,'\" he told ABC News. \"That was the most valuable lesson I learned in all my four years of college.\"",
      "Ulysses Grant Dietz, the youngest great-great grandchild of President Ulysses S. Grant and his wife, Julia. Out of 41 great-great grandchildren, he's the only one to share a name with the 18th president.",
      "\"I became the torch-bearer,\" he told ABC News. \"And so people will say 'Oh, well they're historians, but we want you to talk because your name is Ulysses.' So you have to back that up with some self-education.\"",
      "While this is the yearly formal gathering, this specially connected group of friends gather elsewhere from time to time on other special occasions. Before former President Jimmy Carter died in December, almost a dozen descendants -- including his grandson James Earl Carter IV -- gathered to celebrate the 39th president's 100th birthday last October.",
      "They're descended from Democrats and Republicans, but party affiliation and policy discussion have never stood in the way of the group's mission to stick together.",
      "\"One of the things that all of our ancestors had in common was a great love for the country, a great respect for the institution of the presidency, regardless of politics, and that's something that we all share as well,\" James said.",
      "It also acts as a support system in more challenging times.",
      "\"I had a heart attack back in July, and all of these friends contacted me and were there for me, so they're family,\" Massee McKinley, who is the great-great nephew of 25th President William McKinley and the great, great grandson of 22nd and 24th President Grover Cleveland, told ABC News.",
      "Mary Jean Eisenhower, youngest grandchild of 34th President Dwight Eisenhower, noted that they don't carry on any conflicts their forebears may have had.",
      "\"I think it's fairly common knowledge that Truman and my grandfather had a rift, you know, later on in their lives,\" she told ABC News. \"And we've talked it out, and not only have we discovered that they made up, but we decided that we straightened our grandparents out.\"",
      "This group is determined to use their famous family names to push the legacy forward.",
      "\"Presidents Day is an opportunity to begin to remind people of what their civic duties are. Everybody seems to know their rights, but they seem to have forgotten that those rights come with duties,\" Tweed Roosevelt said. \"One of the things we're trying to do is help Americans understand what their role is, so that democracy will survive.\""

    "story": [
      "Trump and Zelenskyy engaged in a fierce back and forth on Wednesday.",
      "LONDON -- National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said Thursday that officials in Kyiv \"need to tone it down\" after a fierce back and forth between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy related to a potential deal to end Russia's three-year-old invasion of its neighbor.",
      "U.S.-Russia talks began this week in Saudi Arabia without Ukrainian participation, Kyiv's exclusion prompting condemnation in Ukraine and across Europe as well as a vow from Zelenskyy that his country would not sign any deal agreed over its head. Zelenskyy also pushed back on a proposed deal that would give the U.S. access to hundreds of billions of dollars worth of minerals.",
      "Responding to the discord, Waltz told Fox News that the Ukrainians \"need to tone it down and take a hard look and sign that deal,\" referring to the proposed minerals agreement.",
      "\"There's obviously a lot of frustration here,\" Waltz said after Wednesday's war of words.",
      "Seeking to explain the strong remarks from Trump and Vice President JD Vance, Waltz said, \"We presented the Ukrainians really an incredible and historic opportunity to have the United States of America co-invest with Ukraine, invest in its economy, invest in its natural resources and really become a partner in Ukraine's future in a way that's sustainable, but also would be -- I think -- the best security guarantee they could ever hope for, much more than another pallet of ammunition.\"",
      "Trump on Wednesday attacked European allies and the Ukrainian leadership for having failed to end Russia's war. The president went on to call Zelenskyy a \"dictator without elections,\" claiming -- without providing evidence -- that his Ukrainian counterpart's public approval rating was as low as 4%.",
      "Trump also wrote on Truth Social that Zelenskyy \"better move fast or he is not going to have a country left.\"",
      "Zelenskyy, meanwhile, suggested Trump is in a \"disinformation space,\" attributing at least some of the U.S. leader's criticism to Russian disinformation campaigns.",
      "Vance then warned that Zelenskyy's approach to dealing with the Trump White House was \"atrocious.\"",
      "In Moscow, meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday that Ukrainian officials had made \"unacceptable and impermissible\" remarks about foreign leaders \"in recent months.\"",
      "\"Rhetoric used by Zelenskyy and numerous other representatives of the Kyiv regime in general leaves much to be desired,\" Putin's spokesperson said.",
      "The diplomatic spat was set against the backdrop of continued Russian strikes across Ukraine. On Thursday, Ukraine's air force said Russia launched 14 missiles and 161 drones into the country in a massive overnight bombardment.",
      "Ukraine's air force said it shot down 80 of the drones launched in the latest Russian barrage, with another 78 lost in flight without causing any damage. The 14 missiles targeted energy infrastructure, the air force said, adding it would not reveal how many were intercepted.",
      "Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko wrote on Facebook that Russia conducted a \"massive\" missile and drone attack on \"gas infrastructure.\"",
      "The aim of the \"criminal attacks\" was to \"stop the production of gas, which is necessary to provide citizens' household needs and centralized heating,\" he said.",
      "\"While Russia continues to blatantly lie about not attacking civilian critical infrastructure, we are witnessing multiple missiles targeting Ukrainian gas mining facilities at once,\" Galushchenko wrote.",
      "\"Such actions of the enemy prove only once again that Russia is trying to hurt ordinary Ukrainians, plunged into the cold in the middle of winter,\" he added. \"This is outright terrorism.\"",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said its strike targeted \"gas and energy infrastructure facilities that ensure the operation of the military-industrial complex of Ukraine.\"",
      "\"The strike's objective has been achieved,\" the ministry said. \"All facilities have been hit.\"",
      "Russia's long-range strikes into Ukraine have not eased despite the opening of talks aimed at ending Moscow's three-year-old full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Russia's latest salvo came with Trump's Ukraine-Russia envoy Keith Kellogg in Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian leaders. Following the meeting, Zelenskyy said the two had a \"good conversation\" in a readout on Telegram. He said he was \"grateful to the United States for all the assistance and bipartisan support,\" but also emphasized Ukraine is ready for peace and has been \"seeking peace from the first second of this war.\"",
      "On Thursday, Zelenskyy marked the anniversary of the culmination of Ukraine's 2014 Maidan Revolution -- in which pro-Western protesters overthrew Moscow-aligned President Viktor Yanukovych.",
      "\"It was in these days of 2014 that Russia chose war -- it began the first steps towards the occupation of Crimea,\" Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. \"While people were being killed in Kyiv, and people were defending their freedom, Putin decided to strike another blow.\"",
      "\"Since then, the world has been living in a new reality, when Russia is trying to deceive everyone,\" the president wrote. \"And it is very important not to give in, to be together. It is very important to support those who defend freedom.\"",
      "Ukraine is continuing its own long-range campaign against Russian military and industrial infrastructure, especially targets linked to the country's lucrative fossil fuel industry. Ukrainian security services have referred to the campaign as \"drone sanctions.\"",

    "story": [
      "David Boren, the former Oklahoma governor and longtime U.S. Senate intelligence chief who went on to lead the University of Oklahoma after his retirement from politics, has died",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Former Oklahoma Gov. David Boren, who became one of the nation's youngest governors in the 1970s at age 33 and later helped shape national intelligence as a U.S. senator, has died. He was 83.",
      "Boren, who went on to serve as president of the University of Oklahoma after retiring from politics, died early Thursday at his home near Newcastle, said Bob Burke, a longtime family friend. He said Boren's death was the result of complications from diabetes.",
      "The son of a Democratic congressman, Boren quickly followed in his father's footsteps into elected office and oversaw a dramatic downsizing of government in Oklahoma, where over decades in legislative corridors and university offices he became one of the state's most influential figures. His son, Dan Boren, also served four terms as an Oklahoma congressman.",
      "In 2019, David Boren cut ties with the university he had led for 24 years amid a probe into allegations that he had sexually harassed male subordinates. Boren denied wrongdoing and the allegations never resulted in charges or civil litigation.",
      "\u201cHe was the smartest person I ever knew,\u201d Burke, an attorney and author who managed Boren\u2019s first campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1978. \u201cHe was a Rhodes Scholar, yet he could communicate with a farmer in overalls on the Main Street of a small Oklahoma town.",
      "\u201cNo Oklahoman had more influence on the state\u2019s progress in its first century than David Boren,\u201d he said.",
      "Boren served in the U.S. Senate between 1979 and 1994 and was the longest-serving chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. He became president of Oklahoma's largest public university after leaving the Senate and held the position until stepping down in 2018.",
      "\u201cHe saw public service as a noble calling and dedicated his life to it,\u201d Boren's son, Dan Boren, said in a statement. \"The countless heartwarming stories I hear almost daily from people across this state who he helped are reminders of his remarkable life. We shall cherish the memory of his service and remarkable life.\u201d",
      "A year after leaving the University of Oklahoma, a former student alleged he was touched and kissed inappropriately by Boren on several occasions about a decade earlier, allegations that Boren repeatedly denied.",
      "An investigation into Boren\u2019s alleged misconduct by the Jones Day law firm, which ended when Boren severed ties to the university in 2019, was never publicly released. The allegations against Boren tarnished his reputation and led him to withdraw from public life.",
      "Boren served four terms in the Oklahoma House before being elected governor at the age of 33 in 1974, which at the time made him the youngest governor in the country. He ran a reformist campaign that became known as the \u201cBoren Broom Brigade\u201d to demonstrate his pledge to \u201csweep out the old guard.\u201d",
      "As governor, Boren worked to eliminate the inheritance tax, cut the state income tax and reorganize a state government he described as \u201ccluttered\u201d with 214 boards, agencies and commissions.",
      "\u201cThis excessive red tape in government is a constant drain on taxpayer dollars,\u201d Boren once said, adding that the government needed to \u201cget out of the horse and buggy era.\u201d",
      "While in the U.S. Senate, Boren forged close relationships with the leaders of the nation's intelligence community, including former CIA Director George Tenet, whom Boren tapped as the Intelligence Committee's chief of staff prior to Tenet's appointment as CIA director.",
      "On the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, Boren was having breakfast with Tenet at a Washington hotel when Tenet, then CIA director, learned that an aircraft had flown into the World Trade Center tower in New York City. Boren later recalled that neither he nor Tenet was \u201ctotally shocked\u201d by the terrorist attack because the two men had spoken frequently about the possibility of international terrorists launching an attack in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI thought George was obsessed with Osama bin Laden and terrorism around the world,\u201d Boren told The Oklahoman months after the attacks. \u201cI don\u2019t think everything changed Sept. 11; only our perception and understanding changed.\u201d",
      "In the Senate, Boren also helped build bipartisan support to oppose South Africa's oppressive racial apartheid regime ahead of Nelson Mandela\u2019s release from prison in 1990. Shortly after his release, Mandela traveled to the U.S. and appeared as a guest on an ABC News town hall moderated by Ted Koppel. Boren was in the audience and Mandela led a standing ovation after Boren summed up the evils of apartheid and called for its end.",
      "\u201cHe has said all the things that are required to be said in regards to the problems of South Africa,\u201d Mandela said.",
      "During his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Boren also said he was heavily involved with helping influence U.S. policy in Central America, particularly in Nicaragua, during conflict in that country between the right-wing Contras and the leftist Sandinistas, working as an \u201cinformal emissary\u201d for former President George H.W. Bush.",
      "\u201cThe fact that I was in a different party \u2014 and the fact that we trusted each other -- was a big benefit,\u201d Boren told The Oklahoman in 1994.",
      "In 2016, Boren spearheaded a campaign in Oklahoma to adopt a 1 percent sales tax increase that would have raised about $550 million annually for public education, including pay raises for school teachers who were at the time among the lowest paid in the nation. But it was defeated in a statewide referendum.",
      "David Lyle Boren was born on April 21, 1941, in Washington, the son of U.S. Rep. Lyle Hagler Boren and the former Christine McKown. He was married twice, to the late Janna Little Robbins and then to Molly Shi Boren, a former judge, English teacher and president emeritus of the Oklahoma Arts Institute.",
      "Boren suffered from a minor stroke at a statue dedication ceremony in April 2018 and was hospitalized for several days. Boren also underwent heart bypass surgery in March 2017.",
      "Boren is survived by two children, including Dan Boren, the former Oklahoma congressman who is currently secretary of commerce for the Chickasaw Nation.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:15:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Senate Republicans plowing ahead with their efforts to advance the first stage of their two-part package to pay for Trump's agenda despite Trump backing the House\u2019s plan.",

      "Senators plan votes late into the night even though they may result in nothing.",
      "Senate Republicans are plowing ahead with their efforts to advance the first stage of its two-part budget package to pay for President Donald Trump's agenda despite Trump throwing his weight behind the House\u2019s more comprehensive one-bill plan.",
      "In a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump endorsed the House\u2019s budget bill, which bolsters funding for the border and national security while simultaneously extending the tax cuts implemented during Trump\u2019s first term and slashing trillions in funding for a variety of programs.",
      "\u201cThe House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!\u201d Trump posted.",
      "He reiterated his belief that there ought to be \u201cONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL\u201d that comprehensively handles many of his campaign promises in one fell swoop.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson has backed this strategy from the start. He believes the House bill, which also includes a hike to the federal debt limit that many of his members typically oppose, is robust enough to cull support from the members of his widely divided conference. This is essential because Johnson\u2019s razor-thin majority allows for almost no GOP defections.",
      "Senate Republicans say they favor that plan, but they\u2019re skeptical that it can get done in the timely fashion necessary to deliver Trump early-term wins on border security.",
      "\u201cI prefer what you\u2019re doing to what we are doing, but we\u2019ve got to get it done soon,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Budget Committee chairman. \u201cNothing would please me more than Speaker Johnson being able to put together the bill that President Trump wants. I want that to happen. But I cannot sit on the sidelines and not have a Plan B.\u201d",
      "Graham\u2019s move to advance the Senate bill escalates an ongoing battle between Republicans in the two chambers of Congress who are vying for Trump\u2019s approval in the early stages of his administration. Johnson has already called the Senate package a \u201cnon-starter\u201d and has signaled that even if the Senate passes its budget plan, the House will hold off on bringing it up in favor of its own bill.",
      "The Senate plan aims to deliver Trump wins on the border by allocating more funds for his immigration policy. It also beefs up defense spending and makes modifications to energy policy. But unlike the House bill, the Senate plan would take up the debate about extending the Trump tax cuts later and hiking the debt limit to a separate bill to be taken up later this year.",
      "Senators believe this strategy allows them to strike quickly to address \u201cimmediate needs\u201d while buying time for a more complex debate about tax policy.",
      "Majority Leader John Thune, in remarks on the Senate floor Thursday morning, said Senate Republicans are committed to making Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts permanent, but said there is still \u201csubstantial work left to do to arrive at a bicameral agreement\u201d on the issue.",
      "\u201cWhen the President's 'Border Czar' was here last week, he emphasized that the administration cannot sustain its effort to deport criminals here illegally without additional funding and the last thing we want is to delay other parts of the president's agenda like border security as we do the work needed to arrive at a tax agreement that can pass both houses of Congress,\u201d Thune said. \u201cThat's what the Senate is moving forward on a two-part legislative plan to accomplish our and the president's top priorities.\u201d",
      "The need to deliver border funding urgently requires swifter action than debate on a tax bill will allow, Republican Whip John Barrasso said.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s actions are working. They are working so well that the Trump administration says it is running out of money for deportations. 'Border Czar' Tom Homan told us that. [Homeland Security] Secretary [Kristi] Noem told us that. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told us that. Attorney General Pam Bondi told us that. Senate Republicans will act quickly to get the administration the resources they requested and need,\u201d Barrasso said.",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s endorsement of the House plan on Wednesday, senators left a closed-door lunch with Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday committed to advancing their proposal.",
      "So Thursday evening, senators will participate in a blitz of 10-minute amendment votes called a \"Vote-a-rama.\" This process, which is expected to last through the night, is just the first step in unlocking a fast track budget tool called reconciliation, which allows the Senate to bypass the normal 60-vote threshold to advance tax and budget related provisions.",
      "Senate Democrats are committed to opposing the reconciliation bill.",
      "\u201cI think most of us here get that no matter who the president is, our constituents expect us to work for them,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., during a floor speech. \"They expect us to fight for them, and they expect us to do the hard work of passing laws to make their lives better. People don't send us here to make their lives worse, but that's exactly what Trump and [Elon] Musk are doing -- They are looking at our most pressing problems and making them worse, and this budget proposal will only add fuel to that fire right now.\u201d",
      "But Democrats can only stall the bill. If all Republicans hang together, there\u2019s nothing Democrats can do to block it.",
      "But until House and Senate Republicans get on the same page, tonight\u2019s vote-a-rama could prove largely fruitless.",

Others mill about in the shopping centers on the coast and in the capital, some wearing shirts with Lionel Messi\u2019s name on them, carrying bags full of clothes, video games and mobile phones.",
      "They are part of a wave of Argentines who have found Chile to be a budget-friendly paradise this southern summer.",
      "\u201cEverything here is so cheap for us,\u201d said Cristian V\u00e1zquez, who was enjoying the sea in Re\u00f1aca, on Chile\u2019s central coast.",
      "In December 2024, the start of the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s summer, more Argentines went on vacation abroad than in the previous year, with Chile, Brazil, and Uruguay as the top destinations.",
      "Despite a year of economic crisis, Argentines are flocking to beaches, mountains and shopping centers abroad, encouraged by a favorable economic outlook \u2014 and a strong peso.",
      "Between December 2023 and the same month in 2024 the Argentine peso appreciated by around 41% against the official U.S. dollar, thanks in part of a strong adjustment plan implemented by President Javier Milei, an ultra-liberal who came to power at the end of 2023 on vows to \u201cblow up\u201d the central bank, take an axe to the bloated government and kill sky-high inflation.",
      "The stampede of Argentines traveling abroad for their summer vacations is driven by several factors, including the recent devaluation of various foreign currencies, the convenience of nearby destinations accessible by car and the prohibitively high cost of domestic vacations, especially along the Argentine Atlantic coast.",
      "Argentine tourism abroad surged in December, with departures up 76.4% year-over-year to 1.3 million travelers compared to the same month the previous year, according to official figures. Of those, 80.7% visited neighboring countries, primarily Chile (28%), Brazil (22.6%) and Uruguay (15.6%).",
      "Chile has become a popular destination for Argentines, who made up 40% of the 5.2 million visitors to the country in 2024 and early 2025. Chile\u2019s strong economic position relative to Argentina has resulted in competitive prices, a major draw for Argentine tourists.",
      "Chile\u2019s tourism undersecretary, Ver\u00f3nica Pardo, noted that visitors are also spending more than in previous years, averaging about $63.3 per person per day.",
      "Argentine visitors aren\u2019t confined to the sun-drenched beaches of the Chilean coast. Messi jerseys and mate gourds are also a common sight in other neighboring countries.",
      "Nicol\u00e1s Lentini, 37, recently arrived in Brazil, drawn by the devalued real and lower prices. \u201cA week\u2019s rent for four people in Argentina costs $700,\" he said, noting that he paid the same amount for 14 days in B\u00fazios, a Brazilian resort east of Rio de Janeiro.",
      "\u201cBesides, the beaches here are incomparable to ours, where it\u2019s cold. Here, you can wear a T-shirt all day.\u201d",
      "Brazil experienced a surge in tourism after the real depreciated by around 27% in 2024, when it reached a record of 6.6 million foreign arrivals, with Argentines being the main visitors (1.9 million).",
      "Andr\u00e9s Dey\u00e1, from Argentina's federation of travel and tourism business associations, highlighted the challenges of competing with neighboring countries like Brazil.",
      "\u201cWe can provide good services, financing tools, tourism quality and everything else,\u201d he said, but ultimately \"macroeconomic issues define where Argentines decide to travel.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe like it a lot... this year the prices aren\u2019t as high as they\u2019ve been,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez, one of 309,570 Argentines who visited Uruguay between December 20, 2024, and January 13, 2025, representing nearly half of all visitors to the country, where the U.S. dollar appreciated almost 13% against the Uruguayan peso in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "Tourism operators in Argentina note that the Argentine exodus was also fueled by recovering purchasing power due to falling inflation and the recent elimination of a tax on foreign credit card purchases.",

      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune has teed up a vote on a budget plan that sets the stage for a massive boost in defense and border security spending, and leaves a looming tax cut fight for later this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader John Thune teed up a vote this week on a budget plan that sets the stage for a massive boost in defense and border security spending, and leaves a looming tax cut fight for later this year.",
      "The move is designed to give President Donald Trump an early policy win and put pressure on House Republicans to join rather than pursue a separate, more comprehensive effort that also risks taking far longer to pass, if at all.",
      "Trump undercut the Senate GOP's efforts on Wednesday, calling on both chambers to pass the House budget resolution. \u201cThe House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it,\u201d Trump wrote on social media.",
      "Yet Thune is proceeding as planned, despite Trump's stated preference for the House effort.",
      "\u201cIf the House can produce one big beautiful bill, we're prepared to work with them to get that across the finish line, but we believe the president also likes optionality,\" Thune said.",
      "The resolution is not a bill and does not get signed into law by the president, but its passage unlocks a process that allows Republicans to enact their priorities later this year even if Democrats unanimously oppose it.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "The budget resolution, authored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, sets the stage for about $342 billion in increased spending on border security, defense and the Coast Guard.",
      "Graham said the spending would take place over four years and be paid for with reduced spending elsewhere in the federal government, though the resolution itself does not specify how those cuts would occur.",
      "The budget resolution advanced out of committee last week on a party-line vote. It directs the Senate Homeland Security Committee to increase spending by up to $175 billion, the Senate Armed Services Committee to spend up to $150 billion more and the Senate Commerce panel to increase spending by about $20 billion. This is on top of the annual spending that Congress provides through a separate legislative process.",
      "\u201cBuild the wall, deport illegal aliens, and create additional detention space so we don\u2019t have to release illegal immigrants into the community,\" Graham said. \u201cAnd God knows the military needs more money in these dangerous times.\u201d",
      "The Senate proceeded to Graham's budget plan on Tuesday evening, opening it up to 50 hours of debate. Once the debate time has expired \u2014 but before a vote on final passage \u2014 senators will hold what's known in Congress as a \u201cvote-arama.\u201d It's a whirlwind series of votes over several hours in which senators seek to amend the plan.",
      "The votes often last into the early morning hours before exhausted lawmakers decide they've had enough and move to a final vote.",
      "The amendments often are designed to force lawmakers from the other party to take difficult votes on hot-button issues that could prove difficult to explain in the next election cycle.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said Republicans should \"get ready for a late night and an early morning.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are going to make sure the people back home know that Elon Musk is firing VA doctors and food safety inspectors \u2014 for no cause whatsoever \u2014 and illegally defunding the programs that Americans care about,\" Murray said.",
      "Once a budget plan is approved, committees would draft legislation consistent with their instructions to find savings or increase spending in programs under their jurisdiction. But the formal work needed to advance those recommendations can't take place until both the House and Senate pass identical budget plans.",
      "At some point, Republicans in the House and Senate will have to resolve their differences for them to use the tool that will allow the package to pass with a simple majority in the Senate and sidestep a Democratic filibuster. For now, they are competing with each other to win Trump's favor.",
      "The House does have momentum for its efforts after a few weeks of delay. The chamber's Budget panel has advanced its more comprehensive budget plan to the floor on a party-line vote. Speaker Mike Johnson's office said it will come up for a vote in the full chamber next week when the House returns to Washington.",
      "Their plan would allow committees to provide for up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $300 billion in new spending. It would also instruct committees to make at least $1.5 trillion in spending reductions elsewhere in the federal government over the next decade. And it would lift the debt ceiling so that the U.S. can borrow and continue paying its bills.",
      "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog, estimates that the House budget plan would allow for a nearly $4 trillion debt increase over the next decade.",
      "Johnson can spare only one defection if Democrats are unanimous in opposing the plan next week, creating a high-wire act for his leadership team.",
      "Some Republicans have raised concerns about the level of spending cuts that could occur with programs like Medicaid. But those lawmakers will also feel pressure to help Trump enact his priorities or face his wrath for not going along.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A Senate committee voted Thursday to advance Linda McMahon's nomination to serve as President Donald Trump's education secretary, bringing her closer to leading an agency the Republican president wants to shut down.",
      "The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions voted 12-11 along party lines to send her nomination to be considered by the full Senate.",
      "At her confirmation hearing, McMahon said she wants to \u201creorient\u201d the Education Department. Since his campaign, Trump has called for the department to be abolished, but McMahon acknowledged that only Congress could shut it down completely.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d like to make sure that we are presenting a plan that I think our senators could get on board with,\u201d she said.",
      "Pressed on the fate of the agency\u2019s core initiatives, McMahon said Trump wants them to be more efficient but isn\u2019t out to defund them. She suggested certain roles could be moved to other agencies, saying the department\u2019s civil rights arm could go to the Justice Department.",
      "She pledged to preserve federal Title I money for low-income schools, Pell grants for low-income college students and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, all of which were created by Congress.",

      "McMahon, a billionaire Trump ally and former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, brings less experience in education than many others in the role. She was a member of the Connecticut board of education for about a year in 2009, and she\u2019s a longtime trustee at Sacred Heart University. She left the WWE in 2009 and led two unsuccessful bids for the U.S. Senate in Connecticut.",

      "The Trump administration has suspended a program that helped children who come to the U.S. without a parent or guardian navigate the immigration court system",
      "SAN DIEGO -- Children so young their feet can't touch the floor when they sit in courtroom chairs have been left without representation in immigration court because of Trump administration cuts, according to organizations that help these kids navigate the legal system when they arrive in the U.S. without a parent or guardian.",
      "The organizations say the children are at risk because the Trump administration suspended a key program late Tuesday, ordering that the Acacia Center for Justice and its subcontractors immediately stop work on a $200 million contract to provide representation for children entering the country alone.",
      "Daniela Hernandez, an immigration attorney who provides free legal services to about 60 children in Pasadena, California, said during a news conference Wednesday that some of her clients \u2014 who are as young as 2 \u2014 have court hearings as soon as Friday.",
      "\u201cWhat is this 2-year-old client supposed to do without her attorney?\" she said. \"Who will speak for her in court? Who will explain to her and all of our other clients in foster care who have not only nobody, no adult in the United States to care for them, that they will now have to navigate a very complex legal immigration system on their own?\u201d",
      "The Interior Department gave no explanation for the stop-work order, telling the group only that it was done for \u201ccauses outside of your control\u201d and should not be interpreted as a judgment of poor performance. The halt remains in effect until further notice.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the department said it has agreements to support other agencies but does not fund or operate the program and couldn't answer questions about it. The Department of Health and Human Services Department, which oversees unaccompanied migrant children, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "At a San Diego immigration court Wednesday, a 5-year-old girl from Mexico facing deportation sat before Judge Olga Attia. Attia asked if the girl could have some coloring books \u2014 \u201cthat may be a little more fun,\u201d she told her.",
      "As the girl drew, the judge explained the case to her, her 13-year-old sister and her 15-year-old brother. All three children were arrested for crossing the border illegally, without their parents, in March 2024. Their mother attended the hearing -- she entered the U.S. at a different time than her children, who have their own immigration cases.",
      "And they were navigating it all without a lawyer.",
      "The mother said they couldn't afford one. Attia recommended a nonprofit that might give guidance and scheduled another hearing in May.",
      "But with the contract that was ended Tuesday, options for affordable legal guidance are narrowing for this family and thousands of others involving unaccompanied children.",
      "Acacia has a network of 85 organizations nationwide that work with children under 18. About 26,000 migrant children get direct legal representation under the contract while roughly 100,000 get some kind of legal advice, often through presentations lawyers hold for children while they are in government-run shelters just after arriving in the U.S.",
      "People fighting deportation do not have the same right to representation as people going through criminal courts, although they can hire private attorneys.",
      "But there has been some recognition that children navigating the immigration court system without a parent or guardian are especially vulnerable.",
      "The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2008 created special protections for children who arrive in the U.S. without a parent or a legal guardian. It said the government should facilitate legal representation for the children put into deportation proceedings, though it did not mandate every child have a lawyer.",
      "Acacia and its subcontractors recruit and train lawyers and work with private attorneys who provide free legal representation for the children.",
      "Unaccompanied children can request asylum, juvenile immigration status, or visas for victims of sexual exploitation. Most of the children don\u2019t speak English and need interpreters.",
      "\u201cYou have these kids who are thrust into this adult-like situation with very severe consequences,\u201d said Jennifer Podkul, vice president for policy and advocacy at Kids In Need of Defense, citing that about 50% of children have legal representation in immigration court.",

      "Because of the differences in the types of projects funded, China is unlikely to step in as the U.S. retreats, but Beijing still wins because foreign aid is about building relationships and goodwill, said Samantha Custer, director of policy analysis at AidData.",

      "Boren, who went on to serve as president of the University of Oklahoma after retiring from politics, died early Thursday at his home near Newcastle, said Bob Burke, a longtime family friend. He said Boren's death was the result of complications from diabetes.",
      "The son of a Democratic congressman, Boren quickly followed in his father's footsteps into elected office and oversaw a dramatic downsizing of government in Oklahoma, where over decades in legislative corridors and university offices he became one of the state's most influential figures. His son, Dan Boren, also served four terms as an Oklahoma congressman.",
      "In 2019, David Boren cut ties with the university he had led for 24 years amid a probe into allegations that he had sexually harassed male subordinates. Boren denied wrongdoing and the allegations never resulted in charges or civil litigation.",
      "\u201cHe was the smartest person I ever knew,\u201d Burke, an attorney and author who managed Boren\u2019s first campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1978. \u201cHe was a Rhodes Scholar, yet he could communicate with a farmer in overalls on the Main Street of a small Oklahoma town.",

      "Boren served in the U.S. Senate between 1979 and 1994 and was the longest-serving chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. He became president of Oklahoma's largest public university after leaving the Senate and held the position until stepping down in 2018.",
      "\u201cHe saw public service as a noble calling and dedicated his life to it,\u201d Boren's son, Dan Boren, said in a statement. \"The countless heartwarming stories I hear almost daily from people across this state who he helped are reminders of his remarkable life. We shall cherish the memory of his service and remarkable life.\u201d",
      "A year after leaving the University of Oklahoma, a former student alleged he was touched and kissed inappropriately by Boren on several occasions about a decade earlier, allegations that Boren repeatedly denied.",
      "An investigation into Boren\u2019s alleged misconduct by the Jones Day law firm, which ended when Boren severed ties to the university in 2019, was never publicly released. The allegations against Boren tarnished his reputation and led him to withdraw from public life.",
      "Boren served four terms in the Oklahoma House before being elected governor at the age of 33 in 1974, which at the time made him the youngest governor in the country. He ran a reformist campaign that became known as the \u201cBoren Broom Brigade\u201d to demonstrate his pledge to \u201csweep out the old guard.\u201d",
      "As governor, Boren worked to eliminate the inheritance tax, cut the state income tax and reorganize a state government he described as \u201ccluttered\u201d with 214 boards, agencies and commissions.",
      "\u201cThis excessive red tape in government is a constant drain on taxpayer dollars,\u201d Boren once said, adding that the government needed to \u201cget out of the horse and buggy era.\u201d",
      "While in the U.S. Senate, Boren forged close relationships with the leaders of the nation's intelligence community, including former CIA Director George Tenet, whom Boren tapped as the Intelligence Committee's chief of staff prior to Tenet's appointment as CIA director.",
      "On the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, Boren was having breakfast with Tenet at a Washington hotel when Tenet, then CIA director, learned that an aircraft had flown into the World Trade Center tower in New York City. Boren later recalled that neither he nor Tenet was \u201ctotally shocked\u201d by the terrorist attack because the two men had spoken frequently about the possibility of international terrorists launching an attack in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI thought George was obsessed with Osama bin Laden and terrorism around the world,\u201d Boren told The Oklahoman months after the attacks. \u201cI don\u2019t think everything changed Sept. 11; only our perception and understanding changed.\u201d",
      "In the Senate, Boren also helped build bipartisan support to oppose South Africa's oppressive racial apartheid regime ahead of Nelson Mandela\u2019s release from prison in 1990. Shortly after his release, Mandela traveled to the U.S. and appeared as a guest on an ABC News town hall moderated by Ted Koppel. Boren was in the audience and Mandela led a standing ovation after Boren summed up the evils of apartheid and called for its end.",
      "\u201cHe has said all the things that are required to be said in regards to the problems of South Africa,\u201d Mandela said.",
      "During his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Boren also said he was heavily involved with helping influence U.S. policy in Central America, particularly in Nicaragua, during conflict in that country between the right-wing Contras and the leftist Sandinistas, working as an \u201cinformal emissary\u201d for former President George H.W. Bush.",
      "\u201cThe fact that I was in a different party \u2014 and the fact that we trusted each other -- was a big benefit,\u201d Boren told The Oklahoman in 1994.",
      "In 2016, Boren spearheaded a campaign in Oklahoma to adopt a 1 percent sales tax increase that would have raised about $550 million annually for public education, including pay raises for school teachers who were at the time among the lowest paid in the nation. But it was defeated in a statewide referendum.",
      "David Lyle Boren was born on April 21, 1941, in Washington, the son of U.S. Rep. Lyle Hagler Boren and the former Christine McKown. He was married twice, to the late Janna Little Robbins and then to Molly Shi Boren, a former judge, English teacher and president emeritus of the Oklahoma Arts Institute.",
      "Boren suffered from a minor stroke at a statue dedication ceremony in April 2018 and was hospitalized for several days. Boren also underwent heart bypass surgery in March 2017.",
      "Boren is survived by two children, including Dan Boren, the former Oklahoma congressman who is currently secretary of commerce for the Chickasaw Nation.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Hoping to head off a potential trade conflict, a top European Union official stressed the importance of active engagement and fairness in trade during a four-hour meeting with Trump administration officials.",
      "\u201cThe top objective as it was presented to us yesterday by our American partners is reciprocity,\u201d Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the European commissioner for trade and economic security, told reporters at a Thursday briefing.",
      "\u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d met on Wednesday with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and Jamieson Greer, President Donald Trump's nominee to be the U.S. trade representative.",
      "Trump has thrown the decades long partnership between the U.S. and Europe into turmoil by pledging to charge higher taxes on imports from Europe that he says would match the tariffs faced by American products.",
      "But Trump's plan for fair tariffs would also include the value added tax \u2014 which is akin to a sales tax \u2014 charged in Europe that could drastically push up import taxes and potentially trigger a broader trade conflict if the EU imposed retaliatory measures. A broader trade war risks both an economic slowdown and higher inflation that could create financial challenges for millions of families and potentially hurt political support for Trump, as voters in 2024's election specifically wanted him to lower price pressures.",
      "Trump has also proposed separate sectoral tariffs on autos, pharmaceutical drugs and computer chips, in addition to having already imposed 25% steel and aluminum tariffs with no avenues to provide exceptions or exemptions.",
      "The EU official tried in his conversation with White House officials to equate the value added tax as similar to a sales tax as its paid by the final consumer, but he said that the issue had not been resolved.",
      "\u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d also said they discussed the industrial overcapacity of China, particularly in steel, and that the U.S. and EU should work together to tackle that problem, instead of targeting each other.",
      "He stressed that the meeting ended with a focus on looking for ways to \u201cgenerate positive momentum,\u201d adding that the EU would like to \u201csee where we can, like, move first and fast, because I really would like to avoid the pain of measures and countermeasures.\u201d",
      "The EU official said it was critical to establish a personal relationship with his U.S. counterparts.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad that it happened and that we could have such an intense meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I think we will both be thinking how to keep the momentum going on and how to hopefully avoid I would say, the pain.\u201d"

    "summary": "California state lawmakers have announced a bill that would ban the sale of new or refurbished disposable electronic cigarettes",
    "story": [
      "California state lawmakers have announced a bill that would ban the sale of new or refurbished disposable electronic cigarettes",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California could ban the sale of disposable vapes under a bill lawmakers announced Wednesday that is aimed at curbing plastic pollution in the state.",
      "The state has also passed laws in recent years banning single-use plastic bottles in hotels, the sale of Styrofoam food containers and single-use plastic carryout bags at grocery stores.",
      "Vapes, sometimes called electronic cigarettes, are battery-operated devices that contain aerosolized nicotine or cannabis, often with flavorings and other chemicals. Refillable and disposable options are sold, and California's proposal would specifically tackle those that are meant to be thrown away after a single use.",
      "Other countries have considered or approved bans on single-use vape sales, with one taking effect in Belgium on Jan. 1 and another set to begin in the United Kingdom in June. But California would likely be the first U.S. state to enact such a rule. Previous efforts in California and New York have failed.",
      "The California bill would ban the sale or distribution of new or refurbished disposable vapes in the state, beginning Jan. 1, 2026. The proposal would allow local governments or the state to fine people $500 for their first violation of the ban, $1,000 for their second infringement and $2,000 for subsequent offenses.",
      "Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, who authored the bill, said it will help prevent battery acid from single-use vapes from leaching into lands and waterways.",
      "\u201cWe must transition away from these harmful single-use devices, and AB 762 will do just that,\u201d the Southern California Democrat said at a news conference in Sacramento.",
      "The California Grocers Association argued against a similar 2022 proposal, saying that it could lead to increased tobacco smuggling.",
      "Arkan Somo, who co-founded the Neighborhood Market Association, a group of California small businesses, said the new bill would burden family-owned shops that sell tobacco products.",
      "\u201cIf we're going to take the environment as an excuse to keep banning these products, where is that going to stop?\u201d Somo said. \u201cThey're really putting California at a huge disadvantage.\u201d",
      "The state has approved other measures in recent years regulating vape sales. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law in 2020 that banned the sale of most flavored tobacco products with the goal of preventing their use among children.",
      "Many of the recent vape regulations in states have been targeted at addressing risks they pose to public health. California and more than 30 other states have passed laws requiring a tax on e-cigarettes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All states in the U.S. already ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors.",
      "\u201cWhile these products pollute our planet, they're also targeting our most vulnerable among us \u2014 our children,\u201d said Tony Hackett, a policy associate with Californians Against Waste, a nonprofit group supporting the bill. \u201cDisposable vapes are designed for maximum addiction and minimum accountability.\u201d",
      "Part of the appeal of disposable vapes is that they are often more easily accessible and cheaper than refillable devices, said Carolina Saavedra, a staff attorney with the Public Health Law Center at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Minnesota.",
      "But waste from e-cigarettes can contain heavy metals, hazardous lithium-ion batteries that can spark fires and chemical toxins, according to the CDC. The California bill is an \u201cexciting step\u201d to tackle that problem, Saavedra said.",
      "\u201cContinuing to push this conversation and highlight the costliness of this problem and how little \u2014 if any \u2014 benefits at all these items bring, that's going to be huge,\u201d she said.",

      "Here's the latest:",
      "The Resolute Desk, an Oval Office mainstay, \u201cis being lightly refinished,\u201d Trump posted on social media. The desk was built from oak used in the British Arctic exploration ship HMS Resolute, and Queen Victoria gave it as a gift to President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880.",
      "In the meantime, Trump said he would sit at the \u201cC&O\u201d desk previously used by President George H.W. Bush. It was originally built around 1920 for the owners of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, hence the name.",

      "Under terms of the city\u2019s Home Rule authority, Congress already vets all D.C. laws and can outright overturn them.

      "Patel cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee last week by a 12-10, party-line vote.",
      "He is expected to be confirmed unless more than three Republican senators defy Trump\u2019s will and vote against him, which is seen as unlikely.",
      "Patel, a Trump loyalist who has fiercely criticized the agency that he is poised to lead, would inherit an FBI gripped by turmoil. The Justice Department in the last month has forced out a group of senior FBI officials and made a highly unusual demand for the names of thousands of agents who participated in investigations related to Jan. 6.",
      "Trump has said that he expects some of those agents will be fired.",

      "In a joint Fox News Channel interview that aired Tuesday, both insisted they like each other a lot and would stick with their arrangement despite what Trump said were attempts by the media to \u201cdrive us apart.\u201d",
      "At times, Trump sat back as Fox News Channel\u2019s Sean Hannity heaped praise on Musk in an attempt to counteract a Democratic narrative that he\u2019s a callous and unelected force out to destroy the government and upend civil society.",

Fitzpatrick has previously said he would not comment on the investigation until a grand jury has acted.",
      "Body camera video shows officers pummeling Brooks, whose hands are cuffed behind his back. Officers strike him in the chest with a shoe and lift him by the neck and drop him. The video recorded on the night of Dec. 9 has no sound, but the guards meting out the punishment and watching it appear unconcerned. Brooks, 43, died the next day.",

Those employees had previously been accused of either taking part in previous beatings of inmates or letting them continue.",
      "A watchdog group reported \u201crampant abuse by staff\u201d at Marcy after interviewing people incarcerated there in October 2022. The Correctional Association of New York said they were told of physical assaults in locations without cameras, such as between the gates, in vans and in showers.

      "A Michigan appeals court has ruled that Enbridge Energy's plans to build a tunnel around an aging pipeline that runs beneath a Great Lakes channel can continue",
      "Enbridge Energy's plans to build a protective tunnel around an aging pipeline that runs beneath a channel connecting two Great Lakes can continue, a Michigan appeals court ruled.",
      "The state Public Service Commission properly issued permits for the $500 million project, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday in rejecting arguments from environmental groups and Native American tribes that commissioners failed to consider the overall need for the pipeline.",
      "Enbridge wants to build a protective tunnel around a 4-mile (6-kilometer) section of its Line 5 pipeline that runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac, which link Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Enbridge has been using the pipeline since 1953 to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario.",
      "Concerns about a potentially catastrophic spill in the straits have been building since 2017, when Enbridge officials revealed that engineers had known about gaps in the pipeline's coating in the straits since 2014. Fears of a spill escalated in 2018 when a boat anchor damaged the line.",
      "Enbridge officials maintain that the line is structurally sound, but they still reached an agreement with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder\u2019s administration in 2018 that calls for the company to build the protective tunnel.",
      "The Michigan Public Service Commission issued state permits for the project in December 2023. Environmental groups including the Michigan Environmental Council and the National Wildlife Federation, along with the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, and the Nottawseppi Huron band of the Potawatomi asked the appellate court last year to reverse the commission's decision.",
      "The groups and the tribes alleged that the commission improperly considered only the public need for the tunnel rather than whether the entire pipeline as a whole is still necessary. They also argued the commission failed to adequately consider petroleum products' greenhouse gas impacts.",
      "The appellate court found that the commission issued a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d opinion and acted reasonably. It said there was no basis for a reversal or to order the commission to revisit its decision.",
      "David Scott, a senior attorney for the Environmental Law & Policy Center and the Michigan Climate Action Network, which are also plaintiffs in the case, said in an email that he was disappointed with the ruling and considering further moves. He didn't elaborate. Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy praised the decision, saying the tunnel will make a safe pipeline even safer.",
      "The ruling Wednesday doesn't end the legal battle over the tunnel. Current Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, opposes the continued operation of Line 5 even if it's encased in a tunnel. Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a lawsuit in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows the line to run beneath the straits. That case is pending in state court in Ingham County. A ruling could come any day.",
      "Enbridge still needs federal construction permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, although environmentalists fear that President Donald Trump's administration will fast-track that process after Trump declared a national energy emergency on his first day in office."

McBurney reasoned that privacy rights under Georgia\u2019s state constitution include the right to make personal healthcare decisions.",

Brian Kemp in 2019, was one of a wave of restrictive abortion measures that took effect in Republican-controlled states after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a national right to abortion. It prohibits most abortions once a \u201cdetectable human heartbeat\u201d was present.

      "PANAMA CITY -- Panama\u2019s president said Thursday that he had instructed the country\u2019s foreign minister to not discuss the U.S. government\u2019s allegations of Chinese interference in the operations of the Panama Canal with the visiting head of U.S. Southern Command.",
      "The comments followed a dustup the day before when the U.S. embassy in Panama said one of the agenda items for Adm. Alvin Holsey\u2019s visit would be discussing \u201cefforts to protect the canal area from Chinese Communist Party influence & control.\u201d",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Panama quickly shot back with a statement saying the country has \u201cnever participated in the management nor operation of the Panama Canal.\u201d It called allegations by the Trump administration that China controls the canal \u201cpure lies.\u201d It accused the U.S. government of trying to \u201csabotage\u201d relations between China and Panama, but said its efforts will fail.",
      "Mulino waded into the dispute Thursday morning at his weekly press briefing, expressing exasperation over the persistence of the issue since before Trump took office threatening to take back control of the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cWe are not going to speak of lies,\u201d Mulino said. \u201cThat would be to expand on the fascination created over the issue of China in Panama and the control of the Communist Party of the canal. For the love of God.\u201d",
      "Mulino has earlier tried to calm the situation with a post on the social platform X. \u201cThe bilateral agenda with the U.S. is important and relevant,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, for Panama, that does not mean analyzing situations that aren\u2019t true. We aren\u2019t going to speak about what is not reality, but rather those issues that interest both countries.\u201d",
      "Mulino said Thursday that Panama has a team of people working in Washington, not only lobbying on the issue of the canal, but also trying to change the narrative in news coverage of the issue.",
      "Holsey met with the Panama Canal\u2019s administrator Thursday to discuss its strategic importance.",
      "The admiral is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Panama since Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited earlier this month.",
      "China\u2019s alleged influence on the canal was at the top of his agenda, along with Panama\u2019s efforts to assist the U.S. in controling immigration.",
      "U.S. concerns focus on a Hong Kong-based consortium that runs port facilities at either end of the canal. The canal itself is managed and operated by Panama and Panama has said the consortium\u2019s 25-year extension to run the ports is being audited.",
      "Trump has also complained that U.S. warships are charged for transiting while also obligated to protect it.",
      "The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter."

    "story": [
      "An Arkansas woman whose stillborn child was among the human remains that were sold as part of a national scheme is pushing for a state law",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A year had passed since Doneysha Smith suffered a stillbirth and the memories of her loss lingered in 2023. The cremated remains of her child were kept in a tiny urn in her house and on a necklace she wore, and a memorial service had marked her family's loss with mourners releasing blue, white and yellow balloons into the sky.",
      "But the FBI had reached out to the Arkansas woman with shocking news: The urn and necklace didn't contain her child's ashes and the body had been sold as part of a multistate scheme that bought and sold human remains.",
      "\u201cMy son wasn't even able to get to his final resting place,\u201d Smith said during an interview at her home in Sherwood, located outside Little Rock.",
      "Now Smith and her mother are advocating for a new law in Arkansas that would make selling human remains that were supposed to be cremated or buried a felony. The proposal is called Lux's Law, after the name she gave her child. The Senate passed the measure this week and it's pending before a House panel.",
      "Candace Chapman Scott, a former mortuary worker, pleaded guilty in federal court last year to charges that she sold 24 boxes of stolen body parts and fetal remains to a Pennsylvania man for nearly $11,000. The remains included Lux's body.",
      "Scott, who was sentenced last month to 15 years in federal prison, was among several charged in what prosecutors have called a nationwide scheme to steal and sell human body parts from an Arkansas mortuary and Harvard Medical School.",
      "State Sen. Fred Love, a Democrat from Little Rock, said he introduced the measure after speaking with Smith's mother, Lynnell Logan, at a community event and learning there weren't any state laws specifically barring the sale of stolen human remains.",
      "Love said such a law is needed at the state level, noting how the scheme included people in multiple states exchanging messages and pictures on Facebook about the body parts being sold. Love's proposal calls for a fine of up to $10,000 and between three and 10 years in prison for anyone convicted.",
      "\u201cThis is another form of trafficking,\u201d Love said. \u201cWe must do something to stop it.\u201d",
      "Smith and her mother said the news that Lux's body had been sold and that the ashes they received weren't his reopened wounds. To this day, the family doesn't know whether the ashes they received were human remains, Logan said.",
      "\u201cIt was like reliving his passing all over again and then you're thinking about how he was shipped everywhere, and who all handled him,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWho would do this to a baby?\u201d",
      "Only eight states broadly prohibit the sale of human remains, according to Tanya Marsh, a law professor at Wake Forest University School of Law who is an expert in laws regarding human remains.",
      "The Arkansas proposal isn't as broad as those measures since it only applies to bodies that were intended to be cremated or buried. Arkansas already has laws prohibiting the \u201cabuse of a corpse.\u201d",
      "Minnesota last year enacted a law making it a felony to buy and sell human bones, and the lawmaker behind the measure cited examples of oddities shops and websites selling human skulls.",
      "Many people are surprised when they learn that there's a private market for human remains, Marsh said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a shadow area of commerce that most of us don't have exposure to this,\u201d Marsh said.",
      "Lux's remains have been returned to Smith, and his ashes now are in a tiny urn inside a lantern that sits on the mantle.",
      "\u201cWhen tomorrow starts without me don't think we're far apart for every time you think of me I'm right here in your heart,\u201d the glass door of the lantern read.",
      "Smith also has a gold necklace that contains some of his ashes, and she keeps it on a teddy bear in her bedroom when she's not wearing it. The FBI returned Lux's body to the family the same day as last year's eclipse \u2014 something the family views as symbolic.",
      "With the legislation, Smith said her child is living up to the name her family gave him after her stillbirth \u2014 Lux Siloam. \u201cLux\u201d is Latin for \u201clight\u201d and \u201cSiloam\u201d is Greek for \u201csent.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven after passing away, he is still working and kind of moving things around and shining light on something so dark that people need to be aware of,\u201d Smith said."

      "The blogger, Jack LaSota, 34, of Berkeley, California, was arrested Sunday along with Michelle Zajko, 32, of Media, Pennsylvania, and Daniel Blank, 26, of Sacramento, California. They face charges including trespassing, obstructing and hindering and possession of a handgun in a vehicle.",
      "The Zizians have been tied to the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland near the Canadian border in January and five other killings in three states.",
      "LaSota, Zajko and Blank were arrested in Frostburg, Maryland, on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The judge in the case ordered LaSota held without bail citing concerns about her being a flight risk and a danger to public safety. Prosecutors said LaSota \u201cappears to be the leader of an extremist group known as Zizians\u201d that has been linked to killings.",
      "The three were expected to appear remotely for a bail hearing Tuesday at Allegany District Court in Cumberland, Maryland, court officials said.",

      "Maximilian Snyder, who applied for a marriage license with Youngblut in November, is charged with the Jan. 17 stabbing death of Curtis Lind, a Vallejo landlord who had survived an earlier attack by members of the Zizian group and was set to testify against them.",

      "LaSota, who used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman, railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.",
      "LaSota has not responded to emails from the AP in recent weeks, and her attorney Daniel McGarrigle declined to comment on whether she is connected to any of the deaths. She\u2019s wanted for arrest in two states for missing court appearances.",
      "McGarrigle would only confirm Monday that he has represented LaSota and wouldn't confirm her arrest or any details of the latest case. Attempts to reach attorneys for Zajko and Blank were not successful.",
      "Pennsylvania state police records describe Daniel Blank as Michelle Zajko\u2019s housemate in Vermont. In January 2023, police investigating the shooting deaths of Zajko\u2019s parents detained both LaSota and Blank at a hotel where Zajko was staying. Blank was not charged.

      "NEW YORK -- Justice Department lawyers and New York City Mayor Eric Adams are set to face a federal judge who is signaling that he\u2019s unlikely to rubber stamp their request to drop the mayor's corruption charges weeks before an April trial.",
      "Judge Dale E. Ho in Manhattan scheduled the Wednesday afternoon hearing after three government lawyers from Washington made the dismissal request on Friday. Manhattan\u2019s top federal prosecutor resigned after she refused an order to do so.",
      "Ho already indicated that the hearing was likely to be only an initial step when he wrote in an order Tuesday that one subject on the agenda will be a discussion of \u201cprocedure for resolution of the motion.\u201d",
      "Also set for discussion are the reasons for the request to dismiss the indictment against the Democrat that charges the first-term mayor with accepting over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy his influence while he was Brooklyn borough president. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Early last week, Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove told prosecutors in New York in a memo to drop the charges because the prosecution \u201chas unduly restricted Mayor Adams\u2019 ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.\u201d He said charges could be reinstated after November's mayoral election.",
      "Two days later, then-interim U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi, saying Bove's request to drop charges in return for assistance in enforcing federal immigration laws would betray Bondi's own words that she \"will not tolerate abuses of the criminal justice process, coercive behavior, or other forms of misconduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cDismissal of the indictment for no other reason than to influence Adams\u2019s mayoral decision-making would be all three,\u201d Sassoon, a Republican, said of what she called a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d deal as she offered to resign. She also said prosecutors were about to bring additional obstruction of justice charges against Adams.",
      "Bove responded to Sassoon with apparent anger, accepting her resignation and accusing her of \u201cpursuing a politically motivated prosecution despite an express instruction to dismiss the case.\u201d He then informed her that two prosecutors assigned to the case were suspended with pay and that an investigation would determine if they keep their jobs.",
      "If either of those prosecutors wished to comply with his directive to dismiss charges, he welcomed them to do so, but Hagan Scotten quit the following day, writing in a resignation letter that he supported Sassoon's actions.",
      "Scotten wrote to Bove that it would take a \u201cfool\u201d or a \u201ccoward\u201d to meet his demand to drop the charges, \u201cbut it was never going to be me.\u201d",
      "In all, seven prosecutors, including five high-ranking prosecutors at the Justice Department in Washington, had resigned by Friday.",
      "Since then, a small army of former prosecutors have gotten behind the defiant stand by Sassoon and other prosecutors.",
      "On Friday, seven former Manhattan U.S. attorneys, including James Comey, Geoffrey S. Berman and Mary Jo White, issued a statement lauding Sassoon\u2019s \u201ccommitment to integrity and the rule of law.\u201d",
      "On Monday, three former U.S. attorneys from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut submitted papers to Ho suggesting that he appoint a special prosecutor if he finds the Justice Department acted improperly or that he order all evidence be made available to state and local prosecutors.",
      "A former Watergate prosecutor filed papers separately, telling the judge to reject the government's request and consider assigning a special counsel to explore the legal issues and ultimately consider appointing an independent special prosecutor to try the case.",
      "Also Monday, Justice Connection, an organization advocating for Justice Department employees, released a letter signed by over 900 former federal prosecutors to career federal prosecutors that said they have \u201cwatched with alarm\u201d as values \u201cfoundational to a fair and justice legal system\u201d have been tested.",
      "In the letter, the former prosecutors said they \u201csalute and admire the courage many of you have already exhibited. You have responded to ethical challenges of a type no public servant should ever be forced to confront with principle and conviction, in the finest traditions of the Department of Justice.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Alex Spiro, a lawyer for the mayor, wrote to the judge, saying those who believed that Adams struck a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d with prosecutors were wrong.",
      "\u201cThere was no quid pro quo. Period,\u201d he said."

      "The presidents of the United Steelworkers, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers argue that China's efforts have hurt American workers and national security.",
      "In the letter obtained by The Associated Press, they urged Trump to \u201cimpose tough penalties against vessels built according to the plans, policies, and actions of the Chinese Communist Party and to adopt complementary policies that rebuild America's shipbuilding capacity and workforce.\u201d",
      "Last year under President Joe Biden, the unions filed a petition seeking to address China\u2019s shipbuilding under Section 301 of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act, hoping to start a process by which tariffs and other measures could be enacted.",
      "The letter notes China manufactured more than 1,000 ocean-going vessels in 2023, while the United States made fewer than 10 ships. It adds that the Chinese shipbuilding industry received more than $100 billion in government support from 2010 to 2018, such that Chinese shipyards accounted for the majority of worldwide orders last year.",
      "\u201cAs a shipyard worker myself, out of Bath Iron Works in Maine, I have seen firsthand the crippling impacts of China\u2019s predatory actions on our domestic shipbuilding industry,\u201d Brian Bryant, the machinists and aerospace workers union president, said in a separate statement. \u201cFor decades, we\u2019ve seen everything from layoffs to shipyard closures to atrophy of our domestic shipbuilding industrial base.",
      "Trump has made control of the Panama Canal and resetting the global terms of trade with tariffs a key priority.

      "Government finances showed a large surplus last month after a surge in tax receipts but the figure missed official forecasts, increasing pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to meet her own fiscal rules.",
      "The surplus - the difference between what the government spends and the tax it takes in - was \u00a315.4bn in January, which is the highest level for the month since records began more than three decades ago.",
      "However, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, had predicted that the surplus would be higher at \u00a320.5bn.",
      "The smaller figure has added to growing speculation that Reeves will either have to cut public spending or raise taxes further to meet her self-imposed rules for the economy.",

    "story": [
      "A meeting between Chinese president Xi Jinping and some of the country's foremost business leaders this week has fuelled excitement and speculation, after Alibaba founder Jack Ma was pictured at the event.",
      "The charismatic and colourful Mr Ma, who was one of China's most prominent businessmen, had withdrawn from public life after criticising China's financial sector in 2020.",
      "His reappearance at Monday's event has sparked a wave of discussion, with experts and analysts wondering what it means for him, China's tech sector and the economy in general.",
      "The response has been overwhelmingly positive - tech stocks, including those of Alibaba, rallied soon after the event.",
      "On Thursday, the e-commerce giant reported financial results that beat expectations, with shares ending the trading day in New York more than 8% higher. The company's shares are up 60% since the beginning of the year.",
      "So what are analysts reading into Mr Ma's appearance at the event alongside other high-profile guests - including DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng?",
      "Is Jack Ma 'rehabilitated'?",
      "Analysts began looking for clues about the significance of the meeting as soon as Chinese state media started releasing pictures of the event.",
      "\"Jack Ma's attendance, his seating in the front row, even though he did not speak, and his handshake with Xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated,\" China analyst Bill Bishop wrote.",
      "Social media was abuzz with users praising Mr Ma for his return to the public spotlight.",
      "\"Congratulations [Jack] Ma for the safe landing,\" said one user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "\"The comeback of [Jack] Ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy,\" said another.",
      "It is unsurprising that observers have attached so much significance to an appearance by Mr Ma.",
      "Before his disappearance from public life in 2020 - following comments at a financial conference that China's state-owned banks had a \"pawn-shop mentality\" - Mr Ma was the poster boy for China's tech industry.",
      "An English teacher with no background in computing, Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba in his apartment more than two decades ago after convincing a group of friends to invest in his online marketplace.",
      "He went on to build one of China's largest tech conglomerates and become one of the country's richest men.",
      "That was before his \"pawn shop\" comment, when he also lamented the \"lack of innovation\" in the country's banks.",
      "It led to the cancellation of his $34.5bn (\u00a327.4bn) stock market flotation of  Ant Group, his financial technology giant.",
      "This was seen at the time as an attempt by Beijing to humble a company that had become too powerful, and a leader who had become too outspoken.",
      "Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.",
      "Some caution, however, that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed.",
      "Also, the lack of coverage his attendance received in Chinese media outlets seems to confirm he has not been completely rehabilitated.",
      "Is the crackdown on the tech industry over?",
      "Xi Jinping told participants at the symposium that their companies needed to innovate, grow and remain confident despite China's economic challenges, which he described as \"temporary\" and \"localised\".",
      "He also said it was the \"right time for private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to fully display their talents\".",
      "This has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces.",
      "Mr Ma's downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on China's tech industry.",
      "Companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules, as well as state control over important digital assets.",
      "Other companies across the private sector, ranging from education to real estate, also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the \"common prosperity\" campaign.",
      "The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.",
      "But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors.",
      "This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.",
      "Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough.",
      "As rumours that Mr Ma would attend Monday's meeting began to spread, so did a glimmer of hope. Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership \"had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand\".",
      "Aside from Mr Ma and Mr Liang, the list of guests also included key figures from companies such as telecommunications and smartphone firm Huawei, electric-vehicle (EV) giant BYD, and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors.",
      "\"The [guest] list showcased the importance of internet/tech/AI/EV sectors given their representation of innovation and achievement,\" said a note from market analysts at Citi.",
      "\"[It] likely indicates the importance of technology... and the contribution of private enterprises to the development and growth of China's economy.\"",
      "Those present at the meeting seemed to share that sentiment. Lei Jun, the chief executive of consumer electronics giant Xiaomi, told state media that he senses the president's \"care and support\" for businesses.",
      "Is it because of US sanctions?",
      "The symposium took place after the country experienced what some observers have described as a \"Sputnik moment\": the arrival of DeepSeek's disruptive R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model at the end of last month.",
      "Soon after its release, the Chinese-made AI chatbot rose through the ranks to become one of the most downloaded in the world. It also triggered a sudden sell-off of major US tech stocks, as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Back in China, the app's global success has sparked a wave of national pride that has quickly spread to financial markets. Investment has been pouring into Chinese stocks - particularly those of tech companies - listed in Hong Kong and mainland China.",
      "Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment.",
      "But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs.",
      "Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities.",
      "The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\".",
      "Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI.",
      "The goal is to achieve \"socialist modernisation\" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology.",
      "Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board.",
      "\"Rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny, [Jack Ma's] reappearance suggests that Beijing is pivoting from crackdowns to controlled engagement,\" an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, Marina Zhang told the BBC.",
      "\"While the private sector remains a critical pillar of China's economic ambitions, it must align with national priorities - including self-reliance in key technologies and strategic industries.\""

    "summary": "Quantum computers will be able to crack existing encryption and threaten critical infrastructure.",
    "story": [
      "Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky.",
      "Much to everyone's relief the impact turned out to be minimal.",
      "Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world\u2019s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated.",
      "That\u2019s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack.",
      "Quantum computing is radically different to the \u201cclassical\u201d computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states \u2013 one or zero, on or off \u2013 quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions.",
      "\u201cThe reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,\u201d Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's \u201cmuch, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.\u201d",
      "This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.",
      "The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today\u2019s computer networks.",
      "Today\u2019s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes.",
      "This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. \u201cAnything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,\u201d says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2.",
      "Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away.",
      "But progress is being made.",
      "In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer\".",
      "Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today\u2019s systems have a few hundred at most.",
      "But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.",
      "Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, \u201cWhat data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?\u201d",
      "That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe.",
      "Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break.",
      "The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.",
      "The agency said these would \u201csecure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.\u201d It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.",
      "The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,\u201d says Mr France.",
      "Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. \u201cThe challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),\u201d he continues.",

    "summary": "The UK's largest water and waste company was set to run out of money by the end of March.",
    "story": [
      "Thames Water has won a crucial High Court battle to secure a \u00a33bn rescue loan, staving off the prospect of the debt-laden company coming under government control.",
      "The UK's largest water and waste company was set to run out of cash by the end of March and would have likely been placed into temporary nationalisation to keep services running.",
      "The court decision on Tuesday has given Thames breathing space to undergo a major restructuring, but the future of the company remains uncertain as it struggles with \u00a319bn worth of debt and the ruling is set to be appealed.",
      "Thames has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "The supplier serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people.",
      "Since the dire state of the company's finances first emerged about 18 months ago, the government has been on standby to put Thames into special administration.",
      "Regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies and waste services to households will continue as normal.",
      "The water regulator, Ofwat, said Thames Water remained \"subject to our turnaround oversight regime and safeguards are in place to ensure that services to customers are protected\".",
      "Thames has said the \u00a33bn in emergency funding will give it the space needed to complete a restructuring of its debts and attract a cash injection from prospective new investors.",
      "But the proposals had to be approved by the High Court after a group of Thames Water's creditors opposed it, arguing that the 9.75% interest rate on the loan was too costly.",
      "In approving the lifeline, Mr Justice Leech ruled that the \"relevant alternative\" to the company's plan being approved was temporary nationalisation, known as a Special Administration Regime.",
      "\"After taking into account the public interest in ensuring the uninterrupted provision of vital public services, I nevertheless exercise my discretion to sanction the plan,\" he said.",
      "He also added that Ofwat and the Environment Secretary had \"not opposed the plan\".",
      "Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "How much sewage is released into lakes, rivers and the sea?",
      "The Thames Water creditors in favour of the company's plan said the judgement was a \"positive step towards efforts to deliver a highly complex operational turnaround and restructuring\" and avoided \"billions in additional costs on UK taxpayers\".",
      "However, the group of creditors opposed to the deal confirmed they would appeal against the court's decision, after the judge granted them permission to do so.",
      "The group had argued an alternative \"B plan\" would provide the company with the same funding but on better terms and said it was \"disappointed\" by the ruling.",
      "\"Having this judgement reviewed by the Court of Appeal is essential against the backdrop of predatory lending to an essential utility with a clear public interest,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "'Good money after bad'",
      "Thames Water chairman Sir Adrian Montague said the ruling marked a \"significant milestone\" for the company while chief executive Chris Weston said it put \"our business on a firmer financial footing\".",
      "However, Charlie Maynard, Liberal Democrat MP for Witney in Oxfordshire, said he would appeal against the decision.",
      "The politician, who gave a witness statement to the High Court opposing the loan, said: \"Allowing Thames Water to take on \u00a33bn more debt is not in the interests of their millions of customers\".",
      "Henry Swithinbank, policy and advocacy manager at environmental charity Surfers Against Sewage, said the cash lifeline was a \"sticking plaster that will allow Thames Water to limp along until it requires another bailout\".",
      "Thames Water's problems have been blamed on a combination of poor historical regulation, actions by shareholders, climate change and management failure.",
      "Some have argued Thames should have been allowed to collapse and be nationalised due to it being the architect of its own misfortune. Previous owners loaded the company with debt and took out big dividends.",
      "But others, including water companies, have argued that a growing population and the challenges of a changing climate mean bills need to be higher and were kept at lower levels for too long.",
      "The first \u00a31.5bn of the rescue loans to Thames Water will see the company through to the autumn.",
      "A second instalment will be used to fund the company as it appeals a decision by Ofwat over how much Thames can raise household bills by \u2013 a process which could take up to a year.",
      "The company was set to repay \u00a3200m worth of debt due in March, but following the court ruling, all its debt repayments have been extended by two years.",
      "Last week, Thames launched an appeal to allow it to increase bills by more than the regulator had granted.",
      "Ofwat has capped bill rises at 35% over the next five years, but Thames has argued they need to increase by 53%.",
      "Five other water companies - Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Southern Water, and Wessex Water along with water-only company South East Water - have also said they will appeal to allow them to increase bills beyond Ofwat's cap.",
      "In total, the six companies serve more than half of all households in England.",
      "David Henderson, chief executive of the trade association Water UK said the extra money is need for water infrastructure investment.",
      "Six firms have said they will not appeal: Severn Trent, United Utilities, Pennon plus Dwr Cymru Welsh Water, SES and Hafren."

    "summary": "Elon Musk's goal might be hindering the growth potential of the AI firm of his rival Sam Altman, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI's board of directors has officially rejected Elon Musk's nearly $100bn offer for the maker of what is the world's best-known artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT.",
      "But the unsolicited bid might not be a failure - at least as far as Musk is concerned, experts say.",
      "That's because the offer could still complicate CEO Sam Altman's plans to transform OpenAI from a non-profit controlled entity to a for-profit company.",
      "Musk is \"basically trying to stymie OpenAI's growth trajectory,\" said University of Cambridge associate teaching professor Johnnie Penn in an interview with the BBC.",
      "Profit & non-profit",
      "Last week, Musk and a consortium of investors including Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel tabled a $97.4bn (\u00a378.4bn) offer for all of OpenAI's assets.",
      "It was a huge sum - but less than the $157bn the firm was valued at in a funding round just four months ago, and much lower than the $300bn that some think it is worth now.",
      "Complicating all of this is OpenAI's unusual structure which involves a partnership between non-profit and for-profit arms.",
      "Mr Altman is understood to want to change that, stripping it of its non-profit board.",
      "That involves costs which Mr Musk is seemingly trying to inflate.",
      "\"What Musk is trying to do here is raise the perceived value of the non-profit arm of OpenAI, so that OpenAI has to pay more to get out of the obligations it has to its own non-profit,\" said Dr Penn.",
      "The value of its non-profit assets isn't clear. With his bid, Musk was floating a price, according to Cornell University senior lecturer Lutz Finger, who is also the founder and CEO of AI startup R2Decide.",
      "\"By Musk putting a price tag on the non-profit part, he makes the split way more expensive for Altman to do,\" Mr Finger told the BBC. \"It's very simple.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "'Missed the AI train'",
      "Mr Musk justified his actions by saying he wants to return OpenAI - which he co-founded - to its non-profit roots and original mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity.",
      "Others, though, suggest he has somewhat less noble motives linked to his own AI company xAI and chatbot Grok, which have received a lacklustre response from the public.",
      "\"Musk has missed the AI train, somewhat. He's behind, and he has made several attempts to catch up,\" Mr Finger said.",
      "Now, Mr Finger says, Mr Musk is trying to kneecap his most formidable competitor.",
      "An already-tense relationship appeared to worsen further last week with Mr Altman taunting Mr Musk's offer on X, and Mr Musk retorting by calling his onetime partner a \"swindler\".",
      "Mr Altman then hit back in an interview with Bloomberg, opining that Mr Musk is not \"a happy person\" and saying his decisions are made from a \"position of insecurity\".",

      "He is the founder and honorary chairman of the country's ruling party, Georgian Dream.",

      "With an estimated wealth of $4.9bn (\u00a33.9bn), Mr Ivanishvili made his money in 1990s Russia, in computing, metals and banking. Most of his wealth is believed to be tucked away in offshore companies.",
      "Georgia was plunged into political crisis and daily street protests last May when the country's MPs passed the contentious \"transparency on foreign influence bill\", often dubbed the \"foreign agents law\".",
      "Under this legislation, media and non-governmental organisations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad have to register as \"organisations acting in the interest of a foreign power\", submit themselves to stringent audits, or face punitive fines. It was widely seen as a move to prevent US and other Western influence on the country.",
      "Protests then continued when the Georgian Dream-led government won disputed parliamentary elections in October. Protests were spurred again at the start of December when it said it would be putting EU accession talks on hold.",
      "Hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested and severely beaten up by the police.",
      "In response to this crackdown, the US government announced sanctions against Mr Ivanishvili at the end of last year.",

    "summary": "Inside the school where a controversial new head warns against \"hiding behind words like wellbeing\".",
    "story": [
      "Head teacher Alun Ebenezer is no stranger to headlines about his hard-line approach to discipline.",
      "Dubbed by one newspaper as the \"head from hell\", the latest controversy has focused on his decision to introduce detentions on Saturdays.",
      "But as the recently appointed head of 1,300-pupil Caldicot School in Monmouthshire, which has been plagued by issues in recent years including teachers striking over violence in classrooms, Mr Ebenezer said he was unapologetic about a focus on \"strict discipline and firm boundaries\".",
      "He was also critical of what he called a culture of \"hiding behind words like 'wellbeing'\" and \"mollycoddling\" children.",
      "School plagued by bad behaviour brings in Saturday detentions",
      "School head defends rule over length of skirts",
      "\"[We] have a zero-tolerance towards defiance,\" said Mr Ebenezer who, within days of taking the reins at the comprehensive school in June 2024, hit the headlines with reports of children being sent home as part of a school uniform clampdown.",
      "\"So people saying 'no, not doing it' or walking away [swearing] - zero tolerance,\" he added.",
      "Mr Ebenezer told BBC News that two or three families had taken their children out of the school as they felt that his policies were too strict.",
      "He said most parents had been supportive, but about 20 to 30 had objected to the new behaviour policy he introduced in September.",
      "'People confuse strict with nasty'",
      "The school asks parents to come into lessons and sit next to their child if they misbehave in class.",
      "\"I can say to you that we've never had to ask the same parent in twice - it's effective,\" said Mr Ebenezer.",
      "The school also carries out detentions - meaning pupils being kept in school after-hours as a punishment - either on the same day or on a Saturday.",
      "\"We operate a same-day detention policy, which we think works,\" he said.",
      "\"Apparently in Wales it's illegal, because we have to give parents 24 hours' notice so that they know where their children are.\"",
      "Schools are entitled to hold Saturday detentions, except on weekends immediately before and after half-term holidays.",
      "But legislation requires parents to be given at least 24 hours' notice in writing of any detention that will take place outside school sessions if the pupil is at a school in Wales, a requirement which was repealed in England in 2011.",
      "\"The reason we've done [same-day detentions] is because if I'm badly behaved today, I want to be sorted out today,\" said Mr Ebenezer.",
      "Mr Ebenezer was asked to take over at the school after a difficult period which saw teachers striking over \"violent and abusive behaviour\" by pupils.",
      "\"My firm belief is what all young people need is strict discipline and firm boundaries,\" said Mr Ebenezer.",
      "Each morning, senior staff greet pupils and check that coats are off, ties are on and skirts are the right length.",
      "\"I do think uniform's important,\" Mr Ebenezer said.",
      "\"I want [pupils] to give the right impression.\"",
      "He has also introduced a \"solid front door\" policy for wellbeing areas, meaning that pupils must be referred there by staff.",
      "\"We understand that there are some pupils in this school who need proper wellbeing help,\" he said.",
      "\"But let those young people get the help they need, not be at the back of the queue from a hundred people who don't want to be in physics.\"",
      "A recent report by education inspectors Estyn found behaviour at the school had improved but said it was still in need of \"significant improvement\".",
      "It said there was work to do on attendance, safeguarding and developing pupils' skills.",
      "One of the senior team, Hayley Moseley, is in her 15th year at Caldicot School and said she had seen \"lots of changes, lots of different styles of management\".",
      "She said there had been difficulties, but felt the culture in the school was starting to change and that pupils seemed \"happier\".",
      "Pupil Lilly-Belle, 12, was told off in her first week at the school because she was wearing her sister's old skirts which were not the right length.",
      "She said the approach could be \"a bit strict sometimes\" but added: \"It's better to be strict than not strict at all.\"",
      "Caden, 12, said he had been pulled up for an untucked shirt but said he was comfortable with the rules: \"I'm quite happy with them and they're good.\"",
      "Parent Katherine, who has two sons at the school, said the change in approach was initially a shock.",
      "\"It was a bit military - some people called it draconian,\" she said.",
      "\"But sometimes you need that shock to kind of get everybody singing from the same hymn sheet.\"",
      "Mr Ebenezer said he wanted to make Caldicot School one of the top 20 in Wales.",
      "\"It's about doing the right thing,\" he said.",
      "He said his focus was on \"high standards of uniform and appearance, punctuality, attendance, behaviour, attitude\" and said prevailing approaches to behaviour were misguided.",
      "\"It's definitely too soft. I think people confuse strict with nasty,\" he said.",
      "\"Strict is no nonsense - you do this, this happens. No means no, it's not nasty.",
      "\"I think at the moment we are indulging and we are hiding behind words like wellbeing and safe spaces and it's making things unsafe and is damaging people's wellbeing.\"",
      "Mr Ebenezer said he and his staff needed to be \"allowed to do what we need to do and not be inhibited by ridiculous bureaucracy\".",
      "\"We will be safest, happiest and flourish most when we bring back firm discipline, strict boundaries and we can get on with it,\" he added.",

      "A review of a controversial school sex survey which was first requested almost three years ago is to be published in the next month, the Scottish government has said.",
      "It comes after the boss of the UK's Office of Statistics Regulation (OSR) wrote to them demanding that the long-awaited review be published within 30 days.",
      "The Scottish government's Health and Wellbeing census first hit the headlines in 2021 after asking pupils as young as 14 about their sexual experiences.",
      "The OSR wrote to the Scottish government in 2022 warning that they had \"underestimated the significance\" the survey would have for parents and calling for a review of how the questions were designed and the way it was tested.",
      "In a strongly-worded letter seen by BBC Scotland News, the director of the OSR, Ed Humpherson, has now demanded that the government publish the review within 30 days.",
      "He said it was key to providing users with important methodological information that would support transparency and trust in the Scottish government.",
      "In response, the Scottish government said it would publish the review within the 30-day deadline.",
      "It also said the chief statistician for Scotland - Alastair McAlpine - would reply to Mr Humpherson's letter shortly.",
      "In the letter, the UK stats watchdog boss told Mr McAlpine that the Code of Practice for Statistics set out a requirement for his role to show \"independent decision-making and leadership\".",
      "The code says that the chief statistician should have \"sole authority\" for deciding on methods, standards and procedures of official statistics.",
      "Mr Humpherson asked Mr McAlpine to provide \"assurance on the processes and governance within the Scottish government that allow you to carry out this role effectively\".",
      "The Health and Wellbeing census was organised and promoted by the Scottish government but half of Scotland's 32 councils pulled out following concerns about a lack of informed consent and worries over the anonymity of pupils.",
      "In the end, about 130,000 pupils answered the questions online in classrooms and were told that their answers would not be shared.",
      "The questions that were asked varied for different age groups but those in S4 (ages 14 and 15) were asked about their sexual relationships and contraception.",
      "One question asks: \"People have varying degrees of sexual experience. How much, if any, sexual experience have you had?\"",
      "The multiple choice answers include \"oral sex\" and \"vaginal or anal sex\".",
      "At the time of the survey, campaigners warned that it must protect children's right to privacy and give informed consent.",
      "However, consent was done on an \"opt-out\" basis, meaning parents or pupils had to specifically refuse to take part.",
      "Parents said they were not told the nature of the questions in advance and were not asked to agree that their children's private information could be shared.",
      "'Full transparency'",
      "Gavin Yates, the executive director of parents' organisation Connect, said it was really disappointing that years later there still was not \"full transparency\" about the survey.",
      "\"Finding out what young people think is really important but data must be collected in an ethical, open way with proper opt-in consent,\" he said.",
      "\"It's clear that it's time for the full review to be published so we can establish what happened and how protocols will need be changed to put things right.",
      "\"If the parents that initially raised this issue were listened to at the time then these matters could have been properly dealt with years ago.\"",

      "Sir Robert said the procedures were outwith the remit of the OSR but he noted that the Scottish government had been asked to review the approach it took to question development including the \"legal and ethical governance arrangements that are in place for asking questions of each age range\".",
      "He said it was \"regrettable\" the outcomes of the review had not yet been made public.",

      "Other franchises which have drastically expanded perhaps offer some clues about what we can expect from the forthcoming Amazon era of Bond.",
      "Lancelot Narayan, a James Bond historian, journalist and filmmaker, told BBC Radio 5 Live a good comparison is George Lucas selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, giving the company control of the Star Wars brand.",

      "Similarly, the Marvel Cinematic Universe built on the films by launching a string of Disney+ TV shows.",

      "\"But I wonder if we're now in a situation where the times have changed so much, that James Bond now feels as if he belongs in a different era, and it needs something really radical to keep him relevant today.\"",
      "Character origin stories",

      "\"Also M, I'd love to know how Judi Dench's M ended up in that role. And the villains especially, it's a very rich universe, and it's easy to imagine the Marvelisation of it, where you have a kind of spin-off for every character that James Bond ever passed in a corridor.\"",
      "But Zaritsky notes: \"I think Amazon will stop short of doing it ad nauseum, to the point where they're having spin-offs about the MI6 janitor that sleeps in the corner. If they do have spin-offs, I think it's going to be prime characters.\"",

      "\"It's the premier British film property, and I think the control reverting to an American company, not least one that hasn't shown that much commitment to great cinema, is probably quite a worrying sign.\"",

      "The felony assault trial of A$AP Rocky - in which he was found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend - captured global headlines. There were outbursts during the proceedings and surprise visits in court by his longtime partner, singer Rihanna.",
      "Jurors in Los Angeles heard three weeks of testimony chronicling the bitter falling-out of childhood friends and the fight that led to the rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, being charged on accusations he opened fire in the middle of a Hollywood street.",
      "After the rapper was acquitted, he left freely with singer Rihanna, who was seated behind him as the verdict was read.",
      "Here are five big things we learned while inside the courtroom.",
      "1) Unwavering support from Rihanna",
      "As the not guilty verdict was read in court, the rapper immediately jumped from the defence table and leapt over a wooden barrier to hug Rihanna, who was seated behind him in between his mother and sister.",
      "The couple embraced tightly, both breaking into tears as the courtroom erupted in cheers.",
      "Rihanna, a Grammy award-winning artist, was in court multiple days during the trial, including on Valentine's Day.",
      "On one of the days in court, she brought the couple's two young children, who were both dressed in suits with pacifiers in their mouths. You could hear them cooing inside the courtroom as they flipped through children's books.",
      "Joe Tacopina, the rapper's defence attorney, said Mr Mayers tried to shield Rihanna and their family from the criminal proceedings, but said that \"wild horses couldn't keep her away\" from the trial.",

      "Following his acquittal, Rihanna expressed her gratitude on social media, stating, \"The glory belongs to God and God alone! Thankful, humbled by his mercy!\"",
      "2) A$AP Mob falling apart?",
      "The A$AP Mob is a hip-hop collective founded in 2006 in Harlem by a group of high school friends in New York.",
      "They adopted the \"A$AP\" title, which means \"Always Strive and Prosper\".",

      "During the trial, his defence team argued that Mr Ephron harboured resentment toward his former friend, feeling sidelined as A$AP Rocky's fame grew and saw mainstream musical success. They argued Mr Ephron was after money.",
      "Several members of the A$AP Mob testified during the trial in favour of Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy challenged Mr Ephron's account of the events and suggested that he was the aggressor during the altercation, not Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Lou also took the stand, telling jurors that a Glock 43 magazine found during a search of Mr Mayers's home belonged to him, not the rapper.",
      "None of the A$AP members publicly testified for Relli.",
      "3) 'AWGE' still a mystery?",
      "Do you know what AWGE stands for? If you know, I think both me and the jury would love to still know.",
      "During the trial, AWGE came up when A$AP Twelvyy was on the stand. He was asked by prosecutors about its meaning. But before he could answer, A$AP Rocky - who was seated with his attorneys - cut in and shouted, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvvy abided and responded, \"I just know it's AWGE\".",
      "It was an astonishing moment. Criminal defendants don't typically say much during trials - let alone halt a witness from answering a question during their criminal trial.",
      "A$AP Rocky not guilty of firearm assault on LA street",
      "When asked about this exchange after the trial, A$AP Rocky's attorney Joe Tacopina explained what happened.",
      "He said it was an \"acronym for his company that had to do with his family. I'm gonna leave it at that.\" Mr Tacopina went on to explain it was a private thing that the rapper didn't want revealed publicly to millions, especially in a criminal court case.",
      "But the answer really led to more questions. What does it mean and why is it so secretive?",
      "Here's what we do know: AWGE is the name of A$AP Rocky's mysterious creative collective and record label, and it's long been the subject of intrigue.",
      "Founded in 2014, the group operates across music, fashion and art, collaborating with brands like Mercedes-Benz and PacSun. Members include artists, designers and directors, and everyone remains loyal to one rule: no one publicly reveals what \"AWGE\" actually stands for.",

      "In May, he is set to co-chair the 2025 Met Gala - one of fashion's biggest nights - alongside big names like Anna Wintour, British race car driver Lewis Hamilton, singer Pharrell Williams and basketball superstar LeBron James.",
      "His relationship with Rihanna, one of the most famous singers, has further cemented his cultural relevance.",
      "The couple welcomed their second child, Riot Rose, in August 2023, and their growing family had become a symbol of hip-hop royalty.",
      "5) Beef between the lawyers",
      "The trial wasn't just a battleground for the rapper's freedom\u2014it also saw intense clashes between legal teams.",
      "Celebrity defence attorney Joe Tacopina, known for his aggressive courtroom style, relentlessly challenged the credibility of the prosecution's key witness, A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron.",
      "He painted Mr Ephron as an opportunist seeking financial gain and called the prosecution's case flimsy due to a lack of physical evidence. Mr Ephron got so fed up with the rapper's attorney during questioning that he called Mr Tacopina \"annoying\".",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors pushed back, accusing Mr Tacopina of attempting to intimidate witnesses and dismiss key testimonies.",
      "Both sides were very liberal with their use of objections in court, and it sometimes felt as though both sides were trying to throw the other off their game, rather than being based on legal guidelines.",
      "It also got personal between the two sides.",
      "At one point during closing arguments, Mr Tacopina and prosecutor John Lewin traded misconduct allegations, with Mr Lewin accusing Mr Tacopina of using steroids and Mr Tacopina firing back by calling Lewin a \"hunchback\".",

      "Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK, Israel and others.",

      "\"If the BBC was not aware that Abdullah Al-Yazouri is the son of a terrorist leader, what diligence checks were undertaken and why did they fail?\"",
      "The BBC has kept the programme on iPlayer and the new message at the start reads: \"The narrator of this film is 13 year old Abdullah. His father has worked as a deputy agriculture minister for the Hamas-run government in Gaza.",
      "\"The production team had full editorial control of filming with Abdullah.\"",
      "Child's eye view",

      "\"We've promised our audiences the highest standards of transparency, so it is only right that as a result of this new information, we add some more detail to the film before its retransmission. We apologise for the omission of that detail from the original film.\"",
      "It added: \"We followed all of our usual compliance procedures in the making of this film, but we had not been informed of this information by the independent producers when we complied and then broadcast the finished film.",
      "\"The film remains a powerful child's eye view of the devastating consequences of the war in Gaza which we believe is an invaluable testament to their experiences, and we must meet our commitment to transparency.\"",
      "Nandy said the matter was \"a conversation I'll definitely be having with the BBC\".",
      "Speaking to LBC on Thursday, she said: \"I watched it last night. It's something that I will be discussing with them, particularly around the way in which they sourced the people who were featured in the programme.",
      "\"These things are difficult, and I do want to acknowledge that for the BBC, they take more care than most broadcasters in terms of the way that they try to portray these things. They've been attacked for being too pro-Gaza, they've been attacked for being anti-Gaza. But it is absolutely essential that we get this right.\"",

      "The judge rejected an argument that it would be a violation of the Human Rights Act - protecting a person's right to property - if Electric Group was to be allowed to \"exploit\" the \"good will\" built up by the current management by running the venue in \"precisely the same way\".",

      "During the band's performance at the Good Vibes Festival in July 2023, Healy addressed the audience in a profanity-laden speech before kissing bass player Ross MacDonald.",
      "Homosexuality remains a crime in Malaysia which is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning.",
      "The weekend festival was cancelled on its opening night as a result, with the Malaysian government criticising Healy's conduct while blacklisting the band from the country.",
      "'Challenge and provoke'",
      "Festival organisers Future Sound Asia (FSA) claim The 1975 Productions LLP breached their contract following the incident and that all four band members owed a duty of care.",
      "FSA is seeking damages of \u00a31.9 million in \"substantial losses\".",
      "In a hearing on Wednesday, the band's lawyer Edmund Cullen KC described the claim as an \"illegitimate, artificial and incoherent\" attempt \"to pin liability on individuals\", the PA news agency reported.",
      "He said it was \"really quite bizarre\" that the individual members should be held liable as FSA had a contract with the band's company only.",
      "\"The allegations of breaches of a duty of care are not breaches of a duty of care at all,\" he said.",
      "\"They are breaches of Malaysian statutes and guidelines. That is why this claim is completely artificial against my clients.\"",
      "He asked the court to strike out the claim against the band members as individuals and for it to proceed against the company only.",
      "In written submissions for FSA, Andrew Burns KC, said The 1975 - who were due to be paid 350,000 dollars (\u00a3274,000) for a one-hour performance - \"deliberately behaved in a way to challenge and provoke the Malaysian authorities\".",
      "The band first played the festival in 2016, agreeing at the time not to swear, smoke, drink, take off clothes or talk about religion and politics on stage, he noted.",
      "But they \"planned provocative conduct\" in 2023, which included a bottle of wine being \"smuggled\" on stage, a \"second-rate set of songs\" to \"punish and upset the Malaysian audience and authorities\" and an \"obscene speech\"; as well as the kiss which courted much publicity online, the submissions claimed.",
      "\"This is also a case where they could be argued to have been on a frolic of their own rather than simply acting within the course of their ordinary role as LLP members,\" he said in the document.",
      "\"It is therefore fair, just and reasonable for the duty of care to be imposed and for them to answer for their acts of procuring breaches of contract.\"",
      "The court heard that Malaysian authorities had initially refused to let the band perform amid reports about Healy's recent recovery from drug addiction.",
      "But they agreed to allow the performance to take place after the band promised Healy would adhere to all guidelines and regulations, Mr Burns added.",
      "\"The band should be held liable as the loss was caused by their intentional misbehaviour breaching the express assurances that were given which gave rise to their personal duties of care and their responsibility for their own personal behaviour.\"",

      "In footage shared online, Healy could be seen telling the crowd that the band's decision to appear in Malaysia had been a \"mistake\".",
      "\"When we were booking shows, I wasn't looking into it,\" Healy said. \"I do not see the point of inviting the 1975 to a country and then telling us who we can have sex with.",
      "\"Unfortunately you don't get a set of loads of uplifting songs because I'm [expletive] furious,\" the frontman continued. \"And that's not fair on you, because you're not representative of your government. Because you're young people, and I'm sure a lot of you are gay and progressive and cool.\"",
      "Healy and MacDonald then kissed as the band played the song I Like America & America Likes Me.",
      "Soon after - just 30 minutes into the set - Healy and the band walked off stage, with the singer telling the audience: \"Alright, we just got banned from Kuala Lumpur, see you later.\"",
      "Healy's protest stunt sparked a backlash from some LGBT activists and allies in the country, with many calling it an act of \"performative activism\" that would make their lives even harder. Some said it displayed a \"white saviour complex\".",
      "In a statement after the show, a source close to the band said Healy had wanted to stand up for the LGBT community.",
      "After their Malaysian festival appearance had been cut short, the band cancelled further concerts in Indonesia and Taiwan.",
      "Several months later, Healy defended the kiss in a 10-minute speech delivered at a 1975 concert in Dallas, Texas.",
      "Healy said it was \"not a stunt simply meant to provoke the government\" but an \"ongoing part of the 1975 stage show which had been performed many times prior\".",
      "He described online anger over the performance as \"liberal outrage\", and said criticism of the band for \"remaining consistent\" by performing its \"pro-LGBT stage show\" was puzzling."

      "\"I channelled many Roys,\" Bailey explains, adding that Richard II \"explores inherited power in a very similar way to Succession but also expands on it and takes it to a new level\".",
      "The first of Shakespeare's Henriad plays, Richard II sees the unlikeable and corrupt king be usurped by his cousin Henry Bolingbroke who goes on to become Henry IV.",
      "Directed by Nicholas Hytner, the modern-dress production sees Bailey as a cocaine-snorting and camp king.",
      "The 36-year-old said he chose to take on the role of Richard II as there was \"so much to explore with his character\".",
      "\"It's a feast of a play and really speaks to our times - it's fascinating to explore a king who has a cast iron right to rule.\"",
      "'Commands the stage'",
      "Bailey's performance has been positively received by most critics.",
      "The Guardian's three star review said his \"words glitter with feeling\" and added that he \"singularly shines, his luminosity putting the others slightly in the shade\".",
      "The Evening Standard's review added that Bailey \"commands the stage and even allows a little camp to seep into the character\" while the Independent said, in a four-star review, that Bailey has \"an infectious spirit of camp naughtiness, he hugs his crown like a teddy bear, aims wry put-downs at dull courtiers, and bosses his court around like they're actors in a play\".",
      "However, in a three-star review, Dominic Cavendish from the Telegraph suggestedthat Bailey \"doesn't attain the greatness of Ben Whishaw and David Tennant\".",
      "There was also praise for some of the other actors, notably Michael Simkins. The Times said his Duke of York is \"stateliness personified\", but also awarded three stars overall.",
      "The New York Times also commended Simkins: \"His finger-wagging exasperation, verging at times on slapstick, gives an audience-friendly commentary on the unfolding intrigue.\"",
      "Newer fans of Bailey may not realise that he is first and foremost a theatre actor.",
      "In 2013, he played Cassio in Hytner's Othello at the National Theatre and has also performed alongside Ian McKellen in King Lear.",
      "Productions of Shakespeare's plays rarely have a large audience of young women, but Bailey's appeal among that demographic seems to have inspired them to visit the theatre.",
      "\"It makes me so happy to inspire a new generation of young people coming to the theatre,\" he says.",
      "\"If 10 people per show come and see Shakespeare for the first time then I'm doing something right.\""

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:42:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Spacey told Pearce he \"is not a victim\" after the Brutalist star spoke about his behaviour.",
    "story": [
      "Kevin Spacey has responded to fellow actor Guy Pearce's allegation that the Oscar-winner \"targeted\" him during the making of 1997 movie LA Confidential, telling the Australian to \"grow up\", adding: \"You are not a victim\".",
      "It comes after Pearce - one of the stars of the recent Bafta-winning film The Brutalist - this week expanded on his alleged experiences with the US actor having previously called him \"a handsy guy\" in 2018.",
      "Spacey - whose career was brought to a halt by a string of allegations - admitted to \"being too handsy\" and \"pushing the boundaries\", in an interview last year with Piers Morgan, while saying he'd not done anything illegal.",
      "In 2023 the actor was found not guilty of all charges of sexual assault against four men between 2001 and 2013 after a trial in London; and in 2022 a US court dismissed a sexual assault lawsuit against him.",
      "Spacey currently faces a civil trial over another allegation, which he denies, that he sexually assaulted a man in 2008.",
      "A further sexual abuse claim was lodged against him last week at the High Court, according to filings.",
      "'He targeted me, no question'",
      "Pearce told the Hollywood Reporter that the Oscar-winner \"targeted me, no question\" during the making of the 1997 crime thriller LA Confidential.",
      "\"But I did that thing that you do where you brush it off and go, 'ah, that's nothing. Ah, no, that's nothing'. And I did that for five months,\" he said.",
      "\"And, really, I was sort of scared of Kevin because he's quite an aggressive man. He's extremely charming and brilliant at what he does \u2013 really impressive etc.",
      "\"He holds a room remarkably. But I was young and susceptible, and he targeted me, no question.\"",
      "Pearce revealed he had told his wife at the time that he felt safe on set when his co-star Simon Baker was present, because Spacey allegedly focused his attentions on him instead.",
      "He said the #MeToo movement, which saw allegations made against many men in Hollywood from 2017 onwards, had been \"a really incredible wake-up call\" for him.",
      "The actor said he \"broke down and sobbed\" and \"couldn't stop\" after he saw the allegations against Spacey in the news headlines. \"I think it really dawned on me the impact that had occurred and how I sort of brushed it off and how I had either shelved it or blocked it out or whatever.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Spacey responded directly to Pearce in a video posted on X, saying: \"If I did something then that upset you, you could have reached out to me.",
      "\"We could have had that conversation, but instead, you've decided to speak to the press, who are now, of course, coming after me, because they would like to know what my response is to the things that you said.",
      "\"You really want to know what my response is? Grow up.\"",
      "Spacey claimed Pearce omitted to mention he had flown to Georgia a year after LA Confidential was made \"just to spend time with me\" while he was filming another movie, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.",
      "\"I mean, did you tell the press that too, or does that not fit into the victim narrative you have going?\" he added.",
      "\"I apologise that I didn't get the message that you don't like spending time with me. Maybe there was another reason, I don't know, but that doesn't make any sense. That you would have just been leading me on, right? But here you are now on a mission, some 28 years later, after I've been through hell and back.\"",
      "Spacey concluded his message by saying he was happy to have a \"conversation\" with Pearce \"anytime, anyplace\".",
      "\"I've got nothing to hide,\" he said. \"But Guy - you need to grow up. You are not a victim.\"",
      "Pearce earlier told the US publication he had raised Spacey's alleged behaviour with him years later, and had \"had a couple of confrontations with Kevin\" that \"got ugly\".",
      "His new strategy these days, he noted, was \"just try to be more honest about it now and call it for what it is\"."

    "summary": "Analysts say they are not optimistic that the ruthless \"cancel culture\" surrounding the industry will change.",
    "story": [
      "Actress Kim Sae-ron's death in an apparent suicide has renewed criticism of South Korea's entertainment industry, which churns out stars but also subjects them to immense pressure and scrutiny.",
      "Kim - who was found dead aged 24 at her home in Seoul on Sunday - had been bombarded with negative press coverage and hate online after a drink-driving conviction in 2022. Police have not provided further details about her death.",
      "Experts found the circumstances leading to it depressingly familiar. Other celebrities also ended up taking their lives after careers upended by cyberbullying.",
      "As Kim was laid to rest on Wednesday, analysts say they are not optimistic her death will lead to  meaningful change.",
      "South Korea's entertainment industry is enjoying massive popularity. Today, there are more than an estimated 220 million fans of Korean entertainment around the world \u2013 that's four times the population of South Korea.",
      "But there is also increasing spotlight on the less glamorous side of the entertainment industry.",
      "South Korea is known for its hyper-competitive culture in most spheres of life - from education to careers. It has one of the highest suicide rates among developed countries. While its overall suicide rate is falling, deaths of those in their 20s are rising.",
      "This pressure is heightened in the case of celebrities. They face immense pressure to be perfect, and are subjected to the demands of obsessive \"super fans\" who can make or break careers.",
      "That is why even the slightest perceived misstep can be career ending. Kim Sae-ron became so unpopular, scenes featuring her were edited out of shows such as Netflix's 2023 drama Bloodhounds.",
      "\"It is not enough that the celebrities be punished by the law. They become targets of relentless criticism,\" Korean culture critic Kim Hern-sik told the BBC.",
      "He referred to K-pop artists Sulli and Goo Hara, who died by suicide in 2019 after long battles with internet trolls, even though they did not have known brushes with the law.",
      "Sulli had offended fans for not conforming to the K-pop mould, while an internet mob had targeted Goo Hara over her relationship with an ex-boyfriend.",

      "Cyberbullying has also become a money-making gig for some,  Kim Hern-sik told the BBC.",
      "\"YouTubers get the views, forums get the engagement, news outlets get the traffic. I don't think [Kim's death] will change the situation.",
      "\"There needs to be harsher criminal punishment against leaving nasty comments,\" he says.",
      "Kim Sae-ron's father has blamed a YouTuber for her death, claiming the controversial videos they published caused her deep emotional distress.",
      "Others have pointed fingers at some local media outlets, who reportedly fuelled public animosity against Kim by reporting the unverified claims.",
      "\"This cycle of media-driven character assassination must stop,\" civic group Citizens' Coalition for Democratic Media said in a statement on Tuesday.",
      "Na Jong-ho, a psychiatry professor at Yale University, likened the spate of celebrity deaths in South Korea to a real-life version of Squid Game, the South Korean Netflix blockbuster which sees the indebted fighting to the death for a huge cash prize.",
      "\"Our society abandons those who stumble and moves on as if nothing happened.. How many more lives must be lost before we stop inflicting this destructive, suffocating shame on people?\" he wrote on Facebook.",
      "\"Drunk driving is a big mistake. There would be a problem with our legal system if that goes unpunished. However, a society that buries people who make mistakes without giving them a second chance is not a healthy one,\" Prof Na added.",
      "Last year, the BBC reported on how \"super fans\" in the notorious K-pop industry try to dictate their idols' private lives - from their romantic relationships to their daily activities outside of work - and can be unforgiving when things go off script.",
      "It is no surprise that Kim Sae-ron chose to withdraw from the public eye after her DUI conviction, for which she was fined 20 million won (\u00a311,000) in April 2023.",
      "It is worth noting however, that not all public figures are subject to the same treatment. Politicians, including opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, also have past drink-driving convictions but have been able to bounce back - polls show Lee is now the country's top presidential contender.",
      "In South Korea, it is \"extremely tough\" for artistes to recover when they do something that puts a crack in their \"idol\" image, says K-pop columnist Jeff Benjamin.",
      "He contrasts this to entertainment industries in the West, where controversies and scandals sometimes even \"add a rockstar-like edge\" to celebrities' reputations.",
      "\"While no one cheers when a Hollywood celebrity is arrested for DUI [driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs] or sent to jail for significant crimes, it's not necessarily career-ending,\" he says.",
      "While the Korean entertainment industry has made moves to address performers' mental health concerns, it is unclear how effective these have been.",
      "Real change can only happen when there is no more financial or attention incentives to continue with such intrusive reporting, says Mr Benjamin.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 01:43:21 GMT",
    "summary": "EastEnders stars and commentators reflect on times the soap tackled social taboos over 40 years.",
    "story": [
      "Over its 40-year run, EastEnders hasn't just been plot twists, emotions and gripping \"doof doof\" cliffhangers.",
      "It's also tackled social issues head-on, its stars say.",
      "The series has \"done more to create social awareness\" on these issues \"than probably any documentary\", says actor Ross Kemp, who plays leather-jacket-wearing Grant Mitchell.",
      "Kemp, who is hosting a BBC documentary on the history of the soap, says over the last four decades EastEnders has been able to take on subjects many feel are taboo - and it continues to do so with recent storylines including topics such as spiking.",
      "\"You can introduce those things through a continuing drama, a soap like EastEnders, and inform more people than you possibly would do with a government campaign,\" he says.",
      "First gay kiss",
      "On 17 November 1987, EastEnders aired a kiss between characters Colin Russell (played by Lord Michael Cashman) and his boyfriend Barry Clark (Gary Hailes) on the side of the head.",
      "There was a \"furore\" after the kiss was broadcast, Kemp recalls, adding \"it wasn't even a kiss on the lips\".",
      "Former actor Lord Cashman speaks to Kemp about the reaction during the new documentary EastEnders: 40 Years on the Square.",
      "\"The media went berserk,\" he says. \"There were calls for 'this kind of filth to be taken off our screens'.\"",
      "Lord Cashman says \"it was a weird and dark time,\" adding \"there was rampant homophobia\".",
      "In 1988, Section 28 of the Local Government Act was introduced, which banned places like schools and libraries from \"promoting homosexuality\".",
      "Lord Cashman's character Colin went on to share the first mouth-to-mouth kiss between two gay men on a British soap with character Guido Smith (Nicholas Donovan) in 1989.",
      "However, the former actor, later an activist and politician, recalls the reaction from fans: \"There was one guy and he said: 'I used to stand behind the sofa so that my mum and dad couldn't see me looking at you and I knew I wasn't alone.' It made a difference.\"",
      "Domestic violence",
      "According to Ofcom's first review of public service television broadcasting, audiences said early evening programmes, like soaps, had an important social role in airing complex and controversial issues.",
      "One example came in the early 2000s, when the soap featured a domestic violence and coercive control storyline featuring Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) and her brutal partner Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns).",
      "Actor Ainsworth says members of the public would often confuse her for her character and offer sympathy to her in the street. \"People would try and sit me down in places, they'd put their arms around me,\" she says. \"They'd want to look after me.\"",
      "The actor adds she received \"hundreds\" of letters a week from victims of similar violence.",
      "Though one watchdog at the time said the show went \"too far\" for pre-watershed TV, research for a national domestic violence helpline highlighted the storyline as the most significant TV portrayal of violence in the home in 30 years.",
      "Colourism",
      "Molly Rainford, who plays Anna Knight, was introduced to the Square in 2023. She is the daughter of George Knight and Cindy Beale and is part of the first black and dual heritage family to run a pub on any UK soap.",
      "In February 2024, the soap aired scenes of Molly and her on-screen sister, Gina Knight (Francesca Henry), discussing colourism and how differently they are treated because of their different skin tones.",
      "Colourism is prejudice against people who have a darker skin tone or the preferential treatment of those who are the same race but have lighter skin.",
      "Speaking about the storyline, Rainford says: \"These are conversations that happen in every mixed-raced family's life. All of these conversations are so important and so valid, especially right now.\"",
      "Rainford says parents told her their children had \"conversations on the playground that day after seeing that\".",
      "Transgender representation",
      "In 2015, Riley Carter Millington became the first transgender man to play a recurring trans character in a British soap, with his portrayal of Kyle Slater in EastEnders.",
      "Carter Millington says \"there wasn't a lot of on-screen representation\" for trans people and he was \"overwhelmed\" and grateful to have been cast in the role.",
      "\"I understood the weight of it and I didn't take it lightly,\" the actor says, adding that despite leaving the soap in 2016, he still gets messages from fans about his character.",
      "Kemp adds that EastEnders is \"ever-evolving\" with society - and that while there will \"always be a certain crowd that will poo poo it and look down upon it\", it has made some \"landmark television\" over the last 40 years.",
      "If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, you can visit BBC Action Line, including for issues related to sexual abuse and violence and domestic abuse.",
      "As part of EastEnders' 40th anniversary week, BBC News will be hosting live coverage of the live episode on Thursday 20 February, which you can watch on BBC One and iPlayer, and follow on our live page.",
      "From Wednesday, you'll be able to cast your vote here on who Denise decides her future is with, Jack or Ravi.",

      "Her experience was not too dissimilar from mine, except instead of watching soaps, my friends and I crammed onto the sofa eager to find out who had been behaving badly at Casa Amor or which Bushtucker trial awaited a group of intrepid celebrities.",
      "Sitting down to a watch a soap for the first time, I was unsure what to expect. I had never heard anyone my age talk about them before and navigating to ITVX and having to sit through three minutes of adverts was a very different experience from what I'm used to.",
      "I didn't want to do too much research into the shows but I did ask my parents, who are soap fans, to give me a bit of an explainer of who's who.",
      "After the opening titles and iconic theme songs that even I had heard of, I was surprised with how quickly the drama started. There was no scene-setting and I was thrust straight into the middle of some passive aggressive arguing in all three shows.",
      "Although the drama gets progressively more absurd, the sheer amount of scheming and fighting that is crammed into such a short episode means I was hooked for most of the show.",
      "But, I also had a lot of questions about how true the shows are to reality.",

      "Competition with high-budget dramas",
      "Not only are soaps competing with reality TV, but they also face fierce competition from dramas produced by streaming services.",
      "\"It feels like this was filmed 20 years ago,\" my boyfriend says within the first five minutes of watching Coronation Street. Shots are dimly lit, characters stand around in dated kitchens and conversations last a few minutes before flitting to another storyline entirely.",
      "There's nothing wrong with this per se as it adds an element of gritty reality to the shows, but people are now used to high-budget, high-stake dramas with cinematic visuals and star-studded casts.",
      "In just 12 episodes across three soaps there were more plots than I could count - the storylines covered everything from depression to infidelity to knife crime.",
      "In the past, these storylines would have undoubtedly influenced national conversations but for me, it felt like the issues were dealt with heavy-handedly and often felt shoehorned into plotlines.",
      "In comparison to shows such as Sex Education, Euphoria, and Top Boy which resonate with younger audiences by addressing themes like mental health, identity, and social justice in a way that feels authentic and visually compelling, the teenage angst of characters like Betsy and Max in Coronation Street feel unrealistic.",
      "I realise it's unfair to compare the big-budget streamer hits with soaps. The first season of Euphoria which consisted of just eight episodes reportedly cost $165m (\u00a3130m) to produce which is far greater than the budget of soaps.",
      "But, even up against shows such as Made in Chelsea, which likely has a similar budget, soaps still perform poorly with young audiences. Around a quarter of Made in Chelsea's audience is aged 16 to 34.",
      "Perhaps I'm being slightly unfair to the soaps. After all, I am jumping in decades after they first aired with no prior knowledge, so naturally it's harder to build a connection with the characters.",
      "But the longevity of the shows is part of the problem.",

      "Natalie Altman, 25, is an EastEnders fanatic. She started watching it a year ago after seeing clips of the show on TikTok and while it was confusing at first to follow the plots, she immersed herself with learning about their backstories on social media. She says the show feels more authentic than reality TV.",
      "\"I love it so much I've planned my week around the 40th anniversary and even cancelled plans to make sure I can watch it live.\"",
      "Despite none of her friends watching the show and thinking she's a \"loser for watching it\", she says she loves the escapism it provides. \"I'm quite an anxious person so being stressed about things that aren't real is really good for me.\"",
      "Data suggests the London-based drama has more than double the number of young viewers than Emmerdale.",
      "But, in contrast to Natalie, 25-year-old Ryan says EastEnders is a \"bit too doom-and-gloom\" and prefers the other two soaps.",
      "\"They feel more like real life where there are positive and negative storylines.\"",
      "He adds that he doesn't live in a big city so it's nice to watch shows such as Emmerdale that reflect rural life and aren't London-centric.",
      "By the end of the week, I found myself quite enjoying EastEnders more than the other two soaps - which could be partly because I grew up in London and therefore felt more of an inherent connection.",
      "But overall I struggled with the lack of cathartic ending for all of them.",
      "I don't mind a series having multiple episodes but I have to know that all the storylines will eventually be resolved.",
      "With soaps, there is no ending. Storylines carry on even when you think they're over. A character reappears years later or someone's brother's cousin's daughter from five years ago starts digging up the drama again.",
      "I'm unlikely to continue watching soaps after this week but I can see the appeal of them for the people who have been watching it for some time.",
      "There's something impressive about their longevity - will Love Island be celebrating its 40th anniversary in 2055 and will I be tuning in as a pensioner to watch a 21-year-old man tell someone their behaviour is muggy? Probably not.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 02:19:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Four toddlers born with a rare eye condition have seen \"life-changing improvements\", say UK doctors.",
    "story": [
      "An experimental trial of gene therapy has helped four toddlers - born with one of the most severe forms of childhood blindness - gain \"life-changing improvements\" to their sight, according to doctors at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London.",
      "The rare genetic condition means the babies' vision deteriorated very rapidly from birth.",
      "Before the therapy, they were registered legally blind and only just able to distinguish between dark and light. After the infusion, all parents reported improvements - with some of their young children now able to begin to draw and write.",
      "Further work is being done to confirm the early study, which appears in the Lancet medical journal.",
      "Gene therapy for another form of genetic blindness has been available on the NHS since 2020.",
      "The new work builds on that success by injecting healthy copies of a defective gene into the back of a child's eye, very early in life, to treat a severe form of the condition.",
      "Jace, from Conneticut in the United States, had the gene therapy in London when he was just two years old.",
      "As a young baby, his parents noticed something wasn't right about his eyesight.",
      "\"Around eight weeks old when babies should start looking at you and smiling, Jace wasn't doing that yet,\" says his mum DJ.",
      "She knew instinctively there was an issue and began to search for the reason, which took 10 months.",
      "After several visits to doctors and many tests, the family were told Jace had the ultra rare condition. It's caused by a mutation to a gene called AIPL1 and there is no established treatment.",
      "\"It was a shock,\" Jace's dad Brendan says of his first child.",
      "\"You never think it's going to happen to you, of course, but there was a lot of comfort and relief to finally find out... because it gave us a way to move forward.\"",
      "The family was lucky to hear about an experimental trial being carried out in London - just by chance - when they were at a conference about the eye condition.",
      "Jace's surgery was quick and \"pretty easy\", his mum says. He had four tiny scars in his eye where healthy copies of the gene were injected into the retina at the back of the eye through keyhole surgery.",
      "These copies are contained inside a harmless virus, which goes through the retinal cells and replaces the defective gene. The healthy, working genes then kick start a process which helps the cells at the back of the eye work better and survive longer.",
      "In the first month following treatment, Brendan noticed Jace squint for the first time on seeing bright sunshine streaming through the windows of their house.",
      "His son's progress has been \"pretty amazing\", he says.",
      "\"Pre-surgery, we could have held up an object near his face and he wouldn't be able to track it at all.",
      "\"Now he's picking things off the floor, he's hauling out toys, doing things driven by his sight that he wouldn't have done before.\"",
      "This may not be the last treatment he needs in his life, his parents say, but the improvements so far are helping him to know the world better.",
      "\"It's really hard to undersell the impact of having a little bit of vision,\" Brendan says.",
      "No other options",
      "Prof James Bainbridge, a retinal surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital, who helped lead the trial, said giving children the chance of sight improvement this early on could make a big difference to their development and ability to interact with people.",
      "\"Sight impairment in young children has a devastating effect on their development.",
      "\"Treatment in infancy with this new genetic medicine can transform the lives of those most severely affected,\" he said.",
      "The four children, from the United States, Turkey and Tunisia, were all born with an aggressive form of Leber Congenital Amaurosis, where a genetic fault means the cells at the back of their eyes -  that normally help distinguish light and colour- malfunction and rapidly die out.",
      "But scientists at University College London developed the innovative procedure, which involves infusing healthy copies of the gene into the back of the eye.",
      "Unlike traditional scientific trials, families were offered this experimental therapy under a special licence designed for compassionate use, when there are no other options readily available.",
      "Children had one eye treated each - a measure taken in case the treatment had any adverse effects.",
      "They were aged between one and three when they had the procedure and their vision was then checked at intervals over the next four years, in a variety of ways - including moving down corridors and identifying doors.",
      "Given their age, some children found the more formal eye tests challenging.",
      "'Hugely impressive'",
      "According to Moorfields' doctors, the results of the tests they completed, alongside the parent's reports of their improvements, give \"compelling evidence\" that all four benefited from the treatment and were seeing more than would be expected with the normal course of the disease.",
      "Vision in their untreated eyes, meanwhile, deteriorated, as expected.",
      "Consultant eye surgeon, Prof Michel Michaelides, at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, added: \"The outcomes for these children are hugely impressive and show the power of gene therapy to change lives.\"",
      "The team plans to monitor the children to see how long-lasting the results are.",
      "The results so far give them hope that intervening early in other childhood genetic eye conditions could offer the \"greatest benefit\" and ultimately transform children's lives.",

      "But the problems, he added, were not uniform with treatment rates for some cancer types much better.",
      "RCS president Tim Mitchell echoed the concerns, saying: \"The NHS has access to world-class cancer treatments and care, but inconsistent delivery means far too many patients miss out.",

    "story": [
      "Whether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day.",
      "But, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts.",
      "This is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\".",
      "\"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said.",
      "After a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words.",
      "Her audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones.",
      "'Words sound like gibberish'",
      "Having grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from.",
      "She rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles.",
      "\"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said.",
      "It affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".",
      "The cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play.",
      "Other audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use.",
      "Five NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling.",
      "APD is more common in neurodivergent people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.",
      "Hearing vs listening",
      "Renee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on.",
      "Her team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\"",
      "Noise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music.",
      "Lisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model.",
      "\"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.",
      "A false reality?",
      "But Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise.",
      "\"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said.",
      "\"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.",
      "For those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.",
      "A UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.",
      "And, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.",
      "Prof Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\"",
      "Particularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown.",
      "It is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on.",
      "Dr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children.",
      "\"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\"",
      "Dr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research.",
      "He said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".",
      "'Having a hearing dog is like winning the lottery'",
      "Could solar-powered headphones be the next must-have?",
      "Study finds 18m people in the UK have hearing loss",
      "Treatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.",
      "So-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three.",
      "Microphones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS.",
      "\"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis.",
      "\"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\"",
      "To improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.",
      "Limited research",
      "Wayne Wilson, an associate professor in the school of health and rehabilitation sciences at The University of Queensland, says more research needs to be done on the possible link.",
      "However, he points out that doing controlled research with so many variables could prove tricky.",
      "\"The devil is in the detail as the answer probably depends on which sounds, which scenes, which noise, which noise cancellation, what period of noise cancellation, what age of child, etc.\"",
      "Sophie is set to start treatment for her APD in the next few months, and feels excited for the future.",
      "\"If me and my boyfriend go out to a bar, sometimes we will leave early because of the noise. It's nice to know maybe after this treatment, I will be able to go to busier places and handle it a bit better.\"",

      "\"It can be a struggle at times,\" he said. \"I do worry at times but I also worry about my mum. Obviously I love my mum.\"",

      "Dr Hughes made a series of recommendations, including a specific housing grant for valproate victims, a removal of the barriers many face in getting their special educational needs recognised, and work to issue an apology to each individual affected.",
      "More than a year has since passed, and the government is still working on a response.",
      "Mrs Cox said: \"We have pulled various governments over time kicking and screaming to this point where they have acknowledged that the difficulties for up to 20,000 children were caused by this drug.",

    "summary": "The state collected more in tax than it spent in January but the figures fell short of forecasts.",
    "story": [
      "Government finances showed a large surplus last month after a surge in tax receipts but the figure missed official forecasts, increasing pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to meet her own fiscal rules.",
      "The surplus - the difference between what the government spends and the tax it takes in - was \u00a315.4bn in January, which is the highest level for the month since records began more than three decades ago.",
      "However, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, had predicted that the surplus would be higher at \u00a320.5bn.",
      "The smaller figure has added to growing speculation that Reeves will either have to cut public spending or raise taxes further to meet her self-imposed rules for the economy.",
      "The OBR will release its latest outlook for the UK economy and public finances on 26 March, when it will detail what headroom the chancellor has. At the same time, Reeves will announce her Spring Forecast.",
      "Last October, the watchdog said she had \u00a39.9bn in headroom.",
      "However, weak economic growth and higher borrowing costs have weighed on that wriggle room.",
      "\"In order to meet her fiscal rules, the chancellor will need to raise taxes and/or cut spending,\" said Alex Kerr, UK economist at Capital Economics.",
      "He said Reeves's options ahead of her Spring Forecast were already \"bleak\" before the \"ratcheting up of pressure on European governments to increase defence spending\" amid uncertainty over the outcome of the war in Ukraine.",
      "Fiscal rules are self-imposed by most governments in wealthy nations and are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets.",
      "There has been speculation that if the chancellor wants to avoid breaking her own, cuts in public spending or further tax rises could be announced.",
      "Nabil Taleb, economist at PwC UK, said Reeves had \"held the line on Labour's pledges\" to date, but warned \"holding that line will become increasingly challenging\".",
      "The difficult decisions faced by Reeves come as UK economic growth has proved anaemic and inflation - which measures the rate prices rise at - has risen putting pressure on household budgets.",
      "Following the latest government finance figures, Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, reiterated that the government fiscal rules were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The government tends to take more in tax than it spends January compared with other times of the year due to the amount it receives in self-assessed taxes in the month.",
      "Despite last month's \u00a315.4bn being a record figure for a surplus, it undershot forecasts due to lower than expected tax receipts, suggesting weakness in the UK economy.",
      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said borrowing in the financial year to January 2025\u202fwas \u00a3118.2bn, some \u00a311.6bn more than at the same point in the last year."

    "summary": "When Sir Keir Starmer touches down in Washington next week, he will be treading a fine diplomatic line.",
    "story": [
      "When Sir Keir Starmer visits the White House next Thursday, he will be treading a fine diplomatic line.",
      "He will want to maintain his support for President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukraine's government. But he will also want to gain the ear of President Donald Trump over the talks he has begun with Russia to end the war.",
      "All this while keeping out of the venomous verbal crossfire between Washington and Kyiv.",
      "That will be no easy task.",
      "Transatlantic relations are in pieces. The US president has upended America's longstanding support for Ukraine and sidelined Europe in the process.",
      "US defence secretary Pete Hegseth says European security is no longer a US priority. Vice-President JD Vance attacks the very nature of European democracy.",
      "It is into this cauldron of ideological enmity that Sir Keir will seek a hearing when he meets the president and his team at the White House.",
      "So what can and should the prime minister do?",
      "Diplomats say he has one advantage over European allies, namely his permanence. Trump, they say, knows Sir Keir is one of the few European leaders who will stay in power throughout his presidency. Trump, it is said, likes the fact the prime minister has a healthy parliamentary majority.",
      "\"I get along with him well,\" Trump told the BBC a few weeks ago. \"I like him a lot. He's liberal, which is a bit different from me, but I think he's a very good person and I think he's done a very good job thus far.\"",
      "But warm words and familiarity do not pay for lunch along the Washington beltway.",
      "What could Sir Keir offer the famously transactional president? He has already made a downpayment by offering to deploy British boots on the ground in Ukraine as part of a post-war reassurance force.",
      "This angered some European leaders who thought it premature and divisive. It also risked Europe getting excluded from discussions about more fundamental issues such as Ukraine's territory and sovereignty. But the troops offer may gain Sir Keir some diplomatic brownie points in the West Wing.",
      "The other thing Sir Keir could offer Trump is the strongest possible language he can muster promising to increase UK defence spending. Starmer is not expected to announce when he will meet his target of spending 2.5% of national income on defence. But he may talk up both the UK's commitment and his calls for other European allies to do likewise.",
      "Sir Alex Younger, former chief of MI6, told BBC Two's Newsnight: \"We need to demonstrate that we are prepared to play a role, take control of our own environment, recognise that we have got to develop our power and that has got to happen quickly.\"",
      "But diplomats say the main argument Starmer must make is to convince Trump that a fast deal on Russian terms would be against his own interests. Namely that the terms of any ceasefire - its fairness, its permanence, its safeguards - were as important as any short term cessation of hostilities. In other words, that there is no point in having a triumphant ceasefire agreement which does not survive for long, risking Trump's reputation.",
      "\"If I were Starmer, I would say to Trump that this is your chance for your place in history, the man who brought peace and ended this war,\" Lord Darroch, the former UK ambassador to the US, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"But it has to be a fair deal. If it's a bad deal, you are not going to get that praise, you are going to get a load of criticism and that will be your record in the history books.\"",
      "Key to that would be urging Trump to put pressure on Vladmir Putin by threatening to seize frozen Russian assets, increase support for Ukraine and tighten up sanctions.",
      "Huge risks",
      "But the risks of the prime minister's trip are huge. The famously thin-skinned president could take offence at Sir Keir's outright contradiction of his claim that Zelensky is a dictator. He could be irritated by Sir Keir's insistence that any European reassurance force deployed to Ukraine must have a US \"backstop\", expected in the form of aircover.",
      "The diplomatic pitfalls of cross words and cancelled press conferences will be troubling the minds of British officials as they prepare for the trip. They will be acutely aware President Emmanuel Macron of France will be in Washington before them on Monday, competing for Mr Trump's ear.",
      "Sir Keir likes to say that in these troubled times, the UK can once again become a bridge between Europe and the US. France may be keen for that role too.",
      "Another potential point of tension will be trade. Team Trump is promising to impose tariffs on UK goods entering the US that match VAT levied on American goods entering the UK. One argument the UK could make is that hitting British and European trade will make it harder for them to spend more on defence. But officials say that would be a hard argument to make to a president who thinks Europe is ripping off the US both economically and militarily.",
      "The greatest risk, however, is that no manner of charm, politics or diplomacy will touch the sides of this new administration. There is simply no transactional offer that can bridge the vast ideological divide that now exists between Europe and the US. That may be the cold hard lesson the British delegation learns in Washington.",

      "It means the Welsh government's \u00a326bn spending plans for the NHS, education and other public services will pass in the Senedd next month, and includes a ban on greyhound racing and cash for local councils.",

    "summary": "The government admits that stemming price rises will be 'bumpy' as inflation hit 3% in January.",
    "story": [
      "UK inflation jumped sharply in the year to January, driven by rising food prices, air fares and an increase in private school fees.",
      "The higher-than-expected jump to 3% from 2.5% in December, means prices rose at the fastest pace for 10 months.",
      "Food staples such as meat, eggs, butter and cereals were all more expensive than a year ago and comes as many households prepare for higher energy and water bills later this year.",
      "Following the latest figures, the government warned that the road back to low inflation would be \"bumpy\", but the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats argued Labour's tax rises and spending plans had caused the latest spike.",
      "Rising food prices last month mean, on average, the cost of buying groceries is 3.3% more expensive than it was a year ago.",
      "While many staples have edged up in price, some items such as olive oil and lamb have increased markedly, by 17% and 16% respectively.",
      "The rise in inflation, which is a measure used to give a general picture of how living costs have changed over a year, comes ahead of predicted increases to energy bills in April.",
      "Water and council tax bills are also slated to rise in two months' time, which will push up the cost of living for households.",
      "The government has raised the minimum wage for all age groups from April. Benefits and the state pension will also increase.",
      "But some businesses have warned that higher pay, as well as a rise in National Insurance, will mean increased prices for customers as companies attempt to cover increased costs.",
      "\"Life is a struggle\"",
      "\"Life is a struggle,\" said Gaby Cowley. The young mum told the BBC that she could already \"barely make both ends meet\" but food prices are now \"ridiculous\" \u2013 something that keeps her up at night.",
      "\"Food shopping has almost doubled from about three years ago,\" she said. \"We spend, maybe, a minimum of \u00a390 a month now and that doesn't include \u00a320-\u00a330 topping up during the week with fruit, veg and milk.\"",
      "If there is more money going out than coming in, Ms Cowley said she will sell her baby's old clothes \"just to make a little bit of money to do things\".",
      "She hopes the rise in minimum wage will see her pay go up, although she thinks the struggle is far from over.",
      "UK wages continue to outpace inflation",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "As well as food, inflation was fuelled last month by plane tickets. Air fares tend to rise into December and fall into January, but the drop was less than in previous years, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "It also said that private school fees grew by about 13% at the beginning of the year due to VAT being added from 1 January after the government removed the tax exemption.",
      "The sharper rise in inflation - it had been expected to climb to 2.8% - has also led to speculation over how the Bank of England will react in terms of interest rates.",
      "High inflation in recent years, peaking at 11.1% in October 2022, saw the bank raise interest rates, which pushed up the cost of loans, credit cards and mortgages.",
      "As price rises have eased, borrowing costs have fallen and the Bank decided to cut rates earlier this month to 4.5%.",
      "But with the rate remaining above the Bank's 2% target, some economists suggest further cuts could be made at a slower pace.",
      "Professor Jonathan Haskel, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee, told the BBC that policymakers could \"take no signal\" from the inflation spike and carry on cutting rates gradually or view it as a \"harbinger of more to come\" and change course.",
      "Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said because the VAT charge on private schools came into effect last month, the impact on inflation was a \"one-off\".",
      "But Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the threat of higher wage bills for supermarkets and producers meant there was \"every chance\" food price rises in January would not be the last.",
      "\"This is on top of rises in everything from water bills and council tax - which is why it has become known as Awful April,\" she said.",
      "James Murray, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, admitted that getting inflation back down to the 2% target would be \"bumpy\".",
      "\"We are in a different world than we were a few years ago under the previous government, where inflation was routinely double digits,\"  he said.",
      "\"The Bank of England has been clear that they expected inflation to be slightly higher in the first half of this year....but we're confident in our plan for change to make sure that we're kick-starting economic growth by making the reforms that are necessary to boost economic growth right across the country,\" he added.",
      "But shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Labour's \"tax hikes and inflation-busting pay rises\" were to blame for the scale of January's rise.",
      "Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey added: \"The chancellor's misguided policies are putting us at risk of a new era of stagflation. The economy still isn't growing, and now people are being hit in their pockets too.\"",
      "Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said January's figure would be \"uncomfortable\" for the Bank of England, but said she doubted it would prevent further rate cuts.",
      "\"The risk is that the rise in inflation proves more persistent and rates are cut more slowly than we expect, or not as far,\" she added."

    "story": [
      "The British Army has said it is ready to deploy to Ukraine if requested by the government.",
      "This week, 2,500 UK troops from the Army's high readiness force, the First Division,  have been taking part  in a large Nato exercise in Romania - on a training area just 16 miles (25km) from the border with Ukraine.",
      "Although mobile phones have been banned on the exercise, most soldiers are aware that there are now initial discussions to send troops to Ukraine itself.",
      "Brigadier Andy Watson, who is commanding the British contribution to the Nato exercise, says his brigade \"is absolutely ready\" should they receive orders to deploy to Ukraine.",
      "Earlier this week Keir Starmer said that he was ready and willing to send British troops to Ukraine to help guarantee its security, should there be a ceasefire.",
      "But so far he too is unclear as to what they might be asked to do.",
      "In terms of numbers of troops that might be needed, Brigadier Watson said \"clearly what the force package would look like would be dependent on what the prime minister and the Ministry of Defence would like\".",
      "But he said \"it's absolutely not\" something the UK could do on its own. \"I think the prime minister has been very clear that the UK would contribute to efforts, but absolutely not doing it on our own,\" says Brigadier Watson.",
      "Exercise Steadfast Dart is Nato's largest exercise this year and meant to demonstrate how quickly allies can come to the defence of an ally under attack. But while it's meant to demonstrate Nato's readiness, it also highlights its limitations too.",
      "The UK has shown it can move large numbers of troops and equipment, including more than 700 military vehicles, 1,400 miles (2,253 km) across Europe at relatively short notice as part of Nato's new Allied Reaction Force.",
      "And that it can operate alongside allies. More than 10,000 military personnel are taking part in the exercise from eight European nations.",
      "But that is just 10% of the number that most military experts believe might be required for any peacekeeping operation inside Ukraine which might require a force of more than 100,000.",
      "Some of the nations taking part, like Spain and Italy, have not even met Nato's own spending target for defence of 2% of GDP, set more than a decade ago. Many, including the UK, have experienced recent cuts in the size of their armed forces.",
      "When British forces were sent to Helmand in 2009, the British Army had more than 100,000 regular troops.",
      "Now it is at its smallest since the Napoleonic wars, at just over 70,000. Even before the cuts, the British Army was stretched sending a force of 9,000 troops.",
      "It required additional defence spending for urgent operational equipment, as well as a rolling deployment of fresh troops every six months. A regular Army of around 73,000 would now struggle to do something on a similar scale.",
      "Steadfast Dart is meant to show that Nato's European allies can respond to a crisis.",

      "Healey said on Tuesday that European nations would have to play a leading role but he added that \"it is only the US that can provide the deterrence to Putin that will prevent him attacking again\".",
      "Nato's intervention in Libya in 2011 illustrated how European nations struggled without their biggest partner.",

      "But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte now says that is not enough and is pushing for more than 3%.",
      "The Trump administration says it should be more like 5% of GDP. The UK government has still not set a date for its new spending target of 2.5%. Europe has also been slow to ramp up defence production.",

      "Thames Water has won a crucial High Court battle to secure a \u00a33bn rescue loan, staving off the prospect of the debt-laden company coming under government control.",
      "The UK's largest water and waste company was set to run out of cash by the end of March and would have likely been placed into temporary nationalisation to keep services running.",
      "The court decision on Tuesday has given Thames breathing space to undergo a major restructuring, but the future of the company remains uncertain as it struggles with \u00a319bn worth of debt and the ruling is set to be appealed.",
      "Thames has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",

      "Regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies and waste services to households will continue as normal.",
      "The water regulator, Ofwat, said Thames Water remained \"subject to our turnaround oversight regime and safeguards are in place to ensure that services to customers are protected\".",
      "Thames has said the \u00a33bn in emergency funding will give it the space needed to complete a restructuring of its debts and attract a cash injection from prospective new investors.",

      "Sir Keir said he agreed, adding: \"It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration\".",
      "But Lady Chief Justice Baroness Sue Carr said the remarks were \"unacceptable\" and conflicted with the duty of politicians to uphold the rule of law and respect the independent role of judges.",
      "A government spokesperson said Sir Keir had \"made clear that it is for Parliament to make the laws and for the government to decide policy.\"",
      "Speaking at her annual news conference, Baroness Carr also said that judges' concerns about their personal security were at an \"all-time high\" - thanks to attacks on social media driven by wider misreporting of their work.",
      "The exchange between Sir Keir and Badenoch came during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) last week.",
      "Badenoch was critical of how an immigration judge had handled the family's application, which she said was made under a scheme designed for Ukrainians fleeing the war. The case has been widely misreported and misunderstood.",
      "Badenoch said: \"A judge has now ruled in their favour. That is not what the scheme was designed to do.",
      "\"This decision is completely wrong, and cannot be allowed to stand. Are the government planning to appeal on any points of law, and, if so, which ones?\"",
      "The full reading of the judgement reveals that the family of six - a mother and father, and their four children - had sought permission to live with a British relative who proved he was able to house and financially support them.",
      "Part of their case had been that they were political opponents of Hamas, which is banned in the UK under terrorism laws.",
      "The family, whose home in Gaza was destroyed by an air strike, have been granted anonymity.",

These allow families from any background to make a case to reunite if there are compelling reasons to do so outside of standard immigration schemes.",

      "\"She has not quite done her homework, however, because the decision in question was taken under the last government, according to their legal framework.\"",

      "The prime minister has not specified what the \"legal loophole\" is that he wants to close.",
      "Meanwhile, the two Upper Tribunal judges, who granted the family permission to reunite in the UK, said that their decision was not creating a Palestinian settlement scheme, but dealing with a complex and exceptional case.",
      "They had not been presented with any evidence from the government that this family's unusual case would open \"floodgates\".",
      "The UK currently has schemes for some Afghans, Ukrainians and people from Hong Kong to come to the UK, but no route for Palestinians.",
      "Reflecting on the PMQs clash, Baroness Carr said on Monday that \"both the question and the answer were unacceptable\".",
      "\"It is for the government visibly to respect and protect the independence of the judiciary,\" she said. \"Where parties, including the government, disagree with their findings, they should do so through the appellate process.\"",

      "Responding to Baroness Carr's comments, Badenoch said \"politicians must be able to discuss matters of crucial public importance in Parliament\" - and that such debate \"doesn't compromise the independence of the judiciary\".",
      "\"This is not just some legal loophole that can be closed, but requires a fundamental overhaul of our flawed human rights laws,\" she said in a statement on X.",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"Where the law is not working as we think it should be, the government will take action to tighten up the rules - and that is what we are doing\".",
      "\"As a former chief prosecutor, the prime minister's respect for the judiciary, the role they play in our democracy and the rule of law is beyond question,\" the statement added.",

      "\"Their job is to find the facts on the evidence before them and apply the law as it stands to those facts,\" she told reporters. \"If they get it wrong, the protection is a challenge on appeal. If the legislation is wrong, it is Parliament's prerogative to legislate.\"",
      "\"It is really dangerous to make any criticism of a judgment without a full understanding of the facts and the law,\" the lady chief justice said - adding that judges are \"public servants acting independently\" and that, \"frankly, judges deserve better\"."

    "title": "World's glaciers melting faster than ever recorded",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:23:37 GMT",
    "summary": "The planet's glaciers have lost 5% of their ice in little over 20 years, according to a major study.",
    "story": [
      "The world's glaciers are melting faster than ever recorded under the impact of climate change, according to the most comprehensive scientific analysis to date.",
      "Mountain glaciers - frozen rivers of ice \u2013 act as a freshwater resource for millions of people worldwide and lock up enough water to raise global sea-levels by 32cm (13in) if they melted entirely.",
      "But since the turn of the century, they have lost more than 6,500 billion tonnes \u2013 or 5% \u2013 of their ice.",
      "And the pace of melting is increasing. Over the past decade or so, glacier losses were more than a third higher than during the period 2000-2011.",
      "The study combined more than 230 regional estimates from 35 research teams around the world, making scientists even more confident about exactly how fast glaciers are melting, and how they will evolve in the future.",
      "Glaciers are excellent indicators of climate change.",
      "In a stable climate, they remain roughly the same size, gaining about as much ice through snowfall as they lose through melting.",
      "But glaciers have been shrinking pretty much everywhere over the past 20 years as temperatures have risen due to human activities, principally burning fossil fuels.",
      "Between 2000 and 2023, glaciers outside the major ice-sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost around 270 billion tonnes of ice a year on average.",
      "These numbers aren't easy to get your head around. So Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service and lead author of the study, uses an analogy.",
      "The 270 billion tonnes of ice lost in a single year \"corresponds to the [water] consumption of the entire global population in 30 years, assuming 3 litres per person and day\", he told BBC News.",
      "The rate of change in some regions has been particularly extreme. Central Europe, for example, has lost 39% of its glacier ice in little over 20 years.",
      "The novelty of this study, published in the journal Nature, is not so much finding that glaciers are melting faster and faster \u2013 we already knew that. Instead, its strength lies in drawing together evidence from across the research community.",
      "There are various ways of estimating how glaciers are changing, from field measurements to different types of satellite data. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Direct measurements on glaciers, for example, give very detailed information, but are only available for a tiny fraction of the more than 200,000 glaciers worldwide.",
      "By systematically combining these different approaches, scientists can be much more certain about what's going on.",
      "These community estimates \"are vital as they give people confidence to make use of their findings\", said Andy Shepherd, head of the Department of Geography and Environment at Northumbria University, who was not an author of the recent study.",
      "\"That includes other climate scientists, governments, and industry, plus of course anyone who is concerned about the impacts of global warming.\"",
      "Glaciers take time to fully respond to a changing climate \u2013 depending on their size, anywhere between a few years and many decades.",
      "That means they will continue to melt in the years ahead.",
      "But, crucially, the amount of ice lost by the end of the century will strongly depend on how much humanity continues to warm the planet by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.",
      "This could be the difference between losing a quarter of the world's glacier ice, if global climate targets are met, and nearly half if warming continues uncontrolled, the study warns.",
      "\"Every tenth of a degree of warming that we can avoid will save some glaciers, and will save us from a lot of damage,\" Prof Zemp explained.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is the Paris climate agreement?",
      "These consequences go beyond local changes to landscapes and ecosystems \u2013 or \"what happens on the glacier doesn't stay there\", as Prof Zemp puts it.",
      "Hundreds of millions of people worldwide rely to some extent on seasonal meltwater from glaciers, which act like giant reservoirs to help buffer populations from drought. When the glaciers disappear, so does their supply of water.",
      "And there are global consequences too. Even seemingly small increases to global sea-level \u2013 from mountain glaciers, the major Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets, and warmer ocean waters taking up more space - can significantly increase the frequency of coastal flooding.",
      "\"Every centimetre of sea-level rise exposes another 2 million people to annual flooding somewhere on our planet,\" said Prof Shepherd.",
      "Global sea-levels have already risen by more than 20cm (8in) since 1900, with around half of that coming since the early 1990s, and faster increases are expected in the decades ahead.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:45:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Two sinkholes have appeared in the Surrey village of Godstone, but how have they formed and are they dangerous?",
    "story": [
      "Residents in the Surrey village of Godstone have been evacuated after two sinkholes opened up this week along large parts of the high street.",
      "The original hole first appeared late on Monday night, growing to at least 65ft (20m) long by Tuesday lunchtime.",
      "Sinkholes are not uncommon in the UK but can sometimes appear suddenly. What might be the causes and should we be more worried about them?",
      "What is a sinkhole?",
      "A sinkhole is a depression in the surface because the underlying rock has collapsed.",
      "They can be saucer-shaped or appear deeper more like shafts. If they occur in built-up areas they can appear more irregular as a road or another structure above can distort the shape.",
      "In Godstone, the collapsed ground is under a road which is partially concealing the size of the depression.",
      "How are they formed?",
      "Sinkholes can appear for many different reasons - it is often due to the geology but human factors can also be a cause.",
      "One of the most common reasons for a sinkhole is when rocks like limestone or chalk break down. This happens because carbon dioxide from the air dissolves in rainwater to form carbonic acid - this then percolates through the rock and reacts with it, causing it to dissolve.",
      "Sometimes this process can happen gradually, where the depression becomes larger over time.",
      "In other instances, the limestone sits below another layer of rock, which means that as it gets dissolved there are no immediate signs at the surface.",
      "The overlying rock, sometimes clay or sandstone, will then suddenly collapse into the depression beneath - called a 'collapse sinkhole'.",
      "These are most common in South Wales where sandstone rocks lie above caves in the limestone.",
      "But human activities can also accelerate the formation of sinkholes or cause the ground to collapse in a similar way.",
      "Andrew Farrant, British Geological Survey regional geologist for south-east England, suspects that is what has happened in Godstone and it is not a true sinkhole.",
      "He said that one theory is that a burst water main has caused a sudden influx of water into the sandstone bed \"flushing\" the rock out the way.",
      "Pete Burgess, of the Wealden Cave and Mines Society, said a quarry marked \"sand pit\" can be seen on 19th century maps of land directly under the sinkhole.",
      "He added that sand from the pit was dug out and used for building and gardening purposes.",
      "Mr Farrant said that sand pit had been filled in but he added that there had been a significant amount of historic mining in the area and it cannot be ruled out that there were some unmapped pits and quarries that have been built on.",
      "How common are sinkholes in the UK?",
      "They are common in the UK because of the abundance of limestone and chalk rock and historic mining activities.",
      "Limestone and chalk are formed from the deposit and compression of micro-organisms found in shallow warm seas. Millions of years ago the UK was located further south towards the equator and was much warmer with parts of the country submerged - creating the ideal conditions for these rock types to form.",
      "Vanessa Banks, expert in shallow geohazards and risks at the British Geological Survey, told the BBC's Radio 4 PM programme: \"Sinkholes occur in spates but many are not recorded as they occur in remote areas.\"",
      "She added that meteorological conditions play a role as extreme downpours can flush water through the rocks or put pressure on infrastructure like water mains.",
      "Last December, about 30 homes were evacuated in Merthyr Tydfil after the ground collapsed, and in 2014 sinkholes occurred at five to ten times the normal rate across south-east England after intense storm conditions.",
      "Are they dangerous?",
      "\"Collapse sinkholes\" which can appear suddenly and without any warnings at the surface, like cracks or subsidence, can be dangerous.",
      "In 2010, a sinkhole measuring 20m in diameter and 90m deep, appeared in Guatemala City which resulted in the death of one person. In this case heavy rains and poor drainage are thought to have weakened the underlying rock.",
      "And in January a truck cabin was swallowed by a sinkhole in the Japanese city of Yashio, apparently as the result of a sewer rupture. The truck's 74-year-old driver was reported missing.",
      "In the case of dissolution sinkholes geologists can indicate which areas are more at risk if the underlying rock is made up of chalk or limestone. For any new development in the UK the local planning authority does review the geology and any potential risks.",
      "But Dr Collins, reader in geology and geotechnical engineering at Brunel University, said that in this case where water infrastructure plays a role it is harder to predict potential ground collapses.",
      "\"The pipe rupture does highlight the challenge that comes with having buried infrastructure as they are often buried at depths in excess of a metre. The depth is to reduce the impact of deep freeze during a very cold winter.",
      "\"Unfortunately, this makes them hard to monitor and repairs can be difficult, including the replacement of soil in the excavated hole once the repair is complete,\" he said.",

      "A team of experts at the site said complex conditions have made it impossible to save them.",
      "They are part of a pod of 157 whales that had beached near Arthur River, in the island's north west. The rest had died shortly after the stranding.",
      "Tasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years.",
      "False killer whales are technically one of world's largest dolphin species, like their orca namesakes. They can grow up to 6m (19ft) and weigh 1.5 tonnes.",
      "Authorities on Wednesday said the pod had been stranded at the site for 24 to 48 hours, and the surviving animals were already under extreme stress.",

      "\"It's just absolutely horrific.\"",
      "The site - about 300km (186 miles) from the city of Launceston - is extremely difficult to access and transport any rescue equipment to, marine biologist Kris Carlyon told media.",
      "\"This is possibly the trickiest location I've seen in 16 years of doing this role in Tasmania,\" he said.",
      "\"We're talking a very rough, steep, single lane road into the site. We can get four-wheel drives in there, but not a lot else.\"",
      "Rough conditions meant returning the animals to the sea at the location they stranded was impossible, so an expert team tried to relocate two and refloat them, but were unsuccessful.",
      "\"The animals just can't get past the break to get out. They just keep turning around and coming back towards the beach,\" said Shelley Graham, from Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service.",
      "With conditions for the next two days forecast to be similar, expert wildlife veterinarians made the \"tough\" and \"confronting\" decision to euthanise the remaining whales.",
      "\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanasia is always a last resort,\" Dr Carlyon said.",
      "That grim task - which involves shooting the animals -  is expected to begin on Wednesday but continue on Thursday.",
      "Authorities are still working out how to dispose of the carcasses. The site has important cultural heritage for Aboriginal people so a department spokesperson earlier suggested \"it may be a case of... letting nature run its course\".",
      "Authorities have asked members of the public to avoid the site, with bushfires burning nearby and limited road access.",
      "More than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania - often on its west coast.",
      "Around 470 pilot whales were stranded further south at Macquarie Harbour in 2020 and about 350 of them died despite rescue efforts. Another 200 become stranded in the same harbour in 2022.",
      "Whales are highly social mammals and are well known for stranding in groups because they travel in large, close-knit communities which rely on constant communication.",
      "There are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disorientated after following fish they hunt to the shore.",

    "story": [
      "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.",
      "Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.",
      "This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.",
      "Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).",
      "This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.",
      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",
      "But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.",
      "Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.",
      "\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.",
      "\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"",
      "Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.",
      "But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.",
      "The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.",
      "\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"",
      "Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.",
      "At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.",
      "But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.",
      "This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.",
      "As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.",
      "\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.",
      "In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.",
      "This \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.",
      "This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.",
      "But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.",
      "The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.",
      "Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.",
      "Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.",
      "\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.",
      "Sea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.",
      "\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.",

      "But glaciers have been shrinking pretty much everywhere over the past 20 years as temperatures have risen due to human activities, principally burning fossil fuels.",
      "Between 2000 and 2023, glaciers outside the major ice-sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost around 270 billion tonnes of ice a year on average.",
      "These numbers aren't easy to get your head around. So Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service and lead author of the study, uses an analogy.",
      "The 270 billion tonnes of ice lost in a single year \"corresponds to the [water] consumption of the entire global population in 30 years, assuming 3 litres per person and day\", he told BBC News.",
      "The rate of change in some regions has been particularly extreme. Central Europe, for example, has lost 39% of its glacier ice in little over 20 years.",
      "The novelty of this study, published in the journal Nature, is not so much finding that glaciers are melting faster and faster \u2013 we already knew that. Instead, its strength lies in drawing together evidence from across the research community.",
      "There are various ways of estimating how glaciers are changing, from field measurements to different types of satellite data. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Direct measurements on glaciers, for example, give very detailed information, but are only available for a tiny fraction of the more than 200,000 glaciers worldwide.",
      "By systematically combining these different approaches, scientists can be much more certain about what's going on.",
      "These community estimates \"are vital as they give people confidence to make use of their findings\", said Andy Shepherd, head of the Department of Geography and Environment at Northumbria University, who was not an author of the recent study.",
      "\"That includes other climate scientists, governments, and industry, plus of course anyone who is concerned about the impacts of global warming.\"",
      "Glaciers take time to fully respond to a changing climate \u2013 depending on their size, anywhere between a few years and many decades.",
      "That means they will continue to melt in the years ahead.",
      "But, crucially, the amount of ice lost by the end of the century will strongly depend on how much humanity continues to warm the planet by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.",
      "This could be the difference between losing a quarter of the world's glacier ice, if global climate targets are met, and nearly half if warming continues uncontrolled, the study warns.",
      "\"Every tenth of a degree of warming that we can avoid will save some glaciers, and will save us from a lot of damage,\" Prof Zemp explained.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is the Paris climate agreement?",
      "These consequences go beyond local changes to landscapes and ecosystems \u2013 or \"what happens on the glacier doesn't stay there\", as Prof Zemp puts it.",
      "Hundreds of millions of people worldwide rely to some extent on seasonal meltwater from glaciers, which act like giant reservoirs to help buffer populations from drought. When the glaciers disappear, so does their supply of water.",
      "And there are global consequences too. Even seemingly small increases to global sea-level \u2013 from mountain glaciers, the major Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets, and warmer ocean waters taking up more space - can significantly increase the frequency of coastal flooding.",
      "\"Every centimetre of sea-level rise exposes another 2 million people to annual flooding somewhere on our planet,\" said Prof Shepherd.",
      "Global sea-levels have already risen by more than 20cm (8in) since 1900, with around half of that coming since the early 1990s, and faster increases are expected in the decades ahead.",
      "Melting glaciers leave homes teetering in valley of jagged mountains",
      "Satellite gathers best view of melting glaciers",
      "Swiss glaciers get 10% smaller in two years",

      "And now there is US President Donald Trump's \"national energy emergency\", embracing fossil fuels and ditching clean energy policies  \u2013 that has also begun to influence some countries and energy companies already.",
      "In response to Trump's \"drill, baby, drill\" slogan aimed at ramping up fossil fuel extraction, and the US notifying the UN of its withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, Indonesia, for instance, has hinted that it may follow suit.",
      "'If US is not doing it, why should we?'",
      "\"If the United States does not want to comply with the international agreement, why should a country like Indonesia comply with it?\" asked Hashim Djojohadikusumo, special envoy for climate change and energy of Indonesia, as reported by the country's government-run news agency Antara.",
      "Indonesia has remained in the list of top 10 carbon-emitting countries for years now.",
      "\"Indonesia produces three tons of carbon [per person a year] while the US produces 13 tons,\" he asked at the ESG Sustainable Forum 2025 in Jakarta on 31 January.",
      "\"Yet we are the ones being told to close our power plants... So, where is the sense of justice here?\"",
      "Nithi Nesadurai, director with Climate Action Network Southeast Asia, said the signals from her region were concerning.",
      "She said the \"richest country and the largest oil producer in the world\" increasing its production gives other states \"an easy excuse to increase their own - which they are already doing\".",
      "In South Africa, Africa's biggest economy and a major carbon emitter, a $8.5bn foreign-aided transition project from the coal sector was already moving at a snail's pace, and now there are fears that it may get derailed further.",
      "Wikus Kruger, director of Power Futures Lab at the University of Cape Town, said there was a \"possibility\" that decommissioning of old coal-fired power stations would be \"further delayed\".",
      "However he said that while there was some \"walk back\" from transition to renewables, there was still growth in the clean energy sector that was expected to continue.",
      "Argentina withdrew its negotiators from the COP29 climate meeting in Baku last November, days after Trump won the US presidency. It has since followed Trump's lead in signalling it will withdraw from the Paris Agreement of 2015 - which underpins global efforts to combat climate change.",
      "\"We now expect our oil and gas production to go up,\"  Enrique Viale, president of the Argentine Association of Environmental Lawyers, told the BBC.",
      "\"President Milei has hinted that he intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and has said environmentalism is part of the woke agenda.\"",

      "Potential foreign buyers are already lining up.",
      "India and the US have agreed to significantly increase the supply of American oil and gas to the Indian market.",
      "At the end of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit on 14 February, the two countries issued a joint statement that \"reaffirmed\" the US would be \"a leading supplier of crude oil and petroleum products and liquified natural gas to India\".",
      "A few days after Trump's inauguration, South Korea, the world's third largest liquified natural gas importer, has hinted its intention to buy more American oil and gas aimed at reducing a trade surplus with the US and improving energy security, international media have reported from Seoul.",
      "Officials with Japan's largest power generator, JERA, have told Reuters they too want to increase purchases of liquified natural gas from the US to diversify supply, as it currently imports half of it from the Asia-Pacific region.",
      "\"There is certainly a threat that if the US seeks to either flood markets with cheap fossil fuels, or bully countries into buying more of its fossil fuels, or both, the global energy transition might be slowed,\" said Lorne Stockman, research director with Oil Change International, a research and advocacy organisation for transition to clean energy.",
      "Scientists have said there can be no new fossil fuel extraction and there needs to be a rapid reduction of carbon emissions (around 45% by 2030 from the 2019 level) if the world is to limit warming to 1.5 Celsius compared to the pre-industrial period.",
      "\"The economics of energy supply are a key driver of decarbonisation,\" said David Brown, director of energy transition practice at Wood Mackenzie, a global energy think-tank.",
      "\"The resource base of US energy supports the role of natural gas and liquids production. By contrast, import-dependent economies such as China, India, and those in Southeast Asia have a dramatic economic incentive to decarbonise sources of energy.\"",
      "Global energy transition investment surpassed $2tn for the first time last year but studies have also shown that the growth of clean energy transition has markedly slowed in recent years, while many major banks continue to finance fossil fuels."

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:45:06 GMT",
    "summary": "The world's frozen oceans keep the planet cool, but they currently have less ice than ever recorded before.",
    "story": [
      "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.",
      "Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.",
      "This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.",
      "Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).",
      "This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.",
      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",
      "But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.",
      "Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.",
      "\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.",
      "\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"",
      "Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.",
      "But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.",
      "The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.",
      "\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"",
      "Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.",
      "At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.",
      "But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.",
      "This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.",
      "As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.",
      "\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.",
      "In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.",
      "This \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.",
      "This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.",
      "But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.",
      "The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.",
      "Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.",
      "Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.",
      "\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.",
      "Sea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.",
      "\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.",

    "summary": "Analysts say the Alibaba founder's re-emergence could signal a policy change in Beijing.",
    "story": [
      "A meeting between Chinese president Xi Jinping and some of the country's foremost business leaders this week has fuelled excitement and speculation, after Alibaba founder Jack Ma was pictured at the event.",
      "The charismatic and colourful Mr Ma, who was one of China's most prominent businessmen, had withdrawn from public life after criticising China's financial sector in 2020.",
      "His reappearance at Monday's event has sparked a wave of discussion, with experts and analysts wondering what it means for him, China's tech sector and the economy in general.",
      "The response has been overwhelmingly positive - tech stocks, including those of Alibaba, rallied soon after the event.",
      "On Thursday, the e-commerce giant reported financial results that beat expectations, with shares ending the trading day in New York more than 8% higher. The company's shares are up 60% since the beginning of the year.",
      "So what are analysts reading into Mr Ma's appearance at the event alongside other high-profile guests - including DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng?",
      "Is Jack Ma 'rehabilitated'?",
      "Analysts began looking for clues about the significance of the meeting as soon as Chinese state media started releasing pictures of the event.",
      "\"Jack Ma's attendance, his seating in the front row, even though he did not speak, and his handshake with Xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated,\" China analyst Bill Bishop wrote.",
      "Social media was abuzz with users praising Mr Ma for his return to the public spotlight.",
      "\"Congratulations [Jack] Ma for the safe landing,\" said one user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "\"The comeback of [Jack] Ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy,\" said another.",
      "It is unsurprising that observers have attached so much significance to an appearance by Mr Ma.",
      "Before his disappearance from public life in 2020 - following comments at a financial conference that China's state-owned banks had a \"pawn-shop mentality\" - Mr Ma was the poster boy for China's tech industry.",
      "An English teacher with no background in computing, Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba in his apartment more than two decades ago after convincing a group of friends to invest in his online marketplace.",
      "He went on to build one of China's largest tech conglomerates and become one of the country's richest men.",
      "That was before his \"pawn shop\" comment, when he also lamented the \"lack of innovation\" in the country's banks.",
      "It led to the cancellation of his $34.5bn (\u00a327.4bn) stock market flotation of  Ant Group, his financial technology giant.",
      "This was seen at the time as an attempt by Beijing to humble a company that had become too powerful, and a leader who had become too outspoken.",
      "Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.",
      "Some caution, however, that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed.",
      "Also, the lack of coverage his attendance received in Chinese media outlets seems to confirm he has not been completely rehabilitated.",
      "Is the crackdown on the tech industry over?",
      "Xi Jinping told participants at the symposium that their companies needed to innovate, grow and remain confident despite China's economic challenges, which he described as \"temporary\" and \"localised\".",
      "He also said it was the \"right time for private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to fully display their talents\".",
      "This has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces.",
      "Mr Ma's downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on China's tech industry.",
      "Companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules, as well as state control over important digital assets.",
      "Other companies across the private sector, ranging from education to real estate, also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the \"common prosperity\" campaign.",
      "The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.",
      "But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors.",
      "This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.",
      "Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough.",
      "As rumours that Mr Ma would attend Monday's meeting began to spread, so did a glimmer of hope. Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership \"had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand\".",
      "Aside from Mr Ma and Mr Liang, the list of guests also included key figures from companies such as telecommunications and smartphone firm Huawei, electric-vehicle (EV) giant BYD, and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors.",
      "\"The [guest] list showcased the importance of internet/tech/AI/EV sectors given their representation of innovation and achievement,\" said a note from market analysts at Citi.",
      "\"[It] likely indicates the importance of technology... and the contribution of private enterprises to the development and growth of China's economy.\"",
      "Those present at the meeting seemed to share that sentiment. Lei Jun, the chief executive of consumer electronics giant Xiaomi, told state media that he senses the president's \"care and support\" for businesses.",
      "Is it because of US sanctions?",
      "The symposium took place after the country experienced what some observers have described as a \"Sputnik moment\": the arrival of DeepSeek's disruptive R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model at the end of last month.",
      "Soon after its release, the Chinese-made AI chatbot rose through the ranks to become one of the most downloaded in the world. It also triggered a sudden sell-off of major US tech stocks, as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Back in China, the app's global success has sparked a wave of national pride that has quickly spread to financial markets. Investment has been pouring into Chinese stocks - particularly those of tech companies - listed in Hong Kong and mainland China.",
      "Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment.",
      "But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs.",
      "Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities.",
      "The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\".",
      "Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI.",
      "The goal is to achieve \"socialist modernisation\" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology.",
      "Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board.",
      "\"Rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny, [Jack Ma's] reappearance suggests that Beijing is pivoting from crackdowns to controlled engagement,\" an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, Marina Zhang told the BBC.",
      "\"While the private sector remains a critical pillar of China's economic ambitions, it must align with national priorities - including self-reliance in key technologies and strategic industries.\""

    "summary": "It found they were easily able to bypass age checks on apps, which face being banned for under-16s.",
    "story": [
      "More than 80% of Australian children aged eight to 12 use social media or messaging services that are only meant to be for over-13s, according to new research.",
      "It comes as Australia plans to implement a total social media ban for under-16s that is expected by the end of this year.",
      "The country's internet regulator, eSafety, found YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat were the most popular platforms used by young children.",
      "The regulator accused the apps of \"a lack of robust interventions\" for checking the ages of their users.",
      "The companies in question - Discord, Google (YouTube), Meta (Facebook and Instagram), Reddit, Snap and Twitch -  did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Users of all of these platforms must be 13 and over to have an account, though there are some exceptions.",
      "For example, YouTube has Family Link - when an account is accessible for children under the age of 13 under the supervision of a guardian - and the separate app YouTube Kids, which is specifically made for children.",
      "In the report, usage of YouTube Kids was not included for this reason.",
      "It has been reported that YouTube is likely to be spared from the social media ban when it comes into force.",
      "\"The findings of this report will be a helpful input to guide next steps,\" said eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant.",
      "Australia's robust stance on social media for young people is being keenly watched by the rest of the world - including the UK which has not ruled out copying its ban for young users.",
      "In its response to the study, TikTok took the opportunity to criticise the Australian authorities over its stance on YouTube. \"This report again shines a spotlight on the government's decision to give an exclusive carve out to the most popular social media platform for young Australians from the under 16 ban,\" said a spokesperson.",
      "\"Australian parents and guardians have a right to know what evidence, if any, supports the government's decision.\"",
      "'84% use social media'",
      "Researchers questioned over 1,500 children across Australia aged between eight and 15 about their usage of social media and messaging platforms.",
      "They found 84% of the children aged between eight and 12 who were surveyed had used at least one social media or messaging service since the beginning of last year. Over half of them used it via the account of a parent or carer.",
      "Staying with that age bracket, a third of the children who had used social media or messaging services had their own account, and 80% of them had help setting up their account/accounts from a parent or carer.",
      "The study also found only 13% of children who had an account had them shut down by the social media companies or messaging services for being under the age of 13.",
      "If you take YouTube out of the findings entirely, the report found 44% of children aged eight to 12 who were surveyed had used at least one other social media platform last year.",
      "'Inconsistency'",
      "\"These findings indicate there is inconsistency across industry regarding the steps taken to assess the age of end-users at various points in the user experience,\" the report's authors said.",
      "\"However, there is one thing they have in common: a lack of robust interventions at the point of account sign-up to a service to prevent someone under 13 from providing a false age or birthdate to set up an account.\"",
      "The regulator's report also surveyed the platforms themselves, which were asked how they verify the ages of younger users.",
      "Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube told the authors they deployed tools and technology to detect whether a user may be under the age of 13 once they were using the service.",
      "\"Proactive tools and technologies may rely on a user actively engaging with a service (such as connecting with others, communicating with others, sharing and creating content) to detect relevant signals,\" the report said.",

      "Microsoft has unveiled a new chip called Majorana 1 that it says will enable the creation of quantum computers able to solve \"meaningful, industrial-scale problems in years, not decades\".",
      "It is the latest development in quantum computing - tech which uses principles of particle physics to create a new type of computer able to solve problems ordinary computers cannot.",
      "Creating quantum computers powerful enough to solve important real-world problems is very challenging - and some experts believe them to be decades away.",

      "The firm believes its topoconductor has the potential to be as revolutionary as the semiconductor was in the history of computing.",
      "But experts have told the BBC more data is needed before the significance of the new research - and its effect on quantum computing - can be fully assessed.",

      "A host of technology firms, including the silicon valley giants, are currently engaged in a multi-billion dollar race to develop a quantum computer powerful enough to solve these problems.",
      "Microsoft is approaching the problem differently to most of its rivals.",
      "Its path to building a quantum computer relied upon being able to create a \"topoconductor\" or topological conductor.",
      "It uses the newly developed material to create a new state of matter- a so-called \"topological state\" which isn't a gas, liquid or solid and, until relatively recently, had existed only in theory.",
      "Specifically, it relies on so-called Majorana particles, which themselves were previously considered theoretical - work claiming that they had been discovered in 2018 had to be retracted.",
      "High risk, high reward?",
      "While rivals produced a steady stream of announcements - notably Google's \"Willow\" at the end of 2024 - Microsoft seemed to be taking longer.",

      "\"In the same way that the invention of semiconductors made today's smartphones, computers and electronics possible, topoconductors and the new type of chip they enable offer a path to developing quantum system,\" Microsoft said.",
      "The biggest challenge of quantum computers relates to their fundamental building block, called a qubit, which is incredibly fast but also extremely difficult to control and prone to errors.",
      "The more qubits a chip has the more capable it is.",
      "Microsoft says it has put eight of its new topological qubits on its new chip - considerably less than the chips created by some of its rivals.",

      "Professor Paul Stevenson of Surrey University said the research published by Microsoft was a \"significant step\", but he felt it had tough challenges ahead.",
      "\"Until the next steps have been achieved, it is too soon to be anything more than cautiously optimistic,\" he said.",
      "Chris Heunen, Professor of Quantum Programming at the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC he felt Microsoft's plans were \"credible\".",

    "summary": "It is the latest move from Meta to invest more in global connectivity rather than its apps.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has announced plans to build a 50,000km (31,000 mile) sub-sea cable across the world.",
      "The tech giant said Project Waterworth - connecting the US, India, South Africa, Brazil and other regions - will be the world's longest underwater cable project when completed.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has sought to extend its presence in technology beyond social media, including in artificial intelligence (AI) and the infrastructure that supports it.",
      "It said its new cable project would provide \"industry-leading connectivity\" to five major continents and help support its AI projects.",
      "\"This project will enable greater economic co-operation, facilitate digital inclusion, and open opportunities for technological development in these regions,\" Meta said in a blog post.",
      "The cable would be the longest to date that uses a 24 fibre-pair system, giving it a higher capacity, according to the firm.",
      "Sub-sea cables have become increasingly important as they provide the means to power a variety of digital services and transfer data worldwide at speed.",
      "One regularly-cited statistic suggests more than 95% of the world's internet traffic  is transferred through undersea cables.",
      "Telecommunications market research firm TeleGeography says there are currently more than 600 publicly-known sub-sea cable systems worldwide.",
      "This includes the 2Africa cable, backed by Meta and mobile network operators such as Orange, Vodafone and China Mobile, which links three continents and spans 45,000km.",
      "Tech's bigger stake",
      "Tech firms that serve as major providers of web services have invested huge sums in cable infrastructure.",
      "Google said in 2024 it would build the first sub-sea cable connecting Africa and Australia, and announced a $1bn investment to boost connectivity to Japan with two new sub-sea cables in the Pacific Ocean.",
      "\"Over the past decade there has been a shift in which these cables are increasingly laid by large technology companies,\" Professor Vili Lehdonvirta of the Oxford Internet Institute told the BBC.",
      "He said this is in contrast to the past, where underwater cables were laid and financed by large groups of national telecoms firms, due to their considerable investment needs.",
      "Prof Lehdonvirta said this reflects the growing size and position of big tech firms to be able to fund such infrastructure independently - something that \"may be significant to policy makers concerned with concentration in digital markets\".",
      "Telecoms and technology industry analyst Paolo Pescatore said it spoke to Meta's ambitions.",
      "\"Meta has shown a strong desire to own more of the connectivity slice,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"This is a further demonstration as it seeks to leapfrog rivals in providing users with an unique experience by tightly integrating hardware, software, platform and its growing aspirations in connectivity,\" he added.",
      "Protecting against threats",
      "The rising importance of sub-sea cables has increased concerns over their vulnerability to attacks or accidents.",
      "Following a spate of severed cables, experts have said undersea communications infrastructure is a growing arena for geopolitical tensions and conflict.",

      "This said pointed to growing concern over \"Russian and Chinese capabilities to hold undersea infrastructure at risk - particularly during periods of heightened tension or conflict\".",
      "Meta said in its blog post announcing Project Waterworth it would lay its cable system up to 7,000 meters deep and \"use enhanced burial techniques in high-risk fault areas, such as shallow waters near the coast, to avoid damage from ship anchors and other hazards\".",
      "Prof Lehdonvirta said the project appeared to diverge from more established routes, such as by skipping Europe and China and avoiding \"geopolitical hotspots\" in the Suez canal and South China sea.",
      "And he said connecting the US with major, contested markets in the Southern hemisphere could be viewed as \"bolstering US economic and infrastructural power abroad\"."

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 03:50:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's goal might be hindering the growth potential of the AI firm of his rival Sam Altman, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI's board of directors has officially rejected Elon Musk's nearly $100bn offer for the maker of what is the world's best-known artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT.",
      "But the unsolicited bid might not be a failure - at least as far as Musk is concerned, experts say.",
      "That's because the offer could still complicate CEO Sam Altman's plans to transform OpenAI from a non-profit controlled entity to a for-profit company.",
      "Musk is \"basically trying to stymie OpenAI's growth trajectory,\" said University of Cambridge associate teaching professor Johnnie Penn in an interview with the BBC.",
      "Profit & non-profit",
      "Last week, Musk and a consortium of investors including Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel tabled a $97.4bn (\u00a378.4bn) offer for all of OpenAI's assets.",
      "It was a huge sum - but less than the $157bn the firm was valued at in a funding round just four months ago, and much lower than the $300bn that some think it is worth now.",
      "Complicating all of this is OpenAI's unusual structure which involves a partnership between non-profit and for-profit arms.",
      "Mr Altman is understood to want to change that, stripping it of its non-profit board.",
      "That involves costs which Mr Musk is seemingly trying to inflate.",
      "\"What Musk is trying to do here is raise the perceived value of the non-profit arm of OpenAI, so that OpenAI has to pay more to get out of the obligations it has to its own non-profit,\" said Dr Penn.",
      "The value of its non-profit assets isn't clear. With his bid, Musk was floating a price, according to Cornell University senior lecturer Lutz Finger, who is also the founder and CEO of AI startup R2Decide.",
      "\"By Musk putting a price tag on the non-profit part, he makes the split way more expensive for Altman to do,\" Mr Finger told the BBC. \"It's very simple.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "'Missed the AI train'",
      "Mr Musk justified his actions by saying he wants to return OpenAI - which he co-founded - to its non-profit roots and original mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity.",
      "Others, though, suggest he has somewhat less noble motives linked to his own AI company xAI and chatbot Grok, which have received a lacklustre response from the public.",
      "\"Musk has missed the AI train, somewhat. He's behind, and he has made several attempts to catch up,\" Mr Finger said.",
      "Now, Mr Finger says, Mr Musk is trying to kneecap his most formidable competitor.",
      "An already-tense relationship appeared to worsen further last week with Mr Altman taunting Mr Musk's offer on X, and Mr Musk retorting by calling his onetime partner a \"swindler\".",
      "Mr Altman then hit back in an interview with Bloomberg, opining that Mr Musk is not \"a happy person\" and saying his decisions are made from a \"position of insecurity\".",
      "The tit-for-tat is also playing out in court, where US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is considering Mr Musk's request for an injunction that would block OpenAI from its planned conversion.",
      "He claims that he will be irreparably harmed without her intervention.",
      "\"It is plausible that what Mr Musk is saying is true. We'll find out. He'll sit on the stand,\" Gonzalez Rogers said during a hearing in Musk v Altman earlier this month in Oakland, California.",
      "According to OpenAI's lawyers, Mr Musk's recent bid contradicts his earlier claims that OpenAI's assets cannot be transferred away for \"private gain.\"",
      "\"[O]ut of court, those constraints evidently do not apply, so long as Musk and his allies are the buyers,\" their reply brief states.",
      "Some observers say making a deal never appeared to be his goal.",
      "\"I think he's just trying to create noise and news and consternation,\" says Karl Freund, founder and principal analyst at Cambrian-AI.",
      "But in addition to causing problems for his old rival, that strategy could inflict lasting damage on Mr Musk's own reputation.",
      "\"He's brilliant. He creates incredible companies that are doing incredible things. But his personal agenda is causing people to question his motives,\" Mr Freund said."

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Google is allowing advertisers to collect more personal information, which is harder for users to control.",
    "story": [
      "Privacy campaigners have called Google's new rules on tracking people online \"a blatant disregard for user privacy.\"",
      "Changes which come in on Sunday permit so-called \"fingerprinting\", which allows online advertisers to collect more data about users including their IP addresses and information about their devices.",
      "Google says this data is already widely used by other companies, and it continues to encourage responsible data use.",
      "However the company had previously come out strongly against this kind of data collection, saying in a 2019 blog that fingerprinting \"subverts user choice and is wrong.\"",
      "But in a post announcing the new rule changes, Google said the way people used the internet - such as devices like smart TVs and consoles - meant it was harder to target ads to users using conventional data collection, which users control with cookie consent.",
      "It also says more privacy options provide safety to users.",
      "Google told the BBC in a statement: \"Privacy-enhancing technologies offer new ways for our partners to succeed on emerging platforms... without compromising on user privacy.\"",
      "But opponents to the change say fingerprinting and IP address collection are a blow to privacy because it is harder for users to control what data is collected about them.",
      "\"By allowing fingerprinting, Google has given itself - and the advertising industry it dominates - permission to use a form of tracking that people can't do much to stop,\" said Martin Thomson, distinguished engineer at Mozilla, a rival to Google.",
      "What is fingerprinting?",
      "Fingerprinting collects information about a person's device and browser and puts it together to create a profile of that person.",
      "The information is not explicitly collected in order to advertise to people, but it can be used to target specific ads based on that user's data.",
      "For example, a person's screen size or language settings are legitimately needed in order to display a website properly.",
      "But when that is combined with their time zone, browser type, battery level - and many other data points - it can create a unique combination of settings which makes it easier to work out who is using a web service.",
      "These details along with someone's IP address - the unique identifier used by internet devices - were previously prohibited by Google for ad targeting.",
      "Privacy campaigners say that unlike cookies, which are small files stored on a local device, users have little control over whether they send fingerprinting information to advertisers.",
      "\"By explicitly allowing a tracking technique that they previously described as incompatible with user control, Google highlights its ongoing prioritisation of profits over privacy,\" said Lena Cohen, staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "\"The same tracking techniques that Google claims are essential for online advertising also expose individuals' sensitive information to data brokers, surveillance companies, and law enforcement,\" she added.",
      "'Irresponsible' change",
      "\"My argument would be that fingerprinting sits in a little bit of a grey area,\" says Pete Wallace, from advertising technology company GumGum.",
      "\"Should people feel comfortable staying in a grey area of privacy? I'd say no,\" he adds.",
      "GumGum, which has worked with the BBC on ad campaigns before, relies on something called contextual advertising, which uses other data points to target adverts to online users, such as keywords on the website they are on - rather than their personal data.",
      "Mr Wallace says allowing fingerprinting represents a shift in the industry.",
      "\"Fingerprinting feels like it's taking a much more business-centric approach to the use of consumer data rather than a consumer-centric approach,\" he says.",
      "\"This sort of flip-flopping is, in my opinion, detrimental to that route that the industry seemed to be taking towards this idea of really putting consumer privacy at the forefront.\"",
      "He adds that he hopes ad tech companies conclude \"that it isn't the appropriate way to use consumer data,\" but expects them to look at fingerprinting as an option in order to better target adverts.",
      "Advertising is the lifeblood of the internet business model, and allow many websites to be freely available to users without them having to directly pay to access them.",
      "But in return, users often have to give up private information about themselves so that advertisers can show them relevant adverts.",
      "The UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), says \"fingerprinting is not a fair means of tracking users online because it is likely to reduce people's choice and control over how their information is collected.\"",
      "In a blog post in December, the ICO's Executive Director of Regulatory Risk Stephen Almond wrote: \"We think this change is irresponsible.\"",
      "He added that advertisers and businesses which decide to use this technology will have to demonstrate how they are staying within data and privacy laws in the UK.",
      "\"Based on our understanding of how fingerprinting techniques are currently used for advertising this is a high bar to meet,\" he wrote.",
      "Google said in a statement: \"We look forward to further discussions with the ICO about this policy change.",
      "\"We know that data signals like IP addresses are already commonly used by others in the industry today, and Google has been using IP responsibly to fight fraud for years.\"",
      "A spokesperson added: \"We continue to give users choice whether to receive personalised ads, and will work across the industry to encourage responsible data use.\"",

    "story": [
      "Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky.",
      "Much to everyone's relief the impact turned out to be minimal.",
      "Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world\u2019s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated.",
      "That\u2019s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack.",
      "Quantum computing is radically different to the \u201cclassical\u201d computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states \u2013 one or zero, on or off \u2013 quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions.",
      "\u201cThe reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,\u201d Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's \u201cmuch, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.\u201d",
      "This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.",
      "The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today\u2019s computer networks.",
      "Today\u2019s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes.",
      "This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. \u201cAnything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,\u201d says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2.",
      "Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away.",
      "But progress is being made.",
      "In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer\".",
      "Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today\u2019s systems have a few hundred at most.",
      "But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.",
      "Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, \u201cWhat data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?\u201d",
      "That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe.",
      "Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break.",
      "The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.",
      "The agency said these would \u201csecure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.\u201d It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.",
      "The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,\u201d says Mr France.",
      "Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. \u201cThe challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),\u201d he continues.",
      "These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment \u2013 legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example \u2013 might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards.",
      "Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but \u201cIt's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.\u201d",
      "So, it is trying to help customers build \u201ccrypto agility\u201d by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. \u201cThat's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.\u201d",
      "And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites \u2013 such as the Starlink network \u2013 should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily.",
      "\u201cAt any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,\u201d Prof Sastry says. \u201cSo, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.\u201d",
      "More challenging, he says, are \u201cremote sensing\u201d satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.",
      "While the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of 2000, that's because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline, says Fran\u00e7ois Dupressoir, associate professor in cryptography at the University of Bristol.",
      "By contrast, he adds, that it is not possible to predict when current encryption will become vulnerable.",

      "\"It\u2019s just thrown away but it's gold,\" says Mr Venkatesh.",
      "Those pickers typically sell hair to local traders like Mr Venkatesh for between 10 cents and $1 (\u00a30.80) per kilogram, depending on the quality and length of the hair.",
      "Shorter or damaged hair fetches less, while longer strands bring higher prices.",

      "\u201cA diligent collector might gather 1\u20135 kilograms of hair in a day, earning anywhere from 59 cents to $6 per day. This income level is often below minimum wage standards, particularly in rural areas,\u201d says Mr Venkatesh, who has 50 pickers working for him.",
      "\u201cWhile our work contributes to a billion-dollar global market our earnings remain meagre. Intermediaries control prices.\u201d",

      "\"When we look at China there are hundreds of factories spread across the country which add value to the hair industry, whereas in India the value addition still needs to be picked up,\u201d Mr Cherian says.",
      "He says the government needs to help promote investment in the hair industry.",
      "\"It needs automated sorting systems, sophisticated hair treatment procedures for the hair collected, innovative production techniques for manufacturing of wigs which will make India stand out.\u201d",

      "The idea was to create high-quality hair extensions and wigs that would appeal to a broader range of customers.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:53:54 GMT",
    "summary": "An Indian drug maker tells a BBC undercover team its addictive cocktail drug is \u201cvery harmful\u201d but \u201cthis is business\u201d.",
    "story": [
      "An Indian pharmaceutical company is manufacturing unlicensed, highly addictive opioids and exporting them illegally to West Africa where they are driving a major public health crisis in countries including Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote D'Ivoire, a BBC Eye investigation has revealed.",
      "Aveo Pharmaceuticals, based in Mumbai, makes a range of pills that go under different brand names and are packaged to look like legitimate medicines. But all contain the same harmful mix of ingredients: tapentadol, a powerful opioid, and carisoprodol, a muscle relaxant so addictive it's banned in Europe.",
      "This combination of drugs is not licensed for use anywhere in the world and can cause breathing difficulties and seizures. An overdose can kill. Despite the risks, these opioids are popular as street drugs in many West African countries, because they are so cheap and widely available.",
      "The BBC World Service found packets of them, branded with the Aveo logo, for sale on the streets of Ghanaian, Nigerian, and Ivoirian towns and cities.",
      "Having traced the drugs back to Aveo's factory in India, the BBC sent an undercover operative inside the factory, posing as an African businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria. Using a hidden camera, the BBC filmed one of Aveo's directors, Vinod Sharma, showing off the same dangerous products the BBC found for sale across West Africa.",
      "In the secretly recorded footage, the operative tells Sharma that his plan is to sell the pills to teenagers in Nigeria \"who all love this product\". Sharma doesn't flinch. \"OK,\" he replies, before explaining that if users take two or three pills at once, they can \"relax\" and agrees they can get \"high\". Towards the end of the meeting, Sharma says: \"This is very harmful for the health,\" adding \"nowadays, this is business.\"",
      "It is a business that is damaging the health and destroying the potential of millions of young people across West Africa.",
      "In the city of Tamale, in northern Ghana, so many young people are taking illegal opioids that one of the city's chiefs, Alhassan Maham, has created a voluntary task force of about 100 local citizens whose mission is to raid drug dealers and take these pills off the streets.",
      "\"The drugs consume the sanity of those who abuse them,\" says Maham, \"like a fire burns when kerosene is poured on it.\" One addict in Tamale put it even more simply. The drugs, he said, have \"wasted our lives\".",
      "The BBC team followed the task force as they jumped on to motorbikes and, following a tip off about a drug deal, launched a raid in one of Tamale's poorest neighbourhoods. On the way they passed a young man slumped in a stupor who, according to locals, had taken these drugs.",
      "When the dealer was caught, he was carrying a plastic bag filled with green pills labelled Tafrodol. The packets were stamped with the distinctive logo of Aveo Pharmaceuticals.",
      "It's not just in Tamale that Aveo's pills are causing misery. The BBC found similar products, made by Aveo, have been seized by police elsewhere in Ghana.",
      "We also found evidence that Aveo's pills are for sale on the streets of Nigeria and Cote D'Ivoire, where teenagers dissolve them in an alcoholic energy drink to increase the high.",
      "Publicly-available export data show that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, along with a sister company called Westfin International, is shipping millions of these tablets to Ghana and other West African countries.",
      "Nigeria, with a population of 225 million people, provides the biggest market for these pills. It has been estimated that about four million Nigerians abuse some form of opioid, according to Nigeria's National Bureau of Statistics.",
      "The Chairman of Nigeria's Drug and Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig Gen Mohammed Buba Marwa, told the BBC, opioids are \"devastating our youths, our families, it's in every community in Nigeria\".",
      "In 2018, following a BBC Africa Eye investigation into the sale of opioids as street drugs, Nigerian authorities tried to get a grip on a widely abused opioid painkiller called tramadol.",
      "The government banned the sale of tramadol without prescription, imposed strict limits on the maximum dose, and cracked down on imports of illegal pills. At the same time, Indian authorities tightened export regulations on tramadol.",
      "Not long after this crackdown, Aveo Pharmaceuticals began to export a new pill based on tapentadol, an even stronger opioid, mixed with the muscle-relaxant carisoprodol.",
      "West African officials are warning that opioid exporters appear to be using these new combination pills as a substitute for tramadol and to evade the crackdown.",
      "In the Aveo factory there were cartons of the combination drugs stacked on top of each other, almost ceiling-high. On his desk, Vinod Sharma laid out packet after packet of the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail pills that the company markets under a range of names including Tafrodol, the most popular, as well as TimaKing and Super Royal-225.",
      "He told the BBC's undercover team that \"scientists\" working in his factory could combine different drugs to \"make a new product\".",
      "Watch India's Opioid Kings from BBC Eye Investigations on iPlayer or, if you are outside the UK, watch on YouTube.",
      "Aveo's new product is even more dangerous than the tramadol it has replaced. According to Dr Lekhansh Shukla, assistant professor at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences in Bengaluru, India, tapentadol \"gives the effects of an opioid\" including very deep sleep.",
      "\"It could be deep enough that people don't breathe, and that leads to drug overdose,\" he explained. \"And along with that, you are giving another agent, carisoprodol, which also gives very deep sleep, relaxation. It sounds like a very dangerous combination.\"",
      "Carisoprodol has been banned in Europe because it is addictive. It is approved for use in the US but only for short periods of up to three weeks. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, and hallucinations.",
      "When mixed with tapentadol the withdrawal is even \"more severe\" compared to regular opioids, said Dr Shukla. \"It's a fairly painful experience.\"",
      "He said he knew of no clinical trials on the efficacy of this combination. Unlike tramadol, which is legal for use in limited doses, the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail \"does not sound like a rational combination\", he said. \"This is not something that is licensed to be used in our country.\"",
      "In India, pharmaceutical companies cannot legally manufacture and export unlicensed drugs unless these drugs meet the standards of the importing country. Aveo ships Tafrodol and similar products to Ghana, where this combination of tapentadol and carisoprodol is, according to Ghana's national Drug Enforcement Agency, unlicensed and illegal. By shipping Tafrodol to Ghana, Aveo is breaking Indian law.",
      "We put these allegations to Vinod Sharma and Aveo Pharmaceuticals. They did not respond.",
      "The Indian drugs regulator, the CDSCO, told us the Indian government recognises its responsibility towards global public health and is committed to ensuring India has a responsible and strong pharmaceutical regulatory system.",
      "It added that exports from India to other countries are closely monitored and that recently tightened regulation is strictly enforced. It also called importing countries to support India's efforts by ensuring they had similarly strong regulatory systems.",
      "The CDSCO stated it has taken up the matter with other countries, including those in West Africa, and is committed to working with them to prevent wrongdoing. The regulator said it will take immediate action against any pharmaceutical firm involved in malpractice.",
      "Aveo is not the only Indian company making and exporting unlicensed opioids. Publicly available export data suggest other pharma companies manufacture similar products, and drugs with different branding are widely available across West Africa.",
      "These manufacturers are damaging the reputation of India's fast-growing pharmaceutical industry, which makes high-quality generic medicines upon which millions of people worldwide depend and manufactures vaccines which have saved millions of lives. The industry's exports are worth at least $28bn (\u00a322bn) a year.",
      "Speaking about his meeting with Sharma, the BBC's undercover operative, whose identity must remain concealed for his safety, says: \"Nigerian journalists have been reporting on this opioid crisis for more than 20 years but finally, I was face to face\u2026 with one of the men at the root of Africa's opioid crisis, one of the men who actually makes this product and ships it into our countries by the container load. He knew the harm it was doing but he didn't seem to care\u2026 describing it simply as business.\"",
      "Back in Tamale, Ghana, the BBC team followed the local task force on one final raid that turned up even more of Aveo's Tafrodol. That evening they gathered in a local park to burn the drugs they had seized.",
      "\"We are burning it in an open glare for everybody to see,\" said Zickay, one of the leaders, as the packets were doused in petrol and set ablaze, \"so it sends a signal to the sellers and the suppliers: if they get you, they'll burn your drugs\".",
      "But even as the flames destroyed a few hundred packets of Tafrodol, the \"sellers and suppliers\" at the top of this chain, thousands of miles away in India, were churning out millions more - and getting rich on the profits of misery."

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky needs to return to the negotiating table and strike a deal on US access to Ukraine's critical minerals, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz has said.",
      "On Wednesday, Zelensky rejected US demands for a share of its rare earth minerals - a \"deal\" Trump said would reflect the amount of aid the US had provided to Ukraine during its war with Russia.",
      "The comments, made at a White House briefing on Thursday, overshadowed a meeting in Kyiv between Zelensky and Keith Kellogg, the US chief envoy to Ukraine.",
      "Waltz said the White House was \"very frustrated\" with Zelensky after he levelled \"unacceptable\" insults at US President Donald Trump earlier this week.",
      "Ukraine holds huge deposits of critical elements and minerals, including lithium and titanium, as well as sizeable coal, gas, oil and uranium deposits - a supply worth billions of dollars.",
      "Earlier on Thursday, Waltz suggested US access to rare minerals in Ukraine could be exchanged in return for aid - or even as compensation for the support the US has already provided.",
      "\"We presented the Ukrainians really an incredible, and a historic opportunity,\" the adviser said, adding that it would be \"sustainable\" and \"the best\" security guarantee Ukraine could hope for.",
      "But Zelensky had refused the offer, saying: \"I can't sell our state.\"",
      "Waltz's comments in the White House news briefing came shortly after the conclusion of Zelensky's meeting with Kellogg in Kyiv, after which the Ukrainian leader announced he was ready to make an \"investment and security agreement\" with the US to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "The meeting was hailed as \"productive\" by Zelensky - but it more closely resembled an awkward political date.",
      "As the senior members of Donald Trump's team continued to engage directly with Moscow, the retired general had said he was in Kyiv to \"listen\".",
      "But it soon became apparent he wouldn't speak, publicly that is, after a news conference was cancelled at the last minute.",
      "The BBC understands it was a US decision, with Ukrainian sources claiming they believed Kellogg had been \"sidelined\" by the White House.",
      "The meeting with Kellogg had been of huge importance to Kyiv, given that officials are relying on the special envoy to relay its needs to Washington.",
      "In a post shared on X, the Ukrainian president said he and the US special envoy had \"a detailed conversation about the battlefield situation, how to return our prisoners of war, and effective security guarantees\".",
      "He added: \"Ukraine is ready for a strong, effective investment and security agreement with the president of the United States.\"",
      "Later on Thursday, Zelensky said he had spoken to the leaders of Canada, Finland, Norway and South Africa. \"Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,\" he wrote in one post on X.",
      "The possible reasons for Kellogg not wanting to face questions are mounting.",
      "Kellogg's meeting comes in the context of a war of words between his boss Donald Trump and Ukraine's leader, which culminated in the US president referring to Zelensky as a \"dictator without elections\".",
      "Trump also blamed him for starting Russia's invasion.",
      "Now there are reports that the US is refusing to recognise a UN resolution which labels Moscow as the aggressor while recognising Ukraine's territorial integrity.",
      "Earlier this week, Zelensky was excluded from talks between senior Russian and American officials who met in Saudi Arabia to discuss the possibility of ending the conflict.",
      "The war began when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, following its earlier annexation of Ukrainian territory.",
      "Trump, who has been in office for one month, believes US involvement in the war is not in America's interest - and in a radical reversal of previous US foreign policy, he has chosen to negotiate directly with Russia to secure a quick end to the conflict.",
      "On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emerged after more than four hours of talks with Russian diplomats in Riyadh to declare that the first steps towards negotiations had been agreed, with teams to be formed on both sides.",
      "After the meeting in the Middle East, Trump suggested Zelensky had \"started\" the war with Russia - claims which led Zelensky to describe the US president as \"living in this disinformation space\" governed by Moscow.",

      "The company had claimed its footwear could be classified as art and so was protected by copyright laws in a case it put forward to stop rivals selling copycat versions of the cork-soled sandals.",

      "His ruling added that for copyright protection, \"a degree of design must be achieved that shows individuality\".",
      "Birkenstock said in a statement that it \"continues its fight against copycats with undiminished vigour\" by exhausting \"all legal means to defend itself against imitations\".",
      "This ruling by the Federal Court of Justice, Germany's top civil court, is the final judgement which comes after two lower courts had heard the case and disagreed on the issue.",

    "story": [
      "More than 80% of Australian children aged eight to 12 use social media or messaging services that are only meant to be for over-13s, according to new research.",
      "It comes as Australia plans to implement a total social media ban for under-16s that is expected by the end of this year.",
      "The country's internet regulator, eSafety, found YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat were the most popular platforms used by young children.",

      "The companies in question - Discord, Google (YouTube), Meta (Facebook and Instagram), Reddit, Snap and Twitch -  did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Users of all of these platforms must be 13 and over to have an account, though there are some exceptions.",
      "For example, YouTube has Family Link - when an account is accessible for children under the age of 13 under the supervision of a guardian - and the separate app YouTube Kids, which is specifically made for children.",
      "In the report, usage of YouTube Kids was not included for this reason.",
      "It has been reported that YouTube is likely to be spared from the social media ban when it comes into force.",

      "Australia's robust stance on social media for young people is being keenly watched by the rest of the world - including the UK which has not ruled out copying its ban for young users.",
      "In its response to the study, TikTok took the opportunity to criticise the Australian authorities over its stance on YouTube. \"This report again shines a spotlight on the government's decision to give an exclusive carve out to the most popular social media platform for young Australians from the under 16 ban,\" said a spokesperson.",
      "\"Australian parents and guardians have a right to know what evidence, if any, supports the government's decision.\"",

      "Researchers questioned over 1,500 children across Australia aged between eight and 15 about their usage of social media and messaging platforms.",
      "They found 84% of the children aged between eight and 12 who were surveyed had used at least one social media or messaging service since the beginning of last year. Over half of them used it via the account of a parent or carer.",
      "Staying with that age bracket, a third of the children who had used social media or messaging services had their own account, and 80% of them had help setting up their account/accounts from a parent or carer.",
      "The study also found only 13% of children who had an account had them shut down by the social media companies or messaging services for being under the age of 13.",
      "If you take YouTube out of the findings entirely, the report found 44% of children aged eight to 12 who were surveyed had used at least one other social media platform last year.",
      "'Inconsistency'",
      "\"These findings indicate there is inconsistency across industry regarding the steps taken to assess the age of end-users at various points in the user experience,\" the report's authors said.",

      "That stance was applauded by numerous AfD supporters I spoke to at rallies in the lead-up to Sunday's election - including young women who told me they no longer felt safe on the streets.",
      "It's also worth noting that in May, a German court found that \"at least a significant part of the AfD\" believed that anyone with a migrant heritage was not \"properly German\" - even if they held German citizenship. It concluded that the AfD aimed to \"grant German citizens with a migration background only a legally devalued status\". This goes against the German constitution.",
      "Germany's next government",

      "Even if it becomes the second largest force in parliament, as predicted, it is very, very unlikely to make it into Germany's next government.",
      "The post-World War Two political system in Germany is designed so that no single party can dominate parliament as the Nazis did after they were first voted in, in 1933.",
      "Coalition-building is the name of the game. And there has been a so-called firewall in place since the end of World War Two - a cross-party consensus to keep the extreme right out of government.",
      "The AfD insists it is conservative and libertarian, not a radical, right-wing force.",

      "\"The comeback of [Jack] Ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy,\" said another.",
      "It is unsurprising that observers have attached so much significance to an appearance by Mr Ma.",
      "Before his disappearance from public life in 2020 - following comments at a financial conference that China's state-owned banks had a \"pawn-shop mentality\" - Mr Ma was the poster boy for China's tech industry.",
      "An English teacher with no background in computing, Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba in his apartment more than two decades ago after convincing a group of friends to invest in his online marketplace.",
      "He went on to build one of China's largest tech conglomerates and become one of the country's richest men.",
      "That was before his \"pawn shop\" comment, when he also lamented the \"lack of innovation\" in the country's banks.",
      "It led to the cancellation of his $34.5bn (\u00a327.4bn) stock market flotation of  Ant Group, his financial technology giant.",
      "This was seen at the time as an attempt by Beijing to humble a company that had become too powerful, and a leader who had become too outspoken.",
      "Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.",
      "Some caution, however, that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed.",
      "Also, the lack of coverage his attendance received in Chinese media outlets seems to confirm he has not been completely rehabilitated.",
      "Is the crackdown on the tech industry over?",
      "Xi Jinping told participants at the symposium that their companies needed to innovate, grow and remain confident despite China's economic challenges, which he described as \"temporary\" and \"localised\".",
      "He also said it was the \"right time for private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to fully display their talents\".",
      "This has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces.",
      "Mr Ma's downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on China's tech industry.",
      "Companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules, as well as state control over important digital assets.",
      "Other companies across the private sector, ranging from education to real estate, also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the \"common prosperity\" campaign.",
      "The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.",
      "But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors.",
      "This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.",
      "Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough.",
      "As rumours that Mr Ma would attend Monday's meeting began to spread, so did a glimmer of hope. Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership \"had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand\".",
      "Aside from Mr Ma and Mr Liang, the list of guests also included key figures from companies such as telecommunications and smartphone firm Huawei, electric-vehicle (EV) giant BYD, and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors.",
      "\"The [guest] list showcased the importance of internet/tech/AI/EV sectors given their representation of innovation and achievement,\" said a note from market analysts at Citi.",
      "\"[It] likely indicates the importance of technology... and the contribution of private enterprises to the development and growth of China's economy.\"",
      "Those present at the meeting seemed to share that sentiment. Lei Jun, the chief executive of consumer electronics giant Xiaomi, told state media that he senses the president's \"care and support\" for businesses.",
      "Is it because of US sanctions?",
      "The symposium took place after the country experienced what some observers have described as a \"Sputnik moment\": the arrival of DeepSeek's disruptive R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model at the end of last month.",
      "Soon after its release, the Chinese-made AI chatbot rose through the ranks to become one of the most downloaded in the world. It also triggered a sudden sell-off of major US tech stocks, as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Back in China, the app's global success has sparked a wave of national pride that has quickly spread to financial markets. Investment has been pouring into Chinese stocks - particularly those of tech companies - listed in Hong Kong and mainland China.",
      "Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment.",
      "But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs.",
      "Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities.",
      "The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\".",
      "Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI.",
      "The goal is to achieve \"socialist modernisation\" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology.",
      "Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board.",
      "\"Rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny, [Jack Ma's] reappearance suggests that Beijing is pivoting from crackdowns to controlled engagement,\" an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, Marina Zhang told the BBC.",
      "\"While the private sector remains a critical pillar of China's economic ambitions, it must align with national priorities - including self-reliance in key technologies and strategic industries.\""

      "But for the last few years, fans haven't been so sure.",
      "A year after the release of Daniel Craig's final film in the franchise, Amazon bought the series' parent company MGM. Since then, very little has happened.",
      "That finally changed on Thursday, when Amazon announced a new deal that would see long-term Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson step back, and Jeff Bezos's company take full creative control.",
      "In the intervening years, it's been widely reported that there was tension between Amazon, who understandably wanted a return on their investment, and Wilson and Broccoli, whose top priority remained protecting the Bond brand.",
      "The news of the deal has been met with mixed reaction from 007 fans.",
      "\"I'm in two minds,\" says David Zaritsky, creator of The Bond Experience fan channel on YouTube and Instagram.",
      "\"The nostalgic part of my mind feels a little bit of sadness. Broccoli and Wilson have been the custodians for all these years, so it feels like a bit of royal blood in lineage has been severed.",
      "\"That being said, nobody likes inactivity. And there's been a lot of inactivity around the James Bond franchise for many years, and I know that Amazon as a company will not have patience for inactivity.",
      "\"So I'm very hopeful, and dare I say even a little bit excited, that they're going to do something with the franchise that will be interesting nonetheless.\"",
      "Other franchises which have drastically expanded perhaps offer some clues about what we can expect from the forthcoming Amazon era of Bond.",
      "Lancelot Narayan, a James Bond historian, journalist and filmmaker, told BBC Radio 5 Live a good comparison is George Lucas selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, giving the company control of the Star Wars brand.",
      "\"They went off and made that sequel trilogy, and whether you like it or not, it got made rather quickly,\" he notes. \"There wasn't a three-year wait between films.\"",
      "However, despite the explosion in productivity, there is a feeling that both Marvel and Star Wars have overstretched themselves with their spin-off products.",
      "Narayan says he believes Star Wars has become \"creatively redundant\" since the explosion in productivity.",
      "\"The Star Wars TV series have been very hit and miss \u2013 Andor is fantastic, The Mandalorian is OK, I haven't seen Skeleton Crew... but there are very disparate creative voices going on there,\" he notes. \"So this is the worry, you need the correct creative people to run the show.\"",
      "Similarly, the Marvel Cinematic Universe built on the films by launching a string of Disney+ TV shows.",
      "The subsequent decline in Marvel's popularity arguably owes much to fan fatigue, something which won't have been helped by the huge number of story strands they had to keep up with.",
      "Both cases, Marvel and Star Wars, highlight the risks of brand expansion, which can cause long-term damage for short-term financial gain.",
      "Fans will be hoping any Bond extensions will be better than 2023's dubious game show 007: Road to a Million, hosted by Succession's Brian Cox, which was poorly received.",
      "The James Bond franchise, and particularly the subject of which actor will take over from Craig, is of such fascination to the public that it's the focus of a new show currently playing in Cirencester, called A Role To Die For.",
      "\"There are a lot of people who have grown up with it, for whom James Bond has been part of their culture their entire lives,\" says the appropriately named Derek Bond, who directs the show.",
      "\"As time has gone on, being able to reinvent that character and have him perhaps change with the times, has been the secret to his longevity.",
      "\"But I wonder if we're now in a situation where the times have changed so much, that James Bond now feels as if he belongs in a different era, and it needs something really radical to keep him relevant today.\"",
      "Character origin stories",
      "One area the company will almost certainly be looking at now they're in creative control is the potential for character origin stories, in a similar vein to other famous and beloved film characters who have received their own spin-off films.",
      "Cruella, an extension of the 101 Dalmatians villain, and Wonka, of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, have both been hugely successful film spin-offs in their own right in the last five years, with Emma Stone and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet respectively bringing the characters and worlds to a whole new audience.",
      "It's not hard to imagine the popularity of a similar film or show based on famous Bond villains such as Jaws, Oddjob, Blofeld, Goldfinger or May Day - all big brands in their own right.",
      "\"I mean, why has nobody made Moneypenny?!\" laughs Derek Bond. \"There's a great series to made about her and her journey.",
      "\"Also M, I'd love to know how Judi Dench's M ended up in that role. And the villains especially, it's a very rich universe, and it's easy to imagine the Marvelisation of it, where you have a kind of spin-off for every character that James Bond ever passed in a corridor.\"",
      "But Zaritsky notes: \"I think Amazon will stop short of doing it ad nauseum, to the point where they're having spin-offs about the MI6 janitor that sleeps in the corner. If they do have spin-offs, I think it's going to be prime characters.\"",
      "Not everyone is a fan of the idea. \"This is quite possibly the WORST thing to happen to this franchise,\" tweeted Griffin Schiller of Film Speak after Amazon's announcement.",
      "\"James Bond was more than your average franchise. It had class, prestige, they were indie films made as blockbusters... now? It'll be milked dry. It's truly the end.\"",
      "Broccoli has been seen as a steward of the brand throughout her tenure; a safe pair of hands who protected the traditions of the original character.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 05:13:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Research in Chile could help to provide drinking water for some of the world's most arid places.",
    "story": [
      "Capturing water from fog - on a large scale - could provide some of the driest cities in the world with drinking water.",
      "This is what researchers in Chile have concluded after studying the potential of fog harvesting in the desert city of Alto Hospicio in the north of the country.",
      "Average rainfall in the region is less than 0.19in (5mm) per year.",
      "\"Like a lot of cities, Alto Hospicio has its social problems,\" said lead researcher Dr Virginia Carter Gamberini, from Universidad Mayor. \"There is a lot of poverty\", she explained, and many people there have no direct access to the networks that supply clean water.",
      "Many who live in the city's poorest communities rely on drinking water that is delivered by truck.",
      "However, clouds of fog that regularly gather over the mountain city are an untapped source, researchers say.",
      "How do you harvest fog?",
      "Capturing fog water is remarkably simple - a mesh is hung between poles, and when the moisture-laden clouds pass through that fine mesh, droplets form. The water is then channelled into pipes and storage tanks.",
      "It has been used at a small scale for several decades, mainly in rural South and Central America - in places with the right foggy conditions. One of the biggest fog water harvesting systems is in Morocco, on the edge of the Sahara Desert.",
      "However, Dr Carter says a \"new era\" of much larger-scale fog harvesting could provide a more  secure and sustainable supply of water in urban environments where it is most needed.",
      "She and her colleagues carried out assessments of how much water can be produced by fog harvesting, and combined that information with studies of cloud formation in satellite images and with weather forecasts.",
      "From this, they concluded that the clouds that regularly form over the Pacific - and are blown across the coastal mountain city - could provide the people of Alto Hospicio's slums with a sustainable source of drinking water. They published their findings in a paper in the journal Frontiers of Environmental Science.",

      "World's glaciers melting faster than ever recorded",
      "Concerns UK's AI ambitions could lead to water shortages",
      "Alto Hospicio's fog forms over the Pacific Ocean - when warm, moist air flows over cold water - and is then blown over the mountains. The reliably foggy conditions here allowed Dr Carter and her colleagues to pinpoint areas where the largest volumes of water could be harvested regularly from the clouds.",
      "Based on an annual average water collection rate of 2.5 litres per square metre of mesh per day, the researchers worked out:",
      "17,000 sq m of mesh could produce enough water to meet the weekly water demand  of 300,000 litres that is currently delivered by truck to urban slums110 sq m could meet the annual demand for the irrigation of the city's green spacesFog water could be used for soil-free (hydroponic) agriculture, with yields of 33 to 44lb (15 to 20kg) of green vegetables in a month",

      "Alto Hospicio is on the edge of the Atacama Desert - one of the driest places on Earth. With little to no precipitation, the main water source of cities in the region are underground aquifers - rock layers that contain water-filled spaces - that were last refilled thousands of years ago.",
      "With urban populations growing, and demand on those water supplies from mining and industry, the scientists say there is an urgent need for other sustainable sources of clean water.",
      "Dr Gamberini explained that Chile is \"very special\" for its sea fog, \"because we have the ocean along the whole country and we have the mountains\".",
      "Her team is currently working on a \"fog harvesting map\" of the whole country.",

    "story": [
      "\"Morgiane\" is believed to be the oldest existing opera written by a Black American \u2014 but despite its historic significance, the show was only performed for audiences for the first time in 2025.",
      "\"Morgiane\" was the magnum opus of New Orleans-born composer Edmond Dede. The opera, based on themes from \"Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves,\" tells the story of a mother, Morgiane, and her daughter, Amine, who fight a tyrannical ruling sultan. Behind the curtain is Dede's remarkable story.",
      "Dede was born a free Black man in New Orleans in 1827. He was educated and moved to France in 1855, leaving just before the Civil War. In France, he studied music at the Paris Conservatoire and performed at Bordeaux's Grand Theatre. He also traveled to Algeria, then a French colony, and was inspired by the struggle of the people there.",
      "Dede returned to the U.S. once, during the height of the Jim Crow era. He was not permitted to perform in theaters, and went back to Europe, vowing that he would never return to his home country.",
      "Dede went on to write 250 songs, ballets and orchestral pieces. The 545-page \"Morgiane,\" completed in 1887, was his magnum opus, but it was never performed during his lifetime.",
      "In 2014, New Orleans Opera Creole founders Givonna Joseph and Aria Mason found a digital copy of \"Morgiane.\" Opera Creole shares music by composers of African descent, and when they found the piece, they knew they needed to bring it to an audience.",
      "\"I had, you know how you get, a gut feeling that this was important,\" Joseph said. \"I didn't know exactly how.\"",
      "Patrick Quigley, the artistic director designate of Washington, D.C.'s Opera Lafayette, was eager to join the mission. He and Joseph connected in 2023, and they began working with musicians and historians from across the country to bring the never-performed opera to life. First, they transcribed almost 6,000 measures of music into modern notation. When the process was done, they heard music that hadn't been played in over a century.",
      "\"It's this fabulous combination of so many different styles of music, both European and American all together in one place,\" Quigley said.",
      "Excerpts from \"Morgiane\" were played at New Orleans' St. Louis Cathedral on Jan. 24. The church was likely the site of Dede's baptism. The entire opera was performed at Opera Lafayette for the first time on Feb. 3.",
      "\"It was an incredible moment for Washington, D.C., and it was an incredible moment for American music,\" said Quigley, who conducted the performance.",
      "There were also two other performances, one in New York City and one in College Park, Maryland. The brief tour served as a kind of homecoming for Dede, said Joseph.",
      "\"I think he's a New Orleans hero,\" she said.",

      "Blake Lively was not alone in her feelings about Justin Baldoni's alleged conduct while making the film \"It Ends with Us,\"\u00a0according to the amended complaint filed Tuesday in New York. The actor alleged that her costar and the film's director made other women uncomfortable on set and their concerns were documented, the complaint said.",
      "The amended complaint from Lively's legal team included new allegations against Baldoni and his business partner, Wayfarer Studios CEO Jamey Health. It described an alleged incident in 2023 \u2014 after Lively said she reported experiencing \"unwelcome and uncomfortable behavior\" to various leads on the movie \u2014 where another woman in the cast \"reported her own concerns regarding Mr. Baldoni's unwelcome behavior\" and the ways in which she saw it hurting the film.",
      "Baldoni apparently responded to the cast member, whose name doesn't appear in the lawsuit, soon afterward, according to the document. He apparently acknowledged in writing his awareness of the cast member's concerns and indicated things would change, but according to the amended lawsuit they didn't. The complaint referenced another woman in the cast who later told Lively she felt uncomfortable on set, too.",
      "\"Ms. Lively was not alone in raising allegations of on-set misconduct more than a year before the Film was edited,\" said Lively's attorneys, Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb, in a statement. The attorneys said their amended complaint contains evidence to support that accusation \"as well as evidence detailing the threats, harassment, and intimidation of not just Ms. Lively, but numerous innocent bystanders that have followed defendants' retaliatory campaign.\"",
      "Lively and Baldoni have been embroiled in a widely publicized legal battle\u00a0since December, when the New York Times published her sexual harassment allegations against Baldoni. She also alleged that Baldoni retaliated after she spoke up about what happened on set. Baldoni has since sued the newspaper and Lively for defamation, seeking $400 million from her and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, alleging extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "Lively's accusations against Baldoni have partly centered on his alleged use of retaliation tactics to discourage the actor from speaking up by turning public opinion against her. The amended complaint suggested the retaliatory efforts have devolved into \"dangerously extreme\" acts of cyberbullying, harassment and intimidation, allegedly directed not only toward just Lively, but also toward her family, others in the cast of \"It Ends with Us\" and some witnesses.",
      "\"The culture of fear, intimidation, harassment and threats is the predictable result of an incessant digital campaign to turn social media sentiment as dark and negative as is humanly possible,\" a spokesperson for Lively said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Jed Wallace, the owner of crisis public relations firm Street Relations, was also introduced as a defendant in Lively's lawsuit in the amended version. Wallace, who was named in an initial civil rights complaint Lively filed in California prior to suing Baldoni, has been accused of helping orchestrate an alleged smear campaign to damage Lively's reputation and disincentivize her from speaking out. He has denied Lively's allegations and recently filed a defamation suit of his own against her.",
      "Baldoni's attorney, Bryan Freedman, characterized the amended complaint from Lively as \"unsubstantial hearsay of unnamed persons.\"",

What is truly uncomfortable here is Ms. Lively's lack of actual evidence,\" Freedman told CBS News in a statement.",

      "Screams were heard inside the courtroom upon the reading of the verdict as Rocky ran toward the back of the room to hug his longtime partner, Rihanna, who appeared inside the court on multiple occasions throughout the trial. Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, had faced up to 24 years in prison if convicted of all charges.",
      "At the start of the trial last month, he rejected a plea deal which carried a sentence of 180 days in jail.",
      "\"We said from day one, he was innocent. He turned down a plea for almost no jail time because he was innocent,\" Joe Tacopina, his defense attorney, told reporters outside the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center in downtown LA, where photographers swarmed Rocky and Rihanna following the verdict. \"We're honored to have represented this amazing family.\"",
      "Jurors had deliberated for just about three hours before reaching the verdict.",
      "Prosecutors had alleged Rocky shot twice in the direction of his former friend, Terell Ephron, near a Hollywood hotel in 2021. Ephron, another former member of the hip hop collective A$AP Mob who previously went by A$AP Relli, has said he was left with bullet-graze wounds above his knuckles. He testified that Rocky had allegedly threatened to kill him the same night.",

Fame does not place anyone above the law, and we will not waver in our pursuit of justice for victims and the community.\"",

      "Prosecutors alleged Rocky pointed a semiautomatic firearm at Ephron before opening fire during another later confrontation on the evening of Nov. 6, 2021. During the first few days of the trial, Ephron testified that Rocky said, \"I'll kill you right now,\" as he pointed the gun at him, saying it was pointed \"like towards my stomach, like towards like my head and shoulder.\"",
      "While he said he couldn't remember certain details, he told jurors Rocky had moved the gun as he pointed it, saying \"He was looking for a spot to shoot me.\" The prosecution had claimed Rocky then opened fire twice in Ephron's direction later that night, during another alleged confrontation which Ephron described during his testimony.",
      "\"So I see Rocky turn around, and when he turned around, he's like,\" Ephron said as he mimicked the gesture he says Rocky made with the gun, raising his arm into the air while pointing his fingers downward. \"Kinda looked like a movie. The whole thing looked like a movie.\"",
      "The former friends were near the intersection of Argyle and Selma avenues, an area of Hollywood just around the corner from the Walk of Fame, when prosecutors say Rocky opened fire.",
      "Ephron testified he was left with bullet-graze wounds just above his knuckles which he later sought medical treatment for.",
      "\"When he shot the first shot, I felt my hand hot,\" he told jurors from the witness stand last month, saying he grabbed another person there that night and \"used him as a shield\" to try dodging the gunfire. \"I'm just trying to like not get hit at this point,\" Ephron said.",
      "He testified he went back to the area later that night, after Los Angeles Police Department officers had responded to the scene, and collected shell casings he claims were fired by the gun. \"But I ended up going back and getting the actual bullets myself,\" he said, saying he brought a paper bag to collect them and took photos of them.",
      "\"It wasn't hard for me to find the bullets because I knew exactly where I got shot at,\" he said.",
      "Tacopina, Rocky's defense attorney, told jurors that Ephron fabricated that evidence and committed perjury during his testimony, describing him as a \"pathological liar\" during the trial. Tacopina said several police officers had responded to the scene before Ephron returned, saying they carried out a thorough search and never came across shell casings.",
      "\"What you'll learn is that Relli returned to that scene an hour later,\" Tacopina said of Ephron, referring to him by his former artist name of A$AP Relli. \"And he attempted to fabricate evidence... This is some offensive stuff.\"",
      "One of the defense witnesses testified to seeing Rocky with a starter pistol, which only fired blanks, on three occasions. A$AP Twelvyy, another former member of the A$AP Mob collective and longtime friend of Rocky, said the rapper carried around the fake gun as a means of security. The felony charges Rocky had faced do not apply if there was no real firearm involved.",
      "The defense argued the rapper could also be found not guilty on the basis of self defense. Both the prosecution and defense has agreed that Rocky and two other men who were with him that night walked away after the first of two confrontations in Hollywood on the night of Nov. 6, 2021, and that Relli followed them afterwards. However, prosecutors argued Rocky was the aggressor when he first allegedly pulled out the gun and then allegedly opened fire during the second incident.",
      "While arguing that Ephron attempted to extort Rocky, the defense presented recordings which a witness for the defense, Wally Sajimi, testified he made in 2022. On the recording, a voice resembling Ephron's says he will accept being paid to stop taking part in the case against Rocky. \"Once I walk away, when I get my cash, the case will get way weaker,\" the voice on the recording says.",
      "But prosecutors have said Ephron's testimony in court was consistent with what he told Sajimi during a recorded conversation \u2014 that the Grammy-nominated rapper had opened fire with a real gun.",
      "\"Mr. Ephron wants to be paid because he was the victim of a real crime by a real gun,\" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec told jurors last week. \"In that couple minutes, he tells the exact same details that he told you when he testified in this case.\"",
      "\"That's evidence they created. That's their person trying to trick Mr. Ephron, trying to get Mr. Ephron to say something damaging, say something that's gonna undermine this case,\" Przelomiec said of the recording submitted as evidence by the defense.",
      "During closing arguments, Przelomiec told jurors that witnesses who testified for the defense never told law enforcement that Rocky had a fake gun that night when the investigation first got underway. He said the prop gun was only brought up more than two years after the alleged shooting, when those witnesses spoke with Rocky's defense attorneys.",
      "\"The idea that they would not be running into the police station to tell their story is absurd,\" Przelomiec said of the defense witnesses.",
      "Meanwhile, the defense has honed in on what they allege is a lack of credibility in the prosecution's key witness.",
      "Tacopina told jurors during closing arguments last week that aside from Ephron's testimony, the prosecution's evidence \"consists of video, shell casings and knuckle scrapes,\" saying the videos alone do not prove the defendant's guilt and the shell casings were fabricated evidence.",
      "\"They mean nothing without believing his story,\" Tacopina said.",

    "story": [
      "A painting by street artist Banksy with an environmental message and an estimate of up to 5 million pounds ($6.3 million) is going up for auction, with some of the proceeds helping victims of the Los Angeles wildfires.",
      "Sotheby's auction house said Tuesday that \"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is being sold by Sotheby's in London on March 4 from the collection of Mark Hoppus, bassist with California skate-punk band Blink-182, who sees Banksy as a kindred spirit.",
      "Hoppus said he was drawn to the subversion, humor and intelligence of Banksy's work and the similarities between \"skateboarding, punk rock and art.\"",
      "\"I feel like street art and punk rock have the same core,\" Hoppus said. \"The left-out and overlooked making their own reality. \u2026 Just go make art. It's the same spirit. And I've loved art and especially street art ever since realizing that.\"",
      "\"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is part of a 2005 series of works in which Banksy put a satirical spin on famous paintings \u2014 withering Vincent van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" and smashing the diner window in Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks.\" The artist said his aim was to show that \"the real damage done to our environment is not done by graffiti writers and drunken teenagers, but by big business.\"",
      "The work going under the hammer is based on \"The Singing Butler,\" a painting by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano showing a couple in evening dress dancing on a beach as servants proffer sheltering umbrellas. Banksy has added a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste.",
      "\"We loved this painting since the moment we saw it,\" said Hoppus, who bought the artwork with his wife Skye in 2011. He said the painting \u2013 \"unmistakably Banksy, but different\" \u2013 has hung in the family's homes in London and LA ever since.",
      "Hoppus said he would use the proceeds of the sale to buy work by upcoming artists. Some will go to the California Fire Foundation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Cedars Sinai Hematology Oncology Research,",
      "Banksy, who has never confirmed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world's best-known artists. His mischievous and often satirical images include two male police officers kissing, armed riot police with yellow smiley faces and a chimpanzee with a sign bearing the words, \"Laugh now, but one day I'll be in charge.\"",
      "Several of his works have sold for multiple millions at auction. The record is almost 18.6 million pounds ($25.4 million at the time) paid at Sotheby's in October 2021 for \"Love is in the Bin\" \u2013 an image of a girl with a balloon that partially self-destructed during an auction three years earlier thanks to a shredder hidden in the frame.",

      "Dozens of fake, highly sexualized images of the actors Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and former tennis star Maria Sharapova have been shared widely by multiple Facebook accounts, garnering hundreds of thousands of likes and many reshares on the platform.",
      "\"We've removed these images for violating our policies and will continue monitoring for other violating posts. This is an industry-wide challenge, and we're continually working to improve our detection and enforcement technology,\" Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News in a statement emailed on Friday.",

      "How to spot deepfake images online",
      "An analysis of over a dozen of these images by Reality Defender, a platform that works to detect AI-generated media, showed that many of the photos were deepfake images \u2014 with AI-generated, underwear-clad bodies replacing the bodies of celebrities in otherwise real photographs. A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",
      "CBS News has sought comments from Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, and Maria Sharapova on this story. Johansson declined to issue any comment, according to a representative for the actor.",
      "Under Meta's Bullying and Harassment policy, the company prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",
      "But questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content. CBS News found dozens of AI-generated, sexualized images of Cosgrove and McCurdy still publicly available on Facebook even after the widespread sharing of such content, in violation of the company's terms, was flagged to Meta.",
      "One such deepfake image of Cosgrove that was still up over the weekend had been shared by an account with 2.8 million followers.",
      "The two actors \u2014 both former child stars on the Nickelodeon show \"iCarly,\" which is owned by CBS News' parent company Paramount Global \u2014 are the most prolifically targeted for deepfake content, based on the images of public figures that CBS News has analyzed.",
      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",
      "\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"The Board is actively monitoring Meta's response and will continue to push for stronger safeguards, faster enforcement, and greater accountability,\" McConnell said.",
      "Meta is not the only social media company to face the issue of widespread, sexualized deepfake content.",

      "\"We're happy to share that we've reached a deal to continue carrying Paramount channels, including CBS, CBS Sports, Nickelodeon and more,\" YouTube announced in a statement Saturday night. \"With this agreement, YouTube TV will continue to offer 100+ channels and add-ons including Paramount+ with SHOWTIME and will enable more user choice in the future.\"",
      "The statement ended with a note to YouTube TV subscribers, whose \"patience\" the company praised as it \"negotiated on [their] behalf.\"",
      "YouTube, the online video platform owned by Google, launched its subscription-based arm for television streaming in 2017, partnering with broadcast and cable networks that gave YouTube TV access to their programs.",
      "Whether the company's prior agreement with Paramount, which allowed it to stream a broad range of channels under the network's umbrella, would hold up for another year was uncertain until Saturday, as a dispute over carriage fees halted talks for a contract renewal.",
      "Carriage fees are costs that paid TV providers, like YouTube, make to broadcasters, like Paramount, for the rights to carry that broadcaster's programming.

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 11:37:22 -0500",
    "summary": "The actor, who received his fourth Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the legendary folk singer, talks about cultivating authenticity in his performances.",
    "story": [
      "The fires that ravaged Southern California last month turned too many of Malibu's most treasured places to ash. But some, like the legendary Shangri-La Studios, still stand. Over the years, Shangri-La has been used by some of the biggest names in the music business, like Eric Clapton and Adele. But it's also known as the house that Bob Dylan built. Even the old bus out back, legend has it, was used by Dylan on tour.",
      "Dylan even camped out on the lawn. \"I actually think it's in Clapton's biography that there was a period where Dylan had a tent in the rose garden here,\" said actor Edward Norton.",
      "For him, this is hallowed ground \u2013 and in a way, so is his latest movie role. In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Norton is folk music legend Pete Seeger, playing opposite Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as the young Bob Dylan.",
      "Norton says playing a music legend like Seeger was both sublime, and terrifying. \"I think every actor, some part of 'em wants to be a rock star, you know?\" he said. \"I think every actor holds the dream in some sense. I mean, I almost started crying at the idea of it, because, well, I was nervous about it. I was nervous about the whole enterprise. Because I thought the idea of a biopic about Dylan \u2013 if you just said it that way, I was, like, Oooh, like, I'm not sure. 'Cause to me, it has a mythical kind of place in me, and I thought, this could be really, really a bad idea.\"",
      "And here's just one of the challenges: Pete Seeger was an accomplished banjo player, so Norton had to become one as well, and the banjo's a tough one to learn.",
      "I said, \"We did an interview with Steve Martin, and he played the banjo for us, and watching him play the banjo, I mean, it's so complex and it's so fast.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I made the joke that I googled, you know, 'Is there an AI that can replace my hands with Steve Martin's?'\" Norton laughed. \"Or, you know, that thing where you put your arms behind your back and Steve Martin puts his hands under my armpits and does the playing for me? Which I'm not saying is not what happened, you know? It might have. Who knows?\"",
      "In the finished film, his playing looks and sounds authentic, because it is:",
      "That authenticity is something that Norton has always worked for, starting with his very first movie role, as a calculating killer in the 1996 thriller \"Primal Fear.\" Norton, who was raised in Maryland, cultivated an Appalachian accent so real that people thought he was actually from Kentucky, and he wound up with his first Oscar nomination. Three years later he was fighting it out with Brad Pitt in \"Fight Club,\" a film that has now become embedded in our culture.",
      "And although it has a huge following now, it was not successful when it was released. \"No, not at all,\" Norton said. \"And it was polarizing. I would say, there were those who absolutely, like, it hit them right in the center of their sense of their own selves. And then there were people who just absolutely thought it was garbage \u2013 panned it.\"",
      "In fact, it was roundly booed at the Venice Film Festival. But that didn't bother Norton, or his co-star Pitt. \"As the credits rolled, Brad looked at me in the dark crying, and he said, 'That's the best film we'll ever be in.' And I said, 'Me, too, and I think so, too.' And we were hugging each other and crying because we were so happy with, like, boos rising around us, you know what I mean? I think sometimes you just gotta, you know, let your own freak flag fly, and people will figure it out, or not.\"",
      "Norton has let his own freak flag fly in more than 40 films, like a mild-mannered police captain in \"The Grand Budapest Hotel.\" He was an ego-driven Broadway actor in \"Birdman\"; and he nailed the eccentric billionaire part in \"Glass Onion.\"",
      "Watching him on-screen, it's hard to believe Norton was once told he didn't have what it takes to make it as an actor. There was once a casting director who told him, \"Find another profession.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I had one of those, like, someone sits you down and says, 'You should do something else,'\" he said. \"Very, very, very well-known casting director in New York. One of the ones you hoped to get in front of. But look, if you don't run into moments where people lay some fundamental uncertainty around you [about] the path you've chosen, and you can't push through it, then you probably don't belong.\"",
      "There's little doubt he belongs in all of this: Norton has an Oscar nomination for every decade of his career, and he's in the running now for his work in \"A Complete Unknown.\" But he says that, for him, it's not about the awards or the money, but the chance to channel greatness.",
      "He said, \"If channeling their frequency gets people refocused on what it looked like when people were using the talents they had to further ideas and values that were bigger than themselves, then that is what makes it worth doing. Can we get people to re-engage with and be moved by and inspired by the idea of artists as agents of change?\"",

    "title": "Looking back at 50 years of \"Saturday Night Live\"",
    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 10:14:56 -0500",
    "summary": "On October 11, 1975, people tuning into the debut of a late-night comedy show saw something unlike any TV variety extravaganza they'd ever seen. Today, \"Saturday Night Live,\" produced by Lorne Michaels, is now an entrenched part of pop culture.",
    "story": [
      "On Saturday night, October 11, 1975, television viewers tuned in for a comedy variety show that looked nothing like they were used to. \"It's a sketch, a very unusual sketch, kind of in a minor key, [with] John Belushi as a kind of rumpled guy with a grocery sack,\" said writer Susan Morrison. \"He's supposed to be an immigrant trying to learn English.\"",
      "Instructor (Michael O'Donoghue): \"I would like\u2026\"Belushi: \"I would like\u2026\"Instructor: \"\u2026to feed your fingertips\u2026\"Belushi: \"\u2026to feed your fingertips\u2026\"Instructor: \"\u2026to the wolverines.\"Belushi: \"\u2026to the wolverines.\"",
      "When the instructor succumbs to a heart attack and falls to the floor, Belushi mimics him. \"It's about death,\" Morrison laughed. \"And that was something that variety shows did not traffic in in 1975!\"",
      "Morrison is the author of \"Lorne\" (that would be Lorne Michaels, the man behind \"Saturday Night Live\"). For 50 years now, \"Saturday Night Live\" has been putting on a 90-minute mix of live comedy sketches, beloved commercial parodies, and musical acts, each episode headlined by a celebrity host.",
      "So, what did variety shows look like before SNL? \"They took place on a big, wide stage; it was very shiny, very blank,\" said Morrison. \"And the content of these variety shows also was kind of a throwback \u2013 very hammy, almost vaudevillian, kind of Catskill comics doing seltzer-in-the-pants bits.\"",
      "Michaels worked on several of those shows, including \"Laugh-In.\" Morrison said, \"'Laugh-In' was really the first variety show that seemed to care about youth culture and being hip. But politically, that show was relatively toothless. What passed for political humor on 'Laugh-In' was Goldie Hawn doing kind of a dumb blonde bit.\"",
      "Michaels learned a different lesson working on a cornball comedy show hosted by Phyllis Diller.\u00a0 Its premiere episode in 1968 went up against a Barbra Streisand special. \"Streisand was the hottest thing out there,\" said Morrison. \"'Funny Girl' was about to come out. And Lorne thought, 'Oh my God, we're dead. Everybody's gonna watch Streisand.' But as it turned out, the Diller show beat Streisand in the ratings by a mile.",
      "\"And Lorne recognized, I think he said, 'You know, I realized there are two audiences. You know, there's the people I know, and then there's the wider American audience.' And to this day, he's always telling his young writers and performers, 'We have audience in all 50 states. We have to remember this is broadcast. It takes in the whole country.'\"",
      "Keeping all this in mind, Michaels set about creating a show for his own generation. As it happened, NBC's then-president was thinking along the same lines. And while it's fun to knock network executives, one of the revelations in \"Lorne\" is the role that Herb Schlosser played.",
      "\"He was a visionary president of NBC who was looking to fill a hole on Saturday night, when the network had been running Johnny Carson reruns,\" said Morrison. \"And he dictated a memo that pretty much hit all the points of what SNL was to be. He wanted to do a show out of Studio 8H at 30 Rock, which had basically been dormant, you know, since the '50s. He wanted it to be live. He wanted it to be on at 11:30 Saturday night. He wanted it to have rotating hosts.\"",
      "Before Michaels even hired his cast, he hired the writers, among them, Alan Zweibel. \"If you look at those early days of SNL, the logo for the show was 'Saturday Night Live' spray-painted on the outside wall of what was then called the RCA Building,\" he said. \"It was like graffiti. And I thought it spoke volumes. Here these kids came along besmirching whatever the standard was, whatever the establishment was.\"",
      "Zweibel had been working in a deli when he got the gig: \"I gave him a book with my jokes in it. The first joke that I put, saying that the post office is about to issue a stamp commemorating prostitution in the United States. 'It's a 10-cent stamp. But if you want to lick it, it's a quarter.' And they laughed, and it was great. I was now a professional comedy writer.\"",
      "The writers were young, and the cast were unknowns. Morrison said, \"He really wanted the show to feel like it was speaking in the voice of everybody's funny, sarcastic friend, you know, grousing, wisecracking, just the way people are when they're trying to make their friends laugh.\"",
      "And over the past five decades, America has become friends with more than a hundred different cast members and the characters they've created, not to mention all those catchphrases that have seeped into our conversation, like \"Well, isn't that special,\" or \"I gotta have more cowbell.\"",
      "The writers and actors know that the best way to make the audience laugh is to make each other laugh.",
      "Rachel Dratch was on the show from 1999 to 2006. She and longtime writer Paula Pell created Debbie Downer \u2013 that friend we all have who always manages to bring the party down.",
      "Dratch recalled, \"I think it was Paula said, like, 'Let's set it somewhere really happy. So, let's put it at Disney World.' And then it started to flow. And then as we were writing we were making each other laugh a lot, but then we started going, like, wah-wah. Like, just to each other. I think it was Paula who said, like, 'What if we just put the trombone in the scene?'\"",
      "Pell said, \"And then we did it for that first time, and it was where everyone lost their minds laughing on \u2013 they were wiping their eyes with waffles. And I remember being in a dressing room watching it on the thing, and just tears coming down my d\u00e9colletage and laughing so ungodly hard. It was such a lightning-in-a-bottle moment at that show where you're, like, I will never forget this five minutes ever in my life!\"",
      "For material, the staff is encouraged to draw from their own lives. \"I was always, always wanting to be a cheerleader,\" said Pell. \"And every year, every summer, I worked on my back handsprings. I was a little chubby girl. I was very strong. I was nice and loud. I was really good at cheerleading. And every year, I didn't get it.\"",
      "So, Pell collaborated with Cheri Oteri and Will Ferrell on their Spartan cheerleaders sketch:",
      "\"So, the Spartan cheerleaders, that comes from a real place?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it comes from the place of, like, joyful loser existence,\" said Pell. \"You go, 'Oh, I didn't make it. Let's go cheer anyway. We're gonna get costumes. Let's go cheer for things nobody is gonna kick us out on,' and they still get to be dramatic cheerleaders.\"",
      "Over the run of the show, the tone of SNL has shifted away from gritty and dark, towards colorful and more, well, cheerful. Morrison writes that Lorne Michaels began directing his staff to \"do it in sunshine.\" She explained: \"Do it in sunshine means first of all, everyone should look pretty good, you know? You want the costumes to be flattering, the colors to be bright. You don't want anger. He very often counsels writers to avoid writing anger. People don't put on a television to see people yelling at each other. Fred Armisen told me that Lorne said once, 'There's enough misery in the world. People huddle around the television as if they're huddling around a fire.'\"",
      "Armisen played Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi. \"I try to keep it, you know, even with the dictators I've played, I've even approached them with \u2013 I can't believe I'm saying this \u2013 like, love and kindness. So, for Qaddafi I'm like, 'I'm gonna love this character. Whoever this guy is, I'm gonna love him and just imagine him as an eccentric at his very worst.'\"",
      "Armisen spent 12 seasons on \"Saturday Night Live.\" To hear him tell it, it wasn't nearly enough. \"I loved it. It was just the best existence,\" he said. \"If you're sitting out three sketches in a row and you're like, 'Oh, I'm not in these,' it is awesome to watch your castmates put something together and see that magic happen. It's fantastic.\"",

    "summary": "The author has spent more than 50 years finding ways to explain things, via his humorous and intricately illustrated books featuring wooly mammoth guides \u2013 his attempt to hook young readers on the wonders right before their eyes.",
    "story": [
      "Confession: I'm just mad about the mammoth, the one that wandered out of the Ice Age into one of author-illustrator David Macaulay's books \u2013 where he found his purpose in life (if that's a mammoth thing) helping Macaulay explain the way things work to kids.",
      "\"I was desperate to find a humorous way of explaining levers,\" said Macaulay, who realized levers have probably been around for a long time. \"So, I put the mammoth on the end of the log, and put the log on the rock to have a fulcrum, and the villagers on this end of the lever. The problem that had to be solved was, what does the mammoth weigh? So, it's as simple as that!\"",
      "Since it came out in 1988, \"The Way Things Work\" has sold more than a million copies around the world. Mammoth (and a whole herd of his friends) have made their way into other Macaulay books as well.",
      "Asked how many mammoths he thinks he's drawn, Macaulay replied, \"It's like 43,272, I believe. That's just a guess.\"",
      "With or without the help of mammoths, but always with a sense of humor, Macaulay has come to be known as \"America's Explainer-in-chief.\" He is a multi-award-winning star in the children's picture book world and a Macarthur \"genius grant\" recipient, having explained all kinds of things in more than two dozen books over the course of his 50+ year career: the human body \u2026 cathedrals \u2026 castles \u2026 toilets \u2026 the pyramids \u2026 ships \u2026 the city of Rome.",
      "\"I miss Rome,\" he said. \"I think about it often, and I think about particular streets and places in Rome.\"",
      "As an architecture student at the Rhode Island School of Design, Macaulay spent a year there. Born in England, he moved to the United States at the age of ten with his family.",
      "An ongoing exhibit at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., explores the messiness of creating a book. It is toplined, literally, as chaos: \"Chaos, that's where this process started, and in fact it's where all my books start,\" he said. \"This whole thing [depicts] the inside of my brain, and those clouds floating overhead were an attempt to sort of suggest some of that, you know, the things that go through your mind when you think, This is not going to work.\"",
      "\"Some of these look like procrastination,\" I said.",
      "\"Oh, procrastination is my gift,\" said Macaulay. \"I always find that in the end, if I'm using my imagination, if I'm asking the right questions, then the procrastination is working in my favor. I just have to keep drawing.\"",
      "And drawing \u2026 and drawing. The exhibits features just some of the drawings he produced while he was figuring out who would be the ideal tour guide of Rome with the perfect point of view. \"Why not a pigeon carrying a message from somebody who lives outside the city to someone who lives inside the city? And it took the scenic route, which was ideal.\"",
      "Early one fall morning, Macaulay brought us to the Ledyard Bridge. On one aside, Vermont; over there, New Hampshire, the Connecticut River in-between. He began sketching the bridge: \"The weight of all of this is supported on this arch, and transferred into these piers,\" he said.",
      "He wanted us to realize that, for him, sketching is seeing. Sketching is a language for understanding. \"We look at things, but do we actually see them?\" he said. \"What better way to spend time with a structure like this than with a sketchbook in your hand, looking at specific details? I think that's my goal in a way, is to have people open their eyes to the ordinary, to the everyday, to the things they take for granted.\"",
      "Like the sorts of things, both man-made and natural, that Macaulay sees when he walks his dogs, Maya and Minnow, in Norwich, Vt., where he lives.",
      "His storyboard details the objects that hold his fascination: \"Once she's stopped and I'm holding the leash, I think, 'I wonder how many pieces of wood are in that fence? Wonder how it's fastened together?'\"",
      "Walks with Stella, his beloved previous dog, are the basis for the book he's working on now. What's starting to take shape on his wall is David Macaulay's stealth attempt to hook kids on the wonder right before their eyes.\u00a0 \"I thought maybe I can create a book that will help them connect,\" he said. \"What better way to do that than to maybe use myself as an example?\"",
      "It's the first time his work has ever been this personal and introspective. At 78, this time, the point of view is his own.",
      "But why? And why now? \"My sort of conscience, perhaps a little bit, a little payback here after all these years of being able to do what I want, really, and be successful at it, be rewarded for it,\" he said. \"It's time to maybe pay that off.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 15:18:26 -0500",
    "summary": "The new Frosty flavor will be available at Wendy's locations beginning in late February.",
    "story": [
      "Wendy's Frosty's is a beloved treat \u2014 and a new addition to the lineup will combine the familiar frozen dairy dessert with a beloved Girl Scout cookie.",
      "Frosty's have been a staple of the Wendy's menu since the late 1960s when founder Dave Thomas decided to add a frozen treat to it. The drink has only grown in popularity. Last year, the chain served 500 per minute in the United States. The Frosty falls somewhere between soft serve and hard-packed ice cream, creating a frozen creamy treat that's stood the test of time.",
      "For decades, just one flavor \u2014 chocolate \u2014 was available. In 2006, vanilla joined the lineup. In 2022, the fast-food chain started trying new limited-edition flavors.",
      "On Feb. 21, the fast food chain will start selling Thin Mint-flavored Frostys. Fans are excited about the idea, which will combine the smooth Frosty with the mint-chocolate-chip flavors of a Thin Mint, but designing the treat was harder than people may think.",
      "The cookie didn't lend itself to a frozen treat, so the recipe had to be tweaked, according to John Li, Wendy's Vice President of Research and Development. Instead of frozen pieces or chunks of cookie, Li and his team wound up developing a fudge-like cookie butter that can be swirled into a Frosty.",
      "The cookie butter adds the flavor of a Thin Mint but makes it possible for customers to still get their Frosty quickly. The way it's swirled into the frozen treat ensures that customers get a taste of Thin Mint in every sip or bite. The swirl can be added to either chocolate or vanilla Frosty's. Li said they initially thought about only offering one flavor, but decided that the swirl worked well in both.",
      "\"You can't get more nostalgic than a Wendy Frosty and the Girls Scouts,\" said Li. \"The fact that they're coming together really pulls at the heartstrings of food lovers in this country.\"",

Cuts to its grant funding will limit our ability to prove that new conditions are WTC related, and should be added to the list of covered conditions.

      "\"The research is vital to the 9/11 community because it's the research that allows us to add illnesses to the bill as we move forward. Last year we added uterine cancer for the 69th cancer under the bill,\" said Feal. \"More and more people are getting sick, and more and more people are coming up with new illnesses.\"",

      "The vast majority of human cases have been blamed on direct, often intensive exposure to sick cows or birds.",
      "Data reported so far by the CDC from testing labs suggests that this winter's record surge of influenza is being driven by seasonal strains of the virus, not human-to-human spread of a bird flu strain.",
      "However, investigations of a handful of human bird flu cases in the U.S. have so far not been able to identify a source of how they may have gotten sick.",
      "The first U.S. bird flu hospitalization was reported last year in Missouri, though health officials think the patient tested positive while hospitalized for other reasons, not bird flu. A second hospitalization was later reported in Louisiana, in a patient who died from the virus.",
      "Which bird flu strain sickened the new cases?",
      "It is unclear which strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus caused the Ohio and Wyoming cases. Answering that question has been a focus of experts and health officials for previous cases, as they track the evolution of the virus.",

      "A spokesperson for Ohio's health department said that information was not immediately available.

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:59:59 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said his administration is considering dividend checks based on savings found by DOGE. Economists are skeptical.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he's considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. But economists and policy experts across the political spectrum expressed skepticism about the feasibility of such a \"DOGE dividend.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,\" Mr. Trump said at the FII Priority summit, an investment conference in Miami sponsored by Saudi government entities. Mr. Trump didn't provide further details.",
      "The idea of the so-called DOGE dividend surfaced on social media this week when a four-page proposal was posted by an X user, James Fishback. The post caught the eye of Musk, the owner of X, who is spearheading DOGE, and who on Tuesday said he would pitch the idea to Mr. Trump.",
      "According to Fishback's calculation, 20% of the supposed $2 trillion in eventual DOGE savings would be provided to some taxpayers in the form of a direct tax rebate, which he estimated at $5,000 per household. Only households with a tax liability would receive the payment, which means lower-income households that generally don't owe income taxes wouldn't be included.",
      "But economists and policy experts said the plan isn't likely to materialize, citing the implausibility of finding anywhere near $2 trillion in federal cuts, as well as the legislative hurdles in approving such a direct tax payment.",
      "\"It is completely impossible for DOGE to save $2 trillion,\"Jessica Reidl, an economist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Two-thirds of the $7 trillion federal budget goes to Social Security, Medicare, defense, veterans and interest on the debt \u2014 all of which has been taken off the table by President Trump.\"",
      "She added, \"Saving $2 trillion would require eliminating nearly every remaining federal program. DOGE has no legal or constitutional authority to cut this spending; Congress must pass a law and that will not happen.\"",
      "Two-thirds of the nation's $6.7 trillion in annual spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0commitments through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense. In a Feb. 18 interview on Fox News' \"The Sean Hannity Show,\" Mr. Trump reiterated his earlier vow that Social Security and Medicare cuts are off the table.",
      "\"Social Security won't be touched, other than fraud or something,\" Mr. Trump said during the interview. \"We're going to find it's going to be strengthened, but won't be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.\"",
      "On Feb. 19, Mr. Trump backed the House Republicans' budget proposal, which, if enacted, would include deep cuts to Medicaid, the nearly $900-billion-a-year government health insurance program that serves about 79 million mostly low-income or disabled Americans.",
      "The White House didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE cuts",
      "As of Wednesday, DOGE claims it has made cuts that add up to\u00a0about $8.4 billion, according to the task force's own\u00a0documentation.",
      "While DOGE has only been operating since Mr. Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, its cuts are far from reaching Musk's stated goal of shaving $500 billion in annual government spending, let alone reaching near $2 trillion, experts noted.",
      "The plan \"is very unrealistic,\" Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, who describes himself as a libertarian, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I'd love to see it, but I think that is unrealistic, especially in the first year, and certainly unrealistic without Congress getting involved.\"",
      "Any new tax refund check would need the approval of Congress, which controls government spending and is in charge of crafting tax laws. But House Republicans are currently\u00a0negotiating a budget proposal\u00a0that would enact trillions of dollars in spending cuts to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as other tax provisions the president promised on the campaign trail.",
      "A DOGE dividend \"will make their numbers even harder to work in the budget reconciliation,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a Washington, D.C.-based left-leaning economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's hard to see how to make the math work.\"",
      "While a plan for some kind of DOGE dividend could materialize, it would doubtless be a much smaller amount than envisioned, given the practical impossibility of finding $2 trillion in federal cuts.",
      "Experts noted that rebate checks are typically issued in times of economic stress, such as during the pandemic, when Congress authorized several rounds of stimulus checks. But the U.S. economy today is viewed as strong, given growing GDP and low unemployment, they added.",
      "At the same time, the federal government's annual outlays are outpacing revenue by about $2 trillion, creating budget deficits and sending the nation's debt to a record $36.2 trillion.",
      "Reidl noted, \"Washington is facing annual budget deficits that will likely surpass $3 trillion within the next few years. Sending taxpayers dividend checks would be completely irresponsible.\"",
      "DOGE facing legal issues",
      "Experts also raised the issue of whether DOGE's cuts could be reversed by the courts, given that the group is facing multiple lawsuits over its access to sensitive data across various agencies as well as over the legality of its creation.",
      "\"I'm happy to see [DOGE] identify things that can be cut, but I do have concerns about the legality of it,\" Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute said. \"Congress appropriates money, and having the presidential quasi-commission go around and cut things seems like it would run afoul of a lot of laws.\"",
      "DOGE's savings so far could \"be reversed by the courts for bypassing Congress,\" Reidl noted.",
      "Given the challenges of trying to find anything close to $2 trillion in savings, as well as the legislative issues in passing a tax rebate check, experts said their advice to taxpayers is not to bank on getting a DOGE dividend.",

      "Walmart expects first quarter earnings per share of between 57 cents and 58 cents, well below the 64 cents Wall Street was expecting, and for the year. Walmart expects earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. That's also off the $2.77 that analysts are predicting, according to FactSet.",
      "It forecast a 3% to 4% increase in quarterly sales or between $166.35 billion and $167.97 billion. That could be a letdown for industry analysts, who had expected sales of $167.05 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Walmart expects sales to be up anywhere between 3% to 4% for the current year, or between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That too falls short of the $708.72 billion that analysts predicted, according to FactSet.",
      "Inflation-weary consumers",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly financial results and numbers could provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper, particularly amid new trade barriers that according to most economists threaten to reignite inflation.",
      "Consumers over the past year have increasingly focused more on necessities rather than TVs, furniture or appliances. They've become much more discerning about big-ticket purchases because of higher costs for credit as well as for groceries.",
      "Walmart has flourished in that environment, using its clout to keep prices down. It's gained market share, notably among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart's online offerings and paid membership, Walmart +, have also drawn wealthier customers",
      "\"We have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an eCommerce business driven by faster delivery times,\" said CEO Doug McMillon. \"We're gaining market share, our top line is healthy, and we're in great shape with inventory.\"",
      "Tariff risks",
      "Still, Walmart could be faced with challenges with the new tariffs carrying more economic risks than during Trump's first term. If Americans are hit by a new wave of price increases, economists say, and with 70% of the U.S. economy driven by consumers a broad pullback in spending would have ramifications beyond Walmart's sales.",
      "Government data last week revealed a sharp drop in January retail sales as cold weather kept more Americans indoors. But it was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest in a year. Sales were revised higher for December, possibly indicating a pullback by consumers after a holiday season splurge.",
      "\"[T]here are a lot of potential headwinds from sticky inflation, high debt levels, and a suppressed housing market. The uncertainty of tariffs and their impact on prices adds another changeable dimension,\" noted Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a Feb. 14 research note about the retail data.",
      "Yet grocery prices, a sore point for American households, continued to rise.",
      "Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, reported earnings of $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31. That compares with $5.49 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share for the most recent quarter was 66 cents.",
      "Sales rose 4.1% to $180.55 billion in the quarter.",
      "Analysts expected 65 cents per share on sales of $180.07 billion in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet.",

      "Online searches for gambling addiction-related terms have surged in recent years across the U.S., especially in states that have legalized online sports betting, according to a study published on Monday in the American Medical Association's peer-reviewed journal.",
      "Since the Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association Supreme Court decision allowed states to legalize sports betting in 2018, there were 23% more searches nationwide (approximately 6.5 to 7.3 million queries) related to seeking help for gambling addiction, the study found. The researchers analyzed search queries mentioning gambling, addiction, addict, anonymous or hotline, such as gambling addiction hotline, from January 2016 through June 2024.",
      "The increases in Illinois (35%), Massachusetts (47%), Michigan (37%), New Jersey (34%), New York (37%), Ohio (67%), Pennsylvania (50%) and Virginia (30%) were all higher than expected after the opening of sportsbooks in those states, the study found.

      "\"The significantly higher search volumes observed in all eight states make it virtually impossible that our findings occurred by chance,\" the study's main author, Atharva Yeola, a student researcher in the UC San Diego Qualcomm Institute, said in the accompanying opinion article.",
      "In Pennsylvania, the introduction of retail sportsbooks led to 33% more searches than expected for gambling addiction-related terms during the five months before online sportsbooks launched, the study found. After online sportsbooks became available, searches spiked to 61% over expectations and persisted for year.",

    "story": [
      "People who are listed as over 100 years old in the Social Security system are \"not necessarily receiving benefits,\" the new head of the agency said Wednesday, contradicting claims that tens of millions of dead people over that age are receiving checks.",
      "Instead, those individuals \"are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record,\" said Lee Dudek, the new acting Social Security Administration commissioner who was placed in the role by President Trump, in the Feb. 19\u00a0statement.",
      "The clarification comes after Mr. Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly and routinely getting benefits.",
      "Because Social Security records are not public, it's not possible to independently verify Musk's claim. However, the Social Security Administration automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency is seeking to root out fraud, waste and abuse, issued a slew of posts on his social media platform X on Monday night, including: \"Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security.\"",
      "To be sure, there are instances of overpayments and fraud within the Social Security system. A\u00a0July 2024 report\u00a0from Social Security's inspector general stated that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, including $71.8 billion \u2014 or less than 1% \u2014 in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people.",
      "Social Security and COBOL",
      "Part of the confusion comes from Social Security's software system based on the COBOL programming language, which has a lack of date type. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birth dates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago.",
      "The news organization WIRED first reported on the agency's use of COBOL, a programming language which is more than 60 years old.",
      "Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration's inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these individuals were receiving benefits.",
      "The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million.",
      "A July 2023 Social Security OIG report states that \"almost none of the numberholders discussed in the report currently receive SSA payments.\"",
      "DOGE at the Social Security Administration",

      "In the statement, Dudek added that the agency's priority continues to be \"paying beneficiaries the right amount at the right time, and providing other critical services people rely on from us.\"",
      "He noted that DOGE personnel \"CANNOT make changes to agency systems, benefit payments, or other information. They only have READ access.\"",
      "\"I am confident that with DOGE's help and the commitment of our executive team and workforce, that Social Security will continue to deliver for the American people,\" Dudek said.",
      "Treasury clawbacks",
      "In early January, the U.S. Treasury clawed back more than $31 million in a variety of federal payments\u2014 not just Social Security payments\u2014 that improperly went to dead people, a recovery that former Treasury official David Lebryk said was \"just the tip of the iceberg.\"",
      "The money was reclaimed as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Department of Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration's \"Full Death Master File\" for three years as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in 2021. The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died, and the file contains more than 142 million records, which go back to 1899, according to the Treasury.",
      "Treasury estimated in January that it would recover more than $215 million during its three-year access period, which runs from December 2023 through 2026.",
      "Chuck Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said, \"Two cheers for Elon Musk if he can root out and put a stop to improper payments.\"",
      "But to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, \"Social Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,\" Blahous said. \"Medicaid improper payment rates are quite substantial, and soared after the Medicaid expansion of the ACA.\"",
      "\"By all means \u2014 go after any improper payments that are found, but let's not pretend that's where the system's biggest financial problems are,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Mackenzie Scott, the philanthropist and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has pioneered a new kind of giving that has proved transformative for nonprofit organizations.",
      "Since 2019, Scott, who is estimated by Forbes to be worth more than $32 billion, has given away $19 billion in no-strings-attached gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits, meaning the recipients of the donations were permitted to spend the funds however they saw fit. The median gift size was roughly $5 million. She identified organizations she deemed worthy of support through \"quiet research,\" or a discreet vetting process, and didn't accept solicitations for donations.",
      "That's according to new\u00a0research\u00a0from the Center for Effective Philanthropy (CEP) which found that the uncommon size and lack of restrictions of Scott's charitable gifts have not only helped those nonprofits become more financially stable but has enabled them to increase the scope of their impact.",
      "\"There is much to learn from the experiences of nonprofits who received grants using Scott's approach,\" CEP vice president of research Elisha Smith Arrillaga said in a statement. \"These organizations have managed large gifts in strategic ways that have impacted thousands of lives \u2014 whether doubling or tripling the number of individuals receiving food from food banks, or increasing the number of houses being built in towns across the country, or countless other examples.\"",
      "For the report, which is the culmination of a three-year study, CEP surveyed roughly 800 organizations that received gifts from Scott on how the donations affected their efforts.",
      "Organization leaders surveyed said they managed the grants with an eye toward long-term sustainability, and most \u2014 90% \u2014 said the gifts from Scott strengthened their financial positions, compared with organizations that did not receive such grants. Half of nonprofit heads also said that Scott's gift made fundraising easier, and many said they the gift attracted new contributions. Only a few \u2014 7% \u2014 said they lost funders because of the grant.",
      "Some funders expressed concerns that such large grants would make it hard for their groups to continue fundraising, a fear that never materialized and a notion the study dispels.",
      "Community impact",
      "Grant recipients also said they put part of the money they received toward programming efforts, and that they've observed meaningful change in communities as a result.",
      "\"We received the grant December 2022, during which we served migrants from 29 countries, and were able to expand that to 71 countries in 2023,\" one grantee said in a statement. \"In 2023, our staff provided legal orientation to over 12,000 refugees, helped reunify over 200 unaccompanied children with their family members in the United States, and coordinated life-saving shelter and medical treatment to over 1,600 migrants.\"",
      "One group that received funding from Scott said the grant allowed their charity to grow from serving meals to approximately 2.5 million people a day, to 10 million. The grants also had an effect within community organizations, notably by boosting leaders' confidence in the work they do, according to the report.",
      "\"Receiving this grant has helped to rewrite my own narrative of who is capable of being a leader,\" one nonprofit leader said in the report, adding that the confidence boost led the group to expand its programming, take more risks, raise its profile and feel more secure in asking for larger grants from other funding sources.",
      "\"We need more unrestricted gifts like the one we received to help really make a difference in the work we do! We are extremely grateful to MacKenzie Scott for graciously gifting us this funding, which will go a long way to helping us achieve our programmatic and scale goals,\" another gift recipient said in a statement.",
      "For her part, Scott is quoted in the report as saying that the motive behind not issuing restrictions around how groups could allocate the funds was rooted in her belief that those who are closest to the work are best positioned to identify the organization's needs.",
      "\"I needn't ask those I care about what to say to them, or what to do for them. I can share what I have with them to stand behind them as they speak and act for themselves,\" she said.",

Lori Chavez-DeRemer, President Trump's nominee to run the Labor Department, appeared before a Senate committee for her confirmation hearing on Wednesday, where she has faced questions about her support for a pro-union bill when she was in Congress and other labor issues.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who sits on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, has said he will oppose her because of her previous support for pro-labor policies. Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, in the last Congress. The bill would have strengthened labor protections for workers to collectively bargain and expanded penalties for employers that violate workers' rights.",

      "\"If confirmed, my job will be to implement President Trump's policy vision. And my guiding principle will be President Trump's guiding principal \u2014 ensuring a level playing field for businesses, unions and, most importantly, the American worker,\" she said.",

      "\"I'm the national spokesman and lead author of the right-to-work bill. Her support for the PRO Act, which would not only oppose national right-to-work but would preempt state law on right-to-work \u2014 I think it's not a good thing,\" Paul told NBC News last month. \"And it'd be sort of hard for me, since it's a big issue for me, to support her.\"",
      "Paul questioned Chavez-DeRemer about right-to-work policies during the hearing, asking whether she is still supportive of the PRO Act, which he said would have overturned right-to-work laws in half the country. When Chavez-DeRemer said she \"fully\" supports states that \"want to protect their right to work,\" Paul doubled down, asking if she no longer supports the aspects of the PRO Act that would have overturned state right-to-work laws. She said she did not.",

Democrats expressed appreciation for Chavez-DeRemer's record during the hearing, but none emerged as clear backers of her nomination.",
      "So far, Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees have been confirmed with minimal GOP defections. Three Republicans voted against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was confirmed after Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. Republicans have otherwise united behind Mr. Trump's picks, with the exception of Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who voted against three nominees as of last week.",

      "The filing raises questions about Musk's role in the Trump administration and at DOGE, a cost-cutting task force created by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20 that is working at a number of agencies, including the\u00a0Treasury Department\u00a0and the\u00a0IRS, in an effort to find fraud and waste. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Musk's role at DOGE.",
      "Musk, along with fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, was\u00a0originally tasked\u00a0by Mr. Trump with providing \"advice and guidance from outside of Government\" and partnering with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to drive large scale structural reform.\" Ramaswamy\u00a0left DOGE\u00a0in January and is planning a run for Ohio governor.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, DOGE has driven massive federal employee cuts and paused tranches of congressionally approved spending. Many of those federal workers, their unions and Democratic officials have argued that this is a result of Musk's unchecked authority. Mr. Trump has suggested that Musk largely answers to him.",
      "Last week, Musk \u2014 the world's richest person, with a net worth of\u00a0$398 billion\u00a0\u2014 stood behind President Trump at the Oval Office, describing DOGE's work as taking \"very simple and basic\" steps to cut federal spending. During a lengthy Q&A that followed, Mr. Trump was asked if there was anything Musk was told that he can't touch.",
      "\"Well, we haven't discussed that much,\" Mr. Trump replied. \"I'll tell him to go here, go there, he does it. He's got a very capable group of people.\"",
      "Asked by reporters if he was working closely with agency heads, Musk replied that he was working \"in partnership\" with them. \"I check with the president to make sure that this is what the president wants to happen,\" Musk added. \"We talk almost every day, and I double check things to make sure. 'Is this something, Mr. President, you want us to do this?' Then we'll do it.\"",
      "Multiple lawsuits, alarm bells",
      "At the same time, DOGE's efforts have sparked multiple lawsuits and\u00a0raised alarms\u00a0from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates over its reported access to personal data of millions of Americans and businesses.",
      "The White House's Feb. 17 filing came at the request of U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is hearing a case about the\u00a0constitutionality\u00a0of Musk's actions since the start of Mr. Trump's presidency. Fourteen states ranging from Arizona to Washington are suing Musk, DOGE and Mr. Trump, alleging that Musk is exceeding his authority and taking \"actions that can only be taken by a nominated and principal officer of the United States.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that Musk \"does not occupy an office created by law and has no authority to exercise the powers of a principal officer, or any other officer.\"",
      "\"There is no greater threat to democracy than the accumulation of state power in the hands of a single, unelected individual,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"In recent weeks, defendant Elon Musk, with President Donald J. Trump's approval, has roamed through the federal government unraveling agencies, accessing sensitive data and causing mass chaos and confusion for state and local governments, federal employees and the American people,\" the lawsuit further claims.",
      "At a Feb. 17 hearing, Justice Department attorney Harry Graver told Chutkan, \"There is not a single instance of Musk or USDS commanding these actions,\" referring to\u00a0widespread firings of government employees\u00a0across various agencies last week. Instead, the government workers were fired by officials within their own agencies, he said.",
      "When asked at a press briefing at Mar-a-lago on Tuesday about the administration's contention that Musk isn't in charge of DOGE, Mr. Trump said, \"Elon is to me a patriot. So, you could call him an employee, you could call him a consultant, you could call him whatever you want.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Judge Chutkan ruled against the states' request for a temporary restraining order to stop Musk and DOGE from accessing data systems at seven federal agencies and firing or putting their employees on leave. She found that the states failed to show that they would suffer imminent, irreparable harm without relief, writing in her ruling that \"the 'possibility' that defendants may take actions that irreparably harm plaintiffs 'is not enough.'\"",
      "Nonetheless, in a hearing Monday, Chutkan warned that the alleged actions by Musk and DOGE are \"concerning\" and \"troubling.\" She said the mass firings of thousands of federal workers is \"not a small or common thing\" and noted that Musk has not been nominated to a position by the president or confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\"No actual or formal authority\"",
      "The Feb. 17 filing states that Musk is working as a \"senior adviser to the president,\" comparing his role to that of Anita Dunn under the Biden administration. Dunn served as a special government employee when she advised former President Biden, the filing noted.",
      "\"Like other senior White House advisers, Mr. Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,\" the filing said. \"Mr. Musk can only advise the president and communicate the president's directives.\"",
      "Musk's role as a\u00a0special government employee, or SGE, confirmed by the White House earlier this month, indicates that he'll work for the Trump administration for 130 days or less during a one-year period. The SGE role was created in 1962 as a way of enabling the government to tap outside expertise,\u00a0according\u00a0to the publication Government Executive.",
      "Because Musk isn't paid for his work at the White House, his financial disclosure report\u00a0will remain confidential, a White House official has told CBS News on condition of anonymity",
      "Asked at the Oval Office last week whether there are issues with conflicts of interest between his businesses, including Tesla and Space X \u2014 which receive billions in federal contracts \u2014 and DOGE, Musk said that the task force's work is transparent. He added, \"So you can see everything that's going on, and then you can see, am I doing something that benefits one of my companies or not? It's totally obvious.\"",

    "story": [
      "The presence of Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, at the IRS is sparking fresh concerns from Democratic lawmakers about the safety of taxpayer information, and whether the group's work could cause delays in taxpayers receiving their refunds.",
      "An IRS employee associated with DOGE is requesting access to the IRS' Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS, which would provide the group with access to tax data for individuals and businesses, according to a Trump administration official.",
      "\"Waste, fraud, and abuse have been deeply entrenched in our broken system for far too long,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields. \"DOGE will continue to shine a light on the fraud they uncover as the American people deserve to know what their government has been spending their hard-earned tax dollars on.\"",
      "News of the request was first reported by\u00a0the Washington Post. The IRS didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "In a Feb. 17 letter to the IRS, Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren, both Democrats, cited reports that DOGE is \"pressuring the IRS to agree to a memorandum of understanding (\"the MOU\") which would give software engineers working for Elon Musk at DOGE broad access to IRS systems, property and datasets which include the private tax return information of hundreds of millions of American citizens and businesses.\"",
      "Supporters of DOGE view its efforts as a way to cut what they see as bloated federal spending at a time when the nation's outlays are outstripping its tax revenue, pushing the federal debt to an all-time high of\u00a0$36 trillion. But the group's efforts have also sparked several lawsuits, with consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers raising alarms earlier this month after DOGE gained access to the Treasury Department's\u00a0payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.",
      "IRS data is particularly sensitive, given that it reflects financial details for millions of Americans and businesses, ranging from their income, employers, losses, investments, dependents and other items.

      "\"Software engineers working for Musk seeking to gain access to tax return information have no right to hoover up taxpayer data and send that data back to any other part of the federal government and may be breaking the law if they are doing so,\" Wyden and Warren wrote in the Feb. 17 letter.",

They added that even if the DOGE employees are employed at the Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS, they may still be violating the law by accessing taxpayer data.",
      "\"There are serious statutory and regulatory restrictions on when employees outside the Treasury Department may gain access to tax return information,\" the letter said.",
      "It added, \"To date, no information on DOGE employees or any others executing orders on Musk's behalf have revealed any clear, stated purpose as to why they need access to return information, whether they have followed all required laws to gain access to IRS systems, and what steps the IRS has taken to ensure that inspection of tax return is contained to authorized personnel and not disclosed to any unauthorized parties.\"",
      "Protections for taxpayer data were increased in the 1970s after former President Nixon sought to use the IRS against his political opponents, according to New York University's Tax Law blog.",
      "\"Congress acted to put in place ironclad guarantees against such abuses and a bipartisan consensus emerged to ensure the privacy of every American's tax information,\" Robert Weissman, the co-president of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Musk and DOGE's attempt to gain access to IRS data raises profound questions about whether those protections are now being shredded.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News, Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, said DOGE was seeking to find signs of tax fraud.",
      "\"We are talking about performing a basic anti-fraud review to ensure that people are not engaging in large scale theft of federal taxpayer benefits,\" he said. \"I mean, for example, we pay billions of dollars a year in child tax credit payments to illegal aliens, billions with a B. So these are systematic, programmatic reforms that we're talking about here.\"",
      "Delays to IRS tax refunds?",
      "Wyden and Warren also raised concerns about DOGE's impact on tax refunds this year.",
      "DOGE's work at the IRS comes as the tax agency is in the middle of the current tax season, when about 140 million individual tax returns are expected to be filed before the April 15 deadline. For many households, their tax refund check \u2014 which last year averaged more than $3,100 \u2014 is often their biggest cash influx of the year.",
      "\"We are also extremely concerned that DOGE personnel meddling with IRS systems in the middle of tax filing season could, inadvertently or otherwise, cause breakdowns that may delay the issuance of tax refunds indefinitely,\" the Feb. 17 letter said. \"Any delay in refunds could be financially devastating to millions of Americans who plan their budgets around timely refunds every spring.\"",
      "In the meantime, the IRS is preparing to fire thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, the Associated Press reported, citing two sources familiar with the agency's plans. It's unclear how many IRS workers could be impacted, however, the AP noted. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "The cuts would come even as IRS employees were told they would not be able to participate in the Trump administration's earlier \"deferred resignation\" offer until after the tax filing deadline had passed.",
      "A letter sent earlier this month to IRS workers said that \"critical filing season positions in Taxpayer Services, Information Technology and the Taxpayer Advocate Service are exempt\" from the administration's buyout plan until May 15.",
      "Taxpayers have until April 15 to file their taxes unless they are granted an extension.",

      "Meta has removed over a dozen fraudulent, sexualized images of famous female actors and athletes after a CBS News investigation found a high prevalence of AI-manipulated deepfake images on the company's Facebook platform.",
      "Dozens of fake, highly sexualized images of the actors Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and former tennis star Maria Sharapova have been shared widely by multiple Facebook accounts, garnering hundreds of thousands of likes and many reshares on the platform.",
      "\"We've removed these images for violating our policies and will continue monitoring for other violating posts. This is an industry-wide challenge, and we're continually working to improve our detection and enforcement technology,\" Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News in a statement emailed on Friday.",

      "How to spot deepfake images online",
      "An analysis of over a dozen of these images by Reality Defender, a platform that works to detect AI-generated media, showed that many of the photos were deepfake images \u2014 with AI-generated, underwear-clad bodies replacing the bodies of celebrities in otherwise real photographs. A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",
      "CBS News has sought comments from Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, and Maria Sharapova on this story. Johansson declined to issue any comment, according to a representative for the actor.",
      "Under Meta's Bullying and Harassment policy, the company prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",
      "But questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content. CBS News found dozens of AI-generated, sexualized images of Cosgrove and McCurdy still publicly available on Facebook even after the widespread sharing of such content, in violation of the company's terms, was flagged to Meta.",
      "One such deepfake image of Cosgrove that was still up over the weekend had been shared by an account with 2.8 million followers.",
      "The two actors \u2014 both former child stars on the Nickelodeon show \"iCarly,\" which is owned by CBS News' parent company Paramount Global \u2014 are the most prolifically targeted for deepfake content, based on the images of public figures that CBS News has analyzed.",
      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",
      "\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"The Board is actively monitoring Meta's response and will continue to push for stronger safeguards, faster enforcement, and greater accountability,\" McConnell said.",
      "Meta is not the only social media company to face the issue of widespread, sexualized deepfake content.",
      "Last year, Elon Musk's platform X temporarily blocked Taylor Swift-related searches after AI-generated fake pornographic images in the likeness of the singer circulated widely on the platform and garnered millions of views and impressions.",

After the Senate exhausts all amendment votes, it will take a final vote on the budget resolution, which directs the committees to submit their proposed spending plans by March 7.",
      "With a three-seat majority, Senate Republicans should ultimately have the votes to adopt the budget resolution, but the vote-a-rama gives Democrats the opportunity to force their GOP colleagues to go on the record on a host of politically dicey subjects.

Johnson has been trying to keep pace with the Senate's two-bill plan while navigating the demands of his divided Republican conference and razor-thin majority. House GOP leaders aren't confident they can pass two bills with their narrow majority.",

      "The contract pays for data processing to compare cancer incidence rates among firefighters exposed to the World Trade Center toxins with firefighters who were not exposed in other cities.",
      "Earlier Thursday, the FDNY confirmed researchers working on the career firefighter health study received notice of the CDC contract termination last week.",
      "Thursday evening, New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis posted on social media, saying, \"We just received confirmation from the White House that there will be no cuts to staffing at the World Trade Center Healthcare Program and research grants related to 9/11 illnesses.\"",
      "Sen. Chuck Schumer confirmed in a statement that the CDC has restored the grant, saying:",
      "\"This is a clear example of the damaging Trump-DOGE shoot first, ask questions later approach for their rash cuts and layoffs. 9/11 cancer research and funding for FDNY should have never been on the chopping block and I am pleased the CDC has heeded my call to restore this grant for 9/11 first responders. Now they need to fully uphold their promise and reverse the firings of World Trade Center Health staff to ensure care for 9/11 survivors and first responders continues uninterrupted.\"",
      "\"This staff is understaffed\"",
      "This comes after 20% of the World Trade Center Health Program's staff was terminated last week. Advocates say it impacts first responders along with people who lived and worked in Lower Manhattan on 9/11, and makes it harder for them to get certified for a 9/11-related illness.",
      "\"The World Trade Center Health Program is a lifeline to 137,000-plus people in the program. This staff is understaffed,\" Feal said.",
      "FDNY officials said they were told the contract was initially determined to be non-essential because the outputs from the contract are not statutorily required.",
      "CBS News New York reached out the White House for comment and has not heard back.",
      "\"A tragedy for all Americans who swore they would never forget\"",
      "Before the grant was restored, news of the cut drew outrage across New York City.",
      "\"The World Trade Center Health Program has been a lifeline to sickened 9/11 responders, who selflessly gave so much. Cuts to its grant funding will limit our ability to prove that new conditions are WTC related, and should be added to the list of covered conditions. This will hinder our efforts to provide treatment coverage for new conditions, which is a tragedy for all Americans who swore they would never forget,\" FDNY Commissioner Robert Tucker said.",
      "John Feal, who worked at Ground Zero days after the attack, advocates for 9/11 victims, survivors and their families.",
      "\"The research is vital to the 9/11 community because it's the research that allows us to add illnesses to the bill as we move forward. Last year we added uterine cancer for the 69th cancer under the bill,\" said Feal. \"More and more people are getting sick, and more and more people are coming up with new illnesses.\"",

    "summary": "The decision means Haitians would lose work permits and could be eligible to be removed from the country by August.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is throwing out protections for roughly half a million Haitians that had shielded them from deportation.",
      "The decision announced Thursday means they would lose their work permits and could be eligible to be removed from the country by August of this year.",
      "The decision is part of a sweeping effort by the Trump administration to make good on campaign promises to carry out mass deportations and specifically scale back the use of the Temporary Protected Status designation that was greatly expanded under the Biden administration to cover roughly 1 million immigrants.",
      "Impact and deportation concerns",
      "The Department of Homeland Security in a news release said they were vacating a decision by the Biden administration to renew Temporary Protected Status for Haitians. That status gives people legal authority to be in the country but doesn't provide a long-term path to citizenship.",
      "They are reliant on the government renewing their status when it expires. Critics, including Republicans and the Trump administration, have said that over time the renewal of the protection status becomes automatic, regardless of what is happening in the person's home country.",
      "\"For decades the TPS system has been exploited and abused. For example, Haiti has been designated for TPS since 2010. The data shows each extension of the country's TPS designation allowed more Haitian nationals, even those who entered the U.S. illegally, to qualify for legal protected status,\" Homeland Security said in a statement announcing the change.",
      "Homeland Security said an estimated 57,000 Haitians were eligible for TPS protections as of 2011 but by July of last year, that number had climbed to 520,694.",
      "It's not immediately clear how quickly they could be deported from the country once their protections expire. Some may apply for other types of protection and there are logistical challenges to carrying out such large-scale deportations.",
      "Haiti's migration director, Jean Negot Bonheur Delva, said only 21 Haitians have been deported so far under the Trump administration, but he noted the group had already been scheduled for deportation under Biden. There were a total of nine flights to Haiti in 2024, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data.",
      "Delva worried about the strain it would cause to send people back to a country still reeling from violence and where more than one million people are homeless because of gang violence.",
      "\"It's very sad that people who left Haiti to look for a better life elsewhere...will come back,\" said Delva. \"With the insecurity problem, the lack of resources, they will be miserable.\"",
      "More than 5,600 people were reported killed last year in Haiti, according to the U.N.",
      "Many of those displaced are living in severely overcrowded makeshift shelters including abandoned government buildings where rapes are becoming increasingly common.",
      "Gangs control 85% of Haiti's capital and have launched new attacks to seize control of even more territory. Recent massacres have claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians.",
      "Delva said Haiti's government recently created a commission to help those deported.",
      "\"They are children of Haiti. A mother must receive her children from wherever they are,\" he said.",
      "Congress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters or civil strife, giving people authorization to work in increments of up to 18 months at a time.",
      "Toward the end of the Biden administration, 1 million immigrants from 17 countries were protected by TPS, including people from Venezuela, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Sudan, Ukraine and Lebanon. But the Trump administration has already moved to end the protections for Venezuelans.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 21:39:00 -0500",
    "summary": "\"I can tell you this: anyone that has crossed the border between the ports of entry since this administration has taken office has not been released,\" Border Patrol chief Mike Banks told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Unlawful crossings at the U.S. southern border are down 94% from the same period last year, Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks told CBS News in his first sit-down interview, crediting the Trump administration's government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Over the past seven days, Banks said, Border Patrol agents have apprehended an average of 285 migrants per day along the entire southern border, compared to roughly 4,800 during the same time last year.",
      "Banks attributed the dramatic drop in illegal immigration to a slew of executive actions taken by President Trump. They include an order that has effectively closed the U.S. asylum system and allowed for summary deportations, as well as the cancellation of Biden administration policies that allowed some migrants to enter the country with the government's permission.",
      "Formerly Texas' border czar, Banks also cited the Trump administration's deployment of additional troops to the southern border and a decision to deputize Texas National Guard soldiers as immigration officers, to help Border Patrol agents in the field.",
      "Taken together, Banks said, the actions have virtually halted releases of migrants into the U.S. interior and sent a strong warning to those thinking about traveling to the American border that they will most likely be deported if they enter the country without permission.",
      "\"The greater the punishment, the larger the deterrent,\" Banks said during an interview at Customs and Border Protection's headquarters in Washington.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, Banks added, only two migrants have been released from Border Patrol custody after crossing the southern border unlawfully. He said they were released to assist with criminal prosecutions as witnesses.",
      "\"I can tell you this: anyone that has crossed the border between the ports of entry since this administration has taken office has not been released,\" Banks noted.",
      "One of the Biden-era policies the Trump administration rescinded allowed prospective asylum-seekers in Mexico to use a phone app, known as CBP One, to request a time to enter the U.S. at a legal border entry point.",
      "Asked if asylum is no longer an option for migrants at the U.S. southern border given the policy changes, Banks responded, \"At the border, right, crossing in between the ports of entry, which is what the Border Patrol focuses on? No.\"",
      "\"You do not cross the border illegally and then make an asylum claim,\" he said. \"You can go to the port of entry, or you can go to one of the embassies in your country and make your claim for asylum.\"",
      "While illegal crossings along the border with Mexico have dropped precipitously since Mr. Trump's inauguration, they had been on a downward trend over the past year, since soaring to record highs in late 2023. Officials at the time credited Mexico's increased efforts to interdict migrants, and a Biden administration policy, enacted in June 2024, that restricted asylum, though not as broadly as the current rules.",
      "In fact, in December, the Biden administration's last full month in office, Border Patrol recorded 47,000 migrant apprehensions, down 81% from December 2023, during a record-breaking surge in unlawful crossings, government figures show. That number dipped to just over 29,000 last month.",

      "The top official in charge of food safety and nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration resigned this week, protesting the dozens of scientists and other health officials now being let go across the agency's foods program.",
      "In his resignation letter, James Jones warned that the \"indiscriminate\" cuts would add \"one more roadblock\" to the \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda outlined by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "\"They included staff with highly technical expertise in nutrition, infant formula, food safety response and even 10 chemical safety staff hired to review potentially unsafe ingredients in our food supply,\" Jones wrote in his letter, which was dated Feb. 17.",
      "Jones said that at least 89 of his recently hired staff had been cut across the agency's human foods program. News of the resignation was previously reported by the food industry publication Food Fix.",
      "Dozens of other staff have been cut across other parts of the FDA, multiple agency employees told CBS News, because of the sweeping cost-cutting moves by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, task force. Firings at the FDA affected a range of teams, including those overseeing tobacco products to medical devices, officials said.",
      "Many firings came without warning to their supervisors within the agency, officials said, with letters emailed directly to staff by human resources officials outside the FDA. Some were later walked back for employees that Trump administration officials felt needed to be exempted.",
      "The total number of staff cut at the FDA is unclear. An agency spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Jones had come into his role at the FDA as part of a major shakeup in recent years to the agency's food safety work.",
      "One major initiative spearheaded by Jones, a former top regulatory official at the Environmental Protection Agency, had been an effort to systematically start reviewing whether some of the additives previously greenlighted for use in food should still be considered safe.",
      "Under the program, the FDA moved to ban the color additive Red 3 for causing cancer in some laboratory animals. Advocates had hoped the program would also lead to renewed scrutiny of other artificial dyes, like Red 40, which had been lambasted by Kennedy.",
      "He also oversaw a proposal in the final weeks of the Biden administration to push for nutrition labels on the front of packages, as a way to push Americans and food manufacturers towards healthier options on store shelves.",
      "Some officials within the agency had hoped that Jones would be able to find common ground with the incoming team under Kennedy, who is weighing major changes to how food additives are regulated and has decried health officials for not doing enough to curb unhealthy foods.",
      "At a town hall with FDA employees this month, Jones had told his staff that he was ready to work with Kennedy. That changed after the firings, which Jones called \"short sighted\" and \"indiscriminate.\"",
      "\"It has been increasingly clear that with the Trump Administration's disdain for the very people necessary to implement your agenda, however, it would have been fruitless for me to continue in this role,\" Jones wrote in his letter.",
      "Kennedy had said in the run-up to the election that he wanted to fire all of the food and nutrition staff at the FDA and other federal agencies, saying they had been corrupted by conflicts of interest from corporations. In his letter, Jones rebuked Kennedy's attacks on his staff as unfounded.",
      "\"The foods program staff at FDA is the envy of the world in its technical, professional and ethical standards,\" Jones said.",

      "Washington --- Last month, Katie Sandlin uprooted her life in Carbon Hill, Alabama, a town of 2,000, to work at the National Institutes of Health\u00a0in Bethesda, outside Washington, D.C.",
      "\"I wiped out my savings account, I maxed out my credit card, I had to take out a loan,\" Sandlin told CBS News.",

      "Probationary workers usually have less than one year experience, and in some cases less than two years. They have fewer protections from layoffs, making them easier to terminate.",

      "As the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, implements sweeping cuts across the federal government, Republican lawmakers are worried about the impact on jobs and industry in their states.",
      "But very few are directly criticizing President Trump or DOGE's leader, Elon Musk, and are instead taking a quieter approach. But the concerns raised nonetheless underscore the clash between shrinking government and parochial interests.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she was hearing from so many constituents concerned about cuts to the federal workforce in her state that she decided to host a tele town hall Wednesday night, which she said over 1,000 people attended.",
      "Alaska has one of the largest federal workforces per capita in the country, with public land management a significant focus. Murkowski said the concerns at the town hall ranged from the impact on preparedness for wildland fires to staffing national parks to the ruthless treatment of employees.",
      "\"The abrupt terminations that we have seen for those have really been detrimental,\" she said, adding that she took her concerns to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. \"The problem is, they're going to require that all these people who were terminated reapply, so they have to go back to usa.gov and go through the application process, which, if you haven't done it, is a multi-month process. Parks are opening up in a couple months here, and so I'm concerned.\" Additionally, she said, cuts to the Bureau of Land Management could slow permitting for Mr. Trump's energy initiatives.",
      "The Alaska senator said she supports eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in government, \"but there is a way that we go about it, and we do it within the confines of the law and the rules that are out there\u2026when you're dealing with employees, there is a right way and a really not so right way to treat them.\"",
      "Maine Republican Susan Collins, another moderate senator, said she's also worried about the impact on national parks in her state, as well as on biomedical research.",
      "\"I think many of these firings are indiscriminate,\" she said. \"We should wait until Cabinet members are confirmed and can take a careful look at their agencies' needs, rather than doing these sweeping indiscriminate cuts. The fact that workers were let go who are working on avian flu, and the fact that workers have also been fired who are responsible for nuclear safety, shows that we need a far more careful approach.",
      "Earlier this month, as the administration began to dismantle USAID, Kansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran urged Secretary of State Marco Rubio to \"distribute the $340 million in American-grown food currently stalled in U.S. ports to reach those in need.\"",
      "Moran, who sits on the Senate Agriculture Committee, also said he raised his concerns with the White House. \"U.S. food aid feeds the hungry, bolsters our national security & provides an important market for our farmers, especially when commodity prices are low,\" he said on X. He later said the State Department approved his request to distribute the stalled food aid.",
      "Kansas Republican Sen. Roger Marshall partnered with Moran to move USAID's Food for Peace program \u2014 of particular interest to Kansas farmers \u2014 under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture.",
      "\"To me, this is all about saving American taxpayers money, and so I fully support pauses in these programs,\" Marshall told CBS News. \"I think it's time to get rid of some of the agencies we have, over 400 agencies in this federal government, over 2 million employees outside of what we have in the military. So I think it's time for consolidation.\"",
      "Lawmakers have also taken notice of the layoffs at the National Institute of Health. \"Every cent of hard-earned taxpayer money should be spent efficiently, judiciously, and accountability \u2014 without exception,\" Alabama Sen. Katie Britt told AL.com. \"While the administration works to achieve this goal at NIH, a smart, targeted approach is needed in order to not hinder life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama.\"",
      "Most other Republicans remain supportive of DOGE's mission. North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis said he's making sure FEMA and disaster aid isn't disrupted in his state, which has recently been ravaged by storms. But overall, he said, he agrees with the approach.",
      "\"I actually believe they are doing this because they're sick of trying to get answers to legitimate questions about where we can be efficient, and the way to force people to justify investments on exceptions is to shut everything down,\" Tillis said. \"I know it's disruptive, but I think they need to have the capacity to bring things back online that make sense.\"",
      "Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin also defended the administration's cost-cutting efforts. He pointed to the nation's burgeoning debt as a national security issue that requires \"difficult choices\".",
      "\"Any member is going to be particularly upset about some cuts that may be happening in our backyard,\" Mullin told CBS News. \"Look what's happened to FAA? You know, in Oklahoma City, we had the training facility for our air traffic controllers, right? That's a concern, and Sean Duffy and I've had conversations.

    "summary": "A group of five labor unions had argued that President Trump's effort to shrink the size of the federal workforce were illegal.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday allowed President Trump's efforts to shrink the federal workforce to continue moving forward while legal proceedings continue, declining a request from a group of labor unions to temporarily block his firing of federal employees and other actions targeting government workers.",
      "U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper, who sits on the federal district court in Washington, D.C., said in a 16-page decision that he had to deny the unions' request for relief because he lacks jurisdiction over the claims. The judge, appointed by former President Barack Obama, said the unions must pursue their legal challenges through the scheme established by Congress in the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, which governs labor relations in the federal workforce.",
      "The claims, he said, must be filed with the Federal Labor Relations Authority.",
      "Still, Cooper wrote that the first month of Mr. Trump's administration \"has been defined by an onslaught of executive actions that have caused, some say by design, disruption and even chaos in widespread quarters of American society.\" He also noted that mixed decisions by federal judges halting some of Mr. Trump's actions and letting others proceed while cases move forward are not a surprise.",
      "\"Federal district judges are duty-bound to decide legal issues based on even-handed application of law and precedent \u2014 no matter the identity of the litigants or, regrettably at times, the consequences of their rulings for average people,\" Cooper wrote.",
      "The five unions, which represent federal workers, had asked Cooper to issue an order that temporarily prevented the termination of members who are probationary employees; implementation of large-scale reductions in force throughout the government; and a renewal of the president's \"deferred resignation program.\"",
      "That program offered federal workers the chance to resign their positions but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30. The deadline for employees to accept the offer was Feb. 12, and roughly 75,000 federal workers agreed to the program, according to the White House.",
      "The unions argued that the president's three initiatives \u2014 firing of probationary employees, deferred resignation program and planned large-scale reductions in force \u2014 violate the separation of powers and federal law.",
      "In court filings, lawyers for the unions warned that the president's plans to shrink the size of the government threatened more than 500,000 employees. Roughly 220,000 workers are considered probationary, they said, and another 345,000 were deemed nonessential during the last major government shutdown during Mr. Trump's first term. Nonessential workers were targeted for firing in an executive order signed by the president that directs agency heads to prepare for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "More than 12,000 federal workers have already been or are likely to be fired, including over 6,000 at the Internal Revenue Service who are expected to be terminated by the end of the month, according to a source familiar with the agency's plans.",
      "\"A mass reduction of roughly twenty-five percent of the federal civilian workforce is unprecedented,\" the unions wrote in a filing. \"It raises the novel question of whether the Executive Branch may lawfully hobble the federal agencies that Congress creates, to which Congress assigns statutory missions, and which Congress funds so that they may accomplish those legislative directives.\"",
      "The Justice Department had urged the court to deny the unions' request, arguing in part that they failed to show they would be harmed, absent relief.",
      "\"The president is charged with directing the Executive Branch workforce, and he has determined that the politically accountable heads of his agencies should take steps to streamline and modernize the workforce through measures including voluntary deferred resignations, removal of certain probationary employees, and [reductions in force],\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Thursday confirmed Kash Patel to serve as director of the FBI, approving a key ally of President Trump to lead the bureau amid warnings from Democrats that he could target the president's perceived political enemies.",
      "Patel's nomination was approved in a party-line vote, 51 to 49. Two Republicans \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 joined Democrats in voting to oppose Patel.",
      "FBI directors are appointed to 10-year terms but can be removed by the president. Chris Wray, whom the president appointed in 2017, resigned at the end of the Biden administration after Mr. Trump pledged to fire him.",
      "Collins and Murkowski both issued statements explaining their decision to oppose Patel's nomination.",
      "Collins cited the recent resignations at the Justice Department and a questionnaire sent to FBI employees about their involvement in cases about the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. His statements and actions \"cast doubt on Mr. Patel's ability to advance the FBI's law enforcement mission in a way that is free from the appearance of political motivation,\" Collins said.",
      "Murkowski said her opposition \"stem[med] from his own prior political activities and how they may influence his leadership.\" She said the FBI \"must be trusted as the federal agency that roots out crime and corruption, not focused on settling political scores,\" and she was \"disappointed that when [Patel] had the opportunity to push back on the administration's decision to force the FBI to provide a list of agents involved in the January 6 investigations and prosecutions, he failed to do so.\"",
      "Turmoil at the FBI",
      "Patel will take the helm of the FBI at a time of turmoil for the nation's premier law enforcement agency and as it weathers allegations of weaponization from Mr. Trump.",
      "Eight senior bureau officials were asked to step down from their posts or face termination last month as part of broader scrutiny of FBI leadership by the Trump administration. The ousted officials oversaw the bureau's national security, criminal and cyber divisions, three sources told CBS News.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove also ordered Brian Driscoll, who was serving as acting director of the FBI until Patel was installed, to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned to the investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol for review to \"determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.\"",
      "A survey was also sent to certain FBI employees about their activities related to the Jan. 6 probes, including the extent of their roles.",
      "The FBI turned over the list of more than 5,000 personnel who worked on Jan. 6 cases last week. While it initially contained employee identification numbers instead of names and other information, Driscoll was later ordered to identify employees by name.",
      "Concerns that the list of names could be made public prompted a group of unnamed FBI agents who worked on the Capitol riot investigations to file lawsuits against the Justice Department seeking to prevent disclosure of the information.",
      "The Justice Department and lawyers for the agents reached an agreement last week in which the government would not make public the list of names unless it provided two days' notice to the agents. Legal proceedings are ongoing in the case.",
      "Patel vowed during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee late last month that \"all FBI employees will be protected from political retribution.\"",
      "\"Every FBI employee will be held to the absolute same standard and no one will be terminated for case assignments,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has vowed to fire \"some\" FBI employees who worked on the Jan. 6 investigations and alleged without evidence they are \"corrupt.\"",
      "Days before the Senate took up his nomination, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, asked the Justice Department's internal watchdog to investigate whether Patel was directing the firing of senior FBI officials as a private citizen.",
      "\"It is unacceptable for a nominee with no current role in government, much less at the FBI, to personally direct unjustified and potentially illegal adverse employment actions against senior career FBI leadership and other dedicated, nonpartisan law enforcement officers,\" Durbin wrote in a letter to Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general.",
      "He also alleged that Patel may have perjured himself during his confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee. During an exchange with Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, Patel said he was not aware of any plans or discussions to punish FBI agents or personnel associated with investigations into Mr. Trump before he was elected to a second term.",
      "Born on Long Island, New York, Patel began his career as a public defender in South Florida and worked as a trial attorney in the Justice Department's National Security Division. He also served as a legal liaison to Joint Special Operations Command.",
      "In 2017, Patel was special counsel on counterterrorism at the House Intelligence Committee, and then worked as a senior committee aide to its then-chairman, former Rep. Devin Nunes, and as senior counsel at the House Reform and Oversight Committee.",
      "During the first Trump administration, Patel worked for the National Security Council, as principal deputy at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and as chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller.",

      "Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor that he made the decision not to run again last year. McConnell said he's never much liked calling attention to Feb. 20, but he figured his birthday is as good a day as any to make the announcement.",
      "\"Seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate,\" McConnell said. \"Every day in between, I've been humbled by the trust they've placed in me to do their business right here. Representing our commonwealth has been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time. My current term in the Senate will be my last.\"",
      "McConnell has been a U.S. senator from Kentucky since 1985, and he announced one year ago that he would relinquish his leadership role in the Senate. He was the Senate Republican leader from 2007-2025 and is the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history. McConnell served as majority leader from 2015-2021.",

And if it weren't for an 11th-hour outside-the-box idea on the campaign trail, my Senate career would have been over before it began.

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:59:59 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said his administration is considering dividend checks based on savings found by DOGE. Economists are skeptical.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he's considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. But economists and policy experts across the political spectrum expressed skepticism about the feasibility of such a \"DOGE dividend.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,\" Mr. Trump said at the FII Priority summit, an investment conference in Miami sponsored by Saudi government entities. Mr. Trump didn't provide further details.",
      "The idea of the so-called DOGE dividend surfaced on social media this week when a four-page proposal was posted by an X user, James Fishback. The post caught the eye of Musk, the owner of X, who is spearheading DOGE, and who on Tuesday said he would pitch the idea to Mr. Trump.",
      "According to Fishback's calculation, 20% of the supposed $2 trillion in eventual DOGE savings would be provided to some taxpayers in the form of a direct tax rebate, which he estimated at $5,000 per household. Only households with a tax liability would receive the payment, which means lower-income households that generally don't owe income taxes wouldn't be included.",
      "But economists and policy experts said the plan isn't likely to materialize, citing the implausibility of finding anywhere near $2 trillion in federal cuts, as well as the legislative hurdles in approving such a direct tax payment.",
      "\"It is completely impossible for DOGE to save $2 trillion,\"Jessica Reidl, an economist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Two-thirds of the $7 trillion federal budget goes to Social Security, Medicare, defense, veterans and interest on the debt \u2014 all of which has been taken off the table by President Trump.\"",
      "She added, \"Saving $2 trillion would require eliminating nearly every remaining federal program. DOGE has no legal or constitutional authority to cut this spending; Congress must pass a law and that will not happen.\"",
      "Two-thirds of the nation's $6.7 trillion in annual spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0commitments through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense. In a Feb. 18 interview on Fox News' \"The Sean Hannity Show,\" Mr. Trump reiterated his earlier vow that Social Security and Medicare cuts are off the table.",
      "\"Social Security won't be touched, other than fraud or something,\" Mr. Trump said during the interview. \"We're going to find it's going to be strengthened, but won't be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.\"",
      "On Feb. 19, Mr. Trump backed the House Republicans' budget proposal, which, if enacted, would include deep cuts to Medicaid, the nearly $900-billion-a-year government health insurance program that serves about 79 million mostly low-income or disabled Americans.",
      "The White House didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE cuts",
      "As of Wednesday, DOGE claims it has made cuts that add up to\u00a0about $8.4 billion, according to the task force's own\u00a0documentation.",
      "While DOGE has only been operating since Mr. Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, its cuts are far from reaching Musk's stated goal of shaving $500 billion in annual government spending, let alone reaching near $2 trillion, experts noted.",
      "The plan \"is very unrealistic,\" Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, who describes himself as a libertarian, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I'd love to see it, but I think that is unrealistic, especially in the first year, and certainly unrealistic without Congress getting involved.\"",
      "Any new tax refund check would need the approval of Congress, which controls government spending and is in charge of crafting tax laws. But House Republicans are currently\u00a0negotiating a budget proposal\u00a0that would enact trillions of dollars in spending cuts to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as other tax provisions the president promised on the campaign trail.",
      "A DOGE dividend \"will make their numbers even harder to work in the budget reconciliation,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a Washington, D.C.-based left-leaning economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's hard to see how to make the math work.\"",
      "While a plan for some kind of DOGE dividend could materialize, it would doubtless be a much smaller amount than envisioned, given the practical impossibility of finding $2 trillion in federal cuts.",
      "Experts noted that rebate checks are typically issued in times of economic stress, such as during the pandemic, when Congress authorized several rounds of stimulus checks. But the U.S. economy today is viewed as strong, given growing GDP and low unemployment, they added.",
      "At the same time, the federal government's annual outlays are outpacing revenue by about $2 trillion, creating budget deficits and sending the nation's debt to a record $36.2 trillion.",
      "Reidl noted, \"Washington is facing annual budget deficits that will likely surpass $3 trillion within the next few years. Sending taxpayers dividend checks would be completely irresponsible.\"",
      "DOGE facing legal issues",
      "Experts also raised the issue of whether DOGE's cuts could be reversed by the courts, given that the group is facing multiple lawsuits over its access to sensitive data across various agencies as well as over the legality of its creation.",
      "\"I'm happy to see [DOGE] identify things that can be cut, but I do have concerns about the legality of it,\" Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute said. \"Congress appropriates money, and having the presidential quasi-commission go around and cut things seems like it would run afoul of a lot of laws.\"",
      "DOGE's savings so far could \"be reversed by the courts for bypassing Congress,\" Reidl noted.",
      "Given the challenges of trying to find anything close to $2 trillion in savings, as well as the legislative issues in passing a tax rebate check, experts said their advice to taxpayers is not to bank on getting a DOGE dividend.",

    "summary": "The \"reinventing government\" program cut over 480,000 federal jobs and thousands of regulations. The woman who ran the program says any similarities to DOGE end there.",
    "story": [
      "As President Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency push to slash spending, Republican allies have likened their efforts to a White House program from more than 30 years ago.",
      "After entering the White House in 1993, Democratic President Bill Clinton tasked Vice President Al Gore with looking for ways to cut waste and red tape and streamline the federal bureaucracy to \"create a government that works better and costs less.\"",
      "The \"reinventing government\" program cut nearly half a million federal jobs and dispensed with a massive number of regulations. But according to the woman who ran the program under the Clinton administration, any similarities between that program and DOGE end there.",
      "\"We cut fat and they cut muscle. It's as simple as that,\" Elaine Kamarck, now a senior fellow in Governance Studies at Brookings, told CBS News. \"We didn't have any meltdowns of agencies, we didn't have any dysfunction going on, and we obeyed the law. When we thought something was wrong, we sent it to Congress and asked them to change it.\"",
      "The National Partnership for Reinventing Government followed through on Clinton's campaign promise to make the government more efficient and effective. The project was spearheaded by Gore and officially\u00a0created in March 1993, kicking off a review of government agencies that would go on to become the longest-running reform effort in the nation's history. It wrapped up its work in 1998.",
      "Kamarck was hired by Gore to direct the program, and the two put together a team of about 400 civil servants who worked across a number of teams. They conducted reviews of Cabinet-level agencies with a partner team within the agency and returned recommendations for review. Six months later, the project had yielded hundreds of recommendations bound in a report titled\u00a0 \"Creating a Government that Works Better & Costs Less.\"",
      "The effort, which would ultimately trim the federal workforce by around 426,000 in less than eight years while cutting thousands of pages of regulations, was focused on saving the government money. But Kamarck said it also focused on \"making the government work better,\" with attention toward performance and customer service standards that remain today.",
      "\"Basically, we worked with people in the government to identify where we could make it work better, and where we could make it cost less,\" Kamarck said.",
      "The program went on well beyond the six-month review period to focus on implementation, acting upon around two-thirds of the recommendations, and yielding an estimated $136 billion in savings for taxpayers.",
      "Now, more than three decades later, a new cost-cutting effort is underway. Mr. Trump\u00a0announced in December that Musk, who played a major role in his reelection effort, would lead DOGE in the new administration, and signed an\u00a0executive order on his first day in office to officially create the Department of Government Efficiency. Its\u00a0website says it's found $55 billion in savings so far, but a CBS News review of those savings shows some discrepancies.",
      "Unlike the Clinton-era program, which took six months to make its recommendations, DOGE has worked with Cabinet department and agency heads to shrink the government workforce immediately and pause swaths of government spending. DOGE first turned its focus to excising federal contracts and spending on issues like diversity, equity and inclusion provisions and\u00a0foreign aid and has moved on to other federal agencies.",
      "The Trump administration offered a\u00a0deferred resignation plan to more than 2 million civilian federal employees and convinced 75,000 to accept it before shutting it down and ordered agencies to\u00a0lay off nearly all probationary employees.",
      "DOGE has also gained\u00a0access to the Treasury Department's payment system. And an IRS employee associated with DOGE\u00a0requested access to the IRS' data system that includes individual taxpayer information in recent days.",
      "The moves have sparked controversy \u2014 and lawsuits \u2014 over the administration's authority to carry out its dramatic reshaping of the federal government in a compressed period of time.",
      "Facing scrutiny, Musk and allies have held up the example of the Clinton administration's government overhaul seemingly as a kind of model for their own. During a hearing held by the House's newly created DOGE subcommittee last week, one Republican lawmaker showed a video featuring Clinton and Gore's announcement after the six-month review to remind Democrats of what their \"party believed in.\" Musk himself has highlighted the comparison between his work and the effort three decades prior in recent days, sharing an AI-generated\u00a0post on reductions to the federal workforce under the Clinton administration and concurring with a\u00a0post that called Clinton and Gore \"the original Doges.\"",
      "Kamarck, though she has\u00a0advocated for new government cuts, said the \"big difference\" between the Clinton administration program and DOGE is that the earlier program sought to understand what was going on in the agency and what was important, using a fine-toothed comb to make cuts.",
      "\"If they were doing it the same way we did it, they could do a hell of a lot of good for the government,\" Kamarck said. \"But instead, they're just, they're throwing out the baby with the bath water.\"",
      "Still, Clinton's government cutting received its share of criticism, sparking frustrations when the program chose to close many regional offices deemed to be obsolete and incompatible with advancements in electronic communications. Kamarck conceded that they didn't win every fight. Though they succeeded on procurement reform, pioneered electronic filing of tax returns and generally helped usher the federal government into the internet age, they fell short on civil service reform without an advocate in Congress.",
      "And although their effort to reduce the size of the government workforce took place over years instead of weeks, there were some who felt that the buyout strategy they used was not as effective as it could have been. \"Many with special skills left, and people who stayed might have been those we'd have wanted to leave,\" Donald Kettl, the former dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland,\u00a0told Government Executive in 2013.",
      "Kamarck said the process the Clinton administration followed is the \"harder way to do it\" \u2014 and not how DOGE is proceeding.",
      "\"They are pretending that there is no law governing the bureaucracy,\" she said.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 11:37:30 -0500",
    "summary": "\"It requires speaking out. It requires saying, 'That violates the law. That violates the authorities of the executive,'\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on Wednesday urged her colleagues in Congress to reassert their constitutional authority and stand up to President Trump if he withholds funding approved by lawmakers through his\u00a0mass firings of federal workers or severe cuts to federal agencies.",
      "\"If the president, for instance, should seek to withhold federal funding that has already been authorized and appropriated, that violates the Budget Act, it violates the Impoundment Act and it cannot be allowed to stand. And so, if we in Congress allow that, we effectively cede some of our authority, and so, your question as to, what do we do about it? We have to stand up,\" she said in a virtual town hall with constituents.",
      "\"Now, the 'we' has to be more than just me. And this is where it becomes more of a challenge, but it requires speaking out. It requires saying, 'That violates the law. That violates the authorities of the executive,'\" she said.",
      "The Alaska Republican said Congress has an \"obligation to the Constitution\" that requires \"speaking out and standing up, and that requires, again, more than just one or two Republicans \u2014 it requires us as a Congress to do so.\"",
      "The president's moves to essentially shutter several agencies and fire thousands of workers have already run into legal challenges, with federal courts across the country weighing whether his actions were lawful. The administration has been temporarily blocked from ousting workers and freezing funding in a handful of cases so far.",
      "Murkowski is a moderate Republican who has been in the Senate since 2002 and won reelection in 2022 despite longstanding differences with Mr. Trump. She said more than 1,000 people dialed into the call on Wednesday, and that many of her constituents were concerned about the Trump administration's cuts, which are being spearheaded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Alaska has one of the highest concentrations of federal government workers per capita outside the Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia region.",
      "Most Republican lawmakers have so far shown little interest in objecting as the Trump administration tries to whittle down agencies established and funded by Congress.",
      "On the war in Ukraine, Murkowski said \"we were all more than a little bit stunned\" by what she called a \"radical switch\" in the president's rhetoric about the war and Russia. Mr. Trump this week referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a \"dictator\" and wrongly blamed Ukraine for Russia's invasion, while his top aides met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia about the war without inviting Ukrainian officials.",
      "Murkowski said she thought Mr. Trump's comments about Zelenskyy were \"uncalled for and unfortunate.\"",
      "\"It is wrong to suggest that somehow or other Ukraine started this war, asked for this war. It is clear for all the world to see and to know that Putin invaded Ukraine and started the war,\" Murkowski said.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said Russia wants to end the war, without mentioning that Russia started the conflict and could end it at any point by withdrawing troops from Ukraine. Asked if he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith on ending the war, the president said he does.",
      "\"I do, I think the Russians want to see the war end,\" the president said. \"And I do, I really do. But I think they have the cards a little bit because, you know, they've taken a lot of territory, so they have the cards.\"",
      "A handful of other Republicans have expressed their disagreement with Mr. Trump's stance on Russia and Ukraine, without directly crossing the president.",
      "\"Russia's the aggressor here,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Wednesday.",
      "\"Putin started this war,\" Republican Rep. Don Bacon wrote on X Wednesday. \"Putin committed war crimes. Putin is the dictator who murdered his opponents. The EU nations have contributed more to Ukraine. Zelensky polls over 50%. Ukraine wants to be part of the West, Putin hates the West. I don't accept George Orwell's doublethink.\"",
      "Murkowski separately told CBS News on Capitol Hill earlier Wednesday she has been hearing from constituents who have been worked for the federal government for years or decades. She said she heard from one woman who used to work for her before accepting a position with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Because the woman was recently promoted, Murkowski said, she was considered a probationary employee and was terminated as part of the administration's cuts. Now the woman has a \"black mark\" on her record, Murkowski said.",
      "\"She's been terminated and given no opportunity to appeal it, no opportunity to even think about it,\" Murkowski said. \"You get a notice on Friday saying you're gone. Now that, to me, doesn't demonstrate much due process. But even more, it doesn't show respect for those who have worked hard as federal servants.\"",

The Defense Departmen expects to redirect those fund to other programs in the department that would be prioritized by President Trump.",
      "Robert Salesses, who is performing the duties of deputy secretary of defense, said in a statement Wednesday evening that the department intends to produce budgets \"that revive the warrior ethos, rebuild our military, and reestablish deterrence.\"",

      "He said that the secretary has ordered a review of spending plans in the Biden administration's budget budget to offset the costs of Trump priorities for the 2026 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1. Salesses confirmed in the statement that the department seeks cuts of 8% from the Biden defense budget that would add up to about $50 billion. He mentioned \"so-called 'climate change' and other woke programs, as well as excessive bureaucracy,\" as line items that would be excised.",
      "It was not clear which parts of the Pentagon's spending on diversity and equity programs or its spending to address climate change \u2014 such as buying alternate fuels for aircraft, or making bases more resistant to the effects of extreme weather, such as the 2018 hurricane that caused significant damage to Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida \u2014 would be targeted or could add up to $50 billion in savings.",
      "The spending cuts mandate comes as the military is quickly trying to write its fiscal year 2026 request, a congressional process that often starts late during transitions between new presidential administrations.",
      "The cuts would be as drastic as the single-year savings ordered across the military in the 2013 sequestration, a law passed by Congress that was intended to force the legislative branch to reach agreement on budget deficit reductions and instead forced the services to cut $56 billion in a matter of months.",
      "Because of the way the military budget is structured, long-term, high-dollar procurement programs at the time were protected, as were most entitlements such as military retirement and health care.",
      "At the time, the accounts that were easier to cut were found in operations, maintenance and personnel. The services lost noncommissioned officers \u2014 highly trained mid-level enlisted personnel \u2014 and cut training such as flight hours. Military training accidents quickly climbed.",

      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's latest probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

    "summary": "Archaeologists in Egypt have found the tomb of King Thutmose II \u2014 the first discovery of an ancient royal tomb since King Tutankhamun's in 1922.",
    "story": [
      "Egyptian officials announced Tuesday the discovery of the tomb of King Thutmose II, the last of the lost tombs of the kings of ancient Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty, which reigned for over two centuries between about 1550 BC and 1292 BC. It's the first royal Egyptian tomb to be discovered since King Tutankhamun's final resting place was found in 1922.",
      "A joint Egyptian-British archaeological mission discovered Thutmose II's tomb in the mount of Thebes area, west of Luxor and the renowned Valley of the Kings. The team and the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, which made the announcement, said evidence was discovered that clearly indicates it was King Thutmose II's tomb during excavations of what had previously been known only as tomb No. C4.",
      "The entrance and main passage into the structure were discovered in 2022, and internal excavations have continued meticulously since then.",
      "Dr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said when the mission first found the entrance to the tomb and its main passage almost three years ago, the team believed it could belong to one of the wives of the kings, given its proximity to the tomb of the wives of King Thutmose III and its proximity to the tomb of Queen Hatshepsut, which was prepared for her as a royal wife before she became ruler of the ancient kingdom. She ended up being buried in the Valley of the Kings, due to her ascent to the throne.",
      "As the excavation work and examination of artifacts continued, the mission found new evidence that identified the owner of the mysterious tomb as King Thutmose II, suggesting also that his burial rites were carried out by Queen Hatshepsut, who was his wife and half-sister.",
      "Khaled said parts of alabaster vessels found in the ruins have inscriptions bearing the name of King Thutmose II and identifying him as the \"deceased king,\" along with the name of his wife, Hatshepsut, all of which he said had helped to confirm Thutmose II as the owner of the tomb.",
      "He described the discovery as one of the most important archaeological finds in recent years. The artifacts discovered are important additions to the body of knowledge around the history of the area and the reign of King Thutmose II.",
      "The mummy of King Thutmose II was discovered during the 19th century, not far away at another archaeological site known as the Deir el-Bahari Cachette, to which it was likely moved centuries after being looted by tomb raiders, according to the\u00a0relatively new National Museum\u00a0of Egyptian Civilization. His mummy is now on display, among those of other ancient royals, at the museum.",
      "The tomb is in a poor state of preservation due largely to exposure to floods shortly after Thutmose II's death, according to Mohamed Abdel Badie, Head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Head of the Egyptian team that has worked on the dig. Abdel Badie said initial studies also indicate much of the original contents of the tomb were moved to another location after the ancient floods.",
      "He said the teams had discovered mortar in the tomb with remnants of blue inscriptions and yellow stars, and some paragraphs from the book of \"Imydwat,\" which is one of the most important funerary books found in ancient Egyptian tombs, written to help guide the late royals through their underworld journey.",
      "Dr. Piers Litherland, head of the English team at the site, said the tomb is characterized by a simple architectural design typical of those chosen by the successive rulers of Egypt who came after Thutmose II.",
      "Litherland said the mission would continue its survey work and try to determine where the rest of the contents from Thutmose II's tomb were relocated to, and to uncover any further secrets that may have been locked beneath the earth for millennia.",

      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on Jan. 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a\u00a01.5% chance\u00a0of the asteroid striking Earth on Dec. 22, 2032.

      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth, and its next close pass will not come until 2028. Scientists will be able to get another look at the asteroid then, Harwood said, and determine its orbit and trajectory.",
      "Betts said, \"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero.\"",
      "A similar scenario unfolded in 2004 with Apophis, an asteroid initially projected to have a 2.7 percent chance of striking Earth in 2029. Further observations ruled out an impact.",

      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75 percent of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If it explodes over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "The good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft \u2014 a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",

Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:00:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A clinical trial from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center looked at the effects of a targeted mRNA vaccine on early-stage pancreatic cancer patients.",
    "story": [
      "When a routine scan led to Barbara Brigham's pancreatic cancer\u00a0diagnosis in 2020, all she could think about was how she wanted more time. Her husband had just passed away. She loved her local library job. Her three children were still growing their own families.",
      "She turned to her care team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to learn about her options. Brigham had first come to the cancer center when she was diagnosed with a small, non-cancerous cyst on her pancreas. Every year, she had a scan to make sure there were no new cysts. It was that annual scan that found the early-stage pancreatic cancer.",
      "Brigham and her youngest son went to Sloan-Kettering the next day to meet with Dr. Vinod Balachandran, a surgical oncologist who specializes in pancreatic cancer. While laying out her options to fight the cancer, he mentioned that he was running a clinical trial that he believed she would be the \"perfect candidate\" for.",
      "The trial would combine standard surgery and chemotherapy treatments \u2014 which are the standard of care for pancreatic cancer \u2014 with a customized mRNA vaccine. Each vaccine would be designed based on the patient's individual tumor. The idea was that the vaccines could hopefully help the body's immune system attack the cancer, Balachandran told CBS News.",
      "\"I looked at my son, and my son said, 'Absolutely.' So we decided to do that,\" Brigham said. \"The prognosis was not good when I was diagnosed. You know you're going to have a limited amount of time. I just wanted to extend that time.\"",
      "Helping an immune system recognize cancer",
      "The inspiration for the clinical trial came from the small handful of long-term pancreatic survivors, Balachandran said. Only about 10% of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer survive for more than five years.",
      "About a decade ago, Balachandran and other researchers turned their attention to these \"long-term\" survivors. Multiple studies found that the long-term survivors' immune systems generated \"spontaneous immune response\" to the cancer, meaning the immune system could recognize that the cancer was a threat and react accordingly. Typically, it's \"challenging\" to teach the immune system to recognize cancer, said Balachandran, because \"the immune system is hardwired not to recognize our own body.\"",
      "\"This led to this question of, 'If this is what is happening in the best case scenario, could we then replicate the success in other pancreatic cancer patients?' Namely, could we teach other patients' immune systems to recognize their cancers in a very similar way as to what is happening naturally in the long-term survivors?\" Balachandran said.",
      "The phase 1 clinical trial looked at 16 patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer like Brigham's. To be eligible for the trial, a patient's cancer had to only be in the pancreas and be removable with surgery. Those conditions occur in just between 20% and 25% of pancreatic cancer patients, Balachandran said, and mirrored the conditions of most long-term survivors. During surgery, a patient's tumor was removed, then sent to Sloan-Kettering's research partners at the German biotechnology company BioNTech. From the tumor, BioNTech would make the vaccine, which would be given to the patient alongside several weeks of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.",
      "The vaccine targeted mutations created by pancreatic cancer. As cancer cells rapidly divide in the body, they accumulate genetic errors, Balachandran said. Those errors could serve as \"red flags to the immune system,\" he said, so it became a matter of alerting the immune system to those cells and teaching it to recognize them.",
      "Sparking \"strong immune responses\"",
      "Of the 16 patients included in the trial, eight had \"strong immune responses,\" Balachandran said. The difference seemed to hinge on what kind of surgery they had to remove their pancreatic cancer: People who had their spleen removed as part of their treatment did not generate a strong immune response, Balachandran said, likely because of the important role the organ plays in immune function.",
      "Earlier data published by Balachandran showed that of the eight people who had strong immune responses, none of them had their cancer recur 18 months after treatment. On average, people whose early-stage pancreatic cancer is treated with chemotherapy and surgery see their cancer recur in a year or less.",
      "Now, new research published in Nature looked at the same patients 3.2 years after their treatment. The follow-ups found that only two of the eight patients who had a strong immune response saw their cancer return.",
      "Meanwhile, seven of the eight non-responding patients had their cancers return within that 3.2-year window, Balachandran said.",
      "While the data seems promising, Balachandran cautioned that it's \"still hard to attribute causality\" to the vaccine, especially because of the trial's small size.",
      "Dr. Suneel Kamath, a gastrointestinal oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic who was not involved with the trial, pointed out that the survival rate of the patients in the trial is similar to the survival rate of people who have early-stage pancreatic cancer treated with surgery and chemotherapy.",
      "\"This was a nice kind of proof-of-concept study to show that we can make a vaccine for this disease, and it really does actually create an immune response, and an immune response that lasts,\" Kamath said. \"That's a very nice backbone to build off of.\"",
      "Another, larger clinical trial is now underway, Balachandran said. This randomized trial will only focus on early-stage pancreatic cancer patients with intact spleens, to confirm what role that organ plays in the process, he said. It will also help confirm if there is a link between the vaccines and better outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients.",
      "mRNA vaccines as cancer treatment",
      "Many other researchers are focusing on how mRNA vaccines could be used to treat cancer. Such research was underway well before the coronavirus pandemic thrust mRNA vaccination into the spotlight, said Kamath, who is working with the company Moderna on a different mRNA vaccine trial looking at pancreatic and gastric cancer.",
      "Part of what makes mRNA vaccines suitable for cancer treatment is how easily they can be customized, Kamath said. Balachandran said that it took about nine weeks for a vaccine to be made for each patient in the clinical trial. That included international shipping on both sides, he said.",
      "\"The beauty of mRNA vaccines, as we saw with COVID development, is they're very fast to make. It easy to generate. Once you found a new target, it's very quick to make a vaccine for that particular target,\" Kamath explained. \"It's really exciting, because when we talk about curing cancer, it's not really a single monolithic disease. There are probably hundreds of different targets for every cancer type. And so the ability to make vaccines against a lot of those different targets very quickly is really powerful.\"",
      "Part of that research is learning which cancers are better candidates for mRNA vaccines to be used as part of the treatment, Kamath said. Things like melanoma, which causes a lot of mutations in the body, are easier to direct the immune system against. Kidney and lung cancers are other promising options, he said.",
      "Something like pancreatic cancer, which has fewer mutations, is more difficult, but has been the\u00a0subject of previous research. Balachandran said part of his goal in looking at pancreatic cancer was to see if mRNA vaccines could make a difference \"among the most challenging cancers in oncology.\"",
      "\"Hopefully this can provide some important lessons and clues and how we can do this in other cancer types,\" Balachandran said.",
      "\"Such a wondrous thing\"",
      "For Brigham, participating in the clinical trial gave her what she wanted: More time with her family and loved ones \u2014 more than four years after she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. On average, for people whose pancreatic cancer is caught \"before the tumor grows much or spreads,\" survival time is about three to three and a half years, according to Johns Hopkins.",
      "In the past few months, Brigham celebrated several milestones. Her youngest son welcomed his first child \u2014 her eighth grandchild \u2014 in late 2024, and she recently joined her extended family for her brother's 60th wedding anniversary.",
      "Brigham has not had any recurrences since she took part in the trial. The removal of part of her pancreas did make her diabetic, because the organ produces insulin, but she says it's manageable.",
      "\"The trial was such a wondrous thing,\" Brigham said. \"It has just given me such a renewal in my life. Sometimes it's a little difficult, but it's worth it, absolutely worth it.\"",

      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 10:42:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
    "story": [
      "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
      "In the study, published in early February in the journal\u00a0Nature Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers found microplastics in human brains have increased 50% over the past 8 years. They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",
      "The team also found high concentrations of plastic in meat bought at grocery stores.",
      "As for the higher levels found in the brains of dementia patients, the researchers noted the study was not designed to prove whether that was the cause of symptoms \u2014 it may be the reverse, that the disease process allows more accumulation to happen.",
      "\"Atrophy of brain tissue, impaired blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and poor clearance mechanisms are hallmarks of dementia and would be anticipated to increase [micro- and nanoplastic] concentrations,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the research on the health impact of microplastics is still in its infancy, but there are important questions being asked.",
      "\"There are concerns that this could be causing any number of conditions. Could it be increasing the risk of stroke or heart attack? Could it be increasing the risk of cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, infertility?\" she said\u00a0on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "For those looking to reduce exposure to microplastics, Gounder suggests switching from plastic bottles to stainless steel or glass and making some other changes in the kitchen.",
      "\"Do not reheat your food in contact with plastic \u2014 that is really important. So move it to a glass dish or your plate, not in plastic,\" she said \"And then finally switch out your cutting boards. Don't use plastic cutting boards, use either wood or stone.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 20:54:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The asteroid 2024 YR4 has a very small chance of striking Earth when its orbit briefly intersects our planet's in December 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Wednesday lowered the chances to about 1.5%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's latest probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

    "title": "Key facts about asteroid that could hit Earth in 2032",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 10:23:30 -0500",
    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 3.1%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

    "summary": "The president has endorsed the House GOP's one-bill approach while Senate Republicans want to separate his priorities into two bills.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans are forging ahead with a narrower budget proposal focused on defense, border security and energy priorities, despite President Trump's decision on Wednesday to endorse a competing plan put forward by House Republicans.",
      "The Senate began what's known as a \"vote-a-rama\" on the GOP budget blueprint Thursday evening, in which senators can offer an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to cast vote after vote through the night. After the Senate exhausts all amendment votes, it will take a final vote on the budget resolution, which directs the committees to submit their proposed spending plans by March 7.",
      "With a three-seat majority, Senate Republicans should ultimately have the votes to adopt the budget resolution, but the vote-a-rama gives Democrats the opportunity to force their GOP colleagues to go on the record on a host of politically dicey subjects. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Wednesday that Republicans \"better get ready for a late night and a long morning.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, defended the upper chamber's decision while wishing House Republicans success in moving their resolution forward.",
      "\"I think he's made it clear for a long time that he would prefer one big, beautiful bill, and we're fine with that too,\" Thune said Wednesday, referring to the president. \"If the House can produce one big, beautiful bill, we're prepared to work with them to get that across the finish line, but we believe that the president also likes optionality.\"",
      "The Senate's budget resolution calls for increasing military spending by $150 billion and border security spending by $175 billion, but does not extend tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term that expire at the end of the year. Senate Republicans want to address tax cuts in a second bill and make them permanent.",
      "The House plan includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion and calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts. To appease conservatives, the House Budget Committee amended the resolution to make tax cuts dependent on spending cuts. If House committees don't achieve at least $2 trillion in spending cuts, then tax cuts would be scaled back. Tax cuts would be increased if more than $2 trillion is slashed in spending.",
      "Mr. Trump's endorsement of the House's one-bill approach was a victory for Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, and took Senate Republicans by surprise. Johnson has been trying to keep pace with the Senate's two-bill plan while navigating the demands of his divided Republican conference and razor-thin majority. House GOP leaders aren't confident they can pass two bills with their narrow majority.",
      "Senate Republicans, who want to move quickly on border and defense spending, deferred to their House counterparts for weeks to take the lead, but put out their own blueprint amid repeated delays in the lower chamber.",
      "The Senate Budget Committee and House Budget Committee both passed separate plans last week. The House is in recess this week as the Senate works to adopt its resolution.",
      "The chambers will have to eventually have to adopt identical budget resolutions to continue the reconciliation process and enact Mr. Trump's agenda. The process allows Senate Republicans to pass the legislation with a simple majority.",

    "story": [
      "Members of Elon Musk's private security detail have been deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service, granting them certain rights and protections of federal law enforcement agents, four sources familiar with the move confirmed to CBS News Thursday.",
      "The move comes after several people within Musk's orbit relayed a heightened concern about safety for the tech billionaire, including several death threats in recent weeks.",
      "The Tesla CEO turned Trump adviser referenced that concern while on stage at a conservative gathering outside Washington, D.C., on Thursday.",
      "\"President Bukele from El Salvador, who managed to put in prison like a hundred thousand murderous thugs, and he called me,\" Musk recounted to activists gathered at the Conservative Political Action Conference. \"'I am worried about your security,'\" he said the Central American leader told him. \"I'm like, 'Dude, you are worried about my security?'\"",
      "\"It's not enormous,\" Musk added of his security detail. \"Maybe it should be bigger.\"",
      "Musk was tapped by President Trump to head the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump took office last month Musk's team has gone about slashing thousands of federal positions across numerous agencies. DOGE has also stoked controversy by seeking access to sensitive government data.",
      "In a statement late Thursday, Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi referred CBS News to DOGE's communications office.",
      "\"While we are not able to comment on the specifics of our protective operations, Secret Service protocols strictly prohibit private security services from being armed within the Treasury Building, Eisenhower Executive Office Building or the White House,\" Guglielmi said in a statement.",
      "The U.S. Marshals Service routinely deputizes police. During President Trump's inauguration, 4,000 officers from outside of Washington, D.C. \u2014 across 178 different law enforcement and police agencies \u2014 were sworn in and deputized by the U.S. Marshals to assist in protection of the nation's capital.",
      "However, the move to deputize private security officers, who are not sworn law enforcement officials, is considered unorthodox, raising eyebrows among officials familiar with the move.",
      "It was not immediately apparent what authorities Musk's team would be granted, but special deputies are typically permitted to carry weapons on federal grounds and carry out arrests.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House, Justice Department and U.S. Marshals Service for comment. CNN was first to report the news.",
      "It remains unclear why the White House did not issue Musk Secret Service protection. The agency could technically assign a protective detail to anyone with an executive order from Mr. Trump. Along with the president, vice president and first and second families, Secret Service also provides protection to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, among other top White House officials.",
      "The U.S. Marshals are responsible for protecting more than 2,700 sitting judges and approximately 30,300 federal prosecutors and court officials, along with members of the public who visit and work in federal courthouses nationwide.

      "CBS News learned the first officer graduated from a university with an accredited and well-respected aviation program, and so was able to start working with fewer than 1,500 hours under a Restricted Air Transport Pilot certificate.

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 21:39:00 -0500",
    "summary": "\"I can tell you this: anyone that has crossed the border between the ports of entry since this administration has taken office has not been released,\" Border Patrol chief Mike Banks told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Unlawful crossings at the U.S. southern border are down 94% from the same period last year, Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks told CBS News in his first sit-down interview, crediting the Trump administration's government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Over the past seven days, Banks said, Border Patrol agents have apprehended an average of 285 migrants per day along the entire southern border, compared to roughly 4,800 during the same time last year.",
      "Banks attributed the dramatic drop in illegal immigration to a slew of executive actions taken by President Trump. They include an order that has effectively closed the U.S. asylum system and allowed for summary deportations, as well as the cancellation of Biden administration policies that allowed some migrants to enter the country with the government's permission.",
      "Formerly Texas' border czar, Banks also cited the Trump administration's deployment of additional troops to the southern border and a decision to deputize Texas National Guard soldiers as immigration officers, to help Border Patrol agents in the field.",
      "Taken together, Banks said, the actions have virtually halted releases of migrants into the U.S. interior and sent a strong warning to those thinking about traveling to the American border that they will most likely be deported if they enter the country without permission.",
      "\"The greater the punishment, the larger the deterrent,\" Banks said during an interview at Customs and Border Protection's headquarters in Washington.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, Banks added, only two migrants have been released from Border Patrol custody after crossing the southern border unlawfully. He said they were released to assist with criminal prosecutions as witnesses.",
      "\"I can tell you this: anyone that has crossed the border between the ports of entry since this administration has taken office has not been released,\" Banks noted.",
      "One of the Biden-era policies the Trump administration rescinded allowed prospective asylum-seekers in Mexico to use a phone app, known as CBP One, to request a time to enter the U.S. at a legal border entry point.",
      "Asked if asylum is no longer an option for migrants at the U.S. southern border given the policy changes, Banks responded, \"At the border, right, crossing in between the ports of entry, which is what the Border Patrol focuses on? No.\"",
      "\"You do not cross the border illegally and then make an asylum claim,\" he said. \"You can go to the port of entry, or you can go to one of the embassies in your country and make your claim for asylum.\"",
      "While illegal crossings along the border with Mexico have dropped precipitously since Mr. Trump's inauguration, they had been on a downward trend over the past year, since soaring to record highs in late 2023. Officials at the time credited Mexico's increased efforts to interdict migrants, and a Biden administration policy, enacted in June 2024, that restricted asylum, though not as broadly as the current rules.",
      "In fact, in December, the Biden administration's last full month in office, Border Patrol recorded 47,000 migrant apprehensions, down 81% from December 2023, during a record-breaking surge in unlawful crossings, government figures show. That number dipped to just over 29,000 last month.",

      "Probationary workers usually have less than one year experience, and in some cases less than two years. They have fewer protections from layoffs, making them easier to terminate.",
      "\"Now, I'm unemployed, I have a ton of debt, and I'm also losing my health insurance, and I have, like many Americans, a chronic condition that requires me to take medication,\" said Sandlin, who adds that the idea of getting fired \"never crossed my mind.\"",
      "Sandlin says her supervisors \"made it clear that I was not being terminated because of anything that I had done.\"",
      "An official with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which NIH is a part of, sent Sandlin a letter which read, in part: \"Unfortunately, the Agency finds that you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency's current needs, and your performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the Agency.\"",
      "Sandling said receiving the letter \"really upset me, because it felt like it wasn't truthful. My boss, her boss, and even his boss, all said that that was not true.\"",

    "summary": "\"To me, this is all about saving American taxpayers money, and so I fully support pauses in these programs,\" Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall said.",
    "story": [
      "As the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, implements sweeping cuts across the federal government, Republican lawmakers are worried about the impact on jobs and industry in their states.",
      "But very few are directly criticizing President Trump or DOGE's leader, Elon Musk, and are instead taking a quieter approach. But the concerns raised nonetheless underscore the clash between shrinking government and parochial interests.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she was hearing from so many constituents concerned about cuts to the federal workforce in her state that she decided to host a tele town hall Wednesday night, which she said over 1,000 people attended.",
      "Alaska has one of the largest federal workforces per capita in the country, with public land management a significant focus. Murkowski said the concerns at the town hall ranged from the impact on preparedness for wildland fires to staffing national parks to the ruthless treatment of employees.",
      "\"The abrupt terminations that we have seen for those have really been detrimental,\" she said, adding that she took her concerns to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. \"The problem is, they're going to require that all these people who were terminated reapply, so they have to go back to usa.gov and go through the application process, which, if you haven't done it, is a multi-month process. Parks are opening up in a couple months here, and so I'm concerned.\" Additionally, she said, cuts to the Bureau of Land Management could slow permitting for Mr. Trump's energy initiatives.",
      "The Alaska senator said she supports eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in government, \"but there is a way that we go about it, and we do it within the confines of the law and the rules that are out there\u2026when you're dealing with employees, there is a right way and a really not so right way to treat them.\"",
      "Maine Republican Susan Collins, another moderate senator, said she's also worried about the impact on national parks in her state, as well as on biomedical research.",
      "\"I think many of these firings are indiscriminate,\" she said. \"We should wait until Cabinet members are confirmed and can take a careful look at their agencies' needs, rather than doing these sweeping indiscriminate cuts. The fact that workers were let go who are working on avian flu, and the fact that workers have also been fired who are responsible for nuclear safety, shows that we need a far more careful approach.",
      "Earlier this month, as the administration began to dismantle USAID, Kansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran urged Secretary of State Marco Rubio to \"distribute the $340 million in American-grown food currently stalled in U.S. ports to reach those in need.\"",
      "Moran, who sits on the Senate Agriculture Committee, also said he raised his concerns with the White House. \"U.S. food aid feeds the hungry, bolsters our national security & provides an important market for our farmers, especially when commodity prices are low,\" he said on X. He later said the State Department approved his request to distribute the stalled food aid.",
      "Kansas Republican Sen. Roger Marshall partnered with Moran to move USAID's Food for Peace program \u2014 of particular interest to Kansas farmers \u2014 under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture.",
      "\"To me, this is all about saving American taxpayers money, and so I fully support pauses in these programs,\" Marshall told CBS News. \"I think it's time to get rid of some of the agencies we have, over 400 agencies in this federal government, over 2 million employees outside of what we have in the military. So I think it's time for consolidation.\"",
      "Lawmakers have also taken notice of the layoffs at the National Institute of Health. \"Every cent of hard-earned taxpayer money should be spent efficiently, judiciously, and accountability \u2014 without exception,\" Alabama Sen. Katie Britt told AL.com. \"While the administration works to achieve this goal at NIH, a smart, targeted approach is needed in order to not hinder life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama.\"",
      "Most other Republicans remain supportive of DOGE's mission. North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis said he's making sure FEMA and disaster aid isn't disrupted in his state, which has recently been ravaged by storms. But overall, he said, he agrees with the approach.",
      "\"I actually believe they are doing this because they're sick of trying to get answers to legitimate questions about where we can be efficient, and the way to force people to justify investments on exceptions is to shut everything down,\" Tillis said. \"I know it's disruptive, but I think they need to have the capacity to bring things back online that make sense.\"",
      "Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin also defended the administration's cost-cutting efforts. He pointed to the nation's burgeoning debt as a national security issue that requires \"difficult choices\".",
      "\"Any member is going to be particularly upset about some cuts that may be happening in our backyard,\" Mullin told CBS News. \"Look what's happened to FAA? You know, in Oklahoma City, we had the training facility for our air traffic controllers, right? That's a concern, and Sean Duffy and I've had conversations. But at the same time, we have the responsibility to the taxpayers and American people to get our financials, our financial burdens, in order.\"",
      "Florida Senator Rick Scott said he doesn't believe Musk and his DOGE team are moving too quickly.",
      "\"It's what I did when I was governor. It's what I did in my business life,\" said Scott. \"You go through and you're constantly looking at how to spend your money better. So, it's what they ought to be doing. It's what everybody ought to be doing. Every- you know, everybody ought to be going through the budget and saying, 'how can we save money'?\"",

Schumer said, reading from notes in his hand:\u00a0 'I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.'\"",

    "summary": "A group of five labor unions had argued that President Trump's effort to shrink the size of the federal workforce were illegal.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday allowed President Trump's efforts to shrink the federal workforce to continue moving forward while legal proceedings continue, declining a request from a group of labor unions to temporarily block his firing of federal employees and other actions targeting government workers.",
      "U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper, who sits on the federal district court in Washington, D.C., said in a 16-page decision that he had to deny the unions' request for relief because he lacks jurisdiction over the claims. The judge, appointed by former President Barack Obama, said the unions must pursue their legal challenges through the scheme established by Congress in the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, which governs labor relations in the federal workforce.",
      "The claims, he said, must be filed with the Federal Labor Relations Authority.",
      "Still, Cooper wrote that the first month of Mr. Trump's administration \"has been defined by an onslaught of executive actions that have caused, some say by design, disruption and even chaos in widespread quarters of American society.\" He also noted that mixed decisions by federal judges halting some of Mr. Trump's actions and letting others proceed while cases move forward are not a surprise.",
      "\"Federal district judges are duty-bound to decide legal issues based on even-handed application of law and precedent \u2014 no matter the identity of the litigants or, regrettably at times, the consequences of their rulings for average people,\" Cooper wrote.",
      "The five unions, which represent federal workers, had asked Cooper to issue an order that temporarily prevented the termination of members who are probationary employees; implementation of large-scale reductions in force throughout the government; and a renewal of the president's \"deferred resignation program.\"",
      "That program offered federal workers the chance to resign their positions but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30. The deadline for employees to accept the offer was Feb. 12, and roughly 75,000 federal workers agreed to the program, according to the White House.",
      "The unions argued that the president's three initiatives \u2014 firing of probationary employees, deferred resignation program and planned large-scale reductions in force \u2014 violate the separation of powers and federal law.",
      "In court filings, lawyers for the unions warned that the president's plans to shrink the size of the government threatened more than 500,000 employees. Roughly 220,000 workers are considered probationary, they said, and another 345,000 were deemed nonessential during the last major government shutdown during Mr. Trump's first term. Nonessential workers were targeted for firing in an executive order signed by the president that directs agency heads to prepare for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "More than 12,000 federal workers have already been or are likely to be fired, including over 6,000 at the Internal Revenue Service who are expected to be terminated by the end of the month, according to a source familiar with the agency's plans.",
      "\"A mass reduction of roughly twenty-five percent of the federal civilian workforce is unprecedented,\" the unions wrote in a filing. \"It raises the novel question of whether the Executive Branch may lawfully hobble the federal agencies that Congress creates, to which Congress assigns statutory missions, and which Congress funds so that they may accomplish those legislative directives.\"",
      "The Justice Department had urged the court to deny the unions' request, arguing in part that they failed to show they would be harmed, absent relief.",
      "\"The president is charged with directing the Executive Branch workforce, and he has determined that the politically accountable heads of his agencies should take steps to streamline and modernize the workforce through measures including voluntary deferred resignations, removal of certain probationary employees, and [reductions in force],\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing.",

      "Deep vein thrombosis occurs when a blood clot forms in one of the deep veins in the body, according to the\u00a0Mayo Clinic. While it can lead to leg pain or swelling, there are sometimes no noticeable symptoms.",
      "Deep vein thrombosis is typically seen in lower legs, thighs or the pelvis, but can also occur in other parts of the body, the Cleveland Clinic says.

      "Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor that he made the decision not to run again last year. McConnell said he's never much liked calling attention to Feb. 20, but he figured his birthday is as good a day as any to make the announcement.",
      "\"Seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate,\" McConnell said. \"Every day in between, I've been humbled by the trust they've placed in me to do their business right here. Representing our commonwealth has been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time. My current term in the Senate will be my last.\"",
      "McConnell has been a U.S. senator from Kentucky since 1985, and he announced one year ago that he would relinquish his leadership role in the Senate. He was the Senate Republican leader from 2007-2025 and is the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history. McConnell served as majority leader from 2015-2021.",
      "The Kentucky Republican's retirement from the Senate was widely expected.",
      "McConnell, a polio survivor, has experienced health issues in recent years, including freezing episodes and falls.

Or that if not for the people of Kentucky, time and again agreeing that leadership delivers, and elected me to send back here, it would have been someone else from somewhere taking that seat at the table where I've had a chance to work, strategize, fight and win.\"",
      "As Senate majority leader, McConnell wielded immense power, and was singularly responsible for the fast rate at which President Trump's judicial nominees were confirmed during his first term. He was also famous for blocking the confirmation process after Merrick Garland was nominated to the Supreme Court under President Barack Obama, holding the seat open for a Trump nomination instead.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:59:59 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said his administration is considering dividend checks based on savings found by DOGE. Economists are skeptical.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he's considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. But economists and policy experts across the political spectrum expressed skepticism about the feasibility of such a \"DOGE dividend.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,\" Mr. Trump said at the FII Priority summit, an investment conference in Miami sponsored by Saudi government entities. Mr. Trump didn't provide further details.",
      "The idea of the so-called DOGE dividend surfaced on social media this week when a four-page proposal was posted by an X user, James Fishback. The post caught the eye of Musk, the owner of X, who is spearheading DOGE, and who on Tuesday said he would pitch the idea to Mr. Trump.",
      "According to Fishback's calculation, 20% of the supposed $2 trillion in eventual DOGE savings would be provided to some taxpayers in the form of a direct tax rebate, which he estimated at $5,000 per household. Only households with a tax liability would receive the payment, which means lower-income households that generally don't owe income taxes wouldn't be included.",
      "But economists and policy experts said the plan isn't likely to materialize, citing the implausibility of finding anywhere near $2 trillion in federal cuts, as well as the legislative hurdles in approving such a direct tax payment.",
      "\"It is completely impossible for DOGE to save $2 trillion,\"Jessica Reidl, an economist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Two-thirds of the $7 trillion federal budget goes to Social Security, Medicare, defense, veterans and interest on the debt \u2014 all of which has been taken off the table by President Trump.\"",
      "She added, \"Saving $2 trillion would require eliminating nearly every remaining federal program. DOGE has no legal or constitutional authority to cut this spending; Congress must pass a law and that will not happen.\"",
      "Two-thirds of the nation's $6.7 trillion in annual spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0commitments through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense. In a Feb. 18 interview on Fox News' \"The Sean Hannity Show,\" Mr. Trump reiterated his earlier vow that Social Security and Medicare cuts are off the table.",
      "\"Social Security won't be touched, other than fraud or something,\" Mr. Trump said during the interview. \"We're going to find it's going to be strengthened, but won't be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.\"",
      "On Feb. 19, Mr. Trump backed the House Republicans' budget proposal, which, if enacted, would include deep cuts to Medicaid, the nearly $900-billion-a-year government health insurance program that serves about 79 million mostly low-income or disabled Americans.",
      "The White House didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE cuts",
      "As of Wednesday, DOGE claims it has made cuts that add up to\u00a0about $8.4 billion, according to the task force's own\u00a0documentation.",
      "While DOGE has only been operating since Mr. Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, its cuts are far from reaching Musk's stated goal of shaving $500 billion in annual government spending, let alone reaching near $2 trillion, experts noted.",
      "The plan \"is very unrealistic,\" Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, who describes himself as a libertarian, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I'd love to see it, but I think that is unrealistic, especially in the first year, and certainly unrealistic without Congress getting involved.\"",
      "Any new tax refund check would need the approval of Congress, which controls government spending and is in charge of crafting tax laws. But House Republicans are currently\u00a0negotiating a budget proposal\u00a0that would enact trillions of dollars in spending cuts to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as other tax provisions the president promised on the campaign trail.",
      "A DOGE dividend \"will make their numbers even harder to work in the budget reconciliation,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a Washington, D.C.-based left-leaning economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's hard to see how to make the math work.\"",
      "While a plan for some kind of DOGE dividend could materialize, it would doubtless be a much smaller amount than envisioned, given the practical impossibility of finding $2 trillion in federal cuts.",
      "Experts noted that rebate checks are typically issued in times of economic stress, such as during the pandemic, when Congress authorized several rounds of stimulus checks. But the U.S. economy today is viewed as strong, given growing GDP and low unemployment, they added.",
      "At the same time, the federal government's annual outlays are outpacing revenue by about $2 trillion, creating budget deficits and sending the nation's debt to a record $36.2 trillion.",
      "Reidl noted, \"Washington is facing annual budget deficits that will likely surpass $3 trillion within the next few years. Sending taxpayers dividend checks would be completely irresponsible.\"",
      "DOGE facing legal issues",
      "Experts also raised the issue of whether DOGE's cuts could be reversed by the courts, given that the group is facing multiple lawsuits over its access to sensitive data across various agencies as well as over the legality of its creation.",
      "\"I'm happy to see [DOGE] identify things that can be cut, but I do have concerns about the legality of it,\" Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute said. \"Congress appropriates money, and having the presidential quasi-commission go around and cut things seems like it would run afoul of a lot of laws.\"",
      "DOGE's savings so far could \"be reversed by the courts for bypassing Congress,\" Reidl noted.",
      "Given the challenges of trying to find anything close to $2 trillion in savings, as well as the legislative issues in passing a tax rebate check, experts said their advice to taxpayers is not to bank on getting a DOGE dividend.",
      "\"I wouldn't be budgeting a $5,000 expense in the near term,\" Jacquez said.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:58:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits, but executives expressed caution about an uncertain economic landscape.",
    "story": [
      "Walmart shares tumbled on Thursday after the retailing giant provided a 2025 sales and profit forecast that was lower than analysts had expected, with executives warning about new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "Walmart slipped $6.93, or 6.7%, to $97.07 in early afternoon trading on Thursday. The outlook from the nation's largest retailer for 2025 is as much as 27 cents below analyst projections for per-share earnings and for the quarter, Walmart's expectations are as much as 7 cents below Wall Street projections.",
      "Its sales outlook is also disappointing, potentially a reflection of rising challenges ahead as consumers pull back on spending and President Donald Trump's tariffs on China and other countries threaten the low-price model that is the core of Walmart's success.",
      "\"[W]e have to acknowledge that we are in an uncertain time, and we don't want to get out over our skis here,\" said Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey on a conference call with investors on Feb. 20.",
      "Walmart executives said the company has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Groceries account for roughly 60%, of its U.S. business, according to the company's most recent annual report, meaning a huge chunk of sales are not reliant on goods made in China or elsewhere.",
      "Walmart expects first quarter earnings per share of between 57 cents and 58 cents, well below the 64 cents Wall Street was expecting, and for the year. Walmart expects earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. That's also off the $2.77 that analysts are predicting, according to FactSet.",
      "It forecast a 3% to 4% increase in quarterly sales or between $166.35 billion and $167.97 billion. That could be a letdown for industry analysts, who had expected sales of $167.05 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Walmart expects sales to be up anywhere between 3% to 4% for the current year, or between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That too falls short of the $708.72 billion that analysts predicted, according to FactSet.",
      "Inflation-weary consumers",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly financial results and numbers could provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper, particularly amid new trade barriers that according to most economists threaten to reignite inflation.",
      "Consumers over the past year have increasingly focused more on necessities rather than TVs, furniture or appliances. They've become much more discerning about big-ticket purchases because of higher costs for credit as well as for groceries.",
      "Walmart has flourished in that environment, using its clout to keep prices down. It's gained market share, notably among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart's online offerings and paid membership, Walmart +, have also drawn wealthier customers",
      "\"We have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an eCommerce business driven by faster delivery times,\" said CEO Doug McMillon. \"We're gaining market share, our top line is healthy, and we're in great shape with inventory.\"",
      "Tariff risks",
      "Still, Walmart could be faced with challenges with the new tariffs carrying more economic risks than during Trump's first term. If Americans are hit by a new wave of price increases, economists say, and with 70% of the U.S. economy driven by consumers a broad pullback in spending would have ramifications beyond Walmart's sales.",
      "Government data last week revealed a sharp drop in January retail sales as cold weather kept more Americans indoors. But it was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest in a year. Sales were revised higher for December, possibly indicating a pullback by consumers after a holiday season splurge.",
      "\"[T]here are a lot of potential headwinds from sticky inflation, high debt levels, and a suppressed housing market. The uncertainty of tariffs and their impact on prices adds another changeable dimension,\" noted Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a Feb. 14 research note about the retail data.",
      "Yet grocery prices, a sore point for American households, continued to rise.",
      "Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, reported earnings of $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31. That compares with $5.49 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share for the most recent quarter was 66 cents.",
      "Sales rose 4.1% to $180.55 billion in the quarter.",
      "Analysts expected 65 cents per share on sales of $180.07 billion in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on Wednesday urged her colleagues in Congress to reassert their constitutional authority and stand up to President Trump if he withholds funding approved by lawmakers through his\u00a0mass firings of federal workers or severe cuts to federal agencies.",
      "\"If the president, for instance, should seek to withhold federal funding that has already been authorized and appropriated, that violates the Budget Act, it violates the Impoundment Act and it cannot be allowed to stand. And so, if we in Congress allow that, we effectively cede some of our authority, and so, your question as to, what do we do about it? We have to stand up,\" she said in a virtual town hall with constituents.",
      "\"Now, the 'we' has to be more than just me. And this is where it becomes more of a challenge, but it requires speaking out. It requires saying, 'That violates the law. That violates the authorities of the executive,'\" she said.",
      "The Alaska Republican said Congress has an \"obligation to the Constitution\" that requires \"speaking out and standing up, and that requires, again, more than just one or two Republicans \u2014 it requires us as a Congress to do so.\"",
      "The president's moves to essentially shutter several agencies and fire thousands of workers have already run into legal challenges, with federal courts across the country weighing whether his actions were lawful. The administration has been temporarily blocked from ousting workers and freezing funding in a handful of cases so far.",
      "Murkowski is a moderate Republican who has been in the Senate since 2002 and won reelection in 2022 despite longstanding differences with Mr. Trump. She said more than 1,000 people dialed into the call on Wednesday, and that many of her constituents were concerned about the Trump administration's cuts, which are being spearheaded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Alaska has one of the highest concentrations of federal government workers per capita outside the Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia region.",
      "Most Republican lawmakers have so far shown little interest in objecting as the Trump administration tries to whittle down agencies established and funded by Congress.",
      "On the war in Ukraine, Murkowski said \"we were all more than a little bit stunned\" by what she called a \"radical switch\" in the president's rhetoric about the war and Russia. Mr. Trump this week referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a \"dictator\" and wrongly blamed Ukraine for Russia's invasion, while his top aides met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia about the war without inviting Ukrainian officials.",
      "Murkowski said she thought Mr. Trump's comments about Zelenskyy were \"uncalled for and unfortunate.\"",
      "\"It is wrong to suggest that somehow or other Ukraine started this war, asked for this war. It is clear for all the world to see and to know that Putin invaded Ukraine and started the war,\" Murkowski said.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said Russia wants to end the war, without mentioning that Russia started the conflict and could end it at any point by withdrawing troops from Ukraine. Asked if he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith on ending the war, the president said he does.",
      "\"I do, I think the Russians want to see the war end,\" the president said. \"And I do, I really do. But I think they have the cards a little bit because, you know, they've taken a lot of territory, so they have the cards.\"",
      "A handful of other Republicans have expressed their disagreement with Mr. Trump's stance on Russia and Ukraine, without directly crossing the president.",
      "\"Russia's the aggressor here,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Wednesday.",
      "\"Putin started this war,\" Republican Rep. Don Bacon wrote on X Wednesday. \"Putin committed war crimes. Putin is the dictator who murdered his opponents. The EU nations have contributed more to Ukraine. Zelensky polls over 50%. Ukraine wants to be part of the West, Putin hates the West. I don't accept George Orwell's doublethink.\"",
      "Murkowski separately told CBS News on Capitol Hill earlier Wednesday she has been hearing from constituents who have been worked for the federal government for years or decades. She said she heard from one woman who used to work for her before accepting a position with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Because the woman was recently promoted, Murkowski said, she was considered a probationary employee and was terminated as part of the administration's cuts. Now the woman has a \"black mark\" on her record, Murkowski said.",
      "\"She's been terminated and given no opportunity to appeal it, no opportunity to even think about it,\" Murkowski said. \"You get a notice on Friday saying you're gone. Now that, to me, doesn't demonstrate much due process. But even more, it doesn't show respect for those who have worked hard as federal servants.\"",

      "Officials have previously confirmed the virus in mice found on affected farms.",
      "The agency's latest update also included other infected mammals in locations around the country, including a harbor seal in Massachusetts, a fox in North Dakota, a bobcat in Washington state and a domestic cat in Oregon. Officials said the cat infection is likely related to a recent report of two pets from Multnomah County that were sickened after eating raw pet food contaminated with the virus.",

      "\"Although several positions supporting [highly pathogenic avian influenza] were notified of their terminations over the weekend, we are working to swiftly rectify the situation and rescind those letters,\" the USDA said in a statement to CBS News.",

The agency said it \"continues to prioritize the response to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).\"",
      "Since the H5N1 strain of the bird flu began spreading in the U.S. in 2022, about\u00a0148 million birds\u00a0on poultry farms have been euthanized to prevent additional infections, which has caused\u00a0egg prices to spike.\u00a0In March 2024, the illness was found in dairy cows for the first time, while almost 70\u00a0human cases\u00a0have been identified, mostly in dairy and poultry workers.

    "story": [
      "Khan Younis, Gaza Strip \u2014\u00a0Hamas released four bodies on Thursday, which Israeli officials said included two young children who have long been feared dead and had come to embody the nation's agony following\u00a0the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel. Their mother was said to have been returned with them, but Israeli forces said hours later that another person's remains were released instead.",
      "The remains were said to be those of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, as well as Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted. Kfir, who was 9 months old when he was taken, was the youngest of all the captives. Hamas has said all four were killed along with their guards in Israeli airstrikes.",
      "In a social media post early Friday morning, the Israel Defense Forces said that Ariel and Kfir's remains were returned, but not their mother's. \"During the identification process, it was determined that the additional body received is not that of Shiri Bibas, and no match was found for any other hostage. This is an anonymous, unidentified body,\" the IDF said.",
      "In a statement released Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the handover of the wrong remains as a \"cruel and malicious violation\" of the ceasefire agreement that has halted fighting in the Gaza Strip and said Hamas would \"pay the full price\" for the action. He said the fourth body was that of a Gazan woman.",
      "The militants displayed four black caskets Thursday on a stage surrounded by banners, including a large one depicting Israeli Netanyahu as a vampire, as Red Cross vehicles arrived at the scene in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The fighters then carried the caskets over to Red Cross vehicles, where staffers in red vests covered them in white sheets before placing them inside. Each casket had a picture fixed to the front bearing the image of the slain hostage whose remains were purportedly inside.",
      "The Red Cross convoy headed back to Israel, where authorities were carrying out a formal identification process on the remains using DNA, which was expected to take up to two days. A statement from the Lifshitz family, however, shared by the Hostages Families Forum, said they had \"received with deep sorrow the official and bitter news confirming the identification of our beloved Oded's body.\"",
      "\"We had hoped and prayed so much for a different outcome. Now we can mourn the husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather who has been missing from us since October 7,\" the family said, adding that their \"healing process will begin now and will not end until the last hostage is returned.\"",
      "Thousands of people, including large numbers of masked and armed fighters from Hamas and other factions, gathered at the handover site on the outskirts of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.",
      "\"Every home in Israel bows its head today. We bow our heads for the heavy loss of our four hostages,\" Netanyahu said in a statement. \"The four coffins of our loved ones oblige us more than ever to promise, to swear, that what happened on October 7 will never happen again.\"",
      "Israeli channels did not broadcast the handover. In Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, where Israelis have gathered to watch the release of living hostages, a large screen showed a compilation of photos and videos of Lifshitz and the Bibas family, including a chuckling baby Kfir and the family dressed up in Batman costumes. Yarden Bibas, the children's father, was not with his family on Oct. 7, but was taken separately. He was released earlier this month after 16 months in captivity.",
      "Dozens of residents of Kibbutz Nir Oz, from which the four slain hostages released on Thursday were kidnapped, gathered to wave Israeli flags outside of their temporary home an hour north of the ravaged kibbutz.",
      "Israelis have celebrated the return of 24 living hostages in recent weeks under a tenuous ceasefire that paused over 15 months of war. But the handover on Thursday will provide a grim reminder of those who died in captivity as the talks leading up to the truce dragged on for over a year.",
      "It could also provide impetus for negotiations on the second stage of the ceasefire that have hardly begun. The first phase is set to end at the beginning of March.",
      "Kfir Bibas was just 9 months old, a red-headed infant with a toothless smile, when militants stormed into the family's home on Oct. 7, 2023. His brother Ariel was 4. Video shot that day showed a terrified Shiri swaddling the two boys as militants led them into Gaza.",
      "Relatives in Israel have clung to hope, marking Kfir's first and second birthdays and his brother's fifth. The Bibas family said in a statement Wednesday that it would wait for \"identification procedures\" before acknowledging that their loved ones were dead.",
      "Supporters throughout Israel have worn orange in solidarity with the family \u2014 a reference to two boys' red hair \u2014 and a popular children's song was written in their honor.",
      "Like the Bibas family, Oded Lifshitz was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, along with his wife Yocheved, who was freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Oded was a journalist who campaigned for the recognition of Palestinian rights and peace between Arabs and Jews.",
      "Hamas-led militants abducted 251 hostages, including some 30 children, in the Oct. 7 terrorist attack, in which they also killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians.",
      "More than half the hostages, and most of the women and children, have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight and have recovered dozens of bodies of people killed in the initial attack or who died in captivity.",
      "Hamas is set to free six living hostages on Saturday in exchange for hundreds more Palestinian prisoners, and says it will release four more bodies next week, completing the ceasefire's first phase. That will leave the militants with some 60 hostages, all men, around half of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Hamas has said it won't release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he is committed to destroying Hamas' military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal to remove some 2 million Palestinians from Gaza so the U.S. can own and rebuild it, which has been welcomed by Netanyahu but universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries, has thrown the ceasefire into further doubt.",
      "Hamas could be reluctant to free more hostages if it believes the war will resume with the goal of annihilating the group or forcibly transferring Gaza's population.",
      "Israel's military offensive killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its records. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence.",
      "The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to fields of rubble and bombed-out buildings. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza's population. Many have returned to their homes to find nothing left and no way of rebuilding.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:16:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Egypt is promising a viable alternative to Trump's controversial Gaza plan with broad support that would keep Palestinians \"in their homeland.\"",
    "story": [
      "Cairo \u2014 Optimism in the Arab world that President Trump might bring a permanent end to the war in the Gaza Strip and, with it, stability to the tumultuous Middle East, soared as he was given a lion's share of the credit for ushering in the current ceasefire. But that hope has faded quickly since Mr. Trump suggested a plan to force Gaza's entire population out and to \"take over\" the decimated Palestinian territory to develop it as a vacation destination.",
      "Mr. Trump said the roughly 2.3 million Palestinians should be moved to Egypt and Jordan, apparently to make way for investors to move in and \"just clean out the whole thing.\"",
      "The president's suggestion sent a shockwave of confusion and anger sweeping across the Arab nations that surround Israel, and beyond.",
      "\"In Egypt, we have warned since the beginning of the crisis that what was happening was an attempt to render the Gaza Strip uninhabitable, paving the way for the displacement of the Palestinians,\" Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said several days after Mr. Trump first suggested his plan. \"I state it unequivocally: The displacement of the Palestinian people from their place is an injustice. We cannot condone or be a part of the unjust displacement of Palestinians.\"",
      "Meeting earlier this month in Washington with Mr. Trump, Jordan's King Abdullah II, asked about the president's proposal, said Egypt was working on an alternative plan with other Arab countries.",
      "\"We will be in Saudi Arabia to discuss how we can work with the president and with the United States,\" Abdullah told reporters. \"Let's wait until the Egyptians can come and present it to the [U.S.] president, and not get ahead of ourselves.\"",
      "On Friday, a meeting to discuss that alternative proposal for Gaza's future will take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. While Mr. Trump has continued to insist that Egypt and Jordan will rehome the Palestinians from Gaza, his administration has also said it remains open to other suggestions.",
      "\"Right now, the only one who's stood up and said, 'I'm willing to help do it,' is Donald Trump,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview last week. \"All these other leaders, they're going to have to step up. If they've got a better idea, then now is the time.\"",
      "An Egyptian plan for Gaza takes shape",
      "\"Egypt is putting together a comprehensive, phased plan that seeks to rehabilitate Gaza,\" Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Tamim Khallaf told CBS News on Wednesday. \"The plan will span several years that would entail sequential phases of removing rubble and reconstruction.\"",
      "\"It will be conducted in a way to ensure that Palestinians in Gaza remain in their homeland,\" said Khallaf, adding that the plan \"will be operationally both realistic and workable.\"",
      "Funding for the herculean task of rebuilding Gaza will be a vital component of any plan for after the war. As of January, the U.N. and World Bank estimated that 72% of the territory's housing, 84% of its health facilities and 92% of its primary roads had been damaged or totally destroyed, and the bombing continued for another month from that point.",
      "Khallaf told CBS News that Egypt was \"in talks with the United Nations, through the U.N. Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza, to jointly organize an international conference in Egypt for early recovery and reconstruction in Gaza, which will be essential to provide emergency relief activities and secure necessary funds to see the plan come to fruition and restore life back to Gaza.\"",
      "The plan being discussed in Riyadh is expected to be officially endorsed at an Arab summit scheduled for March 4 in Cairo. The plan is also expected to garner backing from further afield. Many U.S. allies in Europe have firmly rejected Mr. Trump's call to relocate Gaza's population, but there has been no other offer of an alternative.",
      "Speaking Wednesday next to Spain's prime minister after they met in Madrid, el-Sissi said the leaders had \"emphasized the importance of the international community's support and adoption of the reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip, that does not involve the forcible displacement of the Palestinian people \u2014 again, without the displacement of the Palestinian people \u2014 from their land they so dearly cherish, and their ancestral homeland they will never abandon, and that ensures the immediate initiation of relief and early recovery operations.\"",
      "Egypt has grappled for a post-war solution for Gaza that would be acceptable to all parties since the conflict was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "It's unclear how much support a unified Arab stance, even with broader international support, might garner from Mr. Trump or his close ally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Without their backing, it's difficult to envision any proposal coming to fruition.",
      "\"Generational healing between Palestinians and Israelis is possible but can only transpire when Palestinians live in an independent state of their own,\" Khallaf told CBS News. \"We look forward to working with the U.S. administration in achieving the long-awaited peace in the region.\"",

    "story": [
      "Mexico will never tolerate an invasion of its national sovereignty by the United States, President Claudia Sheinbaum warned Thursday after Washington designated Mexican\u00a0drug cartels as terrorist organizations.",
      "\"This cannot be an opportunity for the U.S. to invade our sovereignty,\" she said. \"With Mexico it is collaboration and coordination, never subordination or interventionism, and even less invasion.\"",
      "On Wednesday, the Trump administration formally labeled eight cartels as terrorist groups. They include Mexico's two main drug trafficking organizations, the Jalisco New Generation and Sinaloa cartels.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order on his first day back in the White House saying that the cartels \"constitute a national-security threat beyond that posed by traditional organized crime.\"",
      "The move has raised speculation about possible military action.",
      "Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has been given a prominent role in the Trump administration, said on social media the designation \"means they're eligible for drone strikes.\"",
      "Experts, however, said that bombing Mexican cartels or sending troops over the border still appeared unlikely, although Mr. Trump's unpredictability makes it impossible to completely rule out.",
      "The idea \"used to be something that was found in a niche, very much on the fringes, and now it is at the center of the discussion,\" said Cecilia Farfan-Mendez, an analyst at the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation.",
      "In 2022, former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told \"60 Minutes\" that during his first term President Trump suggested firing missiles into Mexico to combat drug cartels there. Esper also said when he pushed back on the idea, Mr. Trump said, \"No one would know it was us.\"",
      "Mexico targets U.S. gun manufacturers",
      "Sheinbaum also said Thursday that Mexico would follow through on her promise to expand its legal action against U.S. gun manufacturers following Washington's decision to designate cartels as terrorist groups.",
      "The Mexican government accuses U.S. arms makers of negligence in the sale of weapons that end up in the hands of drug traffickers, and Sheinbaum said the lawsuit could lead to a new charge of alleged complicity with terrorist groups.",
      "An estimated 200,000 to half a million American firearms are smuggled into Mexico every year,\u00a0\"60 Minutes\" reported\u00a0in December.",
      "A 2023\u00a0CBS Reports\u00a0investigation found that dozens of cartel gunrunning networks, operating like terrorist cells, pay Americans to buy weapons from gun stores and online dealers all across the country, as far north as Wisconsin and even Alaska, according to U.S. intelligence sources. The firearms are then shipped across the southwest border through a chain of brokers and couriers.",
      "Mexico has already\u00a0filed a lawsuit\u00a0in the United States against U.S. arms manufacturers and vendors, claiming $10 billion in damages for their alleged role in criminal violence in the country.",
      "Earlier this month, Sheinbaum angrily\u00a0rejected an accusation by the United States\u00a0that her government has an alliance with drug cartels.",
      "\"We categorically reject the slander made by the White House against the Mexican government about alliances with criminal organizations,\" the president\u00a0wrote on social media\u00a0at the time.",
      "\"If there is such an alliance anywhere, it is in the U.S. gun shops that sell high-powered weapons to these criminal groups,\" she added.",
      "Last month, Sheinbaum launched a campaign to crack down on the number of weapons on the country's streets by\u00a0offering cash\u00a0to those who anonymously leave weapons at designated drop-off locations, including churches.",

    "story": [
      "Luis Rubiales, the former head of Spain's national soccer federation who sullied the women's team's World Cup victory in 2023 by planting an unwanted\u00a0kiss on player Jenni Hermoso's lips\u00a0during the medal ceremony, was found guilty Thursday of sexual assault for the act.",
      "Spain's High Court convicted Rubiales of assault for the forced kiss and fined him 10,800 euros ($11,300).",
      "Rubiales was also ordered to not come within 650 feet of Hermoso, and he cannot contact her for a year, under the court's order. His lawyer, Olga Tubau Martinez, announced shortly after the verdict that he would be appealing the court's decision.",
      "Rubiales was acquitted, alongside three other defendants, on the separate charge of coercion after Hermoso accused him of trying to force her to support him in the aftermath of the kiss, which became one of the biggest scandals in the history of Spanish soccer.",
      "Prosecutors had pushed for Rubiales to be imprisoned for two-and-a-half years.",
      "Hermoso, 34, who plays in the Mexican soccer league as well as for her national team, said she received death threats as the backlash against Rubiales, and what has been seen as institutional sexism in Spanish sports, grew.",
      "Rubiales and his supporters \u2014 including his mother, who went on a hunger strike in a church to protest the treatment of her son \u2014 were unapologetic, describing the kiss as \"a mutual and consented act,\" and calling those who disagreed \"idiots and stupid people.\"",
      "Rubiales pleaded not guilty to all of the charges, maintaining during the trial in Madrid that he was \"absolutely sure that she gave me her permission.\"",
      "During her testimony, Hermoso told the court that \"one of the happiest days of my life was tarnished, and I think it's very important for me to say that I never sought, much less expected, that this would happen. I think personally that it was a lack of respect.\"",
      "\"I'd spent years fighting to win titles for my team, like the World Cup,\" she said. \"But all that's happened to me means that I just haven't been able to enjoy any of it from the moment I set foot back in Madrid. I'm a world champion, but it seems that, even to this day, my life has been on standby. I honestly haven't been able to live freely.\"",

      "\"Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn't be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump inflated the amount of assistance the U.S. has sent to Ukraine since Russia's invasion in 2022. The U.S. has provided $66 billion in security assistance. In total, Congress has appropriated $175 billion in economic, humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine.",

Tuesday's bilateral pneumonia diagnosis would be a worrying turn for any 88-year-old, but it is of particular concern for the leader of the Catholic Church, who has long suffered from respiratory problems.",
      "Pope Francis rested well, woke up and ate breakfast Wednesday morning, the Vatican said. A source at the institution said the pontiff was not suffering heart problems and was breathing on his own, without the aid of a respirator. They said he was sitting up in an armchair at times, and it was understood that he's under strict orders from his medical team to rest.",
      "The Vatican said later Wednesday the pope was in stable condition and blood tests had shown a slight improvement, specifically with inflammation markers.",
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni visited Francis on Wednesday afternoon, and the two spoke privately for 20 minutes, the Vatican said. Close aides have also been bringing him documents to review and sign.",
      "Another source told CBS News that Francis had been making a number of phone calls, and he's also been receiving notes from well-wishers.",
      "People have been gathering outside Rome's Gemelli hospital to show their support, too, with many leaving messages and notes near a statue of former Pope John Paul II. The Vatican also shared a selection of photos Wednesday showing some of the drawings and notes of support that children being treated at Gemelli's pediatric oncology unit have sent to the pope.",
      "The pope has always kept a very busy schedule, and he appeared breathless at some of his public events earlier in the month, before being admitted to the hospital on Friday for what was first diagnosed as bronchitis.",
      "The new diagnosis confirmed on Tuesday, of pneumonia in both of his lungs, came a day after the Vatican said the pontiff had a polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract and that test results were \"indicative of a complex clinical picture that will require an adequate hospital stay.\"",
      "The Vatican said Tuesday that the pneumonia would require additional drug therapy. The illness was discovered after Francis underwent a CT scan of his chest on Tuesday afternoon, the Vatican said.",
      "The Vatican has said Francis is thankful for the \"closeness he feels at this moment\" from his supporters, and that he asked for people to pray for him.",
      "This is the pope's fourth hospitalization since he took over leadership of the Roman Catholic Church in 2013. He underwent significant\u00a0abdominal surgery in 2021 and then had another procedure in 2023 to repair scar tissue and an abdominal hernia. He had been hospitalized briefly for treatment for pneumonia earlier that year.",
      "As a young man in his home country of Argentina, Francis had part of one lung removed following a pulmonary infection, which left him vulnerable to respiratory illnesses.",
      "The Vatican has canceled an audience Francis was scheduled to have on Saturday and announced that he wouldn't celebrate Sunday Mass at St. Peter's Basilica, either.",
      "The pope's continuing hospitalization comes just over two weeks before the start of the annual Christian observance of Lent. The 40-day Lenten period begins on Ash Wednesday, which this year falls on March 5.",

      "Concern over a man who'd exhibited \"fixated behavior\" caused Emma Raducanu to approach the chair umpire in tears and take an unscheduled break in her second-round match at the Dubai Championships, the Women's Tennis Association said Wednesday. The incident unfolded three years after a man in Britain was convicted of stalking the star player at her family home.",
      "There'd been no immediate explanation Tuesday when the 2021 U.S. Open champion walked to the umpire after the second game, said a few words and then stood in a small space between the back of the official's chair and barrier netting adjacent to Court 2.",

      "On Wednesday, the WTA issued a statement explaining that Raducanu was approached in a public space Monday \"by a man who exhibited fixated behavior\" and \"this same individual was identified in the first few rows during Emma's match on Tuesday ... and subsequently ejected.\"",
      "\"He will be banned from all WTA events pending a threat assessment.\"",
      "The chair umpire called tournament organizers immediately when Raducanu reported her concerns in the first set of the night match, and Muchova walked over to console the 22-year-old British player.",
      "Raducanu then picked up a towel, wiped her face, nodded and continued the match. She didn't immediately comment on the incident.",
      "The WTA said it was working with Raducanu and her team \"to ensure her well-being and provide any necessary support\" and the Dubai Tennis Championships said it was collaborating with the WTA, BBC News reported.",

    "story": [
      "Marine experts have given up hope of rescuing more than 150 false killer whales that stranded on a remote beach on Australia's island state of Tasmania, officials said on Wednesday.",
      "Experts including veterinarians were at the scene near the Arthur River on Tasmania's northwestern coast where 157 whales were discovered on an exposed surf beach on Tuesday afternoon, the Department of Natural Resources and Environment said.",
      "Unfavorable ocean and weather conditions, which prevented the whales from being rescued on Wednesday, were forecast to persist for days, incident controller Shelley Graham said.",
      "\"We have been out in the water this morning and have relocated and attempted to refloat two whales but didn't have success as the ocean conditions weren't allowing the animals to get past the break. The animals are continuously restranding,\" Graham said in a statement.",
      "Marine biologist Kris Carlyon said the survivors would be euthanized.",
      "\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful,\" Carlyon said.",
      "The department said there were 136 survivors on Wednesday morning but that assessment was revised down to 90 within a few hours.",
      "The inaccessibility of the beach, ocean conditions and challenges to getting specialist equipment to the remote area complicated the response.",
      "The young whales weighed as little as 1,100 pounds, while the adults weighed over three tons each. Despite their name, false killer whales are one of the largest members of the dolphin family. The whales are large and slender, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and have prominent markings that can allow scientists to identify individuals. A subspecies in the United States is considered endangered. The animals also have strong social bonds and tend to travel in groups, NOAA said.",
      "The reasons for the beachings are unclear. Reasons could include disorientation caused by loud noises, illness, old age, injury, fleeing predators and severe weather.",
      "Clark declined to speculate on why the latest pod might have stranded. Carcasses of dead whales would be examined for clues, he said.",
      "A helicopter reconnaissance on Tuesday afternoon determined that there were no other whales within six miles of the stranded pod, he said.",
      "Some could have been stranded for as long as 48 hours by early Wednesday.",
      "Arthur River resident Jocelyn Flint said her son had discovered the stranded whales around midnight while fishing for shark.",
      "She said she had gone to the scene in the dark hours of the morning and returned after dawn but the whales were too big to be refloated.",
      "\"The water was surging right up and they were thrashing. They're just dying, they've sunk down in the sand,\" Flint said Wednesday morning. \"I think it's too late.",
      "\"There are little babies. Up one end, there's a lot of big ones. It's sad,\" she added.",
      "Department liaison officer Brendon Clark said the stranding was the first by false killer whales in Tasmania in since 1974. That was a pod of more than 160 whales that landed on a beach near Stanley on the northwest coast. Strandings in Tasmania are usually pilot whales.",
      "In early 2024, 29 long-finned pilot whales died and about 100 more were rescued after they were beached along the lower tip of Western Australia. In 2023, nearly 100 pilot whales were stranded on a beach in Western Australia. About half were rescued, but re-stranded only hours later. All of the whales wound up dead, CBS News previously reported. In 2022, 230 pilot whales stranded further south on the west coast at Macquarie Harbor. Only 35 survived.",
      "The largest mass stranding in Australian history occurred in the same harbor in 2020 when 470 long-finned pilot whales became stuck on sandbars. Most of the beached whales died on both occasions.",

    "story": [
      "Rio de Janeiro \u2014 Brazil's prosecutor-general on Tuesday formally charged former President Jair Bolsonaro with attempting a coup to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat, in a plot that included a plan to poison his successor and current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and kill a Supreme Court judge.",
      "Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet alleges that Bolsonaro and 33 others participated in a plan to remain in power. The alleged plot, he wrote, included a plan to poison Lula and shoot dead Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a foe of the former president.",
      "\"The members of the criminal organization structured a plan at the presidential palace to attack institutions, aiming to bring down the system of the powers and the democratic order, which received the sinister name of 'Green and Yellow Dagger,'\" Gonet wrote in a 272-page indictment. \"The plan was conceived and taken to the knowledge of the president, and he agreed to it.\"",
      "Bolsonaro is often seen in Brazil's yellow-and-green national soccer jersey and the colors have become associated with his political movement.",
      "Bolsonaro's defense team said it met the accusations with \"dismay and indignation,\" adding in a statement that the former \"President has never agreed to any movement aimed at deconstructing the democratic rule of law or the institutions that underpin it.\"",
      "Bolsonaro's son, Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, who is a senator, said on the social platform X that the indictment was \"empty\" and there was no evidence of wrongdoing. He accused the Prosecutor-General's Office of serving \"the nefarious interests of Lula.\"",
      "In November, Brazil's Federal Police filed a 884-page report with Gonet detailing the scheme. They allege a systematic effort to sow distrust in the electoral system, drafting a decree to provide legal cover for the plot, pressuring top military brass to go along with the plan and inciting a riot in the capital.",
      "In the indictment, Gonet described the alleged crimes as part of a chain of events articulated with an overarching objective of stopping Bolsonaro from leaving office, \"contrary to the result of the popular will at the polls.\"",
      "The Supreme Court will analyze the charges and, if accepted, Bolsonaro will stand trial.",
      "The far-right leader denies wrongdoing. \"I have no concerns about the accusations, zero,\" Bolsonaro told journalists earlier on Tuesday during a visit to the Senate in Brasilia.",
      "\"Have you seen the coup decree, by any chance? You haven't. Neither have I,\" he added.",
      "As well as participating in a coup d'\u00e9tat, the 34 defendants are accused of participating in an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, damage qualified by violence and serious threat against the state's assets, and deterioration of listed heritage, according to a statement from the Prosecutor General's press office.",
      "Gonet said the criminal organization he charged \"had as leaders the (then) president himself and his running mate, Gen. Braga Netto.\"",
      "\"Both accepted, stimulated, and performed acts that are described in our criminal legislation as attacking the existence and the Independence of (the branches) of power and of the democratic rule,\" Gonet wrote in his report.",
      "The crimes have varying penalties. If Bolsonaro is convicted of attempting a coup and the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, he could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison, according to the country's criminal code.",
      "The indictments, based on manuscripts, digital files, spreadsheets, and message exchanges, expose a scheme to disrupt democratic order, according to the prosecutor-general's office.",
      "The charges are \"historic,\" said Luis Henrique Machado, a criminal attorney and professor at the IDP university in Brasilia, adding that he expects the Supreme Court to accept the charges and put Bolsonaro on trial sometime before the end of next year.",
      "\"The charges show Brazil's institutions are robust, independent and agile,\" Machado said. \"They are a role model for other countries where democracy is at risk.\"",
      "Bolsonaro is barred from running in the 2026 election after judges with the country's top electoral court ruled that he abused his power and cast unfounded doubts on the country's electronic voting system.",
      "Following Tuesday's charges, Bolsonaro will \"position himself as a victim,\" said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. Bolsonaro has previously said his legal woes are an attempt to stop him from returning to office.",

      "\"The emotional impact on Ms. Lively has been extreme, not only affecting her, but her family, including her husband and four children. There are days when she has struggled to get out of bed, and she frequently chooses not to venture outside in public,\" the amended complaint, obtained by Fox News Digital, reads. \"While she has fought to maintain her personal life and business interests, behind closed doors she has suffered from grief, fear, trauma, and extreme anxiety. She also has been experiencing repeated and painful physical symptoms as a result of this experience.\"",
      "\"Mr. Reynolds, too, has been affected mentally, physically, and professionally by his wife\u2019s and children\u2019s pain,\" the complaint continues. \"Worst of all, however, has been the impact on their young children, who have been traumatized and emotionally uprooted in ways that have substantially impacted their well-being.\"",

      "The decision to highlight \"the emotional impact\" of the case on Lively days after the \"Gossip Girl\" star appeared at the star-studded celebration of \"Saturday Night Live's\" 50th anniversary was \"poorly timed,\" entertainment lawyer Camron Dowlatshahi told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"It seems a bit poorly timed to lodge this amended complaint just days after a very public appearance, especially when there is a focus on Ryan Reynolds\u2019 apparent emotional distress,\" Dowlatshahi, a partner at MSD Lawyers, added. \"He was the one joking around on \u2018SNL.\u2019\"",
      "Lively and Reynolds were given a deadline of Feb. 18 to file an amended complaint against Baldoni by Judge Lewis Liman.",
      "\"This makes even more clear that the public appearance was not a good idea,\" Dowlatshahi said. \"The attorneys included the phrase 'behind closed doors' in an attempt to explain the appearances, but typically, you don't want to be in a position to have to qualify and contextualize your client\u2019s actions \u2013 you simply advise them not to do certain things.\"",
      "BLAKE LIVELY VS. JUSTIN BALDONI: EVERYTHING TO KNOW",

      "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni starred together in \"It Ends With Us.\" (Getty Images)",
      "\"One can say it's an attempt to maximize\u00a0public empathy but, at the same time, if these allegations are proven true, it's Lively just expressing how she really feels,\" the branding expert said. \"Sometimes we think that celebrities have a magical, wonderful life, but they're a lot like the average person \u2013 they have families to take care of. People like Reynolds and Lively are under scrutiny 24-7 and the emotional toll from legal situations like this can hit a lot harder because everything is public knowledge. Lively admitting how devastating this has been for her family and yet, upping the ante in the battle, indicates that it must be worth fighting for.\"",

One may have assumed it was due to bruised egos. However, now because Blake Lively has amended\u00a0her complaint to include other women who alleged wrongdoing by Justin Baldoni, I think it's an indication that the matter is more serious than originally perceived.\"",

      "Legal experts agreed that Reynolds' joke at \"SNL50\" was mostly harmless.",
      "\"Reynolds does not have an analogous emotional distress claim against Baldoni, so his public appearances are not as harmful,\" Dowlatshahi told Fox News Digital. \"Lively being out in public and accepting invites to various events shows that she\u2019s not as emotionally distressed and that the impact to her career in terms of earnings and job prospects isn\u2019t necessarily as severe, as warranting hundreds of millions of dollars. Although Lively didn't say anything publicly, her presence and participation at the \u2018SNL\u2019 event potentially mitigates her emotional distress damages for her sexual harassment claim.\"",
      "\"So the more events she and Reynolds attend, the weaker her claims may become, which might ultimately help Baldoni,\" Dowlatshahi added.",
      "Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, pictured here in 2016, have four children together. (Tommaso Boddi/WireImage)",

      "\"They didn\u2019t amount to admissions, and really wouldn\u2019t have much of an effect on the merits of the case or damages,\" entertainment and media law attorney Tre Lovell said. However, the appearances could be \"very damaging\" in the court of public opinion.",
      "\"Clearly, both Lively and Reynolds\u2019 images have taken a hit from these lawsuits, injecting a lot of negativity and animus against them into the public arena. They need to be out there rehabilitating themselves and their persona,\" the lawyer at The Lovell Firm explained. \"They do this by being friendly and likable before the public. In other words, showing the personalities that got them favor from their fans in the first place. However, at the same time, they need to stay completely away from the lawsuit and never mock, demean, make fun of or comment on any of the facts. All references to the lawsuit should be made through their attorneys, and as far as they are concerned, they take the legal proceedings very seriously and intend on proving their case in court.

It\u2019s day one and we have an HR report already.\u2019\"",

Her underwhelming amended complaint is filled with unsubstantial hearsay of unnamed persons who are clearly no longer willing to come forward or publicly support her claims.\"",
      "\"Since documents do not lie and people do, the upcoming depositions of those who initially supported Ms. Lively\u2019s false claims and those who are witnesses to her own behavior will be enlightening,\" Freedman concluded. \"What is truly uncomfortable here is Ms. Lively\u2019s lack of actual evidence.\"",

Her underwhelming amended complaint is filled with unsubstantial hearsay of unnamed persons who are clearly no longer willing to come forward or publicly support her claims.\"",
      "\"Since documents do not lie and people do, the upcoming depositions of those who initially supported Ms. Lively\u2019s false claims and those who are witnesses to her own behavior will be enlightening,\" Freedman concluded. \"What is truly uncomfortable here is Ms. Lively\u2019s lack of actual evidence.\"",

      "\"The new filing also details that a Sony representative spoke to Baldoni about the concerns, and that Baldoni responded, including by reaching out to one of the other women who complained to reassure her that he heard her and promised to make adjustments. The complaint alleges that Mr. Baldoni didn\u2019t follow through on that promise, but did make the adjustment to hire a crisis management team, digital manipulation experts, litigators, and used those helpers to plan and execute the smear campaign described in her original lawsuit. In doing so, Blake has alleged, Baldoni hoped that if she or any other woman made their grievances public, nobody would believe them.\"",

It is because of the continued harassment and targeting of innocent bystanders that Ms Lively\u2019s Amended Complaint does not refer to certain victim-witnesses by name, nor does it quote directly from their texts or include screen shots. Importantly, however, these victim-witnesses have given Ms. Lively permission to share their communications in the Amended Complaint as they are laid out, and they will testify and produce documents in the discovery process.\"",

      "\"I'm not really sure why the dates are redacted\u2026 I understand why people could be redacted, I believe in certain privacy rights, but I'm not really clear on why dates would be redacted,\" Freedman said. \"So it'll be interesting to see what the dates are.\"",

      "Barriers to good health",
      "The biggest obstacle that is keeping Americans from living healthier lives, Prato said, is lack of motivation to make changes.",

      "The Trump administration is increasing pressure on Ukraine to broker a peace deal ending the conflict with Russia as President Donald Trump grows increasingly irritated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to the White House.",
      "National Security Advisor Mike Waltz on Thursday admitted that Trump\u2019s patience with Zelenskyy is running thin, and said that discussions Wednesday between U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg and Ukrainian officials focused on assisting Kyiv \"understand\" the war must come to a halt.",
      "\"President Trump is obviously very frustrated right now with President Zelenskyy, the fact that he hasn't come to the table, that he hasn't been willing to take this opportunity that we have offered,\" Waltz told reporters Thursday in a White House press briefing. \"I think he eventually will get to that point, and I hope so very quickly.\"",
      "\"It certainly isn't in Russia's interest or in the American people's interest for this war to grind on forever and ever and ever,\" Waltz said. \"So a key part of his conversation was helping President Zelenskyy understand this war needs to come to an end.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance on Thursday also defended the Trump administration's decision to meet with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, despite frustration from Ukraine that it was absent from those meetings. Vance stressed that communicating with Russia is key to advancing a deal, and said he believes Europe is on the \"cusp of peace\" for the first time in three years.",
      "\"How are you going to end the war unless you're talking to Russia?\" Vance said at the Conservative Political Action Conference near the nation's capital. \"You've got to talk to everybody involved in the fighting. If you actually want to bring the conflict to a close.\"",

      "The increased pressure on Ukraine to agree to a deal comes on the heels of several tense days between Trump and Zelenskyy, as each hurled insults back and forth toward one another after the meetings between U.S. and Russian officials.",

Republicans have their own problems passing such a plan in the House of Representatives because of the GOP\u2019s slim majority. Republicans must stick together. But in the Senate, Republicans have 53 seats. That\u2019s not enough to crack a filibuster on legislation. The bar there is 60. However, there\u2019s a way to overcome that obstacle: use a special process called \"budget reconciliation\" to bypass a filibuster and pass the bill.",

      "Democrats used budget reconciliation to clear filibuster hurdles to approve Obamacare in 2009-2010. Republicans deployed the reconciliation gambit to try to undo Obamacare in 2017. However, Republicans were more successful in approving President Trump\u2019s tax cuts later that year via reconciliation. The issue is that you must have a budget in place in order to use reconciliation in the Senate. And, the House and Senate must approve the same budget vehicle for reconciliation.",
      "Let me say that again: it has to be the same budget vehicle for reconciliation.",
      "That lays the groundwork. Here\u2019s what unfolded last week.",
      "House Republicans initially struggled to assemble a budget chassis for their eventual legislative plan. What they had to do first was construct and approve the legislative structure for this in the Budget Committee.",
      "That took a Herculean lift, but after six weeks of meetings, House Republicans finally advanced their plan through committee. It cuts $4.5 trillion in taxes, $2 trillion in \"mandatory\" spending (like entitlements) and lifts the debt limit by $4 trillion.",

      "The Senate Republican package didn\u2019t touch tax cuts. Instead, it bolstered military spending and infused the Department of Homeland Security and other related agencies with $175 billion to finish the border wall. It also increased energy production. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., long argued that voters elected President Trump and awarded Congressional Republicans the House and Senate because their message about border security resonated with them. Graham believes it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to deal with tax and spending cuts first. He says the border should be up first. Then move to other things.",

      "You\u2019ve undoubtedly heard the debate about, \"one bill, two bill.\" This is the crux of the debate between the House and Senate. The House wants to do one bill, or in the vernacular of the president, a \"big, beautiful bill.\" However, the Senate approach of focusing first on energy and the border - and leaving tax and spending cuts for later \u2013 naturally dictates doing two pieces of legislation.",
      "This is the parliamentary problem facing Republicans. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s one bill, two bill, red bill, blue bill. Yes. I know this sounds like Dr. Seuss. Passing one thing is a lot easier than approving two things in Congress. And it\u2019s far from clear that House Republicans can even pass their sole bill that just came out of committee.",
      "Graham forged ahead with his bill in committee \u2013 the day before the House Budget Committee could even meet. That created the very real possibility that the Senate could jam the House with its \"one bill\" because the House may never approve its own framework on the floor.",

      "This onerous exercise is to craft a legislative product which enables Republicans to bypass a Senate filibuster later. However, the proposal must be fiscal in nature and not add to the deficit over a ten-year period.",
      "Here\u2019s something important to know.",
      "The mechanics just spelled out creates nothing more than a shell. This is the legislative chassis I referred to earlier. Both the House and Senate must have this in place to eventually debate substantive and \"binding\" provisions of legislation down the road \u2013 be it border security or massive tax cuts. No \"chassis,\" then no final bill.",
      "So, this is an important phase in moving the president\u2019s agenda. But not the end result.",
      "Remember what I said about House Republicans writing their bill to appeal to conservatives on the Budget Committee? The maneuver by the GOP brass was to specifically pry a plan out of committee. But adopting that budget proposal on the House floor - let alone the final bill \u2013 is a challenge. Some conservatives don\u2019t think the bill cuts enough. Some moderates worry about blowing a hole in the deficit with the tax cuts. High-tax state Republicans \u2013 like those from New York and California \u2013 may be loath to support the package if it fails to address SALT. That\u2019s the reduction on state and local taxes.",

      "One option Republicans are talking about is offsetting some of the tax cuts with money brought in via tariffs. It\u2019s argued they could bring in up to $1 trillion in tariffs annually. But the total goods imported was only a little over $3 trillion.",
      "There is no plan right now to slap a 33% tariff on all goods. So that figure seems to be ambitious.",

Favorably, even. But it\u2019s something the Congressional Budget Office would not evaluate unless it was part of the legislation.",

    "summary": "Major IoT data breach: Mars Hydro database with 2.7 billion records exposed. Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson says the breach is a reminder of the risks that come with using IoT devices.",
    "story": [
      "Data breaches keep happening, and too often they come down to companies failing to take cybersecurity seriously. Some of the biggest breaches have been caused by negligence, and now there\u2019s another major one to add to the list. Mars Hydro, a Chinese company that makes Internet of Things (IoT) devices like LED lights and hydroponics equipment, left a massive database unprotected online. As a result, 2.7 billion records were exposed to anyone who knew where to look.",
      "Stay protected & informed! Get security alerts & expert tech tips\u2014sign up for Kurt\u2019s The CyberGuy Report now",
      "Illustration of IoT devices (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happened?",
      "Mars Hydro, a Chinese manufacturer of IoT devices, suffered a massive data breach after a publicly accessible, unprotected database containing nearly 2.7 billion records was discovered online. The 1.17-terabyte database was not password-protected or encrypted, exposing a massive amount of sensitive information related to the company\u2019s smart devices, including LED grow lights and hydroponic equipment.",
      "The database contained logging, monitoring and error records for IoT devices sold worldwide. Among the exposed data were Wi-Fi network names (SSIDs), Wi-Fi passwords, IP addresses, device ID numbers and other details linked to user devices and the Mars Pro IoT software application. Plus, internal records referenced LG-LED SOLUTIONS LIMITED, a California-registered company, as well as Spider Farmer, which produces agricultural equipment.",
      "Security researcher\u00a0Jeremiah Fowler identified the database and immediately sent a responsible disclosure notice to LG-LED SOLUTIONS and Mars Hydro. Within hours, public access to the database was restricted.",
      "It remains unclear how long the database was publicly accessible or whether any unauthorized parties accessed the data before its restriction. The only way to confirm potential access or misuse would be through an internal forensic audit, but no such investigation has been publicly disclosed.",
      "Illustration of using an app to access smart home devices (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Should you be worried?",
      "The unprotected database contained highly sensitive user and device information, including SSIDs and passwords stored in plain text, which could allow unauthorized users to access home networks. Although the researcher did not indicate that any personally identifiable information was exposed, the presence of network credentials, IP addresses, device ID numbers and data about smartphones running the IoT software raises serious security concerns.",
      "The exposed credentials could theoretically enable an attacker to connect to the network, compromise other devices, intercept data or even launch targeted cyberattacks. This risk is particularly troubling, given the broader vulnerabilities within the IoT industry.",
      "According to a threat report by Palo Alto Networks, 57% of IoT devices across all industries are considered highly vulnerable, and an alarming 98% of data transmitted by these devices is unencrypted. The report further found that 83% of connected devices operate on outdated or unsupported operating systems, leaving them susceptible to attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities.",
      "This incident underscores a recurring problem in the IoT sector: poor security practices, weak data protection and the absence of encryption. Without proactive security measures, such breaches will likely continue, exposing users to risks that extend beyond just their IoT devices, potentially compromising entire home or business networks.",
      "Illustration of a IoT device (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "FROM TIKTOK TO TROUBLE: HOW YOUR ONLINE DATA CAN BE WEAPONIZED AGAINST YOU",
      "6 ways you can protect yourself",
      "If you own a Mars Hydro device or use the Mars Pro app, take the following steps to protect your data and secure your network:",
      "1) Change your Wi-Fi password: Since Wi-Fi network names and passwords were stored in plain text, the first step is to update your router password immediately.\u00a0Even if you believe your credentials were not directly exposed, it\u2019s best to assume otherwise. A strong password should be complex, combining upper and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using simple or easily guessable passwords, such as your name, address or basic numerical sequences.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): If your router supports\u00a0two-factor authentication, enabling it adds an extra layer of security. This ensures that even if someone gains access to your login credentials, they would still need a secondary authentication code \u2013 typically sent via text message or an authentication app \u2013 to log in. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "3) Monitor your network for unusual activity: With Wi-Fi credentials and IP addresses exposed, attackers could attempt to access your network remotely. Checking your router\u2019s admin panel regularly to review connected devices is an important security measure. If you notice an unfamiliar device, remove it immediately and change your Wi-Fi password again.",
      "4) Keep your devices updated: IoT devices are notorious for running outdated or unsupported software, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Regularly\u00a0updating the firmware and software of your smart devices ensures that you receive the latest security patches. Check your device settings for available updates and install them as soon as they are released. Keeping your router\u2019s firmware updated is equally important, as routers are a primary target for hackers.",
      "5) Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: Hackers may try to exploit the data from this breach by launching phishing attacks. If you receive an email claiming to be from Mars Hydro or LG-LED SOLUTIONS, urging you to reset your password or provide personal details, be cautious. Cybercriminals often create fake login pages designed to steal credentials. Do not click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Remove your exposed data from data brokers:\u00a0With 2.7 billion records exposed, your personal and network information may already be circulating among data brokers \u2013 companies that collect and sell user data, often without consent. Hackers and scammers use these databases to launch phishing attacks, identity theft scams and targeted cyber intrusions.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Mars Hydro breach is yet another reminder of the security risks that come with IoT devices. Companies need to do a better job of protecting user data, but at the end of the day, it is up to you to secure your own network. Updating passwords, enabling two-factor authentication and keeping an eye on your connected devices can make a big difference in keeping your data safe and your smart home secure.",

      "Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to discuss bank scams and a self-driving car that trapped a rider inside.",
      "Tech support scams have been around for years, but a new variant called the Phantom Hacker scam is rapidly gaining traction. It has cost victims, primarily older Americans, over $500 million since 2023. This scam is particularly deceptive because it unfolds in three carefully orchestrated phases and uses AI-powered social engineering tactics to avoid detection. Attackers leverage caller ID spoofing and AI-generated voices to make their scheme more persuasive, but there are ways to protect yourself.",

      "How the phantom hacker scam works",
      "As\u00a0highlighted by the FBI, the scam begins with the tech support impostor phase. You might receive a call, email, text or even a pop-up on your computer warning you that your device has been compromised. The message urges you to call a customer support number for assistance. Once you do, a scammer posing as\u00a0tech support claims that hackers have targeted your accounts. To \"help,\" they instruct you to download remote access software, allowing them to take control of your computer. Under the guise of scanning for threats, they trick you into revealing your financial accounts, setting up the next phase of the scam.",
      "Next comes the financial institution impostor phase. Another scammer, pretending to be from your bank or investment firm, calls to warn that a foreign hacker has infiltrated your accounts. They advise moving your money to a \"safe\" government-protected account, often using wire transfers, cryptocurrency or cash deposits. They might also insist on keeping the transaction confidential, claiming it\u2019s necessary for security reasons.",
      "In the final U.S. government impostor phase, a third scammer impersonates a federal official \u2013 often from the Federal Reserve \u2013 who pressures you to act quickly. If you start doubting the scheme, they may send you an official-looking email or document to convince you that the transfer is legitimate. By the time victims realize they\u2019ve been tricked, their money is gone, often sent overseas beyond the reach of U.S. authorities.",

      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAMS",
      "How AI is making things worse",
      "AI is making scams like the Phantom Hacker scam more deceptive and harder to spot. Scammers are using AI-powered chatbots to automate their schemes. Instead of relying on human operators, they can now deploy AI-driven responses that sound natural and convincing.",
      "AI-generated\u00a0deepfake voices are also being used to impersonate bank officials and government representatives. With just a short audio sample, scammers can clone a voice to make their calls seem even more authentic. This means a victim might hear what sounds like their bank manager or an official from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Email scams are also becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can craft messages that mimic the tone and style of official communications. Scammers can even generate fake but realistic-looking documents with official letterheads to convince victims that the scam is legitimate.",

      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "7 ways to protect yourself",
      "The best way to defend yourself against the Phantom Hacker scam is to stay informed, be cautious and follow these steps:",
      "1) Ignore unsolicited messages: Scammers often send pop-ups, text messages or emails claiming that your computer is infected or that your bank account is at risk. These messages may look official, but they are designed to create panic and pressure you into taking immediate action. Never click on links or attachments from unknown senders, as they may contain malware or lead to phishing websites that steal your personal information.",
      "2)\u00a0Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Verify phone numbers before calling: If you receive an unexpected message urging you to call tech support, do not use the number provided in the message. Instead, visit the official website of the company in question and find their customer support contact information. Scammers often create fake websites or use\u00a0caller ID spoofing to make their phone numbers appear legitimate, so always double-check before making a call.",
      "4) Avoid downloading unknown software: No reputable company will ever ask you to install remote access tools unless you have specifically reached out for tech support. Scammers use these programs to take control of your computer, monitor your activity and access sensitive information. If someone unexpectedly asks you to download software to \"fix a problem\" or \"protect your account,\" it is likely a scam.",
      "5) Never give control of your device to a stranger: If you allow a scammer to remotely access your computer, they can view your personal files, log your keystrokes and manipulate your accounts without your knowledge. Legitimate customer support representatives will never request remote access unless you have initiated the support request through an official company channel. If someone insists on taking control of your device, hang up immediately.",
      "6) Be skeptical of urgent financial warnings: The U.S. government will never contact you unexpectedly and demand that you move your money to a \"safe account.\" They will also never ask you to wire funds, purchase gift cards or send cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Scammers create a false sense of urgency to trick victims into acting before they can think critically about the situation. If someone claims to be from a bank or government agency and pressures you to move money, stop and verify their identity through official channels.",
      "7) Invest in personal data removal services: Scammers often gather information from data broker websites to make their scams more convincing. Your name, phone number, home address and even financial history may be publicly available without your knowledge. Consider using a data removal service to regularly scan and request the removal of your personal information from these databases. This reduces the chances of scammers targeting you with highly personalized attacks. You can also manually opt out of major data broker sites, but using a service automates the process and keeps your information protected over time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Yurts founder and CEO Ben Van Roo breaks down concerns over DeepSeek on 'The Will Cain Show.'",
      "Apple devices are believed to be pretty secure, and that's what the company will tell you. You might have seen the tagline \"Privacy. That\u2019s Apple.\" in their promotions.",
      "However, the tech landscape is changing, and even Apple products aren\u2019t beyond cybercriminals\u2019 reach.",
      "A new report suggests Mac users will need to be more vigilant this year because AI advancements are helping hackers breach even the most secure systems. I have\u00a0consistently reported on how Mac malware is targeting users, and experts now believe this will only get worse.",

      "The rise of cyberattacks on Apple devices",
      "Mac malware is not what it used to be. For years, the biggest threats were annoying adware and browser hijackers, more of a nuisance than a real danger. But that is changing fast. As highlighted by\u00a0Malwarebytes, a new wave of information stealers is taking over, and they are far more dangerous, going after passwords, authentication cookies, credit card details and even cryptocurrency.",
      "This shift started in mid-2023 with the arrival of\u00a0Atomic Stealer, also known as AMOS, a piece of malware that looked much more like something you would see on Windows than the typical Mac threats. AMOS was not just effective. It was easy to use and sold as a service \u00a0for $1,000 a month with a slick web-based control panel. That success led to the rise of even more dangerous variants.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "One of them,\u00a0Poseidon, launched in mid-2024 and quickly became the dominant Mac stealer, responsible for 70% of infections. It can drain over 160 different cryptocurrency wallets, steal passwords from browsers and password managers and even grab VPN credentials.",
      "At the same time, cybercriminals have doubled down on\u00a0malvertising, using fake ads on Google and Bing to trick users into downloading malware instead of real software. These campaigns are highly targeted, allowing attackers to pinpoint Mac users and serve fake downloads based on their searches. With AI now being used to create and execute many of these attacks, they are likely to increase in scale.",

      "While Mac malware is evolving, the situation on Android is even more alarming. Phishing attacks on the platform have reached staggering levels, with thousands of malicious apps designed to steal credentials and bypass security measures.",
      "So far in 2024, researchers have detected 22,800 phishing-capable apps, alongside 3,900 apps designed to read OTPs from notification bars and 5,200 apps capable of extracting OTPs from SMS messages. These numbers highlight how widespread and effective Android phishing malware has become.",
      "Just like phishing emails, phishing apps trick users into handing over their usernames, passwords and two-factor authentication codes. Once stolen, these credentials can be sold or used for fraud,\u00a0identity theft or further\u00a0cyberattacks. Because phishing apps require minimal code and fewer permissions than traditional malware, they are much easier to sneak onto app stores, including Google Play.",
      "Many phishing apps look like regular, fully functional software. Some impersonate games or utilities, while others appear as cracked versions of popular apps like TikTok, WhatsApp or Spotify. Some stay dormant for days to avoid detection before launching their attacks. Others rely on ad functionality to redirect users to phishing sites, making the malicious code harder to trace.",
      "Google Play Protect, which is built-in malware protection for Android devices, automatically removes known malware. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices.",

      "1. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "2. Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store, Google Play Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS, Android and all installed applications are up to date. Apple and Android frequently release security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS, Android and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here. It generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The days when Mac users could assume they were safe are long gone. Cybercriminals are evolving their tactics, with Mac malware shifting from simple adware to advanced information stealers. Android phishing apps are also becoming harder to detect and more widespread than ever. From stealing passwords and authentication cookies to intercepting OTPs and draining cryptocurrency wallets, these threats are growing in both sophistication and scale. No platform is immune, and as cybercriminals continue refining their techniques, users and organizations must stay ahead with strong security measures.",

      "The financial toll is staggering \u2014 scams cost Americans over $159 billion annually, with average individual losses now exceeding $3,500 per victim. This epidemic is not just a financial crisis but also a human rights issue, as many scams originate from forced labor operations in Southeast Asia.",

      "The mechanics of \"pig butchering\"",
      "One of the most pervasive scams today is the so-called \"pig butchering\" scheme. Originating in China and spreading across Southeast Asia, this scam involves criminals building trust with victims through social media or messaging apps. Once trust is established, victims are lured into fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes. These scams are meticulously crafted to appear legitimate, often involving fake trading platforms and simulated profits. Victims are encouraged to invest more until they are \"slaughtered,\" losing their\u00a0entire savings when the scammers vanish with their funds.",
      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "Forced labor behind these scam centers",
      "What makes these scams even more horrifying is their reliance on human trafficking. Criminal syndicates in countries like Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos force trafficked individuals to run these operations under threat of violence. These \"scam centers\" operate in lawless regions controlled by rebel groups or corrupt officials, making international intervention challenging.

      "BEST PRESIDENT\u2019S DAY DEALS",
      "Why America is a prime target",
      "Cyberscams have taken hold in the U.S. for several reasons that make it particularly vulnerable. As an American, you\u2019re likely connected to the digital world through social media platforms, messaging apps and other online tools. This high level of connectivity makes it easier for scammers to reach you directly, whether through a text message, email or social media chat. The sheer number of people online in the U.S. creates a vast pool of potential targets for cybercriminals.",
      "Additionally, the growing popularity of cryptocurrency in the U.S. has made it a\u00a0prime medium for fraud. Cryptocurrency transactions are fast, anonymous and difficult to trace, which makes them ideal for scammers looking to steal funds without leaving a trail. Many scams are designed to exploit this lack of transparency, leaving victims with little chance of recovering their money once it\u2019s gone.",
      "Another major issue is the lack of a centralized reporting system for cyberscams in the U.S. If you\u2019ve ever been scammed or know someone who has, you might have noticed how confusing it can be to figure out where to report the crime \u2014 whether to the FBI, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or another agency. This fragmented system not only makes it harder for victims to seek help but also prevents authorities from gathering comprehensive data to tackle the problem effectively. These factors combined have made Americans some of the most targeted individuals in the world when it comes to cyberscams.",

      "Several countries have implemented innovative measures to combat cyberscams, offering valuable lessons for the U.S. Singapore, for instance, has introduced a mandatory SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) that requires organizations to register their alphanumeric Sender IDs. This system effectively blocks unregistered SMS senders, significantly reducing impersonation scams. In fact, cases involving scam SMSes in Singapore fell by 70% over three months after mandating the SSIR.",
      "Britain has taken a different approach by establishing a dedicated \"159\" hotline, allowing residents to instantly verify suspicious calls. This simple yet effective system provides a quick way for individuals to check the legitimacy of unexpected communications, potentially preventing many scams before they occur.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Many nations have also implemented stricter authentication measures, such as biometric checks and in-app verifications, which have proven highly effective in reducing fraud. For example, Singapore has required facial verification for higher-risk transactions through Singpass since 2022, resulting in no further reports of malware-enabled scams involving unauthorized CPF withdrawals since its implementation in June 2023.",
      "Some countries are exploring ways to slow down cryptocurrency transactions or cap transfer amounts, which could significantly hinder scammers who rely on quick, anonymous transfers. These measures, combined with a coordinated global response involving major victim nations like the U.S. and China, could prove instrumental in dismantling criminal networks more effectively.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has not fully complied with a court order pausing the freezing of foreign assistance grants and contracts, a federal judge ruled Thursday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali last week ordered the administration to allow the disbursement of U.S. foreign assistance after hearing claims from federal contractors challenging an executive order signed by President Donald Trump pausing nearly all foreign assistance.",
      "Ali determined that a \"blanket suspension of congressionally appropriated foreign aid\" had caused irreparable harm to the contractors and was likely not allowed under the Administrative Procedure Act.",
      "Earlier this week, the administration said in a notice of compliance that the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development had reviewed the thousands of contracts and grants it had canceled as part of the aid freeze and determined that \u201csubstantially all\u201d of the terminations were allowed under the terms of the contracts.",

      "The judge said the Trump administration has yet to offer evidence to rebut the charge that its blanket suspension of foreign aid will cause irreparable harm or that it has fully considered the implications the pause could have on interests that rely on the aid.",
      "\"The Court stands prepared to consider such arguments and evidence at the preliminary injunction stage,\" Ali wrote. \"However, to the extent Defendants have continued the blanket suspension, they are ordered to immediately cease it.\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican-controlled Senate began a series of votes Thursday on a party-line vehicle to pass a $340 billion budget blueprint designed to boost funding for President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement efforts, energy production and the military.",
      "They planned to grind it out in a \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d that\u2019s expected to continue into the early hours of Friday morning. Eventually, they expect to approve the measure along party lines. Republicans have 53 senators and just one of them, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., voted against proceeding to the budget, along with all Democrats.",
      "\u201cWithout this bill passing,\u201d said Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., \u201cthere is no hope of getting money for the border.\u201d",
      "The Senate plan conflicts with a budget plan making its way through the Republican-controlled House, which also includes a $4.5 trillion tax cut and a $4 trillion debt limit hike. Trump has endorsed the House version, but GOP senators have indicated that their version could be a fallback plan if the House blueprint fails.",
      "\u201cTo my House colleagues: We will all get there together. If you can pass the one big, beautiful bill that makes the tax cuts permanent \u2014 not four or five years \u2014 then we\u2019ll all cheer over here. Nothing would please me more than Speaker [Mike] Johnson being able to put together the bill that President Trump wants. I want that to happen, but I cannot sit on the sidelines and not have a plan B,\u201d Graham said on the Senate floor Thursday, before voting began.",
      "Paul said the budget contradicts GOP rhetoric about reducing spending.",
      "\u201cIf we were fiscally conservative, why wouldn\u2019t we take the savings from Elon Musk and DOGE and move it over here and help with the border?\u201d Paul said on the Senate floor. \u201cWhy would we be doing a brand new bill to increase spending by $340 billion?\u201d",
      "Under the process, Senate rules allow for members to propose an unlimited number of amendments.",
      "Democrats sought to force Republicans to take difficult votes through amendments, which the majority party voted down one by one. Many were aimed at protecting benefits and programs they say the GOP is targeting for cuts. One amendment proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would have prohibited the bill from cutting taxes for the wealthy if even $1 is cut from Medicaid, a health care program for low-income Americans.",
      "It was rejected 49-51, with just two Republicans joining Democrats in favor of it: Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Josh Hawley, R-Mo.",
      "If the Senate passes the budget resolution, it would instruct committees to craft legislation that satisfies its goals, which can be fast-tracked to the floor and passed by a simple majority.",
      "The measure seeks $175 billion for immigration and border enforcement, on the request of the Trump administration\u2019s border czar Tom Homan. And it calls for expanding the military by $150 billion, even as Trump and Elon Musk say they want to cut costs at the Pentagon.",
      "The \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d process allows members to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, but it limits provisions to spending and taxes. Democrats can challenge policies that run afoul of the \u201cByrd rule\u201d constraints and call on the Senate parliamentarian to strip them out.",
      "For months, Republicans in the House and Senate have clashed over whether the party should try to pass Trump\u2019s legislative priorities in one reconciliation bill or two.",
      "But on Wednesday, Trump gave a full-throated endorsement to the House's strategy, taking to Truth Social to say he wanted \u201cONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL\u201d and urging the Senate to pump the brakes on their two-bill reconciliation push. The House plan calls for a sweeping package that includes border enforcement, expanding energy production, and renewing the expiring 2017 Trump tax cuts.",
      "The Senate plan would be narrower and would not include renewing the tax cuts that were a signature accomplishment of Trump's first term. Instead, those tax cuts would come in a second reconciliation package later this year, senators have said.",
      "If the House and Senate can get on the same page and pass an identical budget resolution, that would only be the start of a very long and complicated legislative process. In the House, conservatives are demanding steep spending cuts while more moderate Republicans are getting skittish due to potential cuts to Medicaid.",
      "\u201cThe budget resolution is just patty cake. The real work begins when you start putting together the bill and the pay-fors,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a member of both the Budget and Appropriations committees. \u201cThe only prediction I\u2019ll make is that a reconciliation bill will not pass either the House or the Senate without substantial spending reductions.\u201d",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who met with senators this week, said he believed Congress is \u201con track\u201d to pass a reconciliation package in May or June, while acknowledging that was an ambitious timeline.",
      "\u201cI think the president has learned a lot about how D.C. works. And\u00a0I actually talked to the president about this yesterday, and he said to me, \u2018Look, it\u2019s very rare that you can get two reconciliation bills done in one Congress,\u2019 which is why he thinks we\u2019ve got to do a lot with that one big beautiful bill,\u201d Vance said during an appearance Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s early, right? This stuff takes time to put together,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think if you had a record-pace reconciliation bill, we would get this thing done in May or in June. I think we\u2019re on track to do that.\u201d"

      "This article is part of \u201cDealing the Dead,\u201d a series investigating the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research.",
      "A Texas lawmaker horrified by an NBC News investigation into a medical school that profited from the bodies of the poor and vulnerable moved this week to ban the practice, introducing a bill that would make it illegal in the state to perform medical research on a corpse without explicit consent.",
      "The proposal is a direct response to NBC News\u2019 \u201cDealing the Dead\u201d series, which exposed how the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth took hundreds of unclaimed bodies from Dallas and Tarrant counties, cut them up and leased them out to medical device companies, other universities and the Army. Reporters discovered dozens of families who said they would have claimed their loved ones\u2019 bodies and given them proper funerals if they had been told. Some were still searching for their relatives, unaware that they had died.",
      "Sen. Tan Parker, who filed the bill in the Texas Legislature on Wednesday, said he had no idea what the Health Science Center had been doing until he saw NBC News\u2019 investigation in September. The findings outraged and disgusted him, he said.",
      "\u201cEvery Texan deserves dignity in life and death, and the right of families to decide how their loved ones\u2019 remains are handled must be protected,\u201d Parker, a Republican whose district includes portions of Dallas and Tarrant counties, said in a statement. \u201cNo family should ever have to worry that the remains of their loved ones could be taken, dismembered, and leased out without any effort to notify the next of kin. This legislation puts an end to that practice once and for all, ensuring Texas law upholds the highest ethical standards and respects the dignity of every individual.\u201d",
      "In addition to the legislation, NBC News\u2019 reporting has sparked sweeping changes: The Health Science Center suspended its body donation program, fired the officials who led it and said it would stop accepting unclaimed bodies. Boston Scientific and other medical device and research companies, as well as the Army, said they would rethink their arrangements with the center and take steps to ensure they would not use unclaimed bodies in the future. Members of Congress sought answers, and officials in Tarrant County adopted a policy to ensure unclaimed bodies were treated with dignity.",
      "The reporting also brought answers to families who had been left in the dark about what happened to their loved ones. Tim Leggett learned from NBC News last year that his brother Dale, 71, a World War II history buff, had died alone at a hospital in Tarrant County in May 2023. Without notifying Leggett, the county medical examiner provided his brother\u2019s body to the Health Science Center, which shipped his remains out of state to a for-profit medical education company. He applauded Parker\u2019s effort to ban the practice.",
      "\u201cThere is right and wrong, especially when it comes to how we treat each other, whether it\u2019s while we\u2019re alive or deceased,\u201d said Leggett, who was finally able to obtain his brother\u2019s ashes after seeing his name on a list NBC News and Noticias Telemundo published. \u201cThis bill is definitely another good step in making sure this doesn\u2019t happen to any other families.\u201d",
      "Leggett and nearly a dozen other families learned what happened to their relatives from NBC News and Noticias Telemundo reporters. Six of those families found their relative\u2019s name on the list the news outlets published.",
      "Kimberly Patman, who was told by NBC News that the body of her ex-husband, Victor Honey, was cut up and leased out, also said she welcomed Parker\u2019s bill.",
      "\u201cI am very thankful for them moving forward so that what happened to Victor and the other individuals won\u2019t ever happen again,\u201d Patman said.",
      "Honey, a homeless Army veteran who struggled with mental illness, died in Dallas in 2022 without anyone notifying his family. The Health Science Center then dissected his body and leased parts to two medical companies and the Army. After learning of his death last spring, his family buried his cremated remains at the Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery. The experience shook Patman, along with Honey\u2019s adult children and siblings.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t fully grasp the impact unless it has happened to your family,\u201d Patman said.",
      "Parker said his bill would prohibit the donation of an unclaimed body to a medical school or private body broker unless the person agreed to the donation before their death \u2014\u00a0or if permission is given by next of kin.",
      "If adopted, the measure would prevent a repeat of the Health Science Center\u2019s actions.",
      "It would also make Texas one of the few states to clearly ban research on the unclaimed dead \u2014\u00a0those whose families can\u2019t afford to make funeral arrangements or can\u2019t be reached. The practice is legal in most states but is increasingly viewed as unethical by anatomists and leaders in the body donation industry who say doctors and scientists should handle the dead with the same respect shown to living patients.",
      "Officials in North Texas justified sending unclaimed bodies to the Health Science Center by saying the deals saved local governments the cost of burials and cremations, helped train students and doctors and supported lifesaving research. But NBC News found that medical examiner\u2019s offices in Dallas and Tarrant counties, and staff at the Health Science Center, failed to contact relatives who were reachable before declaring the bodies unclaimed.",
      "More from 'Dealing the Dead'",
      "The University of North Texas Health Science Center built a flourishing business using unclaimed corpses. When Aurimar Iturriago Villegas was murdered, her corpse became a commodity in the U.S. body trade.

      "A disgraced chiropractor found a new job selling bodies, then was accused of mishandling them.",
      "Through thousands of pages of documents and data obtained via public records requests, reporters determined that Dallas and Tarrant counties sent about 2,350 unclaimed bodies to the Health Science Center since 2019, more than 830 of which \u2014 advertised as being of \u201cthe highest quality found anywhere in the U.S.\u201d \u2014\u00a0were selected for dissection and study. The center charged medical device and training companies $649 for heads, $330 for a pair of feet and $1,400 for a whole body. The body trade helped bring the center about $2.5 million a year.",
      "The dead included military veterans, people who struggled with drug addiction and mental illness and a young murder victim; while some had fallen out of touch with their relatives, their families said they loved and missed them and would have come forward to claim their body if they\u2019d known they were dead.",
      "After NBC News shared its findings with the Health Science Center, the school offered condolences to families and acknowledged the problems reporters uncovered. \u201cAs a result of the information brought to light through your inquiries, it has become clear that failures existed in the management and oversight of The University of North Texas Health Science Center\u2019s Willed Body Program,\u201d the center said in a statement last year.",
      "Parker\u2019s bill, which could be subject to revisions as it makes its way through the Legislature, will next be debated in a Texas Senate committee. Parker\u2019s office said it was working to get a companion bill filed in the Texas House and hoped to win bipartisan support.",
      "Eli Shupe, a bioethicist at the University of Texas at Arlington, said Parker\u2019s bill would herald a \u201clandmark shift\u201d in protecting corpses from misuse. Shupe began speaking against the Health Science Center\u2019s use of unclaimed bodies when she first learned of the practice just over three years ago.",
      "\u201cTexas would essentially go from a state that\u2019s recently been singled out for ethically unsavory practices to a model for others to follow,\u201d she said. \u201cVery few states have legislation like this. We would be a real leader in the country.\u201d"

      "An overtime goal from Connor McDavid sealed the 3-2 win for Canada at the TD Garden Arena in Boston, where ticket prices soared in the days ahead of the hotly anticipated finale.",
      "The result was the culmination of a midseason tournament that featured stars from Canada, Finland, Sweden and the United States. Recognized as one of the biggest international hockey games in years, Thursday\u2019s matchup could be a preview of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan Cortina, which will feature NHL players for the first time since 2014.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s just a quick tournament and it\u2019s not an Olympic gold medal or anything like that but it means the world to our group,\u201d McDavid said on ESPN after the win. \u201cWe worked so hard all week. It\u2019s special.\u201d",
      "Canada got on the board first 4:48 into the first period. Nathan MacKinnon skated towards the middle of the ice and fired a wrist shot through a sea of players that beat American goaltender Connor Hellebuyck up high.",
      "The U.S. evened the action with 3:08 remaining in the period. Auston Matthews tried to wrap around the goal for a shot but couldn\u2019t control the puck. It instead landed at the feet of Brady Tkachuk, who poked it into the net on a deflection.",
      "The U.S. took its first lead 7:31 into the second period. After a slapshot by Zach Werenski was blocked, it fell to Matthews. He tried to pass the puck across the goal but it was deflected to Jake Sanderson, who put it home on a snapshot. It was his first goal of the tournament.",
      "Canada tied it up with six minutes remaining in the second period. Mitch Marner found Sam Bennett up the left wing, who fired in a wrist shot past Hellebuyck.",
      "McDavid won it 8:18 into overtime on a one-timer off an assist from Marner.",
      "McDavid, the Edmonton Oilers superstar widely considered the best player in the NHL, called his play up until that point in the game \"not very good.\"",
      "\"All that was going through my mind was keep going,\" he said postgame. \"I struggled all night but these guys played great and we found a way.\u201d",
      "The championship contest capped off the first best-on-best men\u2019s hockey tournament in nearly a decade, the last being the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. NHL players were not allowed to participate in the 2018 and 2022 Winter Olympics, though they will be returning for the 2026 Games.",
      "That fact raised the stakes for the 4 Nations tournament, which the NHL created as a replacement this season for the more traditional All-Star Game.",
      "Players who for years were starved for the chance to play meaningful games on behalf of their country now would be able to face-off for international bragging rights. So far, fans, players and executives have commented on how intense and high-quality the games have been."

    "story": [
      "The mayor of a city in Alabama has placed its entire police department on administrative leave, a day after officials announced that a grand jury had recommended the small department be abolished, saying it had \u201coperated as more of a criminal enterprise than a law enforcement agency\u201d and is \u201can ongoing threat to public safety.\u201d",
      "Jim Sawyer, the mayor of Hanceville, a city of about 3,200 roughly 45 miles north of Birmingham, said in a statement Thursday evening that after an \u201ceffective meeting\u201d with Cullman County Sheriff Matt Gentry, all employees of the police department will be placed on administrative leave effective 5 p.m. Thursday.",
      "Sawyer said all 911 and emergency calls will be routed directly to the sheriff\u2019s office, which will provide all law enforcement services to the city of Hanceville.",

      "The police department employed only eight officers as of August, when Marlin was sworn in as chief, according to The Cullman Times. A woman who answered the police department\u2019s dispatch line earlier Thursday said there was no one available to speak to a reporter about its size and that the department had no comment about anything. A message left at the chief\u2019s work voicemail was not immediately returned.",
      "\u201cThis is a sad day for law enforcement, but at the same time, it is a good day for the rule of law,\u201d Crocker said at the start of Wednesday\u2019s news conference, where he was joined by Gentry.",

      "The grand jury did not charge the officers in connection with the death of the dispatcher, Christopher Michael Willingham, 49, whose body was found in his office in August and ruled an accidental overdose from the \u201ccombined toxic effects of fentanyl\u201d and other drugs by the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences.",
      "But the grand jury said his death was \u201cthe direct result\u201d of the police department\u2019s \u201cnegligence, lack of procedure, general incompetence and disregard for human life,\u201d Crocker said.",
      "The revelations came after the Alabama State Bureau of Investigations probed Willingham\u2019s death.",
      "The grand jury also said the department had failed to account for, preserve and maintain evidence, and in doing so, had failed crime victims and the public at large, Crocker said, adding that some of the evidence was unusable. Crocker said any pending cases will go through a review process.",
      "The grand jury said the department \u201chas recently operated as more of a criminal enterprise than a law enforcement agency,\u201d that it \u201cis a particular and ongoing threat to public safety\u201d and that the indicted officers should be suspended by the Alabama Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission. Because of what the grand jury described as \u201ca rampant culture of corruption,\u201d the grand jury recommended that another agency be tasked with policing the city of Hanceville.",
      "Crocker said one of the most concerning things was that the police department\u2019s evidence room was not secure.",
      "\u201cCriminal evidence must be secured in order to have that evidence for prosecution and to ensure due process,\u201d he said. \u201cThis evidence room was anything but secure.\u201d",
      "He showed photos of a hole in the wall of the evidence room and a green broomstick that he said was used to \u201cjimmy open\u201d the door.\u00a0 Crocker said the grand jury had watched \u201ca lot of videos\u201d from security camera footage that showed the evidence room was routinely accessed by individuals who were not authorized to do so.",
      "The grand jury toured the Hanceville jail on Feb. 12 and were left with no confidence in the police department\u2019s ability to maintain a jail or to meet the basic health and safety needs of jail personnel or inmates, Crocker said.",
      "Sawyer, the mayor, said in a statement Wednesday that the city would fully cooperate with all investigations into the police department. Sawyer also said the city council will consider the grand jury\u2019s recommendations \u201cand act swiftly and decisively to address the problems\u201d within it.",
      "Sawyer also said he had spoken with the district attorney and agreed that there should be an audit of the contents of the evidence room. Sawyer said in the statement that he could not comment further, citing the ongoing investigations.",
      "Messages left for Sawyer at his office and personal numbers were not immediately returned.",
      "Gentry, who also attended Wednesday\u2019s news conference, said all of the defendants had been released on bond.",

      "\"Sam may be alive today if they would have done their jobs,\" she said through tears.",
      "The Canandaigua Police Department's chief of police, Mathew Nielsen, said in a phone call that none of his roughly 30 officers spoke with the family prior to Sam's death. He suggested that the family is confused about which law enforcement agency they called to perform the wellness checks.",
      "The phone number the family said they called matched the number of CPD's office. The family also shared a screenshot of their call log with NBC News.",
      "The Ontario County Department of Social Services did not immediately return requests for comment.",
      "'He didn't sound like himself'",
      "Linda Nordquist said her son left her home in Oakdale, Minnesota, in September to visit his former partner Precious Arzuaga. Arzuaga lived at Patty's Lodge, a motel in Canandaigua, New York, in Ontario County. The pair met online several month\u2019s earlier, she recalled, and spoke on the phone daily.",
      "\"They were on the phone 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\" she said. \"They both appeared very happy.\"",
      "Arzuaga, 38, is now one of five suspects in Nordquist's homicide case.",
      "Nordquist booked a flight to be home in Minnesota in early October, Linda Nordquist said. When he didn't come home or answer texts or phone calls, she requested a wellness check with police.",
      "Soon after, she received a call from her son and Arzuaga assuring her Sam was fine and that he wanted to stay to work on the pair's relationship. In the months since, Linda Nordquist said her calls with her son became infrequent.",
      "\"He didn't sound like himself,\" she said. \"It's like he was being coached what to say.\"",
      "Plans to escape, a missed appointment",
      "Then on Dec. 4, she received a distressing email from Ontario County Department of Social Services.",
      "\"I'm working with your son Sam. He wanted me to reach you,\" the email reads, according to a screenshot of the exchange. \"If you can please contact me as soon as your get this email.\"",
      "Linda Nordquist recalled that the DSS agent said her son recently visited their offices and confirmed her worries. He expressed that Arzuaga was controlling his cell phone use, that he wanted to come home and was trying to come up with an \"escape plan,\" the DSS said, according to Linda.",
      "He was supposed to return to the DSS office on Dec. 19, but never showed up, Linda Nordquist said.",
      "\"My problem is that if Sam said this, lock the doors and call the police. All these offices have doors on it. Lock the door, call the police and leave Sam there,\" she said.",
      "A wellness check and conflicting stories",
      "When she next spoke to her son over the phone, he told her he was \"fine,\" but she said she feared Arzuaga was listening to the call. The last time she heard from her son was by text on Jan. 31. After days went by without hearing from him, Linda Nordquist and her daughter Kayla Nordquist requested another wellness check with police on Feb. 9.",
      "Police told the family that Arzuaga's son answered the motel room's door and claimed to not know who Nordquist was, Linda Nordquist said. The police went back to the motel to speak with Arzuaga the same day, who claimed she and Nordquist broke up and that he left a few weeks ago, Linda Nordquist added.",
      "Unconvinced, Linda and Kayla Nordquist asked New York State Police Troop E to file a missing person's report. They said a state trooper declined.",
      "\"She said I need to stop watching so much TV, something about it not being a true crime episode,\" Kayla said. \"I need to stop watching so much TV and that they don't pass out missing people flyers.\"",
      "Trooper Lynnea N. Crane, a spokesperson for Troop E, said in a statement Thursday that the \u201cNew York State Police extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Sam Nordquist during this difficult time\u201d and \u201cunderstand the family\u2019s grief and frustration.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn this case, the New York State Police did not decline to file a missing persons report,\u201d she said. \u201cUpon receiving concerns about Mr. Nordquist\u2019s whereabouts, we took appropriate investigative steps.\u201d",
      "'Mom's here. Mom's looking.'",
      "The mother and daughter then went to their local police in Oakdale, Minnesota, to file a national missing person\u2019s report, they said. That prompted police to investigate, they said.",
      "They wondered if his identity as a trans person played a role in law enforcement's response.",
      "\"When I called, I said 'my transgender brother,' they knew that. So either they didn't conduct this wellness check because of him being transgender,\" Kayla Nordquist said. \"Or I'm thinking because he's transgender people are like, 'Oh, he's transgender, which makes him a man so he should man up.'\"",
      "At a news conference last week, New York State Police Capt. Kelly Swift called Sam\u2019s homicide \u201cone of the most horrific crimes I have ever investigated\u201d in her 20-year career in law enforcement.",
      "\u201cSam was subjected to repeated acts of violence and torture in a manner that ultimately led to his death,\u201d Swift said at the news conference. \u201cHis body was then transported in an attempt to conceal the crime.\u201d",
      "Despite not hearing from him, Linda Nordquist said she had no indication that her son might be dead. Before receiving the news, she was waiting for her next paycheck to travel to Canandaigua and find him.",
      "\"We were going to get blow horns and drive up and down the streets. I made 300 copies of fliers. We were going to put a flier on every door, every business, go door to door if we had to,\" she said through tears. \"Because if something was happening or if Sam was to a point where he couldn't go home or whatever, at least Sam could possibly hear my voice and know: 'Mom's here. Mom's looking.'\""

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 21:53:51 GMT",
    "summary": "DOGE wants access to filers\u2019 data, and the commerce secretary says Trump wants to scrap the IRS. But filing a return remains mandatory \u2014 the earlier the better, tax advisers say.",
    "story": [
      "This tax season is rife with uncertainty, as the world\u2019s richest person looks to shake up the Internal Revenue Service and the commerce secretary calls to eliminate it \u2014 but filers still need to carry on as usual, tax experts say.",
      "\u201cWhatever they\u2019re going to have to do to make their tax return accurate and true, they have to do,\u201d said Christina Wease, director of the Alvin. L. Storrs Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic at Michigan State University.",
      "\u201cIn the face of uncertainty,\u201d tax filers should consider getting their returns in as soon as they can, ideally electronically, said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \u201cThis was the case a few years ago with the pandemic,\u201d and the advice still holds true, she said \u2014 echoing a common refrain among tax advisers even in uneventful tax seasons.",
      "The current season has already been anything but.",
      "Alina Habba, an adviser to President Donald Trump, said at a conservative conference Thursday, \u201cWe\u2019re firing a bunch of the IRS today, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d Her remarks followed Associated Press reporting that thousands of probationary employees are slated to be cut this week.",
      "Late Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News\u2019 Jesse Watters that Trump wants to \u201cabolish\u201d the IRS \u201cand let all the outsiders pay\u201d via trade policies including tariffs (which tax American importers, not foreign businesses or governments). Watters then told his more than 3 million followers on X that their \u201ctax rates, interest rates, and mortgage rates are going to come hammering down.\u201d",
      "\u201cAbolishing the IRS or even, say, cutting funding to the IRS doesn\u2019t alter our tax system at all,\u201d said Kathleen DeLaney Thomas, a tax law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cOnly Congress could decide to repeal the many statutes in the Internal Revenue Code that provide the framework for our federal tax system.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency initiative is pressing for access to an IRS database containing sensitive taxpayer information, an effort that has drawn a lawsuit alleging privacy and tax law violations. The plaintiffs also claim DOGE\u2019s request poses a potential conflict of interest, since the data could involve tax records and investigations of Musk\u2019s business competitors.",
      "Tax policy and legal experts say much remains to be seen about the extent of any access to filers\u2019 data DOGE may gain and what the group might do with it. Two sections of the IRS tax code protect the confidentiality of returns and prohibit executive branch influence over agency audits and investigations.",
      "\u201cFor decades, since we\u2019ve had these privacy laws enacted by Congress, it\u2019s pretty much just been understood that IRS civil servants handled this data,\u201d Thomas said.",
      "In recent weeks, DOGE has made an aggressive push to slash federal spending and root out purported fraud and abuse across the government. While some of the initiative\u2019s high-profile claims have been called into question or included errors, conservative pundits and administration officials continue to promote them.",
      "\u201cWaste, fraud, and abuse have been deeply entrenched in our broken system for far too long,\u201d said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields, reiterating a statement he provided Sunday to NBC News. \u201cIt takes direct access to the system to identify and fix it.\u201d",
      "The IRS didn\u2019t respond to NBC News\u2019 requests for comment.",
      "In the meantime, taxpayers are still staring down the usual deadline to file their returns and have few ways to protect themselves from any potential fallout from non-IRS staffers\u2019 possible involvement.",
      "\u201cWe do not yet know the impact on IRS operations but are monitoring closely to ensure we can help hardworking Americans get every dollar they deserve,\u201d said a spokesperson for H&R Block, a major tax preparer. \u201cWhat we do know is tax returns are still due by April 15th.\u201d",
      "Holtzblatt said the DOGE efforts have caused \u201ca lot of uncertainty and a lot of concern ... [that] will be spilling over to the rest of us during this filing season, and particularly those of us who have concerns with how our tax information is used.\u201d",
      "But she emphasized that filing a correct and complete return isn\u2019t optional. If taxpayers are concerned about DOGE employees potentially seeing their bank account information, they could opt not to receive refunds via direct deposit. The IRS also offers checks by mail, but that could take longer.",
      "Mary Clements Evans, a certified financial planner in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, has been advising clients not to file their returns by mail either, citing the reports of workforce cuts at the IRS. \u201cThose paper filings, they\u2019re going to require people looking at them,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the great things the IRS has done over the years is they\u2019ve automated the processes.\u201d",
      "Evans said she\u2019s now fielding clients\u2019 concerns about how changes at the agency might affect returns this year. Many taxpayers rely on the IRS for support, partly because of an ongoing shortage of certified public accountants, and she said she\u2019s worried that staff firings could leave filers with fewer free resources. But she echoed other tax experts in saying it remains a good idea to file sooner rather than later.",
      "\u201cAs far as the vast majority of individuals who are filing, they can go ahead and file,\u201d Evans said.",
      "Holtzblatt suggested using the IRS\u2019 new Direct File tool since it\u2019s less labor-intensive. The free filing system was piloted last year and has since expanded to 25 states.",
      "For fiscal year 2023, the IRS processed nearly 271.5 million tax returns and other forms, and issued $659.1 billion in returns, according to agency data. Taxpayers submit a wide variety of personal information in those documents, all of which helps calculate their tax liability. IRS employees then view taxpayers\u2019 returns to verify their filing status, exemptions and deductions before administering a refund if due. If something seems off, or if a taxpayer is selected for a random audit, the IRS will reach out via mail to request further information.",
      "The IRS database that DOGE is trying to access, called the Integrated Data Retrieval System, contains a slew of data that\u2019s central to this process. IRS employees are allowed to access it on a need-to-know basis, said Nina Olson, who served as the national taxpayer advocate at the IRS from 2001 to 2019. Agency staffers, usually auditors or case advocates, can use the IDRS to pull up individuals\u2019 tax returns, which can include from their Social Security numbers and income to details about their health histories and dependents.",
      "\u201cYou have to specify what you are going to be doing in order to be able to meet statutory requirements for having access to return information,\u201d Olson said, who herself did not have access to the IDRS in her role at the time. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019s a crime to access it.\u201d",
      "Normally, IRS systems containing taxpayer data are secure and information is locked down, said Amy O\u2019Hara, executive director of the Georgetown University Research Data Center, which deals with federal statistics. She said breaches are rare, usually personnel-related and punished quickly.",
      "Under current laws, DOGE staffers would have to meet the same requirements to access the IDRS as any other contractor or employee, O\u2019Hara said.",
      "\u201cThere are these checks and balances in place to ensure the integrity of the systems,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just need to make sure that that integrity holds.\u201d"

      "Prior to the market open, Walmart\u00a0reported fourth-quarter earnings\u00a0of 66 cents per share.",

    "story": [
      "Airbus\u00a0could prioritize deliveries to its non-U.S. customers if tariffs disrupt the European plane maker\u2019s imports stateside, CEO Guillaume Faury said Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe have a large demand from the rest of the world, so [if] we face very significant difficulties to deliver to the U.S., we can also adapt by bringing forward deliveries to other customers which are very eager to get planes,\u201d Faury told CNBC\u2019s Charlotte Reed, in an interview discussing the company\u2019s\u00a0full-year results.",
      "\u201cThose tariffs are looming, and we don\u2019t know what they will be, [and], if and when we would have tariffs come in, what they would impact. So we stand ready to adapt accordingly,\u201d Faury said, referring to U.S. President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0wide-ranging tariff threats\u00a0which have already been\u00a0ramped up against China.",
      "Faury nevertheless stressed that Airbus had made moves in recent years to not only buy more from the U.S. and sell a significant number of aircraft and helicopters in the U.S., but also to base part of its production locally.",
      "That includes a large output site in Mobile, Alabama, with two final assembly lines for the company\u2019s A220 and A320 family jets, with another U.S. line under construction to build A320 and A321s for the domestic market.",
      "A host of large U.S. carriers are Airbus customers, including\u00a0American Airlines,\u00a0Delta,\u00a0United\u00a0and\u00a0JetBlue.",

      "\u201cBottom lime, we believe in this industry \u2014 that is very much a North Atlantic ecosystem with a lot of interdependencies \u2014 tariffs would hurt both sides. So I hope, I believe, we will not be significantly impacted by tariffs,\u201d Faury said.",
      "The European plane maker\u2019s target for around 820 aircraft deliveries in 2025 was issued \u201cin spite of those uncertainties, to clarify what we think we can deliver this year absent tariffs,\u201d Faury said.",
      "Airbus, meanwhile, remains stymied by a host of supply chain issues which are limiting its ability to ramp up production and work through its order backlog of more than 8,000 jets, Faury told CNBC.",
      "His comments come after the company earlier on Thursday reported a 6% rise in annual revenue, but an 8% fall in adjusted operating profit to 5.35 billion euros ($5.59 billion) across 2024.",
      "Profit at the company\u2019s defense and space unit swung to a loss of 656 million euros for the full year.",

      "Starting this week, workers at the celebrity video-greeting app are reporting into the company\u2019s Chicago headquarters Monday through Thursday. In exchange, the roughly two dozen eligible employees can expect a $10,000 annual raise, free lunch, free parking and access to an onsite gym.",
      "\u2033\u2018Roll out the red carpet\u2019 is our first corporate value, and we really felt like we wanted to make HQ a perk, not a punishment,\u201d Cameo CEO Steven Galanis tells CNBC Make It. \u201cWe know we\u2019re asking more out of you to give up the flexibility, and we wanted to compensate you for it.\u201d",
      "Many workers say\u00a0they\u2019d take a pay cut\u00a0to be able to keep working from home. Cameo is hoping the inverse will be true.",
      "Galanis and his leadership team landed on a $10,000 annual raise because the sum is \u201cmeaningful for everybody,\u201d especially junior employees: \u201cThat might be the difference between them being able to get an apartment in the city or having to take the train because they live with their parents in the suburbs.\u201d",
      "Cameo currently has 50 employees, including 26 in Chicago and others around the U.S. and internationally, though most remote workers are concentrated in New York and Los Angeles. The new benefit doesn\u2019t apply to workers outside of Chicago, though \u201cif they wanted to move to Chicagoland, we would give them a [relocation benefit] and they\u2019d be eligible,\u201d Galanis says.",
      "Cameo\u2019s Chicago headquarters opened during the summer of 2024, but leaders never set a schedule of when they expected employees to be in. Without it, workers generally reported to the office two to three times in the middle of the week, Galanis says.",
      "The new four-day policy was announced to staff a month ago. Galanis is reluctant to call it a mandate but says \u201cthere wasn\u2019t an ability to opt out.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you live in Chicagoland, you are four days a week in-office \u2014 there wasn\u2019t an option on that. And in exchange, we give you a $10,000 raise.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you wanted to move, you could do that\u201d and not be subject to the in-office expectation, Galanis says.",
      "Galanis says none of Cameo\u2019s employees quit the company or moved away from Chicago following the policy announcement. A few outside of Chicago have indicated possibly moving closer to headquarters given the new perks.",
      "Remote workers can also take part in Cameo\u2019s Team Week, launched this summer, where they can be flown to Chicago once a month for a defined week when \u201ceverybody\u2019s in,\u201d Galanis says.

      "An overtime goal from Connor McDavid sealed the 3-2 win for Canada at the TD Garden Arena in Boston, where ticket prices soared in the days ahead of the hotly anticipated finale.",
      "The result was the culmination of a midseason tournament that featured stars from Canada, Finland, Sweden and the United States. Recognized as one of the biggest international hockey games in years, Thursday\u2019s matchup could be a preview of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan Cortina, which will feature NHL players for the first time since 2014.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s just a quick tournament and it\u2019s not an Olympic gold medal or anything like that but it means the world to our group,\u201d McDavid said on ESPN after the win. \u201cWe worked so hard all week. It\u2019s special.\u201d",
      "Canada got on the board first 4:48 into the first period. Nathan MacKinnon skated towards the middle of the ice and fired a wrist shot through a sea of players that beat American goaltender Connor Hellebuyck up high.",
      "The U.S. evened the action with 3:08 remaining in the period. Auston Matthews tried to wrap around the goal for a shot but couldn\u2019t control the puck. It instead landed at the feet of Brady Tkachuk, who poked it into the net on a deflection.",
      "The U.S. took its first lead 7:31 into the second period. After a slapshot by Zach Werenski was blocked, it fell to Matthews. He tried to pass the puck across the goal but it was deflected to Jake Sanderson, who put it home on a snapshot. It was his first goal of the tournament.",
      "Canada tied it up with six minutes remaining in the second period. Mitch Marner found Sam Bennett up the left wing, who fired in a wrist shot past Hellebuyck.",
      "McDavid won it 8:18 into overtime on a one-timer off an assist from Marner.",
      "McDavid, the Edmonton Oilers superstar widely considered the best player in the NHL, called his play up until that point in the game \"not very good.\"",
      "\"All that was going through my mind was keep going,\" he said postgame. \"I struggled all night but these guys played great and we found a way.\u201d",
      "The championship contest capped off the first best-on-best men\u2019s hockey tournament in nearly a decade, the last being the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. NHL players were not allowed to participate in the 2018 and 2022 Winter Olympics, though they will be returning for the 2026 Games.",
      "That fact raised the stakes for the 4 Nations tournament, which the NHL created as a replacement this season for the more traditional All-Star Game.",
      "Players who for years were starved for the chance to play meaningful games on behalf of their country now would be able to face-off for international bragging rights. So far, fans, players and executives have commented on how intense and high-quality the games have been."

    "story": [
      "Rep. Rich McCormick faced\u00a0an angry crowd Thursday during a town hall in his Georgia district, where many constituents lashed out at the Republican lawmaker for his support of massive federal layoffs and budget cuts by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "In video of the event taken by Greg Bluestein, a reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and an NBC News contributor, attendees clashed with McCormick, bashing both President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk who is helping lead DOGE's efforts to drastically reduce government spending.",
      "In one instance, an attendee referred to recent cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by asking, \u201cWhy is the supposedly conservative party taking such a radical and extremist and sloppy approach to this?\u201d",
      "McCormick responded that \u201ca lot of the work they do is duplicitous with AI.\u201d",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Nearly 1,300 probationary CDC employees were removed from their  posts as the Trump administration makes efforts to terminate all probationary workers \u2014 typically employees who are recent hires.",
      "\u201cIf we continue to grow the size of government and we can\u2019t afford it, it\u2019s going to have shortfalls in your Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security,\u201d McCormick added at the event in Roswell, about 20 miles from the CDC headquarters.",
      "The attendee shot back that the administration was taking a \u201cchainsaw approach\u201d to dismissing its employees and the layoff effort was being \u201cjammed down the pipe, so rushed and sloppily.\u201d",
      "After McCormick said that a department or agency makes its own decisions about who to cut from its workforce when given a directive about head count, people in the audience could be heard saying, \u201cNo!\u201d with one person saying, \u201cElon Musk is deciding.\u201d",
      "The town hall was also punctuated by constituents saying, \u201cwe\u2019re pissed,\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t bend over,\u201d as well as chants of \u201cshame!\u201d",
      "As McCormick struggled to respond to the interruptions from the crowd and suggested he was offering solutions and people didn\u2019t \u201cwant to hear,\u201d one person can be heard shouting, \u201cWe want to work with someone better.\u201d",
      "McCormick handily won re-election last year, winning 64.9% of the vote in a state that Trump flipped after narrowly losing the battleground to President Joe Biden in 2020.",
      "One person who raised budget concerns Thursday could be heard telling McCormick that he had done a \u201cdisservice\u201d and had failed to \u201cstand up for us.\u201d",
      "In another instance, an attendee asked McCormick how he plans to \u201crein in the megalomaniac in the White House\u201d following Trump\u2019s \u201cLONG LIVE THE KING\u201d post on Truth Social, a question that was met by cheers and some people rising to their feet.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk about tyranny, when you talk about presidential power, I remember having the same discussion with Republicans when Biden was elected,\u201d\u00a0McCormick said, to boos from the attendees.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to see any president be too powerful,\u201d\u00a0McCormick added.",
      "At different points during the town hall, McCormick made attempts to quiet the crowd, saying at one point, \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna yell at me, that\u2019s not going to be an effective town hall,\" and later telling attendees, \"Nobody can hear when you\u2019re yelling.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has not fully complied with a court order pausing the freezing of foreign assistance grants and contracts, a federal judge ruled Thursday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali last week ordered the administration to allow the disbursement of U.S. foreign assistance after hearing claims from federal contractors challenging an executive order signed by President Donald Trump pausing nearly all foreign assistance.",
      "Ali determined that a \"blanket suspension of congressionally appropriated foreign aid\" had caused irreparable harm to the contractors and was likely not allowed under the Administrative Procedure Act.",
      "Earlier this week, the administration said in a notice of compliance that the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development had reviewed the thousands of contracts and grants it had canceled as part of the aid freeze and determined that \u201csubstantially all\u201d of the terminations were allowed under the terms of the contracts.",
      "In response, Ali suggested Thursday that the administration was not  fully abiding by his court order pausing the funding freeze and instead searching for new ways to justify its pause on large amounts of aid.",
      "\u201cBy enjoining Defendants and their agents from implementing any directives to undertake such blanket suspension, the Court was not inviting Defendants to continue the suspension while they reviewed contracts and legal authorities to come up with a new, post-hoc rationalization for the\u00a0en masse\u00a0suspension,\u201d Ali wrote.",
      "The judge said the Trump administration has yet to offer evidence to rebut the charge that its blanket suspension of foreign aid will cause irreparable harm or that it has fully considered the implications the pause could have on interests that rely on the aid.",
      "\"The Court stands prepared to consider such arguments and evidence at the preliminary injunction stage,\" Ali wrote. \"However, to the extent Defendants have continued the blanket suspension, they are ordered to immediately cease it.\"",
      "The judge stopped short of holding the administration in contempt.",
      "A spokesperson for the White House did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "The day of his second inauguration, Trump signed an executive order pausing all \"foreign development assistance\" funding for 90 days. The order directed all federal department and agency heads to immediately pause new obligations and disbursements of aid to foreign countries and nongovernmental organizations.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, days after being confirmed, ordered an immediate stop to nearly all foreign assistance funded through the State Department and USAID.",
      "The foreign aid pause case is not the first time of his second term that the Trump administration has been found by a judge to be in violation of a court order. Earlier this month, a federal judge in Rhode Island ruled that the Trump administration had violated his order\u00a0halting a broad federal funding freeze, which included a pause to foreign aid but also to domestic grants and loans. The memo enacting that pause, which came from the Office of Management and Budget, was rescinded in late January."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Thursday publicly supported Republican Rep. Byron Donalds' likely bid for Florida governor in 2026.",
      "Donalds has not yet announced, but NBC News reported last month that he is telling donors that he will run for the seat, which is being vacated by Republican Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited.",
      "Donalds is among Trump\u2019s biggest congressional supporters, and he was expected to get Trump\u2019s backing, even if the public show of support came sooner than many anticipated.",
      "\u201cI know Byron well, have seen him tested at the highest most difficult levels, and he is a TOTAL WINNER!\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social Thursday. \u201cAs Governor, Byron would have a BIG Voice and would work closely with me to advance our America First Agenda.\u201d",
      "While no major candidate has formally filed to run for governor in 2026, both Donalds and Casey DeSantis have been viewed as potential GOP frontrunners. Casey DeSantis, the first lady of Florida, earlier this month signaled she was considering a run \u2014 a prospect that was openly discussed at a donor event in Palm Beach County, as NBC News reported.",
      "Trump\u2019s endorsement is a huge win for Donalds. Trump won Florida by 13 percentage points, lives in the state and is widely seen as the most powerful influence over the state\u2019s Republican politics.",
      "In recent days, DeSantis himself has been making calls \u2014 including to Tallahassee-based lobbyists with clients before his administration \u2014 about his wife's potential run for governor \u2014 two people familiar with the conversations told NBC News.",
      "\u201cHe was absolutely starting to make calls on this,\u201d a donor who spoke with DeSantis directly said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that changed Byron\u2019s timeline at all, but the sitting governor was starting to make calls, it seems to have really kicked this race off.\u201d",
      "DeSantis\u2019 office did not return a request for comment.",
      "DeSantis had been looking for a candidate to support in 2026, something that the most current likely field \u2014 barring his wife's entrance \u2014 did not offer.",
      "He and Donalds have been at odds after Donalds backed Trump in the 2024 presidential primary, and state Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, another rumored candidate, has fought with DeSantis over a host of issues, most recently immigration.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the Trump endorsement will impact Casey DeSantis' thought process on running in 2026, but some view it as something that could make her re-think getting in the race.",
      "\u201cShe will need to process things and go through the stages of grief, but ultimately they will decide she\u2019s not going to run,\u201d a veteran GOP Florida lobbyist said. \u201cTrump just won this state by 15 points and throttled DeSantis in a national election. They know their brand cant take another loss to Trump.\u201d",
      "Beyond Trump\u2019s explicit endorsement, Donalds earlier this week unveiled a list of heavyweight GOP supporters \u2014 names that Trump himself amplified on Truth Social. The list included South Florida GOP mega donor Max Alvarez, lobbyist Brian Ballard \u2014 who has close ties to both Trump and DeSantis \u2014 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and tech billionaire David Sacks, among others.",
      "Trump also included a poll that showed Donalds with a commanding lead in a hypothetical 2026 race.",
      "Some in Trump\u2019s orbit continue to also see Casey DeSantis through the lens of a longtime rivalry between Trump and DeSantis. Trump endorsed DeSantis\u2019 first gubernatorial bid in 2018 \u2014 which gave him a huge boost \u2014 but some Trump defenders saw DeSantis then running for president in 2024 as a betrayal."

    "story": [
      "This article is part of \u201cDealing the Dead,\u201d a series investigating the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research.",
      "A Texas lawmaker horrified by an NBC News investigation into a medical school that profited from the bodies of the poor and vulnerable moved this week to ban the practice, introducing a bill that would make it illegal in the state to perform medical research on a corpse without explicit consent.",
      "The proposal is a direct response to NBC News\u2019 \u201cDealing the Dead\u201d series, which exposed how the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth took hundreds of unclaimed bodies from Dallas and Tarrant counties, cut them up and leased them out to medical device companies, other universities and the Army. Reporters discovered dozens of families who said they would have claimed their loved ones\u2019 bodies and given them proper funerals if they had been told. Some were still searching for their relatives, unaware that they had died.",
      "Sen. Tan Parker, who filed the bill in the Texas Legislature on Wednesday, said he had no idea what the Health Science Center had been doing until he saw NBC News\u2019 investigation in September. The findings outraged and disgusted him, he said.",
      "\u201cEvery Texan deserves dignity in life and death, and the right of families to decide how their loved ones\u2019 remains are handled must be protected,\u201d Parker, a Republican whose district includes portions of Dallas and Tarrant counties, said in a statement. \u201cNo family should ever have to worry that the remains of their loved ones could be taken, dismembered, and leased out without any effort to notify the next of kin. This legislation puts an end to that practice once and for all, ensuring Texas law upholds the highest ethical standards and respects the dignity of every individual.\u201d",
      "In addition to the legislation, NBC News\u2019 reporting has sparked sweeping changes: The Health Science Center suspended its body donation program, fired the officials who led it and said it would stop accepting unclaimed bodies. Boston Scientific and other medical device and research companies, as well as the Army, said they would rethink their arrangements with the center and take steps to ensure they would not use unclaimed bodies in the future. Members of Congress sought answers, and officials in Tarrant County adopted a policy to ensure unclaimed bodies were treated with dignity.",
      "The reporting also brought answers to families who had been left in the dark about what happened to their loved ones. Tim Leggett learned from NBC News last year that his brother Dale, 71, a World War II history buff, had died alone at a hospital in Tarrant County in May 2023. Without notifying Leggett, the county medical examiner provided his brother\u2019s body to the Health Science Center, which shipped his remains out of state to a for-profit medical education company. He applauded Parker\u2019s effort to ban the practice.",
      "\u201cThere is right and wrong, especially when it comes to how we treat each other, whether it\u2019s while we\u2019re alive or deceased,\u201d said Leggett, who was finally able to obtain his brother\u2019s ashes after seeing his name on a list NBC News and Noticias Telemundo published. \u201cThis bill is definitely another good step in making sure this doesn\u2019t happen to any other families.\u201d",
      "Leggett and nearly a dozen other families learned what happened to their relatives from NBC News and Noticias Telemundo reporters. Six of those families found their relative\u2019s name on the list the news outlets published.",
      "Kimberly Patman, who was told by NBC News that the body of her ex-husband, Victor Honey, was cut up and leased out, also said she welcomed Parker\u2019s bill.",
      "\u201cI am very thankful for them moving forward so that what happened to Victor and the other individuals won\u2019t ever happen again,\u201d Patman said.",
      "Honey, a homeless Army veteran who struggled with mental illness, died in Dallas in 2022 without anyone notifying his family. The Health Science Center then dissected his body and leased parts to two medical companies and the Army. After learning of his death last spring, his family buried his cremated remains at the Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery. The experience shook Patman, along with Honey\u2019s adult children and siblings.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t fully grasp the impact unless it has happened to your family,\u201d Patman said.",
      "Parker said his bill would prohibit the donation of an unclaimed body to a medical school or private body broker unless the person agreed to the donation before their death \u2014\u00a0or if permission is given by next of kin.",
      "If adopted, the measure would prevent a repeat of the Health Science Center\u2019s actions.",
      "It would also make Texas one of the few states to clearly ban research on the unclaimed dead \u2014\u00a0those whose families can\u2019t afford to make funeral arrangements or can\u2019t be reached. The practice is legal in most states but is increasingly viewed as unethical by anatomists and leaders in the body donation industry who say doctors and scientists should handle the dead with the same respect shown to living patients.",
      "Officials in North Texas justified sending unclaimed bodies to the Health Science Center by saying the deals saved local governments the cost of burials and cremations, helped train students and doctors and supported lifesaving research. But NBC News found that medical examiner\u2019s offices in Dallas and Tarrant counties, and staff at the Health Science Center, failed to contact relatives who were reachable before declaring the bodies unclaimed.",
      "More from 'Dealing the Dead'",

The center charged medical device and training companies $649 for heads, $330 for a pair of feet and $1,400 for a whole body. The body trade helped bring the center about $2.5 million a year.",
      "The dead included military veterans, people who struggled with drug addiction and mental illness and a young murder victim; while some had fallen out of touch with their relatives, their families said they loved and missed them and would have come forward to claim their body if they\u2019d known they were dead.",
      "After NBC News shared its findings with the Health Science Center, the school offered condolences to families and acknowledged the problems reporters uncovered. \u201cAs a result of the information brought to light through your inquiries, it has become clear that failures existed in the management and oversight of The University of North Texas Health Science Center\u2019s Willed Body Program,\u201d the center said in a statement last year.",
      "Parker\u2019s bill, which could be subject to revisions as it makes its way through the Legislature, will next be debated in a Texas Senate committee. Parker\u2019s office said it was working to get a companion bill filed in the Texas House and hoped to win bipartisan support.",

      "In an emailed statement, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service, said many of the terminated positions were funded by the Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden.",

The former WWE star deflected suspicion at first, but in Episode 5, one of her closest allies, Chrishell Stause, started to doubt her. Chrishell voiced her concerns about Nikki during the roundtable, leading most of the group to vote her out. \"The win for me is that I do get to go home to my son. The loss for all of you is that I'm a Faithful,\" Nikki said as she left.",
      "Bob Harper",
      "As Episode 6 began, the trust between the Traitors was at an all time low.  They met in the turret and discussed their \"dysfunctional family\" before listing their targets. They settled on Bob Harper, who was vocal at the most recent roundtable about who the Faithfuls couldn't trust. The three remaining Traitors labeled him as \"the more imminent threat\" and agreed to murder him. When \"The Biggest Loser\" trainer didn't show up for breakfast the next morning, the cast, excluding the Traitors, were stunned. After Bob H. read his letter from the Traitors, he said, \"No f---ing way. I think the Traitors are playing a really ballsy game. They're very invincible right now because they are so hidden. I'm angry. I'm just angry over the train of thought of why I was murdered. I hate the Traitors.\"",
      "Wes Bergmann",
      "At the end of the Episode 6, Wes Bergmann planned to turn on Rob, but the \"Survivor\" winner beat him to it. Throughout the episode, Wes had been suggesting Rob's name to multiple people. When everyone arrived at the roundtable, Rob used Wes' scheming ways against him and pointed out that Wes pushed for Nikki to be banished. To defend himself, Wes warned that he would target anyone who voted against him. His tactic didn't work and pushed the Faithfuls in the opposite direction, making them vote to banish him. \"The Challenge\" star delivered one of his signature boastful speeches before he left, calling himself \"one of the greatest reality competition players of all time.\" He added, \"I don't care about any of you. You are all chess pieces on a board. And so to all those people that have died until I got to this circle right here, I have no idea who killed them because I'm a Faithful.\"",
      "Derrick Levasseur",
      "Derrick Levasseur took a chance during the roundtable in Episode 6 and voiced his theory about Rob being a traitor. The next episode, his boldness came back to bite him. When the Traitors met in secret at the beginning of Episode 7, they begrudgingly decided the \"Big Brother\" winner needed to go to help rebuild trust between them. As Derrick learned his fate, he was unsurprised. \"I knew that after I called out Rob directly last night, and he chose to instead go at Wes, that he was not going to give me another roundtable, which I guess I have to take as a compliment,\" Derrick said. He proudly added, \"I'm the most dangerous person in here for the Traitors, and they know it.\" He said he would have made the same move and that he was \"honored\" to have been a part of the season.",
      "Rob 'Boston Rob' Mariano",
      "Rob's smooth-talking and cunning ways could no longer save him by Episode 7. Before he departed, Derrick planted seeds to his fellow Faithfuls, cautioning them that Rob was a Traitor. At breakfast, Rob posed the theory that the Traitors had murdered Derrick to make the \"Survivor\" star look guilty. But \"Vanderpump Rules\" star Tom Sandoval was unconvinced and realized that it was the third time a Faithful was murdered after publicly going against Rob. So, Tom presented that evidence during the roundtable, hoping that others would jump on board. After everyone voted, Rob received a majority of votes \u2014 including two from his fellow Traitors \u2014 and was banished, ending his masterful run this season. \"First of all, I just want to tell all of you that I have really enjoyed meeting you and playing this game with you. I've had a ton of fun,\" he said during his final speech. \"I am, and always have been, from the very beginning, a Traitor.\"",
      "Chrishell Stause",
      "At the start of Episode 8, Chrishell Stause was one of the few remaining players that did not secure a shield in the previous mission. So, she had to dress to the nines and go to the chapel to learn if the Traitors decided to murder her. While the other vulnerable players turned around and saw Cumming waiting for them near the pews, Chrishell came face to face with the two remaining Traitors. The \"Selling Sunset\" star seemed slightly shocked as she discovered the Traitors' identities. They explained that she would've never been banished, so they needed to eliminate her. \"That's unfortunate,\" Chrishell simply said. In her final confessional interview, she said that all of the Faithfuls had been \"idiots\" and that one particular Traitor was \"playing the best game.\" She added, \"I wasn't ready to leave. But, if I must go, I appreciate the fabulous send off.\"",
      "Ciara Miller",
      "The remaining Faithfuls desperately searched for any evidence that could point them in the direction of a Traitor. Sam Asghari suggested that the group revisit the theory that one of the Traitors was in the coffins in Episode 3. With Jeremy murdered and Nikki banished, that left Ciara as the only possible option. At the round table in Episode 8, Ciara explained that her passionate speech after she was placed in the coffin was an example of her pleading for her life in the game. She also tried to cast doubt on two contestants. But, the other players did not trust her and all voted to banish the \"Summer House\" star. \"I don't really do speeches, but I'll always go down fighting. I'm never succumbing to anyone,\" she said during her final remarks. \"Even the Traitors, because I am a Faithful.\"",
      "Sam Asghari",
      "Episode 9 began with the remaining Traitors, once again, butting heads about the next murder. They ultimately agreed that murdering Sam would be the best move. They pointed out that he was improving at picking up on suspicious behavior and that other Faithfuls were starting to listen to him. When the actor learned his stint on the show was over, he was unsurprised. \"Alright, my time has come to an end,\" he said. \"I was sort of expecting this. I had some good ideas around the roundtable. I was getting good at it and the only way to get me out of the castle was to murder me.\" He said he was leaving with no regrets. \"I've played with honor, respect, I got to know people, and I got to have fun. So I wouldn't change one thing.\"",
      "Carolyn Wiger",
      "Carolyn's run as the most undetected Traitor in the game came to a dramatic end in Episode 9. Throughout the episode, Carolyn started to hint to other players that they shouldn't trust her fellow Traitor Danielle. Meanwhile, Danielle was secretly plotting to expose Carolyn as a Traitor. In the chess game mission, Danielle took a back seat while Carolyn was vocal, making the other players think for the first time that something was off. Then at the roundtable, Danielle showed off her convincing debate skills. She called Carolyn out for attacking her in a previous episode, noting that eliminated Traitors were very aggressive at the roundtable. Carolyn attempted to create a counter argument but was unsuccessful. After getting voted out, she tearfully approached the circle of truth and said, \"I'm somebody who, every day of my life, am judged because of who I am, my differences, my quirks.\" She revealed that she avoided building connections because of how emotional she is. \"Playing this game, it's not easy for me,\" she continued. \"I just wanted to have fun! But I have to get real with myself. Being a Traitor isn't fun.\""

Because it's very easy to praise and think about the impact of first responders when dealing with such a widespread, media-covered emergency, but we don't always think about them in quieter times. And so it's just a reminder that the show is there to try and make sure that that spotlight on them is constant, because they are always there at the ready.",

And Buck's really going to be put into that place of feeling abandoned, and he's going to react to it in a really \u2014 and I don't say this about myself, I say this about the story \u2014 a really cute way, that I think will go down very well with viewers of the show.",

You know, I feel like maybe that would feel like going around Eddie, or going behind Eddie's back, maybe. Or even if Eddie was aware of it, maybe just making Eddie jealous, because Eddie can't have that relationship with him. So I think Buck has kind of not tried to intervene too much in the situation, or not insert himself into the situation, because as much as he is a part of their life, you know, that is his son, and I don't think you would want to overstep too much. So, yeah, I actually don't think that Buck is in contact with Christopher and that he's kind of letting Eddie handle his business and just being there at the ready if needed.",

Keeping himself busy, whether it be the baking, whether it be work \u2014\u00a0just keeping things happening so that maybe he doesn't have too much time to stop and think, which, you know, always catches up with you eventually. But I kind of feel like that's where we find Buck at the moment. He's just keeping himself occupied so that the silence and the thoughts don't creep in.",
      "I have experienced that in some of the earlier seasons. I think it was hard to quiet that noise. And then once you read one thing or another, it's difficult to not let it seep in, you know? But I've kind of found the balance, and I don't think, as an actor on the show, I don't think you should be involved in fandom of the show, and I don't think you should read fandom of the show. I think your job is your job, and you have to make the thing, and then it gets given over to the fans to do whatever they want with it. And so, actually finding that boundary between the two has been really, really healthy for me.",
      "Season Eight, this season. It's definitely a newer thing for me. But, you know, listen, anytime I'm on a social media app, and anything \"9-1-1\" or anything Oliver Stark-related comes up, I gleefully (click) \"not interested in this post\" and get it out of my algorithm. And it's really helped me just kind of think more positively about it. So, yeah, it's a newer thing, but something that I'm really happy that I made a step towards.",
      "Episode 11 I think is really special. Not even just because of story, but one of our own directed it. One of the cast directed it, which is the first time that's happened on the show. So that was a really special experience for me. Not me the director, me the actor on the show. It's not me.",
      "I think I'm really excited for that to air, just because, I just think it's a really special moment, and it's this particular actor's first time doing it. So, yeah, just, it felt like a big moment.",
      "I think so. I\u2019m pretty sure it'll be revealed ahead of time, but I think they are keeping it secret for now."

    "summary": "Kim Kardashian has a message for anyone hating on North West's Lion King performance, saying she knows she got the role because of her famous parents and that she is not Mariah Carey",
    "story": [
      "Kim Kardashian clapped back to the haters who criticized her daughter's \"Lion King\" performance.",
      "Kardashian's eldest daughter, North West, played Simba in a live concert at the Hollywood Bowl in May 2024, which celebrated the 30th anniversary of \"The Lion King.\"",
      "Clips of North's performance at the event went viral, showing North singing with excitement. Online, many said Disney should have selected another more conventionally trained performer to play the role of Simba.",
      "\u201cI was there. It would have been a great performance at a school talent show or musical, but with so many amazing young performers out there, she shouldn\u2019t have been on the HB stage,\u201d one\u00a0person said on TikTok.",
      "Another added, \u201cNorth West was not good in The Lion King. And her family/production did her no favors in letting her go on anyway. Not all kids are good at all things and they need to be taught that. There were likely dozens of experienced kids that should have been cast.\"",
      "Kardashian anticipated the backlash in the Season 6, Episode 3 of \u201cThe Kardashians.\"",
      "In a confessional, Kardashian said that she knew her daughter got the role because of nepotism and she knew that North would face criticism for her singing abilities.",
      "\"I already know what's coming, that she's not Whitney Houston. Duh! I know that she got the job because of her parents,\" she said.",
      "However, Kardashian explained that \"North is the moment\" and she's the one who people pay to see.",
      "\"They want to see North West on a TikTok, on a this, on anything, because she's a personality, a performer,\" she said.",
      "She shared choice words for anyone who came for her daughter's performance. \"If anyone wants to hate on a child that is having the time of their lives, then f--k you,\" she said.",
      "Kardashian said that she's \"proud\" of North. \"It's such a proud moment as a mom to see your child have so much fun and not be nervous at all,\" she said.",
      "Kardashian added, \"She's so proud of herself. She did such a great job. And anyone that is hating on a kid is just a hater, and she's not there to be Mariah Carey.\"",
      "The start of the episode looks into how North got the opportunity \u2014 and why Kardashian was hesitant to let her accept it. Disney approached the family about North's participation, according to the episode.",
      "\"I just can't decide,\" Kardashian said on the phone with her sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian. She said she was \"worried about\" people being mean.",
      "\"I'm really torn on if we should let her do this or not. \"She's not a singer. She raps. She's been on a stage with her dad for sure. As a mom, especially putting her child on a platform with a lot of opinions \u2014 it's something to really, really think about,\" she said.",
      "North, however, expressed her interest. \"Right away, she was like, 'Please, Mom, I want to do it,'\" Kardashian recalled her saying. She finally let her do it, saying she \"believes in her.\"",
      "The episode goes into dress rehearsals and North in costume behind-the-scenes. \"I'm so happy I'm doing this,\" North said.",
      "Kardashian also grapples with being a \"mom-ager\" to North's career. \"I'm not really ready to be a mom-ager. But if there's one thing she wants to do here or there, that makes sense, I'll consider it. I loved this for her,\" she said."

      "She gave a more detailed portrait of her family life while speaking to Interview Magazine. According to the interview, her parents are both psychologists \u2014 her father is a schizophrenia specialist and her mother works with children.",
      "As for how she was drawn to acting? She made a guess in her Interview Magazine conversation.",
      "\"My sister married a writer, so I think that\u2019s what sparked my interest in acting. I\u2019ve always been a huge film buff and so is my father, so I grew up watching all the Woody Allen films and Tarantino, Sofia Coppola, Scorsese,\" she said.",

      "Madison told Hollywood Authentic she thinks her abilities as an actor stem back to being a \"big daydreamer\" as a kid.",
      "\"I would daydream about being different versions of myself; versions where I wasn\u2019t shy, or I had lots of friends, or I did interesting, crazy things, and felt big emotions,\u201d Madison said. \u201cI do think that me being an actor, I\u2019m able to do those things. It gave me the feeling of not being shy. But then a part of me loves being alone. I\u2019m very much just a lone wolf kind of person. It\u2019s a contradiction.\u2019"

      "After their \u201cShow Me the Meaning of Being Lonely\u201d performance, during which Craig Melvin sang his heart out, the album\u2019s track list appeared on Spotify. Among the newer additions are \u201cI\u2019ll Be There For You,\u201d \u201cYou Wrote the Book on Love,\u201d \u201cIf You Knew What I Knew\u201d and \u201cMy Heart Stays With You,\u201d sung predominately by Dorough.",
      "Longtime fans have heard these songs on deluxe and imported versions of their CDs, but they will now be available to stream.",
      "Their new song \u201cHey,\u201d Littrell tells TODAY.com, was originally created for their ninth studio album, 2019's \u201cDNA.\u201d At the time, the song didn\u2019t quite match sonically with the rest of the album.",
      "Littrell adds, \u201cWe were trying to cram it in last minute, and it just didn\u2019t work. So we were like, \u2018Hey, this is a gem. It\u2019s special.\u2019 We wanted to hold on to it and the time came around, this announcement happened, it was like, \u2018Oh my gosh, what better way to present a brand-new song?\u2019 So it turned out perfect.\u201d",
      "Fans will also get to hear the alternate version of \u201cI Want It That Way\u201d that the group says \u201cmakes sense,\u201d a nod to fans\u2019 questions over the years about what the original song actually means. Instead of \u201ctell me why,\u201d the lyrics are switched up with versions of \u201cno goodbyes,\u201d \u201cno more lies\u201d and \u201cthat is why.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the rhyming scheme, it doesn\u2019t have the feel. You\u2019re going to understand why we chose to go with the other one,\u201d Richardson explains, with McLean adding that \u201csome of the lyrics are the same, but the majority is completely different.\u201d",
      "A look to the future and Grammy aspirations",
      "Dorough recalls a moment when they first started as a group and were touring high schools.",
      "\u201cThe microphones went out, we sang a cappella and still won all those kids over,\u201d Dorough says. \u201cRight from the beginning, we instilled that we can get through anything.\u201d",
      "With almost 32 years of history, the Backstreet pride is alive and well. Their accomplishments include millions of records sold, a slew of awards, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the distinction as the first pop band at Sphere, but the group is still holding out for one specific accolade.",
      "\u201cIt would be an honor for us to get established into our career with having a Grammy and the acknowledgement of that,\u201d Dorough says. \u201cThat\u2019s something I think we\u2019ve always had on our bucket list. And we\u2019ve been nominated, what, nine times? Every time we get it, we always get beat out by somebody about 30 years into the industry before us. So we\u2019re getting closer to that 30 years now, to maybe get one ourselves.\u201d",
      "According to the Grammys\u2019 website, the group has been nominated for eight awards. Their last nomination was in 2019 for best pop duo/group performance for their song \u201cDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart\u201d from \u201cDNA.\u201d Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper took the win for \u201cShallow.\u201d",
      "Despite the loss, McLean says, \u201cIt\u2019s just been this steady incline for us, and it\u2019s just been a blessing that we\u2019re still doing this 32 years later.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have the best fans in the world that keep wanting us to come back,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd it just seems to happen organically, that opportunities like Sphere reignite this flame. They inspire us and it gets us excited again.\u201d"

Unlike Belle, Milla actually has cancer. (The real Belle Gibson admitted\u00a0to lying about having cancer in an interview with Australia\u2019s\u00a0The Weekly\u00a0in 2015.)",
      "In the show, doctors find a rare cancer \u2013 called pleomorphic sarcoma undifferentiated \u2014 in Milla\u2019s arm. Rather than follow their recommendations and amputate, the 22-year-old opts for an alternate medical regimen involving juice and coffee enemas. She builds a career on the idea that she healed her cancer holistically. It seems to work for a while, until the cancer comes back. This time, the spread is fatal and Milla dies.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the facts and fiction of Milla.",
      "Who is Milla Blake based on in real life?",
      "\u201cMilla is an amalgamation of wellness influencers at the time,\u201d Debnam-Carey tells\u00a0TODAY.com. \u201cWe created Milla as her own thing. That was what was so great about it \u2026 we could boost her up so that she could be going toe-to-toe with Belle.\u201d",
      "She says the character was inspired in part by\u00a0Jessica Ainscough, the editor of a teen magazine who was diagnosed with epithelioid sarcoma, a rare cancer, when she was 22, and nicknamed\u00a0herself\u00a0\u201cThe Wellness Warrior.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Ainscough and Milla share similarities. In Ainscough\u2019s now-deleted blog post on her five-year diagnosis anniversary in 2013, viewed on the Internet Archive, Ainscough remembered hearing of a sacrcoma diagnosis.",
      "\u201c'The results have told us that you have a rare type of cancer called epithelioid sarcoma.\u2019 I went numb. \u2018It\u2019s not treatable with chemotherapy or radiation, and there\u2019s a good chance we will have to amputate your arm but this disease is essentially terminal,\u2019\u201d\u00a0she wrote.",

      "Gerson Therapy is not scientifically proven, per Sloan Kettering. Ainscough, however, said it worked for her.",

      "Also like Milla, Ainscough\u2019s mother was also diagnosed with cancer. Sharyn Ainscough died in 2013 of breast cancer.",

      "While the show never says it's a \"true story,\" instead opting to describe itself as a \"true-ish story based on a lie,\" Col Ainscough feels the relationship the show depicted between Milla and Belle was an upsetting false narrative.",
      "\"Jess and Belle Gibson were never friends,\" he said, adding that he hasn't seen the show and doesn't plan on it but learned of the inaccuracies from others.",

      "He says in real life, he \"fully supported\" his daughter's decision to seek alternative treatment methods.",
      "\"I felt Jess had no real option but to seek alternatives,\" he said, complimenting her \"bravery and diligence\" to do so.",
      "\u201cJess was incredibly intelligent, and she and Sharyn spent months researching every possible option, including clinics worldwide,\" he continued. \"I did my own research, read about Gerson therapy and felt confident it was manageable for our family. I trusted Jess and Sharyn\u2019s judgement, knowing they wouldn\u2019t take such a decision lightly.\"",
      "He said that after 24 months in the program, Jess was cancer free, and she stayed that way for \"several years.\"",

These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloane with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",

      "\"Ms. Lively previously sent her California Civil Rights Department Complaint in response to the retaliatory campaign Wayfarer launched against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns. Unfortunately, Ms. Lively\u2019s decision to speak out has resulted in further retaliation and attacks. As alleged in Ms. Lively\u2019s federal Complaint, Wayfarer and its associates have violated federal and California state law by retaliating against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns.",
      "\"Now, the defendants will answer for their conduct in federal court. Ms. Lively has brought this litigation in New York, where much of the relevant activities described in the Complaint took place, but we reserve the right to pursue further action in other venues and jurisdictions as appropriate under the law.\"",

      "\u201cNothing in this lawsuit changes anything about the claims advanced in Ms. Lively\u2019s California Civil Rights Department Complaint, nor her federal complaint, filed earlier today,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThis lawsuit is based on the obviously false premise that Ms. Lively\u2019s administrative complaint against Wayfarer and others was a ruse based on a choice \u2018not to file a lawsuit against Baldoni, Wayfarer,\u2019 and that \u2018litigation was never her ultimate goal.\u2019\u00a0As demonstrated by the federal complaint filed by Ms. Lively earlier today, that frame of reference for the Wayfarer lawsuit is false.\u00a0While we will not litigate this matter in the press, we do encourage people to read Ms. Lively\u2019s complaint in its entirety.

      "Lively\u2019s legal team said Baldoni and Wayfarer \u201care trying to shift the narrative to Ms. Lively by falsely claiming that she seized creative control and alienated the cast from Mr. Baldoni. The evidence will show that the cast and others had their own negative experiences with Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer. The evidence will also show that Sony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony\u2019s cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe video shows Ms. Lively leaning away and repeatedly asking for the characters to just talk. Any woman who has been inappropriately touched in the workplace will recognize Ms. Lively\u2019s discomfort,\u201d her legal team continued. \u201cThey will recognize her attempts at levity to try to deflect the unwanted touching. No woman should have to take defensive measures to avoid being touched by their employer without their consent.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for Lively said releasing the video to the media, rather than presenting it as evidence in court, was \u201canother example of an unethical attempt to manipulate the public\u201d and was \u201ca continuation of their harassment and retaliatory campaign.\u201d",

      "Among the bodies believed to be handed over by Hamas were those of Kfir and Ariel Bibas, the two youngest captives seized in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack that triggered Israel's military campaign in Gaza.",
      "The bodies of the two children were later confirmed to be those of Kfir and Ariel Bibas \u2014 but the body that was believed to be that of their mother, Shiri, was not in fact her, the Israel Defense Forces said.",
      "\"This is a very serious violation by the Hamas terrorist organization, which is required by the agreement to return four dead abductees,\" the IDF said. \"We demand that Hamas return Shiri home along with all of our abductees.\"",
      "The bodies handed over were the first to be returned under the current ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Lifshitz's family said Thursday that his body had been identified.",
      "Each casket also carried a small photograph of one of the four hostages.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of those in Hamas captivity, had earlier said that the body of Shiri Bibas was handed over, along with the bodies of her two children and that of Lifshitz.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement that \"We are horrified and devastated by the news that their mother, Shiri, was not returned \u2014 despite the agreement and our desperate hopes.\"",

      "The IDF said that the identification process determined the other body was not Shiri Bibas, and \"no match was found for any other abductee. It is an anonymous body without identification.\"",
      "The handover took place in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, where large crowds gathered and armed Hamas militants in black and camouflage uniforms patrolled the area.

      "While all other child hostages were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners during a one-week ceasefire in November 2023, the Bibas family never emerged from Gaza.",
      "On one of the final days of the brief pause in fighting, Hamas released a statement claiming that Shiri Bibas and the children had been killed in an Israeli airstrike, although Israel\u2019s military said the claim could not be confirmed before later acknowledging its fears for the family.",

      "The 36-year old was released from Hamas captivity Saturday along with two other hostages in exchange for 369 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. He is the second U.S. citizen after Keith Siegel, 65, to be freed in phase one of the ceasefire and hostage release deal.",
      "His father, Jonathan Dekel-Chen, said in an interview Monday that his son, who was wounded in his right shoulder and his left leg when he was kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 2023 Hamas-led attack, \u201cwas given minimal medical treatment once he got to Gaza.\u201d",

      "On the morning of the attack, Dekel-Chen put his wife, Avital Dekel-Chen, 34, and their two daughters, Bar, 7, and Gali, 3, into the safe room of their home. He then went out to confront the militants storming their kibbutz and was taken captive.",

      "That sparked a furious reaction from both Israel and President Donald Trump, who warned that unless they were freed, \u201call hell is going to break loose\u201d in Gaza, where health officials say more than 48,000 people have been killed since Israel launched its military campaign Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The first phase of the agreement \u2014 which calls for the release of 33 hostages in exchange for a six-week ceasefire and the release of around 1,900 prisoners and detainees \u2014 is due to expire March 2.",
      "Negotiations are\u00a0 underway to try to reach the second phase of the agreement, which would see the release of all living hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners and detainees, a permanent ceasefire and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.",
      "Ultimately, ahead of Dekel-Chen\u2019s release, both sides backed down and reverted to the original terms of the ceasefire brokered by Qatar and 369 Palestinian prisoners were freed in exchange for the three men.",
      "The days of uncertainty were \u201cbrutal\u201d as they waited to see if the ceasefire would collapse, Jonathan Dekel-Chen said, adding, \u201chonestly, it was terrifying, not just for us but for the families of all of the remaining hostages.\u201d"

      "The troops are part of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s attempt to stave off President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order announcing tariffs on Mexican, Canadian and Chinese goods coming to the U.S., a move aimed at pressuring the three countries into stopping the flow of fentanyl and immigrants into the U.S.",

      "During an interview along the fence across the border from New Mexico, Mexican National Guard Maj. Alexander V\u00e1squez Hern\u00e1ndez attributed the drop in illegal border crossings to the amount of new personnel in the area.",
      "\u201cThe principal objective is to inhibit the trafficking of fentanyl,\u201d he said in Spanish, adding that the deployment of troops has helped them recognize key transit points.",
      "Mexican National Guard troops have been mobilized to at least 13 cities from Tijuana to Matamoros across the nearly 2,000-mile border.",

      "But critics say that the troops will do little to stop illegal immigration or the flow of drugs like fentanyl \u2014 and instead amount to an unnecessary show of force that militarizes the border as a political stunt.",
      "\u201cThis is a waste of government resources,\u201d said Luis Zavala de Alba, the director of Casa Monarca del Migrante, a shelter for migrant families in Monterrey, Mexico, and a visiting professor at Yale University.",
      "Migrants at Casa Monarca have told Zavala de Alba they might just stay in Mexico because they\u2019re not sure they can get to the U.S. But he said that \u201cthese measures will contain the flow temporarily, while organized crime finds ways of crossing desperate migrants.\u201d",
      "With border activity being significantly quieter than usual, NBC News pressed V\u00e1squez Hern\u00e1ndez on whether the troops were just a show for Trump \u2014 as critics argue.",

      "Guard members in full tactical gear are patrolling the border. Recently, they discovered a large, sophisticated tunnel just feet from El Paso, Texas. It measured 4 by 6 feet across with a complete lighting and ventilation system.",
      "Because most fentanyl is smuggled into the U.S. in vehicles through legal ports of entry \u2014 not through rural stretches of the border \u2014 the National Guard and the Mexican Army have increased their presence at official border crossings.",
      "Illegal border crossings dropped drastically after the U.S. tightened asylum restrictions during the latter part of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.",
      "After Trump was re-elected, Customs and Border Protection said the number of crossings fell another 35% from December to January. Trump\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan, said this week that the Border Patrol was seeing just 229 encounters a day along the entire border, down from a peak of 11,000 a day during Biden\u2019s term.",
      "As part of its crackdown, the U.S. State Department has designated Mexican drug cartels as well as MS-13 and the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua as foreign terrorist organizations, according to a document published Thursday in the Federal Register. A U.S. official also told NBC News that the CIA has expanded drone surveillance flights to target cartels.",
      "Smuggling is down, but 'it won't make a difference'",
      "Donning a mask, Marcos, a human smuggler, agreed to speak to NBC News on the condition that his last name be withheld. He works in southern Mexico: The city of Tapachula is a major bottleneck for migrants coming from Central America.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d he said of the troops. \u201cIt\u2019s foolishness.\u201d",
      "This is not the first time Mexico has deployed troops for border enforcement. On the campaign trail, Trump said that he had convinced Mexico to send thousands of troops during his first term.",
      "But the second Trump administration is eager to promote early successes in its current crackdown. According to a Customs and Border Protection internal memo obtained by NBC News, Honduran Frontier Police earlier this month intercepted a bus with 23 migrants who told them they were abandoning the journey to the U.S. and returning to their home countries because they\u2019d been detained in Mexico and deported to Guatemala.",
      "Marcos said he\u2019s been smuggling migrants for six years and won\u2019t stop \u2014 at least in the short term. When pressed on whether he considers himself a criminal, he responded that while what he does may be against the law, he rationalizes it morally.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never abandoned or robbed anyone,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s like a travel agency. \u2026. People have a dream. And if not for us, many of those in Latin America and elsewhere, it wouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d",
      "But he did concede that his business has plummeted by 80% since Trump took office.",
      "He said the cost for his services depends on nationality. Someone from Central America costs $12,000-$18,000; from South America,  $14,000-$26,000; from Europe or Asia, $40,000.",
      "Migrants often scrounge up the money from relatives in the U.S. or by becoming indebted to cartels. But Marcos pleads ignorance.",
      "\u201cThis is something we don\u2019t ask,\u201d he said, adding that while he doesn\u2019t work for a cartel, he must often pay them to move migrants through their territory.",
      "\u201cMigration is a business for everyone,\u201d he said.",
      "Before Trump took office, he said his operations typically moved dozens of people per week, earning him personally about $5,000 to $6,000 a month. Now, he expects to make about $1,000 a month.",
      "Still, he thinks Trump is mistaken \u2014 his policies will not end up deterring people from coming to the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think he is focusing on the issue of migration the wrong way,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of closing the border, he should look farther south to implement measures against corrupt people in our countries.\u201d"

      "Both cases \u2014 one on criminal charges, one an impeachment \u2014 are related to his brief imposition of martial law in December.",
      "Security was heightened at the Seoul Central District Court as the motorcade transporting Yoon arrived for a preliminary hearing that involved discussions of witnesses, proposed evidence and other preparations for his criminal trial.",
      "The court, which scheduled another preliminary hearing in March, was also reviewing a request by Yoon\u2019s lawyers to cancel his arrest and release him from custody. Such challenges are rarely successful. The court was expected to make a decision later Thursday.",
      "Yoon next traveled across the capital to the Constitutional Court, which is nearing a decision on whether to formally remove him from office after he was impeached by the National Assembly. Yoon temporarily left the courtroom when Prime Minister Han Duck-soo appeared as a witness. Yoon\u2019s lawyer explained to the justices that his client believed it would damage the country\u2019s image if both were seen in court together.",
      "Han supported Yoon\u2019s claim that the liberal opposition, with its legislative majority, had disrupted state affairs through pushing for impeachments of senior officials and undermining the government budget. However, Han repeated his previous statements to lawmakers and investigators that Yoon had violated constitutional requirements by failing to deliberate in a formal Cabinet meeting before declaring martial law on Dec. 3. Han said he didn\u2019t know of any Cabinet member who expressed support of Yoon\u2019s step.",

      "Martial law was lifted about six hours after Yoon declared it but has caused political turmoil, disrupted high-level diplomacy and tested the resiliency of the country\u2019s democracy. Yoon\u2019s conservative supporters rioted at the Seoul Western District Court after it authorized his arrest last month, while his lawyers and ruling party have openly questioned the credibility of courts and law enforcement institutions handling the case.",

      "Created after the chaotic withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from Afghanistan in 2021,\u00a0CARE\u00a0oversees efforts across U.S. government agencies to evacuate at-risk Afghans, process them in third countries and resettle them in the U.S. under a program called \u201cEnduring Welcome.\u201d",
      "It also works to address the\u00a0challenges women and girls face\u00a0under the Taliban, who have\u00a0rolled back their rights and protections.",
      "Among the over 250,000 Afghans who could be stranded if the office is closed are 128,000 people in Afghanistan who worked for the United States and have applied for special immigrant visas along with their families, as well as several thousand Afghans who were fully vetted and are waiting in Albania, Qatar and other countries to travel to the United States, according to U.S.-based refugee advocates working with the Afghans.",
      "The Afghans potentially affected also include family members of 200 active-duty Afghan American U.S. service members, unaccompanied minors waiting to be reunited with their parents and relatives of Afghans already settled in the United States.",
      "The discussions around closing the State Department CARE office are separate from the\u00a0freeze on refugee resettlement\u00a0and\u00a0foreign aid\u00a0that President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0ordered on his first day back in office.",
      "Tahera Rezaei, an Afghan veterinarian who lives in Chicago after having worked with Americans in Afghanistan, said she has been trying to get her family members out and is shocked and confused that the flights may be shut down.",
      "\u201cI keep saying this has to be a mistake or an oversight. We were told that those who worked with USA would not be left behind,\u201d she said in a message to NBC News. \u201cWe all followed the rules, and I cannot believe this is actually happening.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cI am worried about my family I tried so hard to bring\u00a0them here but now I\u2019m heartbroken.\u201d",
      "VanDiver said American military veterans will be devastated if their Afghan partners are left behind in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump brought up Afghanistan at every single debate. Does he know that his administration is now abandoning the very Afghan allies who fought\u00a0and shed\u00a0blood alongside those service members? We cannot believe that President Trump is aware of what\u2019s happening here,\u201d VanDiver said.",
      "\u201cVeterans put their own credibility on the line to bring our Afghan allies home. We told them that America keeps its word. Now this administration is making liars out of all of us,\u201d he said.",
      "VanDiver and other advocates said it was not too late to salvage the program with either a decision from the Trump administration or action by Congress.",
      "Kim Staffieri, executive director of the Association of Wartime Allies, a nonprofit group that helps Afghans who worked for the U.S. government, said she hoped the Trump administration would preserve the resettlement effort, as it did in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "\u201cWe made promises. They stood by our troops. We\u00a0owe it\u00a0to them to bring them to a place of safety. And we hope the administration will continue processing their applications, as they did last time,\u201d she said.",
      "The Taliban has jailed, tortured or killed Afghans who fought or worked for the former U.S.-backed government,\u00a0according to the United Nations. The Taliban deny\u00a0that, saying they announced a \u201cgeneral amnesty\u201d for former government soldiers and officials when they returned to power.",
      "Thousands of Afghans who are awaiting U.S. resettlement from third countries are in Pakistan, which says it will deport those awaiting relocation back to Afghanistan by March 31 unless their cases are swiftly processed by the governments that have agreed to take them,\u00a0The Associated Press reported."

    "story": [
      "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 He\u2019s an investment banker with a distinctly American pedigree, having studied at Harvard and Stanford before going on to work at Goldman Sachs and McKinsey. But as U.S. and Russian negotiators work to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine, Kirill Dmitriev will be trying his best to secure the best deal for one man: President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Fluent in English and married to a close friend of Putin\u2019s daughter, Dmitriev, 49, is a longtime confidante of the Russian leader, entrusted with running the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and a key player in the recent high-level talks in Saudi Arabia about ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Dmitriev was involved in the meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Yuri Ushakov, Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser, and an American delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. He also attended separate meetings in Riyadh and made an argument that might appeal to President Donald Trump\u00a0\u2014 that sanctions had cost U.S. companies billions of dollars.",
      "\u201cHis main role, his main task, is what Putin assigned him: to get the Americans to lift sanctions pressure. That\u2019s his job,\u201d Andrei Fedorov, Russia\u2019s former deputy foreign minister, told NBC News in a telephone conversation last week.",
      "Putin thinks of Dmitriev as an official who can be relied on, Fedorov said, adding that he was a \u201cvery good executor\u201d when it came to negotiations.",
      "Dmitriev has already courted the new administration in the White House by playing a crucial role in facilitating the prisoner swap that led to the release of Marc Fogel, three and a half years after a Russian court handed him a 14-year jail sentence for a minor medical cannabis infraction.",
      "Fogel, a 63-year-old teacher from Pennsylvania, flew back to the U.S. last week with Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, who credited a man called \u201cKirill\u201d for making the deal.",
      "\u201cWe had a reach-out from someone who is a go-between between the Russian government and the American government and I presented it,\u201d Witkoff told Fox News a few days after they touched down on U.S. soil. \u201cThe president and we all determined that it was credible, that there was an opportunity to get Marc Fogel back, and the president listened, carefully decided it was actionable and said hop on the plane and let\u2019s hope to get a good result.\u201d",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was also heavily involved in the deal to secure Fogel\u2019s release, according to a senior Saudi official who credited Dmitriev as \u201cabsolutely the go-to\u201d and \u201chighly active\u201d in the negotiations surrounding the exchange, which saw convicted money launderer Alexander Vinnik return to Russia.",
      "Dmitriev has long established ties with the Saudi leader and, in October 2019, he was awarded the King Abdulaziz Second-Class Order of Merit, the kingdom\u2019s highest award, for his work to strengthen cooperation between Russia and Saudi Arabia after he helped secure an oil price agreement under the expanded OPEC+ producers\u2019 forum.",
      "\u201cHe is well connected with the Saudis; he is one of them,\u201d Fedorov said. \u201cThey make money together.\u201d He added that when the prisoner exchange was broached, \u201cthe Saudis were the first to confirm that they were willing to help with the matter.\u201d",
      "The Saudi award was another in a long list of honors for Dmitriev, who has been presented with no less than three titles, the Order of Alexander Nevsky, the Order of Honour and the Order of Friendship, by the Kremlin.",
      "But his success has come as little surprise to those who have tracked his career.",
      "Born in what is now Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, but was then part of the Soviet Union, as a teenager Dmitriev took part of a high-school exchange with the U.S., where he later returned to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree at Stanford University and an MBA at Harvard. In 2009 he was a \u201cyoung global leader\u201d at the World Economic Forum.",
      "He went on to work in Ukraine before moving back to Russia, where American business channels CNBC and Bloomberg would feature him because of his expertise on local markets.",
      "Putin then tapped him up to head the Russian Direct Investment Fund, which was created in 2011 to facilitate foreign investment.",
      "Describing him as \u201cextraordinarily smart,\u201d a senior U.S. finance executive who asked not to be named to protect their business relationships, said Dmitriev was able to move in Western circles \u201cwith ease.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of Russians who speak good English have no f---ing idea how we think,\u201d he said. \u201cHe actually is a guy who has spent enough time with Westerners, particularly Americans, and he actually has a pretty good feel for how we process information.\u201d",
      "While Dmitriev was \u201cvery pro-American and pro-Western,\u201d he added that he was \u201cultimately totally loyal and patriotic to Russia\u201d and Putin.",
      "In his role, he subsequently championed his country and encouraged investment in the face of hostility about the Russian annexation of Crimea.",
      "He also played a part in early contacts with the U.S. when Trump was first elected president in 2016. Among the people he met was Erik Prince, the founder of the now defunct Blackwater security firm and a supporter of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential run.",
      "Their secret meeting in the Four Seasons Hotel in the Seychelles, on Jan. 11, 2017, was featured in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, which said Dmitriev sought an introduction to a Trump transition team member in order to begin improving U.S.-Russia ties.",
      "Two years later, as Covid-19 pandemic took hold, Dmitriev invested in and promoted Russia\u2019s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine.",
      "But after Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Dmitriev seemed to disappear from public view in the West, although he routinely attended major events in Russia and met Putin on several occasions. He also made regular media appearances in his homeland.",
      "Four days after Russian forces crossed into Ukraine, the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned Dmitriev, calling him a \u201cclose associate of Putin.\u201d His wife, Natalya Popova, \u201cbelieved to be close to one of Putin\u2019s daughters, Katerina Tikhonova,\u201d was also sanctioned.",
      "But after Trump was elected again last year, Dmitriev re-entered the spotlight praising the president\u2019s \u201cdecisive leadership\u201d as he issued a series of executive orders.",
      "The week before Trump\u2019s inauguration he met with Putin to talk about Russian investments, according to the Kremlin\u2019s website.",
      "After the ceasefire talks in Riyadh, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both countries had agreed to re-establish \u201cthe functionality of our respective missions in Washington and Moscow\u201d and that Washington would create a high-level team to work on a path to ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Dmitriev was there to discuss \u201ceconomic issues,\u201d according to Ushakov, Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser.",
      "Whether those discussions included the lifting of American sanctions is unclear, but Fedorov, Russia\u2019s former deputy foreign minister, was convinced that he would eventually achieve that goal.",
      "\u201cWhen he is given a task, he does it,\u201d he said.",
      "Keir Simmons reported from Riyadh and Natasha Lebedeva from Washington."

      "The exchange comes at a crucial time for Ukraine, which is struggling to lock in Western support to fight Russian invaders who have occupied 20% of the country and regularly bomb its cities and infrastructure.",
      "Trump also called Zelenskyy a \u201cmodestly successful comedian\u201d who \u201ctalked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn\u2019t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and \u2018TRUMP,\u2019 will never be able to settle.\"",

It\u2019s all-important that security guarantees remain on the table\u2014and that they work for Ukraine, for real and lasting peace.\" The two appeared on the same panel at the Munich Security Conference last week.",
      "Zelenskyy, who was a popular actor and comedian before running for president, earlier referred to U.S. support given to Ukraine so far \u2014 $67 billion in weapons and $31.5 billion. He added that American demands that Ukraine should hand over more than $500 billion in rare earth minerals was \u201cnot a serious conversation\u201d and added that he cannot sell his country.",
      "Zelenskyy's pugnacious comments about not wanting \u201canyone making decisions behind our backs\u201d came in response to Trump saying that Ukraine was responsible for Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said Wednesday in an interview on Fox News that no one should criticize Trump for trying to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict. \"What he said yesterday and today is, why hasn\u2019t President Zelenskyy tried to end this war for the betterment of his country? And we have to ask ourselves, is Ukraine\u2019s position improving or not on the battlefield?\" he said.",
      "Waltz also added that there has been \"bizarre pushback and escalation of rhetoric\" over the Trump administration's proposal to invest in Ukrainian infrastructure and rare minerals.",

      "Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Ministry promptly dismissed the allegation, saying that the authorities were only trying to facilitate conditions for the swift return of Afghans to their home country.",
      "Pakistan has long threatened to deport Afghans living in the country illegally.",
      "Separately, Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister\u00a0Shehbaz Sharif\u00a0last month approved a March 31 deadline to deport those awaiting relocation to third countries unless their cases are swiftly processed by the governments that have agreed to take them, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "More than 800,000 Afghans have returned home or have been expelled by force from Pakistan since 2023, according to the International Organization for Migration, a U.N. agency that tracks migrations.",
      "In a strongly worded statement on Wednesday, the Afghan Embassy \u2014 which represents the Taliban-run government of Afghanistan \u2014 criticized \u201cthe short timeframe\u201d given by the authorities in Islamabad and \u201cthe unilateral nature of Pakistan\u2019s decision.\u201d",
      "Afghans in Islamabad and the nearby garrison city of Rawalpindi\u00a0have been subjected to arrests, searches, and orders\u00a0from police to leave the the two cities and relocate to other parts of Pakistan, the embassy said.",

      "There are also some\u00a01.45 million Afghan refugees, registered with the U.N. refugee agency, most of whom fled during the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation of their country. Last July, Pakistan extended the stay of refugees registered with the UNHCR until June 2025, saying they will not be arrested or deported at least until the extension expires.",
