      "Hungarian authorities have banned the Irish-language rap group Kneecap from entering the country",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Members of the Irish-language rap group Kneecap were banned from entering Hungary ahead of their scheduled performance at the popular Sziget Festival as authorities argued the musicians' presence in the country would constitute a risk to national security.",
      "The Belfast trio, scheduled to play on Sziget's closing day on Aug. 11, is known for anarchic energy, satirical lyrics and use of symbolism associated with the Irish republican movement, which seeks to unite Northern Ireland, currently part of the U.K., with the Republic of Ireland.",
      "The group has faced criticism for lyrics laden with expletives and drug references and for political statements seeming to glorify militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.",
      "Kneecap has accused critics of trying to silence the band because of its support for the Palestinian cause throughout Israel's war in Gaza and say they don\u2019t support Hezbollah and Hamas nor condone violence.",
      "Hungary's immigration authority, the National Directorate-General for Aliens Policing, published decrees on Thursday declaring Kneecap members Naoise \u00d3 Caireall\u00e1in, J.J. \u00d3 Dochartaigh and Liam \u00d3g \u00d3hAnnaidh would be banned from Hungary's territory for three years since their \u201centry and stay constitute a serious threat to national security.\u201d",

      "Hungarian authorities and other groups had earlier pushed Sziget Festival to cancel the band's performance. Hungary's minister for European affairs, J\u00e1nos B\u00f3ka, noted the government\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy toward antisemitism in a July 11 letter to the festival's organizers.",
      "Hundreds of figures from Hungary's music and cultural community also have signed a petition calling for Kneecap's performance to be cancelled.",
      "The group performed in April at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California, where they accused Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians enabled by the U.S. government. That sparked calls for the rappers\u2019 U.S. visas to be revoked and several Kneecap gigs have since been canceled as a result.",

      "George Kooymans, guitarist and co-founder of the Dutch band Golden Earring, has died at 77",
      "NEW YORK -- George Kooymans, the guitarist and co-founder of the Dutch band Golden Earring who co-wrote the hard-rock classic \u201cRadar Love\u201d and wrote and shared lead vocals on the top 10 hit \u201cTwilight Zone,\u201d has died at age 77.",
      "Kooymans' family and the surviving members of Golden Earring announced that he had died Wednesday from complications of ALS, which he had been diagnosed with in 2020. He retired from the band soon after.",
      "\u201cGeorge bore this devastating and debilitating illness with exceptional strength and dignity,\u201d the statement from Golden Earring reads in part. \u201cWe bid farewell to a great musician and composer, whose work extended beyond Golden Earring. George was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, but above all, a friend.\u201d",
      "A native of The Hague, Kooymans was in his mid-teens when he helped found what became Golden Earring in the early 1960s: The band's name was inspired by an instrumental of the time, \u201cGolden Earrings.\u201d He was also a core member of the group's best known lineup, which featured drummer Cesar Zuiderwijk, singer-guitarist Barry Hay and bassist-keyboardist Rinus Gerritsen and stayed together from 1970 until Koosyman's departure.",
      "With more than 20 top 10 singles in their native country, Golden Earring had more success at home than overseas. But they began to attract an underground following in the U.S. in the late 1960s and broke through commercially in 1973 with the worldwide hit \u201cRadar Love,\" which has been covered by U2, R.E.M. and hundreds of others and used on the soundtrack to \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d \u201cWayne's World 2\u201d and other films.",
      "\u201cRadar Love,\u201d with its stately opening riff and memorable opening line \u201cI\u2019ve been driving all night, my hands wet on the wheel,\u201d was once ranked by Rolling Stone as among the greatest road trip songs.",

      "NEW YORK -- MrBeast's new CEO hit Wall Street Wednesday as YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson's media empire looks to develop long-term brand partnerships and, in turn, unlock more funding for its charitable content.",
      "Venture capitalist Jeff Housenbold took over MrBeast leadership last summer with a mandate to professionalize an ever-growing entertainment company. YouTube's most popular creator had reached record audience levels far outpacing its startup days, while vowing to reassess its internal culture amid multiple controversies. But, despite joining Nasdaq's closing bell ceremony on Wednesday, Housenbold said their strategic plan does not currently include a public offering \u2014 or any active funding rounds.",
      "\u201cDo I want to make banger content? Yeah. That\u2019s cool,\" Housenbold told The Associated Press. \"But what can we do with that banger content? Generate profits, make a sustainable business that gives us greater ability to impact people\u2019s lives around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re marching quickly to profitability, so we don\u2019t have to raise additional capital,\u201d he added.",
      "Instead, MrBeast is focused on securing multi-year exclusive advertising deals as opposed to single-video brand partnerships. With 416 million subscribers and legions of impressionable young fans, Housenbold argued that MrBeast is uniquely positioned to deliver more bang for companies' marketing bucks by pointing that \u201cfirehouse of attention\u201d at them.",
      "Along the way, Housenbold said he is encouraging Donaldson to tout the channel's charitable works \u2014 which often feature quantifiable stunts such as building wells, removing ocean plastic or covering cataract surgery costs. The company, in his view, \u201ccan do good while doing well.\u201d",

      "New projects such as the Amazon Prime reality show and a James Patterson novel from HarperCollins aim to diversify the genders and ages of his audience. Housenbold said that base has historically consisted mostly of 8-to-25-year-olds and men.",
      "But Housenbold acknowledged missteps in last year's production of \u201cBeast Games,\" which prompted allegations of \u201cunsafe\u201d conditions from some contestants who said an unorganized set led to injuries, irregular food provision and lacking access to medication. While describing most of those reports as \u201cinaccurate,\u201d Housenbold said they were \u201cbetter prepared\u201d for the second season's recently wrapped shoot.",

But it did attract the attention of Mick Fleetwood, who invited Buckingham to join Fleetwood Mac. Buckingham in turn insisted Nicks come, too. The two, then a couple, became the central faces, voices and songwriters of the group for the four decades that followed.",
      "The pair\u2019s tumultuous relationship appeared across the band\u2019s discography: She wrote \u201cDreams\u201d about him. He wrote \u201cGo Your Own Way\u201d about her. Infamously, they broke up while writing the 1977 hit album \u201cRumours.\u201d Footage of Nicks staring down Buckingham 20 years later during a performance of \u201cSilver Springs\u201d routinely goes viral (\u201cYou'll never get away from the sound of the woman that loves you,\u201d Nicks and Buckingham sing in unison, at one point, holding each other's gaze.)",
      "Buckingham left the band in 1987, returning in 1996. The last time the band reunited, however, for a 2018-2019 tour, the rest of the members kicked Buckingham out, and as a result, he sued them. He claimed he was told five days after the group appeared at Radio City Music Hall that the band would tour without him. He says he would have been paid at least $12 million for his share of the proceeds. Later that year, Buckingham said they had settled the lawsuit.",
      "Both Buckingham and Nicks have also released reams of solo music. Some fans had theorized that Nicks and Buckingham were teasing a Fleetwood Mac reunion, which would have been the first since the death of vocalist, songwriter and keyboard player Christine McVie in 2022.",
      "Last year, Nicks told MOJO that without McVie, \u201cthere is no chance of putting Fleetwood Mac back together in any way.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A doctor charged with giving Matthew Perry ketamine in the weeks leading up to the \u201cFriends\u201d star's overdose death is expected to plead guilty Wednesday.",
      "Dr. Salvador Plasencia would be the fourth of five people charged in connection with Perry's death to plead guilty.",
      "Plasencia was to have gone on trial in August until the doctor agreed last month to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine, according to the signed document filed in federal court in Los Angeles.",
      "He had previously pleaded not guilty, but in exchange for the guilty pleas prosecutors have agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.",
      "Plasencia's attorneys emphasized in an email after he reached his agreement that he \u201cwas not treating Matthew Perry at the time of his death and the ketamine that caused Mr. Perry\u2019s death was not provided by Dr. Plasencia.\u201d",
      "The remaining charges can carry a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, and there is no guarantee he'll get less, but he's likely to. Plasencia has been free on bond since shortly after his arrest in August. He will not be sentenced until a future hearing.",
      "The only remaining defendant who has not reached an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office is Jasveen Sangha, who prosecutors allege is a drug dealer known as the \u201cKetamine Queen\u201d and sold Perry the lethal dose. Her trial is scheduled to begin next month. She has pleaded not guilty.",
      "According to prosecutors and co-defendants who reached their own deals, Plasencia illegally supplied Perry with a large amount of ketamine starting about a month before his death on Oct. 28, 2023.",
      "According to a co-defendant, Plasencia in a text message called the actor a \u201cmoron\u201d who could be exploited for money.",
      "Perry's personal assistant, his friend, and another doctor all agreed to plead guilty last year in exchange for their cooperation as the government sought to make their case against larger targets, Plasencia and Sangha. None have been sentenced yet.",
      "Perry was found dead by the assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa. The medical examiner ruled that ketamine, typically used as a surgical anesthetic, was the primary cause of death.",

      "For much of his life, the Black Sabbath founder and legendary heavy metal frontman who died at 76 on Tuesday was known to much of the public as a dark purveyor of deeds ranging from decadent to downright Satanic.",
      "Wild stories followed him. Clergy condemned him. Parents sued him.",
      "But with the debut of his family reality show on MTV, the world learned what those who'd been paying closer attention already knew: Ozzy Osbourne was soft and fuzzy under the darkness.",
      "During its relatively short run from 2002 to 2005, \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d became a runaway hit and made stars of his wife Sharon and kids Jack and Kelly. But more than that, it made a star of the domesticated version of Ozzy Osbourne, and in the process changed reality TV.",
      "In 2025, when virtually every variety of celebrity has had a reality show, it's hard to see what a novelty the series was. MTV sold it as television's first \u201creality sitcom.\"",
      "\u201cJust the idea of the Black Sabbath founder, who will forever be known for biting the head off a bat during a 1982 concert, as a family man seems strange,\u201d Associated Press Media Writer David Bauder wrote on the eve of \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d premiere. But on the show, Osbourne was \"sweetly funny \u2014 and under everything a lot like the put-upon dads you\u2019ve been seeing in television sitcoms for generations.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s not the guy that everyone associates with the \u2018Prince of Darkness\u2019 and all this craziness,\u201d Deraney said. \"And people loved him.

      "They sat on the couch. They ate dinner. The now-sober Ozzy sipped Diet Cokes, and urged his kids not to indulge in alcohol or drugs when they went out. He struggled to find the History Channel on his satellite TV. They feuded with the neighbors because, of all things, their loud music was driving the Osbournes crazy.",

      "Like family sitcoms, the affection its leads clearly had for each other was essential to its appeal.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it will once again withdraw from the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, an expected move that has the U.S. further retreating from international organizations.",
      "The decision to pull U.S. funding and participation from UNESCO comes two years after the Biden administration rejoined following a controversial, five-year absence that began during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. The White House cited similar concerns as it did in 2018, saying it believes U.S. involvement is not in its national interest and accusing the agency of promoting anti-Israel speech.",
      "The decision, which won't go into effect until December 2026, will deal a blow to an agency known for preserving cultural heritage through its UNESCO World Heritage Sites program \u2014 which recognizes significant landmarks for protection, ranging from the Taj Mahal to Egypt's pyramids of Giza and the Grand Canyon National Park. The agency also empowers education and science across the globe.",
      "It is the Trump administration\u2019s latest move to pull support for U.N. agencies under a larger campaign to reshape U.S. diplomacy. Under the \"America First\" approach, the administration has pulled out of the U.N. World Health Organization and the top U.N. human rights body, while reassessing its funding for others. This has left the U.N., which is in the process of its own massive overhaul, reevaluating core programs and initiatives and what the international body would look like without support from the U.S. \u2014 its largest donor.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement that the withdrawal was linked to UNESCO\u2019s perceived agenda to \u201cadvance divisive social and cultural causes.\u201d",
      "She added that UNESCO\u2019s decision in 2011 \u201cto admit the \u2018State of Palestine\u2019 as a Member State is highly problematic, contrary to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization.\u201d",
      "UNESCO director general Audrey Azoulay said she \u201cdeeply\u201d regrets the U.S. decision but said it was expected and that the agency \u201chas prepared for it.\u201d She also denied accusations of anti-Israel bias, saying it contradicts \u201cthe reality of UNESCO\u2019s efforts, particularly in the field of Holocaust education and the fight against antisemitism.\u201d",
      "Azoulay added that \u201cthe reasons put forward by the United States of America are the same as seven years ago, even though the situation has changed profoundly, political tensions have receded, and UNESCO today constitutes a rare forum for consensus on concrete and action-oriented multilateralism.\"",
      "Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the U.N., celebrated the announcement, saying in a statement that it is a \u201cfitting response to the consistent misguided anti-Israel bias of UNESCO, an organization that has lost its way.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration had rejoined UNESCO in 2023 after citing concerns that China was filling the gap left by the U.S. in UNESCO policymaking, notably in setting standards for artificial intelligence and technology education.",
      "\u201cUnilaterally withdrawing the United States from UNESCO is another assault by the Trump administration on international cooperation and U.S. global leadership,\" Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said.",

While the U.S. had previously provided a notable share of the agency\u2019s budget, UNESCO has diversified its funding sources in recent years as the U.S. contribution has decreased. Today, American assistance represents only 8% of the agency\u2019s total budget.",

      "A godfather and force of heavy metal, Osbourne died Tuesday at 76, just weeks after his last performance.",
      "The English icon's idiosyncratic, throaty voice launched generations of metalheads, both through his work at the reins of Black Sabbath and in his solo career. Across his repertoire, there are songs with total global ubiquity and lesser-known innovations with his unique, spooky aesthetic quality.",
      "To celebrate Osbourne\u2019s life and legacy, we've selected just a few songs that made the man, from timeless tunes to a few left-of-center selections.",

      "It would be a challenge to name a more immediately recognizable guitar riff than the one that launches Black Sabbath's 1970 megahit \u201cIron Man.\u201d It transcends the metal genre \u2014 an all-timer heard around the world and in guitar stores everywhere.",
      "One of the great Vietnam War protest songs, Black Sabbath's \u201cWar Pigs\u201d is a rare moment where hippies and metalheads can agree: \u201cPoliticians hide themselves away / They only started the war / Why should they go out to fight?\u201d Osbourne sings in the bridge.",
      "Osbourne's heaviest performances are at least partially indebted to Black Sabbath's bassist and lyricist Terry \u201cGeezer\u201d Butler, and there is perhaps no better example than \u201cChildren of the Grave,\u201d the single from the band's 1971 album, \u201cMaster of Reality.\u201d \u201cMust the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?\u201d Osbourne embodies Butler's words, a sonic fist lifted in the air. \u201cCan they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?\u201d",
      "Black Sabbath were in a creative rut in the time period leading up to \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath,\u201d the opening track from their 1973 album of the same name.

      "LAS VEGAS -- While Bronny James and other young talent were lighting up the NBA Summer League court in Las Vegas, another game was being played just a few steps away: One with scripts, storyboards and studio buzz.",
      "Inside the Thomas & Mack Center, just as the league wrapped up Sunday, a different kind of crowd formed. Hollywood execs, producers and curious power players were slipping away from the basketball action to catch a slate of 34 film projects created by NBA stars past and present.",
      "More than just film screenings, it\u2019s an emerging playground where sports and the art of storytelling collide. From baseline to backlot, the Summer League Film Festival is generating off-court buzz \u2014 with the likes of Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett, actor-producer Mark Wahlberg and filmmaker Deon Taylor joining the mix. Conversations are building on turning this three-day showcase into a launchpad for athlete-filmmakers, backed by film industry veterans who understand both the creative and business sides of shaping ideas and grooming projects for the screen.",
      "\u201cThis definitely has legs,\u201d said retired NBA player Stacey Augmon after previewing \u201cUNLV: Kings of Vegas,\u201d a documentary chronicling the untold story of the Runnin\u2019 Rebels in the Strip View Pavilion. A 10-minute clip was screened before a packed audience, including Sundance Film Festival director Michelle Satter and production companies like the Wahlberg co-owned Unrealistic Ideas and Alcon Entertainment, the company behind \u201cThe Book of Eli\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d",
      "Like other entries, the \u201cKings of Vegas\u201d team showcased select footage, including interviews with high-profile names such as Snoop Dogg, Chuck D and Jimmy Kimmel, alongside UNLV legends Augmon, Larry Johnson, Greg Anthony and others. After the screening, the producers and cast discussed the film\u2019s origins, drawing a standing ovation from the crowd.",
      "The documentary remains in development, but Augmon says the film festival is already proving its worth.",
      "\u201cThis gives us another great avenue,\u201d said Augmon, who played on the Runnin' Rebels team that won the 1990 NCAA championship before his 15-season NBA career. His college teammate, Anderson Hunt, said sharing their authentic, real-life stories offer a major advantage like never before, unlocking new pathways to getting their projects financed and sold.",
      "\u201cWe have control of what's coming out,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cPeople might know about our stories through the internet. But stuff like this takes our platform to the next level. This is great for us, and Deon is like a golden child.\u201d",
      "The festival spotlighted stories produced by NBA stars past and present including Nikola Jokic, Luguentz Dort, Tony Allen, Nate Robinson, Kyle Anderson, Cole Anthony, Keyon Dooling and Udonis Haslem.",
      "Deon and Roxanne Avent Taylor of Hidden Empire Film Group were tapped to infuse the festival with seasoned filmmaking expertise, helping bridge the worlds of sports and entertainment. He played a key role in encouraging Hollywood insiders to show up, especially during the NBA Summer League's final stretch to keep the closing days as enticing as opening week.",
      "Taylor credited NBA Summer League co-founder Albert Hall for having the foresight to spark the collaboration.",
      "\u201cThis is all invaluable,\u201d said Hall, who cofounded the league with Warren LeGarie in 2004. \u201cThe players make money, no doubt about it. They invest in these projects. But they don\u2019t really know what the system can provide or how to approach it. Kind of like a young executive getting into the sport or a young player trying to be seen and get exposure. It\u2019s the same way. They have to be coached up.\u201d",
      "Hall said the partnership with Hidden Empire was a natural next step following their successful collaboration with the NFL and Skydance Sports, where they led film training sessions in March for more than 20 current and former NFL players. He added that having Wahlberg and Archie Gips of Unrealistic Ideas on board brings more industry muscle to strengthen the initiative and help drive it forward.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gateway for athletes to share their art, do their art and be creative without anyone questioning them,\u201d said Taylor, director of \u201cBlack and Blue,\u201d \u201cThe Intruder, \u201cMeet the Blacks\u201d and \u201cFatale.\u201d A former basketball player in East Germany turned independent filmmaker, he said true artistry requires neither a film school nor a Hollywood pedigree.",
      "\u201cThe greatest artists are the ones that draw, create, build, shoot in the face of negativity and who paint pictures of what they see in the times that they live in,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cYou can only do that if you live in this culture. You can do that if you've lived and experienced it. You can't do that from a high-rise building with no pain. These guys come from adversity in life and sports.\u201d",
      "EverWonder Studio president Michael Antinoro certainly thinks so, and then some. He sees the film festival as more than a one-off spectacle in Las Vegas.",
      "In Antinoro's eyes, it could become the Oscars of athlete-driven storytelling with satellite versions popping up in the NBA arenas throughout the season. He sees value in helping standout projects secure the final funding and reach the right distributors.",
      "\u201cIf we can add any value, we\u2019re in the rooms talking to all the networks and streamers that distributes films,\u201d said Antinoro, a founding partner of the studio, which specializes in nonfiction content, documentaries and live events. The company served as co-executive producer on \u201cDefiant: The Manny Pacquiao Obsession\u201d in 2019 and produced projects featuring Mike Tyson and Brett Favre.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking to them a lot. It\u2019s all about exposure,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these films maybe need a little more money just to get them over the line. If it makes sense, we can play a little there too.\u201d",
      "For Michelle Satter, it\u2019s all about fostering a supportive creative community. She sees promising potential in what\u2019s taking shape at the Summer League Film Festival.",
      "While it\u2019s still early, Satter can envision a future where projects from the festival eventually find their way into Sundance.",
      "\u201cWhy not? Of course,\u201d said Satter, a founding figure at Sundance since 1981. She now serves as the founding senior director of Sundance Institute's artist programs. She's exploring how it might support the festival after being invited by Taylor.",
      "Sundance already has an existing partnership with Taylor\u2019s Hidden Empire. She called the opportunity to collaborate on this new venture both exciting and aligned with Sundance\u2019s mission to uplift emerging voices in storytelling.",
      "Satter's late son, Michael Latt, had his documentary short \u201cHoops, Hopes & Dreams\u201d premiere at Sundance early this year. She said Sundance gets about 15,000 short film submissions each year, but there\u2019s room for compelling storytelling that opens up new perspective from an athlete\u2019s lens.",
      "\u201cThat was the power of storytelling, the unity of sports and bringing people together in community,\u201d she said. \u201cI love the idea. These are the stories people need to see. They need to be out there in the world.\u201d",

      "While not the first K-pop act to include North Korean defectors \u2014 BE BOYS\u2019 Hak Seong debuted earlier this year \u2014 the diversity of the group's members add a rare dimension to the genre\u2019s growing global diversity.",
      "The group debuts Friday with their single album \u201cThe 1st Verse\u201d under Seoul-based label Singing Beetle. Their title track \u201cShattered\u201d features lyrics co-written by Hyuk and Kenny.",

      "Hyuk, who lived in North Korea\u2019s North Hamgyong Province until age 12, defected to the South in 2013. His journey to K-pop stardom began while working in a factory in South Korea, where a chance encounter with the CEO of a music label eventually led to weekend rap lessons in Seoul.",
      "\u201cI went to university but then things went bad. It was when COVID was pretty severe, and a bad incident happened, so I had no choice but to work at a factory,\u201d he said.",
      "Initially skeptical, Hyuk thought the invitation to become a pop star might be a scam. He recalled thinking: \u201cI really have nothing right now, even if you rob me, not even dust would come out.\"",
      "After a year of meetings where the music executive consistently bought him meals and encouraged his training, Hyuk joined the agency in late 2021.",

      "In Alaska, a public radio station general manager took a moment from a busy day warning her community about a possible tsunami for a special task \u2014 sending a text message to Sen. Lisa Murkowski urging her to vote against a measure to strip federal fund...",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Lauren Adams, general manager for KUCB public radio in Unalaska, Alaska, didn't have much time to reflect on Congress, 4,000 miles away, stripping federal funding for public media this week. She's been too busy working.",
      "Sirens blared in the Aleutian Islands community Wednesday warning of a potential tsunami, with a voice over public loudspeakers urging the community's 4,100 residents to seek higher ground immediately and tune into the radio \u2014 to Adams' station.",
      "At the same time in Washington, the Senate was voting on a measure that would eliminate nearly $1.1 billion that had already been appropriated for NPR and PBS \u2014 a process that didn't end until early Thursday morning. The House completed the process in time for President Donald Trump to sign it before a Friday deadline.",
      "Trump had called for the cuts, saying public media's news programming was biased against him and fellow Republicans, and threatened GOP members of Congress with primary challenges if they didn't fall in line.",
      "Adams, her news director, a reporter and an intern kept broadcasting and updating KUCB's social media feed until the danger passed. Then she made time for one more task \u2014 texting U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and urging her to vote against the bill. Murkowski was one of two Republican senators, along with Susan Collins of Maine, to publicly dissent.",
      "\u201cI thought that it was such a telling story of why her constituents have a different relationship to public radio than maybe some other regions of the United States,\u201d Adams said.",
      "The federal money is appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes it to NPR and PBS. Roughly 70% of the money goes directly to the 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations across the country, although that's only a shorthand way to describe its potential impact.",
      "The cuts are expected to weigh most heavily on smaller public media outlets away from big cities, and it's likely some won't survive. Katherine Maher, NPR's president and CEO, estimated as many as 80 NPR stations may face closure in the next year. Some stations are already fielding offers from commercial entities to buy their broadcast licenses, she said.",
      "\u201cMany of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,\u201d said Paula Kerger, PBS president and CEO. \u201cThere is nothing more American than PBS. Despite today's setback, we are determined to keep fighting to preserve the essential services we provide to the American public.\u201d",
      "The measure will cost PBS and NPR stations in Mississippi roughly $2 million, about 15% of the budget, said Royal Aills, executive director of Mississippi Public Broadcasting.",
      "Already, Mississippi Public Broadcasting has decided to eliminate a streaming channel that airs children's programming like \u201cCaillou\u201d and \u201cDaniel Tiger's Neighborhood\u201d to the state's youngsters 24 hours a day, said Taiwo Gaynor, the system's chief content officer.",
      "\u201cThis is important for families, to have access to content that they don't have to pay for,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cThat is a sad thought, to think that we ... might not be able to provide that for a generation of children.\u201d",
      "Maine\u2019s public media system is looking at a hit of $2.5 million, or about 12% of its budget, for the next fiscal year, said Rick Schneider, president and chief executive officer of Maine Public. He said he\u2019s not ready to identify specific cuts, but the system is preparing to reinvent itself to make certain it continues serving the state\u2019s residents.",
      "Maine\u2019s rural residents rely heavily on public media for weather updates and disaster alerts, said Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of ACLU of Maine. Rowles said public media was a \u201clifeline\u201d to her growing up off the grid.",
      "NPR's Maher fears what the cuts might mean for the system's journalism, not just in rural areas where local news can be hard to come by, but in telling the rest of the country what is going on there. Less funding will also mean less support for popular television and radio programming, although it's too soon to tell which programs will be affected.",
      "NPR stations also use millions of dollars in federal money to pay music licensing fees. Now many will have to renegotiate these deals, which could mean less music, or a more limited variety of music, on outlets where music discovery is a big part of their identity. For example, Maher estimates that some 96% of all classical music broadcast in the United States is on NPR stations. \u201cThat is essentially taking an entire art form out of public access,\u201d she said.",

      "Already, public media is seeing an increase in donations from reader and viewers to support its mission, and stations are actively sounding the alarm. In a plea to listeners on its website Thursday, Philadelphia's WXPN radio pointed to its legacy in helping people discover new music. \u201cThe most important thing you can do is support WXPN and the public media system in a way that is meaningful to you,\u201d the station urged on its website.",
      "But donations aren't going to fill the hole left by the loss in federal funding, Maher said. The public media leaders have already turned to lobbying Congress to restore some of the funding through the appropriations process for next year's budget. They don't know how much time they have; Maher said it would be inordinately costly, and perhaps prohibitive, to reopen a radio station that is forced to close.",
      "Public media isn't getting any help from states, either. At least five states have reduced their own outlays for public media this year, either for budget or political reasons.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example, vetoed nearly $6 million that Florida lawmakers had set aside for public broadcasters the day before the state's budget took effect on July 1. \u201cDone in Florida,\u201d DeSantis responded on social media to a Trump post calling public broadcasting a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d that should be defunded.",

Griffin said the station\u2019s board has already agreed on a plan to furlough staff members one day a month, and he\u2019s taking a 50% pay cut.",
      "The station covers Kodiak Island, home to one of the nation\u2019s largest U.S. Coast Guard bases.",
      "\u201cWe have to dip into our savings while we figure out what KMXT is going to look like over the next six months, Griffin said. \u201dAt least for the next year we\u2019ll be fine but we\u2019re probably going to have to look at leasing space in our building to other organizations to help fill that gap.\u201d",

      "The worst water Colt Smith has seen in 14 years with Utah\u2019s Division of Drinking Water was at a mobile home park, where residents had been drinking it for years before state officials discovered the contamination.",
      "The well water carried cancer-causing arsenic as much as 10 times the federal limit. Smith had to put the rural park under a do-not-drink order that lasted nearly 10 years.",
      "\u201cThe Health Department refers it to us like ... \u2018Why aren\u2019t you guys regulating it?\u2019 We had no idea it existed,\u201d he said.",
      "More than 50 years after the Safe Drinking Water Act was passed to ensure that Americans\u2019 water is free from harmful bacteria, lead and other dangerous substances, millions of people living in mobile home parks can\u2019t always count on those basic protections.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found that nearly 70% of mobile home parks running their own water systems violated safe drinking water rules in the past five years, a higher rate than utilities that supply water for cities and towns, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. And the problems are likely even bigger because the EPA database doesn\u2019t catch all parks.",
      "Even where parks get water from an outside source \u2014 such as a city \u2014 the clean water coming in can become contaminated if it passes through problematic infrastructure before reaching residents' taps. Because the EPA doesn\u2019t generally require this water to be tested and regulated, the problems may go unseen.",
      "Utah is one of the few states to step in with their own rules, according to an AP survey of state policies.",
      "\u201cIf you look back at the history of the Safe Drinking Water Act, like in the \u201970s when they were starting, it was, \u2018Well, as long as the source \u2026 is protected, then by the time it gets to the tap, it\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 And that\u2019s just not how it works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "In one Colorado mobile home park, raw sewage backed up into a bathtub. In a Michigan park, the taps often ran dry and the water resembled tea; in Iowa, it looked like coffee \u2014 scaring residents off drinking it and ruining laundry they could hardly afford to replace. In California, boxes of bottled water crowd a family's kitchen over fears of arsenic.",
      "Almost 17 million people in the U.S. live in mobile homes. Some are comfortable Sun Belt retirees. Many others have modest incomes and see mobile homes as a rare opportunity for home ownership.",
      "To understand how water in the parks can be so troubled, it\u2019s useful to remember that residents often own their homes but rent the land they sit on. Despite the name, it's difficult and expensive to move a mobile home. That means they\u2019re \u201chalfway homeowners,\u201d said Esther Sullivan, a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado in Denver who lived in several mobile home parks as she researched a book. Residents often put up with \u201creally egregious\u201d property maintenance by landlords because all their money is tied up in their home, she said.",
      "Pamela Maxey, 51, of Kalamazoo, Michigan, said she had forgotten what it was like to have reliable, clean water until she traveled to her state Capitol last year to advocate for better mobile home park protections and stayed in a hotel. By then, she had spent eight years in a park where sewage backed up into homes and the flow of tap water was sometimes weak or discolored.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I went into the bathroom to take a shower that I realized, \u2018I don\u2019t have to jump in here and squint my eyes closed the entire time and make sure water doesn\u2019t get in my mouth because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI went to brush my teeth, and I just turned the faucet on and I brushed my teeth from the water coming from the faucet. I haven\u2019t been able to do that for over a year.\u201d",
      "Victoria Silva, a premed student in Fort Collins, Colorado, estimates the water in Harmony Village Mobile Home Park where Silva lives went out or lost pressure 20 to 30 times over roughly three years there.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much water they need until the water is out for five minutes when they need to flush, when they need to rinse something off their hands, when they need to make some pasta,\u201d Silva said.",
      "The park's owner says a licensed professional ensures water is maintained and tested, and outages are minimized.",
      "The U.S. has some 50,000 water utilities, most serving small towns and rural areas. Many struggle to find expert staff and funding, and they violate clean water rules more often than the handful of large utilities that serve cities. But even among the hard-pressed small utilities, mobile home parks stand out.",
      "The AP analysis found that more than half these parks failed to perform a required test for at least one contaminant, or failed to properly report the results, in the past five years. And they are far more likely to be repeat offenders of safe drinking water rules overall.",
      "But that's only part of the story. The true rates of mobile home park violations aren\u2019t knowable because the EPA doesn\u2019t track them well. The agency\u2019s tap water violation database depends on information from states that often don\u2019t properly categorize mobile home parks.",
      "When Smith first searched Utah\u2019s database in response to an AP request for data from all 50 states, he found only four small water systems identified as belonging to mobile home parks. With some keyword searches, he identified 33 more.",
      "Other parks aren\u2019t in the databases at all and may be completely unregulated.",

      "\u201cIt was literally us driving around and going, \u2018Wait a minute, there\u2019s a bunch of mobile home parks!\u2019\u201d said Amy Miller, who previously served as EPA\u2019s head of enforcement for the Pacific Southwest region.",
      "The water in these other parks had been off their radar. At some, testing found high levels of cancer-causing arsenic in the water that had been provided to residents for years.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many unnoticed parks are out there. Most states aren\u2019t actively looking for them and say they find very few. In Colorado, after the state passed a new law to require water testing at all mobile home parks, officials uncovered 79 parks with their source of water unknown. That\u2019s about a tenth of the total parks in the state.",
      "Many parks are decades old with aging pipes that can cause chronic water problems, even if the water that supplies the park is clean when it enters the system.",
      "Jake Freeman, the engineering director at Central States Water Resources, a Missouri-based private utility company that specializes in taking over small water systems in 11 states, said substandard and poorly installed pipes are more common to see in mobile home parks.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s hard to find the piping in the mobile home parks because if there\u2019s any kind of obstruction, they just go around it,\u201d he said. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like spaghetti laying in the ground.\u201d",
      "After a major winter storm devastated Texas in 2021, Freeman said, the company found pipes at parks it had taken over that \u201cwere barely buried. Some of them weren\u2019t buried.\u201d",
      "When pipes break and leak, the pressure drops and contaminants can enter water lines. In addition, parks sometimes have stagnant water \u2014 where pipes dead-end or water sits unused \u2014 that increases the risk of bacterial growth.",
      "Rebecca Sadosky is public water supply chief in North Carolina, where mobile home communities make up close to 40% of all water systems. She said owners don\u2019t always realize when they buy a park that they could also be running a mini utility.",
      "\u201cI think they don\u2019t know that they\u2019re getting into the water business,\u201d she said.",
      "Utah is a rare state that enforces safe drinking water standards even within mobile home parks that get their water from another provider, according to AP\u2019s survey of states. A small number of other states like New Hampshire have taken some steps to address water safety in these parks, but in most states frustrated residents may have no one to turn to for help beyond the park owner.",
      "In Colorado, when Silva asked officials who enforces safe drinking water rules, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t get clear answers.\u201d",
      "Steve Via, director of federal regulations at the American Water Works Association utility group, argued against regulating mobile home parks that get their water from a municipality, saying that would further stretch an already taxed oversight system. And if those parks are regulated, what\u2019s to stop the rules from extending to the privately owned pipes in big apartment buildings \u2014 the line has to be drawn somewhere, he said.",
      "Via said residents of parks where an owner refuses to fix water problems have options, including going to their local health departments, suing or complaining publicly.",
      "Silva is among the advocates who fought for years to change Colorado\u2019s rules before they succeeded in passing a law in 2023 that requires water testing in every mobile home park. It gives health officials the ability to go beyond federal law to address taste, color and smell that can make people afraid to drink their water, even when it\u2019s not a health risk. The state is now a leader in protecting mobile home park tap water.",
      "Smith, the Utah environmental scientist, said stopping the contaminated water flowing into the mobile home park and connecting it to a safe supply felt like a career highlight.",
      "He said Utah's culture of making do with scarce water contributed to a willingness for stronger testing and regulations than the federal government requires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s sort of the communal nature of like, everybody should have access to clean water,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to transcend political ideologies; it seems to transcend religious ideologies.\u201d",

      "The U.S. was once among only a few developed countries with a rate that ensured each generation had enough children to replace itself \u2014 about 2.1 kids per woman. But it has been sliding in America for close to two decades as more women are waiting longer to have children or never taking that step at all.",
      "The new statistic is on par with fertility rates in western European countries, according to World Bank data.",
      "Alarmed by recent drops, the Trump administration has taken steps to increase falling birth rates, like issuing an executive order meant to expand access to and reduce costs of in vitro fertilization and backing the idea of \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d that might encourage more couples to have kids.",
      "But there's no reason to be alarmed, according to Leslie Root, a University of Colorado Boulder researcher focused on fertility and population policy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this as part of an ongoing process of fertility delay. We know that the U.S. population is still growing, and we still have a natural increase \u2014 more births than deaths,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the statistic for the total fertility rate with updated birth data for 2024.",
      "In the early 1960s, the U.S. total fertility rate was around 3.5, but plummeted to 1.7 by 1976 after the Baby Boom ended.

The rate in 2023 was 1.621, and inched down in 2024 to 1.599, according to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for donation by some patients who showed signs of life",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for organ donation by some patients who showed signs of life, officials told Congress Tuesday.",
      "While the organ removals were canceled, near misses that some lawmakers called horrifying should never happen. A House subcommittee asked how to repair trust in the transplant network for potential organ donors and families -- some of whom have opted out of donor registries after these cases were publicized.",
      "\u201cWe have to get this right,\u201d said Rep. Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee and whose mother died waiting for a liver transplant.",
      "\u201cHopefully people will walk away today knowing we need to address issues but still confident that they can give life,\u201d Guthrie said, adding that he will remain a registered organ donor.",
      "The hearing came after a federal investigation began last fall into allegations that a Kentucky donation group pressured a hospital in 2021 to proceed with plans to withdraw life support and retrieve organs from a man despite signs that he might be waking up from his drug overdose. That surgery never happened after a doctor noticed him moving and moaning while being transported to the operating room \u2014 and the man survived.",
      "Lawmakers stressed most organ donations proceed appropriately and save tens of thousands of lives a year. But the federal probe \u2013 concluded in March but only made public ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing -- cited a \u201cconcerning pattern of risk\u201d in dozens of other cases involving the Kentucky group's initial planning to recover someone's organs.",
      "The report said some should have been stopped or reassessed earlier, and mostly involved small or rural hospitals with less experience in caring for potential organ donors.",
      "The Kentucky organ procurement organization, or OPO, has made changes and the national transplant network is working on additional steps. But notably absent Tuesday was any testimony from hospitals \u2013 whose doctors must independently determine a patient is dead before donation groups are allowed to retrieve organs.",
      "Here's a look at how the nation's transplant system works.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list and about 13 a day die waiting, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.",
      "Only about 1% of deaths occur in a way that allows someone to even be considered for organ donation. Most people declared dead in a hospital will quickly be transferred to a funeral home or morgue instead.",

      "Data from the Education Department shows the pace at which it resolves civil rights complaints has slowed as the Trump administration dismantles the agency",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration insists it hasn\u2019t wavered in its duty to protect the civil rights of America\u2019s children even as it dismantles the Education Department. Yet its own data shows the agency has resolved far fewer civil rights cases than in past years despite families filing more complaints.",
      "The Education Department\u2019s civil rights branch lost nearly half its staff amid mass layoffs in March, raising questions about its ability to address a deep backlog of complaints from students alleging discrimination based on disability, sex or race. Pressed on the issue in June, Education Secretary Linda McMahon denied a slowdown.",
      "\u201cNot only are we reducing the backlog, but we are keeping up with the current amount with a reduced staff because we are doing it efficiently,\u201d McMahon said at a Senate budget hearing.",
      "By several measures, however, the output of the Office for Civil Rights appears to have fallen sharply in comparison with previous years. A public database of the office\u2019s resolution agreements \u2014 cases in which schools or universities voluntarily agreed to address civil rights concerns \u2014 suggests the office\u2019s work has slowed.",
      "The database lists just 65 resolutions so far this year, on pace to fall far below previous years\u2019 totals. Last year the office logged 380 resolutions in total, following 561 in 2023. During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, the office averaged more than 800 resolutions a year, including 1,300 during his first year in office.",
      "Other internal data obtained by The Associated Press show a similar trend. Since Trump took office, the total number of resolved cases is down about 40% from the same time frame last year \u2014 including cases that were dismissed, mediated or reached a voluntary resolution. Compared with last year, there also has been a 70% decrease in the number of cases resolved through resolution agreements or action taken by a school to comply with federal law, the internal data shows.",
      "Meanwhile, new complaints have increased 9%. The total number of cases has now climbed beyond 25,000.",
      "An Education Department spokesperson said the Trump administration is fixing a broken system.",
      "\u201cWhen staff levels were at their peak, OCR\u2019s processes still proved to be ineffective, as evidenced by the chronic backlog of tens of thousands of cases that left students\u2019 discrimination claims languishing over many presidential administrations,\u201d spokesperson Julie Hartman said.",
      "Parents and advocates say they\u2019ve noticed a difference.",
      "Adrienne Hazel filed a complaint in April after her 20-year-old son Ricky, who has autism, was placed in a public school program without a certified teacher and was not given an individual learning plan. Hazel, of Southfield, Michigan, has not heard from the federal office after receiving an automatic reply when she filed the complaint.",
      "Things moved faster last year when Hazel filed a separate complaint for her son. The office notified Ricky\u2019s school, which Hazel says spurred the district to reach an agreement with her within about three months. This time, she said, it feels like she\u2019s on her own.",
      "\u201cThere has been zero response to this,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s basically going into a babysitting situation. He\u2019s not getting the things that he needs to grow into independence. And he\u2019ll just be aging without getting an education.\u201d",
      "Marcie Lipsitt, a special education advocate in Michigan who worked with Hazel, said such stories are common. She helps families file complaints but warns it could take at least a year before an investigation opens. Some schools have backtracked on previous agreements, she said, yet parents can\u2019t get a response from the federal office.",

      "The fate of the Education Department itself is in question as the Trump administration moves ahead with a plan to wind down the agency. A Supreme Court decision Monday cleared the way for the agency to continue mass layoffs and outsource some functions to other agencies. McMahon previously suggested the civil rights work could be managed by the Justice Department.",
      "Still, McMahon said in June that the office was making headway after inheriting a backlog of 20,000 cases from the Biden administration. She told senators the office was catching up on the backlog and keeping up with new complaints.",
      "With half the staff, many question how that\u2019s possible. In a June court order pausing the termination of Office for Civil Rights employees, a federal judge in Boston said the branch is \u201ccurrently incapable of addressing the vast majority\u201d of complaints.

      "The Office for Civil Rights is responsible for enforcing civil rights laws across the nation\u2019s schools and is often a last resort for parents and students facing discrimination from schools. The office reviews complaints and, for those that meet certain criteria, opens investigations. Others are dismissed or move to a mediation process.",
      "Of the 65 resolution agreements reported this year, 57 were signed after Trump took office.

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian activists called for more protests Wednesday against a law they say weakens the country\u2019s anti-corruption bodies, following the first major demonstration against the country's government in more than three years of war. The legislation has also drawn rebukes from European Union officials and international rights groups.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, under pressure as the change threatened to endanger his public support at a critical time in the war, convened the heads of Ukraine's key anti-corruption and security agencies Wednesday morning in a response to the outcry against his decision to approve the new law that was passed by Parliament.",
      "\u201cWe all hear what society says,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram after the meeting. But he insisted the new legal framework was needed to crack down harder on corruption.",
      "\u201cCriminal cases should not drag on for years without verdicts, and those working against Ukraine must not feel comfortable or immune from punishment,\u201d the Ukrainian leader said.",
      "He said all government agencies agreed to work constructively and respond to public expectations for fairness and effectiveness. A detailed joint action plan is expected within two weeks, aimed at addressing institutional weaknesses, removing legal hurdles, and ensuring justice across the board, he said.",
      "Thousands of people gathered in the capital and other cities across Ukraine on Tuesday evening to urge Zelenskyy to veto the controversial bill. After Zelenskyy approved it, activists called on social media for another demonstration in the center of Kyiv at 8 p.m. Wednesday.",
      "The legislation tightens government oversight of two key anti-corruption agencies. Critics say the step could significantly weaken the independence of those agencies and grant Zelenskyy\u2019s circle greater influence over investigations.",
      "Fighting entrenched corruption is crucial for Ukraine\u2019s aspirations to join the EU and maintain access to billions of dollars in Western aid in its fight against Russia's three-year invasion.",
      "In a post on X, the EU\u2019s Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos expressed concern over the vote in the Ukrainian Parliament, called the Rada, calling it \u201ca serious step back.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian branch of Transparency International criticized Parliament\u2019s decision, saying it undermines one of the most significant reforms since what Ukraine calls its Revolution of Dignity in 2014, and damages trust with international partners. It accused authorities of \u201cdismantling\u201d the country\u2019s anti-corruption architecture.",
      "Zelenskyy has been the international face of Ukraine\u2019s determination to defeat Russia\u2019s all-out invasion, and his domestic troubles are an unwelcome diversion from the war effort.",

      "LONDON -- Britain\u2019s Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed the convictions of two financial market traders accused of manipulating benchmark interest rates in one of the biggest scandals to come out of the global financial crisis in 2008.",
      "The charges against Tom Hayes, a former Citigroup and UBS trader, and Carlo Palombo, who worked for Barclays, centered around alleged efforts to influence the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or Libor, and its euro currency equivalent Euribor, which were used to set the interest rates on trillions of dollars of loans and other financial products around the world.",
      "The court ruled that the convictions of Hayes and Palombo were unfair because the judges in their separate cases gave inaccurate instructions to jurors. That effectively prevented jurors from considering the key question of whether the traders had acted dishonestly.",
      "\u201cThat misdirection undermined the fairness of the trial,\u201d Judge George Leggatt wrote in an 82-page decision backed by all five members of the panel that heard the case.",
      "Hayes was convicted in August 2015 and sentenced to a maximum of 14 years in prison, which was later reduced to 11 years. Palombo, convicted in March 2019, was sentenced to four years in prison. Both men were released in 2021.",

      "The decision came after the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeal in 2022 overturned the convictions of two traders charged with similar crimes in the United States. Hayes and Palombo, whose appeals were repeatedly rejected by British judges, were allowed to take their case to the U.K. Supreme Court after that ruling.",

      "Libor and Euribor were critical benchmarks that were once used to set the interest rates on everything from business loans to home mortgages and credit card debts. As a result, they also became central to more complex financial transactions such as those used by banks and businesses to bet on interest rate fluctuations.",
      "The benchmarks were vulnerable to manipulation because they were set by banks that could profit from swings in interest rates.",
      "Each day, major international banks were asked to submit the interest rate at which they could borrow money from other banks. An average of those submissions was then used to set the daily Libor and Euribor rates.",
      "During the financial crisis, regulators became aware that some banks were making artificially low Libor submissions to make their institutions seem more creditworthy. Some traders also sought to influence the submissions made by their banks as even small moves in the benchmark rates could boost their profits.",
      "Those risks became even more pronounced during the financial crisis, when lending dried up and bankers had to base their daily submissions on a subjective assessment of the market rather than actual loans.",
      "Libor and Euribor were phased out in recent years, in part because they were seen as worsening the financial crisis.",

      "The weevil has devoured thousands of Uruguay\u2019s palm trees since its unexplained arrival from Southeast Asia in 2022. But authorities are only now waking up to the threat as the landscape of municipalities transforms and fears grow that the country's beloved palms could be wiped out.",
      "\u201cWe are late in addressing this,\u201d Estela Delgado, the national director of biodiversity at Uruguay's Ministry of Environment, acknowledged last month. \u201cBut we are doing so with great commitment and seriousness.\u201d",

      "For six hours every day after school, Nahideh works in a cemetery, collecting water from a nearby shrine to sell to mourners visiting loved ones\u2019 graves",
      "KABUL, Afghanistan -- For six hours every day after school, Nahideh works in a cemetery, collecting water from a nearby shrine to sell to mourners visiting loved ones\u2019 graves. She dreams of becoming a doctor \u2014 but knows it is a futile dream.",
      "When the next school year starts, she will be enrolling in a madrassa, a religious school, to learn about the Quran and Islam \u2014 and little else.",
      "\u201cI prefer to go to school, but I can\u2019t, so I will go to a madrassa,\u201d she said, dark brown eyes peering out from beneath her tightly wrapped black headscarf. \u201cIf I could go to school then I could learn and become a doctor. But I can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "At the age of 13, Nahideh is in the last grade of primary school, the limit of education allowed for girls in Afghanistan. The country\u2019s Taliban government banned girls from secondary school and university three years ago \u2014 the only country in the world to do so. The ban is part of myriad restrictions on women and girls, dictating everything from what they can wear to where they can go and who they can go with.",
      "With no option for higher education, many girls and women are turning to madrassas instead.",
      "\u201cSince the schools are closed to girls, they see this as an opportunity,\u201d said Zahid-ur-Rehman Sahibi, director of the Tasnim Nasrat Islamic Sciences Educational Center in Kabul. \u201cSo, they come here to stay engaged in learning and studying religious sciences.\u201d",
      "The center\u2019s roughly 400 students range in ages from about 3 to 60, and 90% are female. They study the Quran, Islamic jurisprudence, the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, and Arabic, the language of the Quran.",
      "Most Afghans, Sahibi noted, are religious. \u201cEven before the schools were closed, many used to attend madrassas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after the closure of schools, the interest has increased significantly, because the doors of the madrassas remain open to them.\u201d",
      "No recent official figures are available on the number of girls enrolled in madrassas, but officials say the popularity of religious schools overall has been growing. Last September, Deputy Minister of Education Karamatullah Akhundzada said at least 1 million students had enrolled in madrassas over the past year alone, bringing the total to over 3 million.",
      "Sheltered from the heat of an early summer\u2019s day in a basement room at the Tasnim Nasrat center, Sahibi\u2019s students knelt at small plastic tables on the carpeted floor, their pencils tracing lines of Arabic script in their Qurans. All 10 young women wore black niqabs, the all-encompassing garment that includes a veil, leaving only the eyes visible.",
      "\u201cIt is very good for girls and women to study at a madrassa, because \u2026 the Quran is the word of Allah, and we are Muslims,\u201d said 25-year-old Faiza, who had enrolled at the center five months earlier. \u201cTherefore, it is our duty to know what is in the book that Allah has revealed to us, to understand its interpretation and translation.\u201d",
      "Given a choice, she would have studied medicine. While she knows that is now impossible, she still harbors hope that if she shows she is a pious student dedicated to her religion, she will be eventually allowed to. The medical profession is one of the very few still open to women in Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cWhen my family sees that I am learning Quranic sciences and that I am practicing all the teachings of the Quran in my life, and they are assured of this, they will definitely allow me to continue my studies,\u201d she said.",

Both should be learned simultaneously.\u201d",
      "The female secondary and higher education ban has been controversial in Afghanistan, even within the ranks of the Taliban itself. In a rare sign of open dissent, Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Abbas Stanikzai said in a public speech in January that there was no justification for denying education to girls and women.",

      "His madrassa first opened five years ago with 35 students. Now it has 160 boys aged 5-21, half of whom are boarders. Beyond religious studies, it offers a limited number of other classes such as English and math. There is also an affiliated girls\u2019 madrassa, which currently has 90 students, he said.",

      "But he suspended the declaration to strike down the regulations for a year to allow the government \u201cto consider whether it wishes to implement a way to deal with the contravention.\u201d",
      "He said in the judgement that the regulations and \u201cdrawing the line of a person's biological sex at birth create a disproportionate and unnecessary intrusion into the privacy and equality rights.\"",

      "France's justice minister is transferring 100 of the country\u2019s most dangerous inmates to a high-security prison to prevent them from running criminal operations from behind bars",
      "PARIS -- They are France 's most dangerous drug kingpins, according to the country's justice minister \u2014 prison inmates so wealthy and powerful that even behind bars, they can continue to order assassinations, run narco-trafficking operations and launder money.",
      "Flexing his powers as minister in charge of the French penal system, G\u00e9rald Darmanin's solution to the problem is contentious. He is moving 100 inmates \u2014 men he describes as \u201cFrance\u2019s biggest criminals\u201d \u2014 into an austere maximum security penitentiary in the country's north that critics say has echoes of tough U.S. prisons.",
      "The move is also possibly vote-catching for Darmanin, who has joined a growing field of possible successors to President Emmanuel Macron after the next election, less than two years away.",
      "In the newly reinforced Vendin-le-Vieil prison, the selected inmates will be locked in individual cells for 23 hours on most days.",
      "Largely cut off from the world, Darmanin argues they will no longer be able to fuel drug-related violence, which has become a political issue ahead of the 2027 presidential election.",
      "\u201cWe are here to guarantee that they don't speak to the outside, that they don't continue their trafficking outside, that they don't corrupt prison officers, magistrates, police officers and gendarmes,\" Darmanin said on primetime evening television after the first 17 inmates were transferred this week to Vendin-le-Vieil from other, less secure facilities.",
      "France has had a long history of both notorious prisons (the Bastille) and prisoners \u2014 both real (Napoleon) and fictional (\"The Count of Monte Cristo\").",
      "Still, Vendin-le-Vieil's lock-up conditions are exceptional, similar to the ultra-secure \u201cSupermax\u201d prison in the United States and Italy\u2019s tough \u201ccarcere duro\u201d incarceration rules for Mafia members.",
      "Vendin-le-Vieil already houses some of France's most infamous prisoners \u2014 including Salah Abdeslam, lone survivor of a team of Islamic State extremists that terrorized Paris in 2015, killing 130 people in gun and bomb attacks.",
      "To make way for the specially selected 100 inmates \u2014 some already convicted, others in pre-trial detention \u2014 many other Vendin-le-Vieil inmates were moved out. The newcomers will be grouped together in the prison's new \u201cSection for Combatting Organized Crime,\u201d with reinforced security and regulations, and equipped with systems to block mobile phone signals and drones.",
      "Among those on the list for Vendin-le-Vieil is Mohamed Amra, nicknamed \u201cThe Fly,\" who staged an escape last year that killed two guards and then fled to Romania before he was captured and returned to France.",
      "The newcomers will have just one hour a day in a prison exercise yard, in groups of no more than five. The rest of the time, they will mostly be confined to individual cells fitted with holes so prison guards can handcuff them before moving them and with ratchet systems so inmates can't yank the doors open or shut when they have to be unlocked.",
      "They will be guarded by 250 wardens \u2014 elsewhere, the ratio is usually 20 guards to 100 inmates, Darmanin told French broadcaster TF1.",
      "Instead of unlimited calls with family members from prison phones, they will be limited to a maximum of two hours, twice a week \u2014 a restriction that Darmanin says will make monitoring their conversations easier.",
      "Prison visiting rooms have also been equipped with security glass dividers, to prevent physical contact between inmates and visitors. Darmanin says this will prevent mobile phones and other contraband from being smuggled in. The new Vendin-le-Vieil inmates also won't have the rights accorded in other prisons of intimate time with partners and family members.",
      "Darmanin said the conditions will be \u201cextremely hard\" but are necessary because France risks \u201ctipping into narco-banditry\u201d in the absence of tough decisions.",

      "Vogelhut accuses Darmanin of angling for votes and playing on \"French people\u2019s fears and anxieties.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t solve any problems,\" she said. \"There won\u2019t be any less crime.\"",

      "Brazilian coffee farmers are facing tough times after the U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports earlier this month",
      "PORCIUNCULA, Brazil -- Brazilian Jos\u00e9 Natal da Silva often tends to his modest coffee plantation in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state in the middle of the night, sacrificing sleep to fend off pests that could inflict harm on his precious crops.",
      "But anxiety has troubled his shut-eye even more in recent weeks, following President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement earlier this month of a 50% tariff on Brazilian imported goods, which experts expect to drive down the price of coffee in Brazil.",
      "Da Silva sighed as he recounted his fears, sitting on the dry earth surrounded by his glossy green arabica coffee shrubs, in the small municipality of Porciuncula.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sad because we struggle so much. We spend years battling to get somewhere. And suddenly, everything starts falling apart, and we\u2019re going to lose everything,\u201d da Silva said. \u201cHow are we going to survive?\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff on Brazil is overtly political. In his public letter detailing the reasons for the hike, the U.S. president called the trial of his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, a \u201c witch hunt.\u201d Bolsonaro is accused of masterminding a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss to left-leaning President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "The tariff has sparked ripples of fear in Brazil, particularly among sectors with deep ties to the American market such as beef, orange juice \u2014 and coffee. Minor coffee producers say the import tax will hit their margins and adds to the uncertainty already generated by an increasingly dry and unpredictable climate.",
      "Brazil, the world\u2019s largest coffee producer, exports around 85% of its production. The United States is the country\u2019s top coffee buyer and represents around 16% of exports, according to Brazil\u2019s coffee exporters council Cecafe.",
      "The president of Cecafe\u2019s deliberative council, M\u00e1rcio Ferreira, told journalists last week that he thinks the U.S. will continue to import Brazilian coffee, even with the hefty tariff. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that neither the United States nor any other source can give up on Brazil, even if it\u2019s tariffed,\u201d he said.",
      "But the tariff will likely decrease Brazilian coffee\u2019s competitiveness in the U.S. and naturally reduce demand, said Leandro Gilio, a professor of global agribusiness at Insper business school in Sao Paulo.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way we can quickly redirect our coffee production to other markets,\u201d Gilio said. \u201cThis principally affects small producers, who have less financial power to make investments or support themselves in a period like this.\u201d",
      "Family farmers produce more than two-thirds of Brazilian coffee. They are a majority in Rio state\u2019s northwestern region, where most of the state\u2019s coffee production lies.",
      "Coffee farming is the primary economic activity in these municipalities. In Porciuncula, which neighbors Brazil\u2019s largest coffee-producing state Minas Gerais, gentle mountains are layered with symmetrical lines of coffee shrubs.",

      "Last year, drought \u2014 made more likely by human-caused climate change \u2014 devastated large swathes of da Silva's production. The reduction in supply pushed coffee prices up, but only after many small-scale farmers had already sold all their crops.",
      "Since peaking in February, prices of arabica have fallen, dropping 33% by July, according to the University of Sao Paulo\u2019s Center for Advanced Studies in Applied Economics, which provides renowned commodity price reports.",
      "\u201cWhen you make an investment, counting on a certain price for coffee, and then when you go to sell it the price is 20-30% less than you calculated, it breaks the producers,\u201d said Paulo Vitor Menezes Freitas, 31, who also owns a modest plantation of around 35,000 coffee trees in the nearby municipality of Varre-Sai.",
      "Life out in the fields is tough, according to Menezes Freitas.",
      "During harvest season, he sometimes gets up at 3 a.m. to turn on a coffee drier, going to bed as late as midnight. The rest of the year is less intense, but still, there are few to no breaks because there\u2019s always work to do, he said.",

      "In addition to slashing the value of his coffee beans, Menezes Freitas said the tariff will impact machinery and aluminum \u2014 goods that producers like him use every day.",
      "\u201cWe hope this calms down. Hopefully, they\u2019ll come to their senses and remove that tariff. I think it would be better for both the United States and Brazil,\u201d he said.",

      "The snake can fit comfortably on a coin, so it was able to elude scientists for almost 20 years. Too tiny to identify with the naked eye, Blades placed it in a small glass jar and added soil, substrate and leaf litter.",
      "Several hours later, in front of a microscope at the University of the West Indies, Blades looked at the specimen. It wriggled in the petri dish, making it nearly impossible to identify.",
      "\u201cIt was a struggle,\u201d Blades recalled, adding that he shot a video of the snake and finally identified it thanks to a still image.",
      "It had pale yellow dorsal lines running through its body, and its eyes were located on the side of its head.",
      "\u201cI tried to keep a level head,\u201d Blades recalled, knowing that the Barbados threadsnake looks very much like a Brahminy blind snake, best known as the flower pot snake, which is a bit longer and has no dorsal lines.",

      "\u201cRediscovering one of our endemics on many levels is significant,\u201d said Justin Springer, Caribbean program officer for Re:wild who helped rediscover the snake along with Blades. \u201cIt reminds us that we still have something important left that plays an important role in our ecosystem.\u201d",
      "The Barbados threadsnake has only been seen a handful of times since 1889. It was on a list of 4,800 plant, animal and fungi species that Re:wild described as \u201clost to science.\u201d",
      "The snake is blind, burrows in the ground, eats termites and ants and lays one single, slender egg. Fully grown, it measures up to four inches (10 centimeters).",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re very cryptic,\u201d Blades said. \u201cYou can do a survey for a number of hours, and even if they are there, you may actually not see them.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump has announced trade deals with Japan and a handful of other Asian countries that will relieve some pressure on companies and consumers from sharply higher tariffs on their exports to the United States.",
      "A deal with China is under negotiation, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying an Aug. 12 deadline might be postponed again to allow more time for talks.",
      "Steep tariffs on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum remain, however, and many other countries, including South Korea and Thailand, have yet to clinch agreements. Overall, economists say the tariffs inevitably will dent growth in Asia and the world.",
      "Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced a deal Wednesday that will impose 15% tariffs on U.S. imports from Japan, down from Trump's proposed 25% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs.",
      "It was a huge relief for automakers like Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda, whose shares jumped by double digits in Tokyo. Trump also announced trade deals with the Philippines and Indonesia. After meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., Trump said the import tax on products from his country would be subject to a 19% tariff, down just 1% from the earlier threat of a 20% tariff.",
      "Indonesia also will face a 19% tariff, down from the 32% rate Trump had recently said would apply, and it committed to eliminating nearly all of its trade barriers for imports of American goods. Earlier, Trump announced that Vietnam's exports would face a 20% tariff, with double that rate for goods transshipped from China, though there has been no formal announcement.",
      "Negotiations with China are subject to an Aug. 12 deadline, but it's likely to be extended, Bessent told Fox Business on Tuesday. He said the two sides were due to hold another round of talks, this time in Sweden, early next week. Meanwhile, Trump said a trip to China may happen soon, hinting at efforts to stabilize U.S.-China trade relations.",
      "A preliminary agreement announced in June paved the way for China to lift some restrictions on its exports of rare earths, minerals critical for high technology and other manufacturing. In May, the U.S. agreed to drop Trump's 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days, while China agreed to lower its 125% rate on U.S. goods to 10%. The reprieve allowed companies more time to rush to try to beat the potentially higher tariffs, giving a boost to Chinese exports and alleviating some of the pressure on its manufacturing sector. But prolonged uncertainty over what Trump might do has left companies wary about committing to further investment in China.",

      "As higher education costs have grown to heights many U.S. residents find unattainable or illogical, some adults are looking to their employers for help",
      "NEW YORK -- After five years of working long nights as a truck driver, Julius Mosley wanted a change. He found driving unfulfilling, and his teenage son needed him to spend more time at home.",
      "So Mosley took a job as a customer service representative at a telecommunications company near his home. The employee benefits included being able to take job-related classes for free. He decided he wanted to study leadership so he could learn about managing teams and helping people become the best versions of themselves.",
      "His company, Spectrum, paid for a 10-week front-line manager certificate program that Mosley went on to complete. Then it covered the tuition cost for a bachelor's degree in leadership and organization studies that he's currently pursuing. The company also promoted him to a management position while he took college courses online.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely changed the course of my life,\u201d Mosley said about the education benefit, which took care of his tuition up front instead of requiring him to pay and seek later reimbursement. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a blessing to be able to do this.\u201d",
      "As higher education costs have grown to heights many U.S. residents find unattainable or illogical, some adults are looking to their employers for help defraying the expense of college and professional credentials. Nearly half of public and private employers have a tuition reimbursement program for employees, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, or SHRM.",
      "Many employers that provide tuition assistance reimburse staff members up to $5,250 per year because that amount is tax-deductible, said Amy Dufrane, CEO of the Human Resource Certification Institute, which offers credentials to HR professionals.",
      "Some companies offer more, including Bank of America, which provides tuition assistance of up to $7,500 annually, and Spectrum which, in addition to its prepaid tuition program, reimburses employees earning master's degrees or enrolled in classes that fall outside the scope of its prepaid program up to $10,000 per year.",
      "\"For companies who are looking to attract Generation Z and Millennials, it\u2019s a great way to bring them in because they\u2019re keenly interested in how companies are investing in them and the benefits that are available,\" said Dufrane.",
      "Because many college graduates start jobs after accumulating student loan debt, about 8% of employers also offer help with student loan repayment, according to James Atkinson, vice president of thought leadership at SHRM.",
      "If continuing education feels out of reach financially or seems incompatible with job demands, experts say there are ways to explore the possibility, either by by making the case to your employer or seeking a position at a place that provides education benefits.",
      "In traditional tuition reimbursement programs, employees lay out thousands of dollars to pay for tuition, books and fees at the start of a semester, and usually must complete the course with a passing grade before a company would kick in its contribution.",
      "That means employees would often wait four to six months before being reimbursed, which only works for more affluent workers, said Paul Marchand, chief human resources officer at Spectrum.",
      "\u201cThe person that can afford to put it on their credit card and sit with $3- or $4- or $5,000 of expenses due back to them and not be concerned about that cost, that is not our average worker,\u201d Marchand said. \u201cOur average worker is making $25, $28, $30 bucks an hour, maybe having a second job, maybe a single parent with kids, ... and they\u2019re important workers for us, and we want to help develop them and grow their careers.\u201d",
      "Spectrum launched a program that lets employees sign up for an array of certificates or college courses while paying nothing themselves. The eligible courses and where to take them came from Guild, a Denver company that works with employers on workforce development and tuition assistance.",
      "Walmart offers a similar benefit to its front-line associates, who can enroll in college or certain classes without ever seeing an invoice, according to company spokesperson Jimmy Carter. The benefit also extends to family members of the employees, he said.",
      "As recent college graduates have struggled with debts from college, some employers have added student loan repayment programs as well as tuition assistance.",

      "President Donald Trump has announced a trade framework with Japan, placing a 15% tax on goods imported from that nation",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump announced a trade framework with Japan on Tuesday, placing a 15% tax on goods imported from that nation.",
      "\u201cThis Deal will create Hundreds of Thousands of Jobs \u2014 There has never been anything like it,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social, adding that the United States \u201cwill continue to always have a great relationship with the Country of Japan.\u201d",
      "The president said Japan would invest \u201cat my direction\u201d $550 billion into the U.S. and would \u201copen\u201d its economy to American autos and rice. The 15% tax on imported Japanese goods is a meaningful drop from the 25% rate that Trump, in a recent letter to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, said would be levied starting Aug. 1.",
      "Early Wednesday, Ishiba acknowledged the new trade agreement, saying it would benefit both sides and help them work together.",
      "With the announcement, Trump is seeking to tout his ability as a dealmaker \u2014 even as his tariffs, when initially announced in early April led to a market panic and fears of slower growth that for the moment appear to have subsided. Key details remained unclear from his post, such as whether Japanese-built autos would face a higher 25% tariff that Trump imposed on the sector.",
      "But the framework fits a growing pattern for Trump, who is eager to portray the tariffs as win for the U.S. His administration says the revenues will help reduce the budget deficit and more factories will relocate to America to avoid the import taxes and cause trade imbalances to disappear.",
      "The wave of tariffs continues to be a source of uncertainty about whether it could lead to higher prices for consumers and businesses if companies simply pass along the costs. The problem was seen sharply Tuesday after General Motors reported a 35% drop in its net income during the second quarter as it warned that tariffs would hit its business in the months ahead, causing its stock to tumble.",
      "As the Aug. 1 deadline for the tariff rates in his letters to world leaders is approaching, Trump also announced a trade framework with the Philippines that would impose a tariff of 19% on its goods, while American-made products would face no import taxes. The president also reaffirmed his 19% tariffs on Indonesia.",
      "The U.S. ran a $69.4 billion trade imbalance on goods with Japan last year, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "America had a trade imbalance of $17.9 billion with Indonesia and an imbalance of $4.9 billion with the Philippines. Both nations are less affluent than the U.S. and an imbalance means America imports more from those countries than it exports to them.",
      "The president is set to impose the broad tariffs listed in his recent letters to other world leaders on Aug. 1, raising questions of whether there will be any breakthrough in talks with the European Union. At a Tuesday dinner, Trump said the EU would be in Washington on Wednesday for trade talks.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- They were in love once.",
      "Four years before Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cRumours\u201d became one of the best breakup records of the 1970s \u2014 and, many might say, all time \u2014 Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham were relative unknowns, a young couple putting out their own album, posing nude on the cover like a Laurel Canyon version of Adam and Eve.",
      "Released as \u201cBuckingham Nicks,\u201d the 1973 album has for decades maintained somewhat of a holy grail status in the dusty bins of record stores, selling for $20 to $90 depending on its condition. Now, in addition to new vinyl, it will be available on streaming and CD for the first time when it's reissued Sept. 19 on Rhino, Warner Music Group announced Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt's one of those records that everybody has heard of but not that many people have actually heard,\u201d said Brian Mansfield, a music historian, journalist and record collector in Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cEspecially before everything got put onto YouTube, very few people had heard it because it had never been on CD. But it had this iconic cover that everybody recognized.\u201d",
      "\u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d featured the duo's iconic harmonies and Buckingham's distinct guitar sound, which later fueled Fleetwood Mac's ability to sell tens of millions of records. But \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d bombed upon release and Polydor dropped them from the label, prompting Nicks' return to waitressing and Buckingham to briefly tour with Don Everly.",
      "The rest of the story is enshrined in lore: Drummer Mick Fleetwood heard \u201cFrozen Love\u201d from the album when he visited the studio where it was recorded, Sound City. After guitarist Bob Welch left the band, Fleetwood invited Buckingham to Fleetwood Mac, with Buckingham insisting Nicks join too. The band also included the late Christine McVie on keyboards and John McVie on bass.",
      "Generations of avid Fleetwood Mac fans have tattooed their lyrics or analyzed them at a forensic level, enshrining the tumultuous relationship between Buckingham and Nicks in pop culture. The upcoming reissue of \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d is a reminder of the couple's musical beginnings and the special status their only joint album has held among fans and record collectors.",
      "\u201cAs soon as we put it out, it goes that day,\u201d said Michael Bell, owner of Hunky Dory Records, which has locations in Raleigh, Durham and Cary, North Carolina.",
      "Nicks and Buckingham met during high school at a local church in Northern California where young musicians gathered on a school night, according to Stephen Davis' \u201cGold Dust Woman: The Biography of Stevie Nicks.\u201d",
      "Buckingham played the Mamas & the Papas' \u201cCalifornia Dreamin'\" on piano, prompting Nicks to chime in, singing Michelle Phillips\u2019 high harmony.",
      "\u201cThey glanced at each other; she noticed his eyes, cold blue like lake ice,\" Davis wrote. \"They sang the whole song while the room went quiet, everyone mesmerized.\u201d",
      "After high school, Nicks joined the band Buckingham was in, Fritz, which would open for Creedence Clearwater Revival, Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. They eventually split off as a duo, started dating and moved to Los Angeles.",
      "Nicks said she loved Buckingham before he was a millionaire, according to Davis' book, and \u201cwashed his jeans and embroidered stupid moons and stars on the bottom of them.\u201d",
      "The first track on \u201cBuckingham Nicks,\u201d \u201cCrying in the Night,\" has \u201ca sense of Joni Mitchell fronting the Eagles,\u201d Davis wrote. \u201cFrozen Love\u201d closed out side two, with \u201clayers of strings and synthesizers and a major Lindsey Buckingham rock guitar symphony.\"",
      "\u201cNo one seemed to like the record,\u201d Davis wrote. \u201cPolydor executives hadn\u2019t even wanted to release it.\"",

      "He has no idea why \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d hasn't been reissued more considering the steady demand. For him, it's a good album but not one that reached the heights of what was to come.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not there yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything on this album that would have made a Fleetwood album.\u201d",
      "The romantic relationship between Buckingham and Nicks would end around the making of \u201cRumours.\u201d Nicks and Buckingham would shoot eye daggers at each other onstage in packed stadiums, while Buckingham would roll his eyes during Nicks' MusiCares speech in 2018, according to the Los Angeles Times. Buckingham would eventually be kicked off the band's tour in 2018 , prompting a lawsuit that was later settled.",
      "But this month, Buckingham and Nicks seemed to be operating in perfect symmetry \u2014 at least on Instagram. Each posted half a line from \u201cFrozen Love,\u201d \u2014 with Nicks writing \"And if you go forward\u2026\u201d and Buckingham responding, \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d On Wednesday, they shared the same video of a billboard being put up to advertise the reissue of \u201cBuckingham Nicks.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. automakers worry that President Donald Trump's agreement to tariff Japanese vehicles at 15% would put them at a competitive disadvantage, saying they will face steeper import taxes on steel, aluminum and parts than their competitors.",
      "\u201cWe need to review all the details of the agreement, but this is a deal that will charge lower tariffs on Japanese autos with no U.S. content,\u201d said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents the Big 3 American automakers, General Motors, Ford and Jeep-maker Stellantis.",
      "Blunt said in an interview the U.S. companies and workers \u201cdefinitely are at a disadvantage\u201d because they face a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 25% tariff on parts and finished vehicles, with some exceptions for products covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that went into effect in 2020.",
      "The domestic automaker reaction reveals the challenge of enforcing policies across the world economy, showing that for all of Trump\u2019s promises there can be genuine tradeoffs from policy choices that risk serious blowback in politically important states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, where automaking is both a source of income and of identity.",
      "The United Auto Workers said in a statement it was \u201cdeeply angered\u201d by the deal. \u201cA better deal would have held Japanese automakers to the same standards U.S. workers have fought for at GM, Ford, and Stellantis,\u201d the UAW said.",
      "\u201cIf this becomes the blueprint for trade with Europe or South Korea, it will be a major missed opportunity,\u201d the union added. \u201cWe need trade deals that raise standards \u2014 not reward the race to the bottom. This deal does the opposite.\u201d",
      "Trump portrayed the trade framework as a major win after announcing it on Tuesday, saying it would add hundreds of thousands of jobs to the U.S. economy and open the Japanese economy in ways that could close a persistent trade imbalance. The agreement includes a 15% tariff that replaces the 25% import tax the Republican president had threatened to charge starting on Aug. 1. Japan would also put together $550 billion to invest in U.S. projects at the \u201cdirection\u201d of the president, the White House said.",
      "The framework with Japan will remove regulations that prevent American vehicles from being sold in that country, the White House has said, adding that it would be possible for vehicles built in Detroit to be shipped directly to Japan and ready to be sold.",
      "But Blunt said that foreign auto producers, including the U.S., Europe and South Korea, have just a 6% share in Japan, raising skepticism that simply having the open market that the Trump administration says will exist in that country will be sufficient.",
      "\u201cTough nut to crack, and I\u2019d be very surprised if we see any meaningful market penetration in Japan,\u201d Blunt said.",
      "Asked at Wednesday's briefing about whether Trump's sectoral tariffs such as those on autos were now subject to possible change, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the issue had been going through the Commerce Department.",

      "The framework with Japan was also an indication that some nations simply saw it as preferential to have a set tariff rate rather than be whipsawed by Trump's changes on import taxes since April. But for the moment, both Japan and the United Kingdom with its quotas on auto exports might enjoy a competitive edge in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWith this agreement in place it provides Japan with a near-term operating cost advantage compared to other foreign automakers, and even some domestic U.S. product that uses a high degree of both foreign production and parts content,\u201d said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars. \"It will be interesting to see if this is the first domino to fall in a series of foreign countries that decide long-term stability is more important that short term disputes over specific tariff rates.\u201d",
      "Autos Drive America, an organization that represents major Japanese companies Toyota, Honda and Nissan and other international automakers, said in a statement that it is \u201cencouraged\u201d by the announced trade framework and noted its members have exceeded domestic automaker production for the past two years.",
      "The statement urged \"the Trump administration to swiftly reach similar agreements with other allies and partners, especially the European Union, South Korea, Canada and Mexico.\u201d",
      "The Japanese framework could give automakers and other countries grounds for pushing for changes in the Trump administration's tariffs regime. The president has previously said that he values flexibility in negotiating import taxes. The USMCA is up for review next year.",
      "Ford, GM and Stellantis do \u201chave every right to be upset,\u201d said Sam Fiorani, vice president at consultancy AutoForecast Solutions. But \u201cHonda, Toyota, and Nissan still import vehicles from Mexico and Canada, where the current levels of tariffs can be higher than those applied to Japanese imports. Most of the high-volume models from Japanese brands are already produced in North America.\u201d",
      "Fiorani noted that among the few exceptions are the Toyota 4Runner, the Mazda CX-5 and the Subaru Forester, but most of the other imports fill niches that are too small to warrant production in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere will be negotiations between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico, and it will probably result in tariffs no higher than 15%,\u201d Fiorani added, \u201cbut nobody seems to be in a hurry to negotiate around the last Trump administration\u2019s free trade agreement.\u201d",

      "The problem: Mortgages signed by the Paxtons contained inaccurate statements declaring that each of those three houses was their primary residence, enabling the now-estranged couple to improperly lock in low interest rates, according to an Associated Press review of public records. The lower rates will save the Paxtons tens of thousands of dollars in payments over the life of the loan, legal experts say.",

      "It is a federal and state crime to knowingly make false statements on mortgage documents. It's also against the law in Texas to collect a homestead tax break on two separate properties.

That\u2019s a bigger question to me than the money, when you are AG and have to enforce this law.\u201d",
      "Separately, land records indicate the Paxtons may have violated the terms of at least two mortgages on other houses they own. The mortgage on a home in College Station, Texas, says the property is for the Paxtons\u2019 exclusive use and cannot be rented out. Doing so would be grounds for terminating the mortgage, the document states. The home has been listed for rent on real estate websites on-and-off since at least 2022.",
      "Ken Paxton also holds a $1.2 million mortgage on a \u201c5 bedroom luxury cabin\u201d in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, that is for rent on Airbnb and other short-term rental sites, records show. The property\u2019s mortgage stipulates that it cannot be rented out.",
      "Representatives for Stifel Bank, Cornerstone Home Lending and Benchmark Mortgage, which issued the mortgages in question, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Paxton\u2019s real estate dealings are in many ways distinct from those of James and Schiff, the Democrats targeted by the Trump administration.",
      "The investigation of James centers on forms she signed in 2023 while helping a niece buy a home in Virginia. One form stated that James intended to occupy the home as her \u201cprincipal residence.\u201d But in other documents, the New York attorney general made clear she had no intention of living there. An email to the mortgage loan broker two weeks before she signed the documents stated the property \u201cWILL NOT be my primary residence.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve said from the beginning, if prosecutors want to know that truth about Attorney General James\u2019 mortgage applications, we are ready and waiting with the facts,\u201d said Lowell, James\u2019 attorney.",
      "For over a decade, Schiff owned homes in Maryland and California, the state he represents, that were both designated as his primary residence. In 2020, then a congressman, Schiff designated his Maryland property as a second home \u2014 a step Paxton has not taken.",
      "Paxton\u2019s real estate dealings are not the first time he has drawn scrutiny for his conduct while in office.",
      "Before his election as attorney general, Paxton, then a state senator, admitted in 2014 to violating Texas securities law and paid a fine.",
      "He spent roughly 10 years under state indictment on securities charges while serving as attorney general. The charges were eventually dropped in 2024. Other alleged misdeeds in office led to his impeachment by Texas\u2019 GOP-controlled House in 2023. He was acquitted in a trial by the Senate.",
      "Angela Paxton did not cast a vote in his impeachment trial and recently filed for divorce, citing Ken Paxton\u2019s infidelity and other \u201crecent discoveries.\u201d She did not elaborate.",
      "What ultimately unleashed the impeachment push was Paxton\u2019s relationship with Austin real estate developer Nate Paul, who pleaded guilty this year to one count of making a false statement to a financial institution.",
      "In 2020, eight top aides in Paxton\u2019s office told the FBI they were concerned the state\u2019s top law enforcement official was misusing his office to help Paul over the developer\u2019s unproven claims about an elaborate conspiracy to steal $200 million of his properties.",
      "The House impeachment managers accused Paxton of attempting to interfere in foreclosure lawsuits and issuing legal opinions to benefit Paul. They also alleged that Paul employed a woman with whom Paxton had an affair in exchange for legal help and that the developer paid for expensive renovations to the attorney general\u2019s home in Austin.",
      "That would be the same house that he declared in mortgage documents was his third primary residence.",

    "story": [
      "Brazilian coffee farmers are facing tough times after the U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports earlier this month",
      "PORCIUNCULA, Brazil -- Brazilian Jos\u00e9 Natal da Silva often tends to his modest coffee plantation in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state in the middle of the night, sacrificing sleep to fend off pests that could inflict harm on his precious crops.",
      "But anxiety has troubled his shut-eye even more in recent weeks, following President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement earlier this month of a 50% tariff on Brazilian imported goods, which experts expect to drive down the price of coffee in Brazil.",
      "Da Silva sighed as he recounted his fears, sitting on the dry earth surrounded by his glossy green arabica coffee shrubs, in the small municipality of Porciuncula.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sad because we struggle so much. We spend years battling to get somewhere. And suddenly, everything starts falling apart, and we\u2019re going to lose everything,\u201d da Silva said. \u201cHow are we going to survive?\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff on Brazil is overtly political. In his public letter detailing the reasons for the hike, the U.S. president called the trial of his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, a \u201c witch hunt.\u201d Bolsonaro is accused of masterminding a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss to left-leaning President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "The tariff has sparked ripples of fear in Brazil, particularly among sectors with deep ties to the American market such as beef, orange juice \u2014 and coffee. Minor coffee producers say the import tax will hit their margins and adds to the uncertainty already generated by an increasingly dry and unpredictable climate.",
      "Brazil, the world\u2019s largest coffee producer, exports around 85% of its production. The United States is the country\u2019s top coffee buyer and represents around 16% of exports, according to Brazil\u2019s coffee exporters council Cecafe.",
      "The president of Cecafe\u2019s deliberative council, M\u00e1rcio Ferreira, told journalists last week that he thinks the U.S. will continue to import Brazilian coffee, even with the hefty tariff. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that neither the United States nor any other source can give up on Brazil, even if it\u2019s tariffed,\u201d he said.",
      "But the tariff will likely decrease Brazilian coffee\u2019s competitiveness in the U.S. and naturally reduce demand, said Leandro Gilio, a professor of global agribusiness at Insper business school in Sao Paulo.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way we can quickly redirect our coffee production to other markets,\u201d Gilio said. \u201cThis principally affects small producers, who have less financial power to make investments or support themselves in a period like this.\u201d",
      "Family farmers produce more than two-thirds of Brazilian coffee. They are a majority in Rio state\u2019s northwestern region, where most of the state\u2019s coffee production lies.",
      "Coffee farming is the primary economic activity in these municipalities. In Porciuncula, which neighbors Brazil\u2019s largest coffee-producing state Minas Gerais, gentle mountains are layered with symmetrical lines of coffee shrubs.",

      "Besides coffee, he grows cassava, squash, bananas, oranges and lemons and has a few chickens that provide fresh eggs. \u201cWe have them because of the fear of not being able to eat. We wouldn\u2019t manage if everything were bought, because the profit is very low,\u201d he said.",
      "Last year, drought \u2014 made more likely by human-caused climate change \u2014 devastated large swathes of da Silva's production. The reduction in supply pushed coffee prices up, but only after many small-scale farmers had already sold all their crops.",
      "Since peaking in February, prices of arabica have fallen, dropping 33% by July, according to the University of Sao Paulo\u2019s Center for Advanced Studies in Applied Economics, which provides renowned commodity price reports.",
      "\u201cWhen you make an investment, counting on a certain price for coffee, and then when you go to sell it the price is 20-30% less than you calculated, it breaks the producers,\u201d said Paulo Vitor Menezes Freitas, 31, who also owns a modest plantation of around 35,000 coffee trees in the nearby municipality of Varre-Sai.",
      "Life out in the fields is tough, according to Menezes Freitas.",
      "During harvest season, he sometimes gets up at 3 a.m. to turn on a coffee drier, going to bed as late as midnight. The rest of the year is less intense, but still, there are few to no breaks because there\u2019s always work to do, he said.",
      "Menezes Freitas, who is expecting his first child in October, said the tariff\u2019s announcement increased his fears for the future.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s scary. It feels like you\u2019re on shaky ground. If things get worse, what will we do? People will start pulling out their coffee and finding other ways to survive because they won\u2019t have the means to continue,\u201d he said.",
      "In addition to slashing the value of his coffee beans, Menezes Freitas said the tariff will impact machinery and aluminum \u2014 goods that producers like him use every day.",
      "\u201cWe hope this calms down. Hopefully, they\u2019ll come to their senses and remove that tariff. I think it would be better for both the United States and Brazil,\u201d he said.",

      "Like most cult comedies, \u201cHappy Gilmore\u201d didn\u2019t start out an obvious instant classic, though. \u201cA one-joke \u2018Caddyshack\u2019 for the blitzed and jaded,\u201d wrote EW. \u201cTo describe Happy\u2019s antics as boorish is putting it mildly,\u201d wrote The New York Times. \u201c\u2018Happy Gilmore\u2019 tells the story of a violent sociopath,\u201d wrote Roger Ebert. He called it \u201cthe latest in the dumber and dumbest sweepstakes.\u201d",
      "\u201cHappy Gilmore\u201d was a box-office success, grossing $39 million in the U.S. and Canada. And through worn-out DVDs and regular TV reruns, it became a favorite to generations of golfers and a staple of goofy \u201990s comedy.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how many times I\u2019ve seen that movie,\u201d says the actor-filmmaker Benny Safdie, who co-directed Sandler in \u201cUncut Gems.\u201d \u201cIt was on an endless loop. I had the DVD and I just kept watching it. I can close my eyes and see the movie end to end. It\u2019s one of my favorite movies.\u201d",
      "Now, nearly three decades later, and after years of batting away pleas for a sequel, Sandler has finally put Happy\u2019s Bruins jersey back on. \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d which Netflix will debut Friday, is arguably the most anticipated streaming release of the summer.",
      "Sandler was well aware of the checkered history of comedy sequels. Movies like \u201cZoolander 2\u201d and \u201cAnchorman 2\u201d have struggled to recapture the freewheeling spirit of the originals. The movie Sandler counts as his favorite, \u201cCaddyshack\u201d \u2014 so much so that he was initially hesitant to make a golf comedy \u2014 spawned 1988's woebegone \u201cCaddyshack II.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf someone brought it up to us, we were like, \u2018Yeah, no, we\u2019re not going to do that,\u2019\u201d Sandler said in a recent interview alongside Herlihy. \u201cThere was no moment we went \u2018Aha.\u2019 It just kind of happened. The last couple years, we were talking about Happy and how it might be funny if he was down and out.\u201d",

But after a tragic incident and falling on hard times, he\u2019s lured back into golf. This time, though, Happy is an insider, motivated to protect the sport. Safdie co-stars as the founder of Maxi Golf, a new circus-like tour with long hitters.",
      "\u201cWe thought it could be fun to write something like that\u201d says Sandler. \u201cIt kind of connected to our lives and this age, and wanting to make a full-on comedy. There\u2019s nothing better than dropping a comedy and trying to make people laugh, to us. It feels like why we originally got into this business.\u201d",
      "Big, broad comedies have grown almost extinct in the decades since \u201cHappy Gilmore.\u201d Returning to that style of comedy was, for Sandler and Herlihy, the best reason to make the sequel. For the 58-year-old friends and regular collaborators, it was a chance to riff like they used to.",
      "\u201cWe were outlining the story together and then we were like, \u2018We should watch the first one again, man,\u2019\u201d Sandler says. \u201cWe\u2019re going off of our memory of so many things, hanging out with Carl Weathers and Bob Barker and all that stuff. Then we watched it and we were like, \u2018Oh, yeah.\u2019 It was a tone.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt made a little more sense than \u2018Billy Madison,\u2019\u201d says Herlihy, \u201cbut we weren\u2019t afraid to swing, swing, swing.\u201d",
      "Cameos, of course, were a major part of \u201cHappy Gilmore.\u201d (The Bob Barker scene was originally written for Ed McMahon.) In the years since, many of the faces of the original have died, including Barker, Weathers, Frances Bay, the hulking Richard Kiel and Joe Flaherty, who played the heckler. Even the golf ball-stealing alligator, Morris, has passed on. \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d unusually elegiac for a proudly silly comedy, nods to all of them.",
      "For the sequel, many others, like Travis Kelce, Bad Bunny and Margaret Qualley, were lining up to be a part of it. So were pro golfers. Just about all the big names in golf, including several legends, appear. The day after winning Sunday\u2019s British Open, Scottie Scheffler flew to New York for the premiere.",
      "Over the years, Herlihy and Sandler have seen a lot of them try \u201cthe Happy Gilmore.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like when these golfers try to do it, these pros, they\u2019re 5% thinking, \u2018Maybe this will work,\u2019\u201d says Herlihy, laughing.",
      "\u201cI played with Bryson (DeChambeau) like a week ago and when he did it, it was ridiculous,\u201d adds Sandler. \u201cHe literally blasted it 360 and just kept walking. I was like, \u2018Did he just smash the Happy Gilmore and not even think about it?\u2019\u201d",
      "It\u2019s possible that \u201cthe Happy Gilmore\u201d will even outlive the movies. There's a good chance that, even as you read this, somewhere some kid is trying it, hoping to get a laugh and maybe get it on the fairway, too.",
      "\u201cWhen we were putting it together, I called my dad and asked him if it was legal. He was like, \u2018I don\u2019t see why not,\u2019\u201d Sandler remembers. \u201cThen there are some people who look at it and go: \u2018It does help you swing hard. It gives you more momentum. You turn your hips faster. Maybe it\u2019s a good thing.\u2019\u201d",

      "So much of the attention going into New York Giants training camp is on first-round pick and quarterback of the future Jaxson Dart",
      "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Jaxson Dart is squarely in the spotlight as someone the New York Giants hope will be their quarterback of the future. The future is not here yet.",
      "For all the attention Dart is getting as a first-round draft pick, coach Brian Daboll made it clear when training camp opened Wednesday that the plan has not diverted from Russell Wilson being the guy at football's most important position.",
      "\u201cThese guys will be out here competing, but Russ is our starter,\u201d Daboll said.",
      "Wilson took all the first-team snaps in the first practice of camp, with Dart and journeyman Jameis Winston alternating going second and third. Dart threw an interception his first throw of 11-on-11 team drills, Wilson told his younger teammate to focus on the next play and the rookie's subsequent throw went for a touchdown.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re working well together,\u201d veteran defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence said. \u201cRuss is a great leader, Jameis is a great leader and I see them talking to him a lot. Russ handles his business really well, so for (Dart) to learn from that and them to be unselfish to teach that to him, it\u2019s only on an up trajectory.\"",
      "There's little direction to go but up for the Giants, who tied for the worst record in the NFL last season at 3-14. That is one reason fourth-year general manager Joe Schoen turned over the quarterback part of the roster almost completely \u2014 with local cult hero Tommy DeVito the lone holdover.",
      "Wilson at age 36 got a contract for this season worth up to $21 million with $10.5 million guaranteed. And New York traded a second-round pick and two third-rounders to move up to take Dart 25th, several weeks after signing Winston.",
      "Scouting Dart from afar at Mississippi and watching him up close in offseason workouts, the Giants like what they're witnessing so far.",
      "\u201cYou saw leadership, you saw arm talent, you saw athleticism and he\u2019s a rookie,\u201d Schoen said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a long way to go, and he\u2019s got a really good supporting cast in there to help. We\u2019ve got a really good coaching staff as well, so he\u2019s in a good spot right now.\u201d",
      "That spot is in reserve, though Daboll would not say if the backup job is up for grabs between Dart and Winston. Only that when the season starts on Sept. 7 at NFC East rival Washington, Wilson will be under center if healthy.",
      "Asked about that certainty, Wilson said he's \u201calways just focused on being the best version of myself every day.\u201d",
      "A teammate two seasons ago in Denver, tight end Chris Manhertz believes Wilson is qualified to handle this situation thanks to \u201call the traits of a good quarterback.\u201d",

      "McIntosh will be very busy during the eight days in the pool, packing her schedule with five individual events. She'll contend with prelims in some events, and she'll also add relays.",
      "\u201cThis means 14 or 15 races she could swim in eight days, demanding races,\u201d Canada's head coach Iain McDonald told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's a very challenging schedule she's set for herself.\u201d",
      "The 18-year-old Canadian set three world records in five days in June at the national trials. She broke her own 400-meter individual medley mark, dropping it to 4 minutes, 23.65 seconds, and set the 200 IM record (2:05.70) and the 400 freestyle record (3:54.18).",
      "She was also a mere half-second behind the 200 butterfly record, which has stood since 2009, and just off the 800 freestyle record set last month by American Katie Ledecky.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s such a versatile athlete, it\u2019s kind of tough to nail what her best events are,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty good right across the spectrum.\"",
      "McIntosh will be the focus on Day 1 of the pool events in Singapore. She swims the 400 freestyle final, and comes back about 30 minutes later for a semifinal of the 200 IM.",
      "Despite holding the world record in the 400 free, she's never won gold in the event at the Olympics or worlds. This time she's ready, and credits coach Fred Vergnoux.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m super pumped for the 400 freestyle and I\u2019m really excited to see how I manage doing the double,\u201d McIntosh told Canadian broadcaster the CBC.",
      "McIntosh said Vergnoux has boosted her endurance, pointing more to distance events.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s true that I haven\u2019t been able to do it on world stage yet,\u201d she said of the 400. \u201cI think going into past big meets I haven\u2019t had the confidence in my training and my freestyle in general \u2014 technique-wise and endurance-wise \u2014 that I have now.\u201d",
      "Ariarne Titmus was the gold medalist in Paris with silver for McIntosh, but the Australian swimmer is taking a year off. It's Titmus's record that McIntosh just broke. Ledecky, the bronze medalist in Paris, appears to be McIntosh's chief rival.",

      "Archaeologists in central Israel are excavating one of the world's oldest known burial sites, dating back 100,000 years",
      "SHOHAM, Israel -- Archaeologists believe they have found one of the oldest burial sites in the world at a cave in Israel, where the well-preserved remains of early humans dating back some 100,000 years were carefully arranged in pits.",
      "The findings at Tinshemet Cave in central Israel, published in an academic journal earlier this year, build on previous discoveries in northern Israel and add to a growing understanding of the origins of human burial.",
      "Of particular interest to archaeologists are objects found beside the remains that may have been used during ceremonies to honor the dead and could shed light on how our ancient ancestors thought about spirituality and the afterlife.",
      "\u201cThis is an amazing revolutionary innovation for our species,\" said Yossi Zaidner, one of the directors of the Tinshemet excavation and a professor of archaeology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \"It\u2019s actually the first time we are starting to use this behavior.\u201d",
      "Archaeologists working at Tinshemet since 2016 have discovered the remains of five early humans that date back to around 110,000 to 100,000 years ago, according to various technologies.",
      "The skeletons were discovered in pits and carefully arranged in a fetal position, which is known as a burial position, said Zaidner. Many were found with objects, such as basalt pebbles, animal remains or fragments of ochre, a reddish pigment made from iron-rich rocks.",
      "These objects, some sourced from hundreds of kilometers (miles) away, had no known practical use for daily life, so experts believe they were part of rituals meant to honor the dead.",
      "Tinshemet Cave is a dark slash in central Israel\u2019s rolling hills filled with squeaking fruit bats. Inside and around the cave is an unassuming stone mound which Zaidner calls \u201cone of the three or four most important sites for study of human evolution and behavior during the Paleolithic time.\u201d",
      "The Paleolithic era, also known as the Stone Age because of the onset of stone tools, lasted from as early as 3.3 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago. Tinshemet Cave is from the Middle Paleolithic era, roughly between 250,000 to 30,000 years ago.",
      "Some of the Tinshemet researchers' core findings were published in March in Nature Human Behavior. A key discovery were the remains of five early humans, including two full skeletons and three isolated skulls with other bones and teeth. Also of note were more than 500 differently sized fragments of red and orange ochre, a pigment created by heating iron-rich stones to a certain temperature \u2014 evidence that early humans had the means to create decorative objects.",
      "\u201cHere we see a really complex set of behaviors, not related to just food and surviving,\u201d Zaidner said.",
      "Using hand chisels and delicate, pen-sized pneumatic drills that resemble dental tools, archaeologists will need many more years to excavate the site. The field work, which started in 2016, is usually done over the summer months. This year, a dozen archaeology undergraduate and graduate students fanned out across the site, painstakingly documenting and removing each fragment of tool, object or bone.",
      "At the entrance to the cave, the skull of one of the early humans is slowly emerging from the rock sediment; it will be years before it is fully excavated.",

      "Tinshemet is exceptionally important to archaeologists because the local climate preserved the bones, tools, and ornaments in good condition, unlike many other parts of the world where these items were lost to time, said Christian Tryon, a professor at the University of Connecticut and a research associate at the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The skeletons and objects were so well preserved because of ash from frequent fires, likely for rituals. This large amount of ash mixed with rainfall and Israel's acidic limestone, creating optimal conditions for perseveration. One skeleton was in such good condition archaeologists could see how the fingers were interwoven, hands clasped beneath the head.",
      "Tryon said the Tinshemet findings are bolstering earlier discoveries from two similar burial sites dating back to the same period in northern Israel \u2014 Skhul Cave and Qafzeh Cave. Skhul Cave was excavated almost 100 years ago, and Qafzeh Cave mostly around 50 years ago, when archaeological practices were more haphazard.",
      "\u201cThere were so many uncertainties with those sites, but this is confirming it\u2019s a pattern we know, and they\u2019re really nailing down the dates,\u201d Tryon said.",
      "Tinshemet has helped archaeologists conclude that burial practices started to become more widespread during this time, representing a shift in how early humans treated their dead.",
      "Some archaeologists believe intentional burials started earlier. In South Africa, the Homo naledi species \u2013 an ancient cousin of Homo sapiens \u2013 may have been intentionally placing their dead in caves as early as 200,000 years ago. But many archaeologists said the findings are controversial and there is not enough evidence to support the claim of intentional burials.",
      "In ancient times, Israel was a bridge between Neanderthals from Europe and Homo sapiens from Africa. Archaeologists have identified other subgroups of early humans in the area, and believe the groups interacted and may have interbred.",
      "Experts have been studying the two full skeletons brought from Tinshemet for years, but it\u2019s still unclear if they were Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, a hybrid population or another group altogether.",
      "The mix of subgroups created opportunities for different groups of early humans to exchange knowledge or express identity, said Zaidner. It\u2019s around this time that archaeologists first see examples of early jewelry or body painting, which could be ways early humans started outwardly belonging to a certain group, drawing boundaries between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel Hershkovitz, a physical anthropologist at Tel Aviv University and the co-director of the Tinshemet site, said the concept of cemeteries in prehistoric life is important because it symbolizes \u201ca kind of a territory.\u201d",
      "He said that same kind of claim over land where ancestors are buried still echoes in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of claim you make to the neighbors, saying \u2019this is my territory, this part of the land belongs to my father and my forefather' and so on and so on.\u201d",

      "Teenagers are turning to AI for advice, guidance and conversation",
      "As artificial intelligence technology becomes part of daily life, adolescents are turning to chatbots for advice, guidance and conversation. The appeal is clear: Chatbots are patient, never judgmental, supportive and always available.",
      "That worries experts who say the booming AI industry is largely unregulated and that many parents have no idea about how their kids are using AI tools or the extent of personal information they are sharing with chatbots.",
      "New research shows more than 70% of American teenagers have used AI companions and more than half converse with them regularly. The study by Common Sense Media focused on \u201cAI companions,\u201d like Character. AI, Nomi and Replika, which it defines as \u201cdigital friends or characters you can text or talk with whenever you want,\u201d versus AI assistants or tools like ChatGPT, though it notes they can be used the same way.",
      "It\u2019s important that parents understand the technology. Experts suggest some things parents can do to help protect their kids:",
      "\u2014 Start a conversation, without judgment, says Michael Robb, head researcher at Common Sense Media. Approach your teen with curiosity and basic questions: \u201cHave you heard of AI companions?\u201d \u201cDo you use apps that talk to you like a friend?\u201d Listen and understand what appeals to your teen before being dismissive or saying you\u2019re worried about it.",
      "\u2014 Help teens recognize that AI companions are programmed to be agreeable and validating. Explain that\u2019s not how real relationships work and that real friends with their own points of view can help navigate difficult situations in ways that AI companions cannot.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that's really concerning is not only what's happening on screen but how much time it\u2019s taking kids away from relationships in real life,\u201d says Mitch Prinstein, chief of psychology at the American Psychological Association. \u201cWe need to teach kids that this is a form of entertainment. It's not real, and it's really important they distinguish it from reality and should not have it replace relationships in your actual life.\u201d",
      "The APA recently put out a health advisory on AI and adolescent well-being, and tips for parents.",
      "\u2014 Parents should watch for signs of unhealthy attachments.",
      "\u201cIf your teen is preferring AI interactions over real relationships or spending hours talking to AI companions, or showing that they are becoming emotionally distressed when separated from them \u2014 those are patterns that suggest AI companions might be replacing rather than complementing human connection,\u201d Robb says.",
      "\u2014 Parents can set rules about AI use, just like they do for screen time and social media. Have discussions about when and how AI tools can and cannot be used. Many AI companions are designed for adult use and can mimic romantic, intimate and role-playing scenarios.",

      "Teenagers are increasingly turning to AI for advice, emotional support and decision-making, according to a new study",
      "No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence.",
      "The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister\u2019s birthday party.",
      "The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.",
      "\u201cEveryone uses AI for everything now. It\u2019s really taking over,\u201d said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. \u201cI think kids use AI to get out of thinking.\u201d",
      "For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \u201cdigital friends,\u201d like Character.AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",
      "As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI\u2019s potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.",
      "\u201cAI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It\u2019s never judgmental,\u201d says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking to AI, you are always right. You\u2019re always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.\u201d",
      "All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an \u201cAI companion\u201d for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.",
      "\u201cThat felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,\u201d said Nair. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.\u201d",
      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \u201cas satisfying or more satisfying\u201d than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study\u2019s lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s eye-opening,\u201d said Robb. \u201cWhen we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.\u201d The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.",
      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",
      "\u201cIf teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else\u2019s perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,\u201d he said.",

The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character.AI chatbot.",
      "\u201cParents really have no idea this is happening,\u201d said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cAll of us are struck by how quickly this blew up.\u201d Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data.",
      "Telzer\u2019s research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.",
      "Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.",
      "\u201cOne of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,\u201d said Telzer. \u201cThey need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.\u201d",
      "Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.",
      "\u201cIf you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,\u201d Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.",
      "Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m worried that kids could get lost in this,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.\u201d",
      "Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children\u2019s mental health are different from those of social media.",
      "\u201cSocial media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,\u201d Nair said. \u201cI think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper \u2014 our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the new addiction,\u201d Nair added. \u201cThat\u2019s how I see it.\u201d",

      "The financial world is buzzing about tokenization, a process using blockchain to turn real-world assets like stocks or real estate into digital tokens",

And Robinhood\u2019s push into tokenizing shares of private companies quickly faced pushback from one of the world\u2019s most popular startups.",
      "The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time.",
      "The massive growth of stablecoins, which are a type of cryptocurrency typically bought and sold for $1, has helped fuel the appetite to tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said on a recent podcast.",

Netflix was market-expanding. In the same way, I think the tokenization of real-world assets will be market expanding.\u201d",

Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030.",
      "The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that\u2019s seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance.",
      "The world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs \u2014 more than $123,000 on Monday \u2014 while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what\u2019s been called the \u201cgolden age\u201d for digital assets.",

      "A U.K. High Court has ruled that Hewlett Packard Enterprise is owed over 700 million pounds from the estate of British tech tycoon Mike Lynch and his former finance director",
      "LONDON -- Hewlett Packard is owed more than 700 million pounds ($943 million) from British tech tycoon Mike Lynch's estate and his former finance director after they lost a fraud case involving Lynch's software company, a U.K. High Court judge ruled on Tuesday.",
      "The court\u2019s decision comes nearly a year after Lynch was killed when his superyacht sank off Sicily, where he had gathered with friends and family to celebrate his acquittal months earlier in a separate U.S. criminal trial.",
      "The U.S. tech company, now known as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, had accused Lynch of fraud and conspiracy after it bought Lynch's company, Autonomy Corp., for $11 billion.",
      "HPE also took Lynch to court in the U.K., seeking up to $4 billion in damages in a civil case. The High Court had ruled mostly in HPE\u2019s favor in 2022, but the judge had said that the amount awarded would be \u201csubstantially less\u201d than the company was seeking.",
      "Judge Robert Hildyard was originally due to issue a draft ruling in September but delayed it after Lynch\u2019s yacht, the Bayesian, sank in the storm off Sicily on Aug. 19. Lynch and his daughter were among seven people who died while 15 others survived, including the captain and most of the crew.",
      "In a written judgment, Hildyard expressed his \u201csympathy and deepest condolences\u201d to Lynch\u2019s wife and family.",
      "Hildyard said HPE suffered a loss of 646 million pounds based on the difference between Autonomy's purchase price and what it would have paid had Autonomy's \u201ctrue financial position been correctly presented.\"",

    "story": [
      "As global temperatures rise under climate change, the bees responsible for pollinating many crops are under increasing stress and scientists are trying to understand how they are affected",
      "WILLIAMSPORT, Ohio -- Sweat covers Isaac Barnes\u2019s face under his beekeeper\u2019s veil as he hauls boxes of honeycomb from his hives to his truck. It's a workout in what feels like a sauna as the late-morning June temperatures rise.",
      "Though Barnes was hot, his bees were even hotter. Their body temperatures can be up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit (about 15 Celsius) higher than the air around them. As global temperatures rise under climate change, scientists are trying to better understand the effects on managed and wild bees as they pollinate crops, gather nectar, make honey and reproduce.",
      "They noticed flying bees gathering nectar avoided overheating on the hottest days by using fewer but harder wingbeats to keep their body temperature below dangerous levels, according to a study published last year. Scientists also say that bees \u2014 like people \u2014 may also cope by retreating to a cooler environment such as the shade or their nest.",
      "\u201cJust like we go into the shade, or we sweat or we might work less hard, bees actually do the exact same thing so they can avoid the heat,\u201d said Jon Harrison, an environmental physiologist at Arizona State University and one of the study\u2019s authors.",
      "But that means the bees aren't able to do what they normally do, said Kevin McCluney, a biology professor at Bowling Green State University.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going out and getting more nectar. They\u2019re not mating. They\u2019re not doing the things that bees would otherwise do,\u201d McCluney said.",
      "Generally, most bees are heat-tolerant, but as the climate warms, some experts think their ability to fend off disease and gather food might become harder. And habitat loss, increased use of pesticides, diseases and lack of forage for both managed and wild bees are all listed as potential contributors to the global decline of bees and other pollinators.",
      "\u201cIf you're not well-fed, and your body is intoxicated with pesticides and you have lots of diseases in your body, you're going to be less heat-tolerant than if you were healthy,\u201d said Margarita L\u00f3pez-Uribe, a pollinator health expert at Pennsylvania State University.",
      "Earlier this year, preliminary results from the annual U.S. Beekeeping Survey found that beekeepers lost almost 56% of their managed colonies, the highest loss since the survey started in 2010.",
      "Almost all of the managed honeybee colonies in the U.S. are used to pollinate agricultural crops such as almonds, apples, cherries and blueberries. Fewer pollinators can lead to less pollination and potentially lower yields.",
      "\u201cIt's a very fragile system if you think about it,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Uribe said. \u201cBecause if something goes wrong, you have these super high-value crops that won\u2019t get enough bees for pollination.\u201d",
      "Back at Barnes' hives in Ohio, thousands of honeybees fly around as he gathers boxes to take back to his farm for honey production. Nearby, a couple of his bees land on milkweed flowers, a rare bit of plant diversity in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields.",
      "For Barnes, who operates Honeyrun Farm with his wife, Jayne, one of the challenges heat can pose to his 500 honeybee hives is fending off parasitic mites that threaten the bees. If temperatures get too hot, he can\u2019t apply formic acid, an organic chemical that kills the mites. If it\u2019s applied when it\u2019s too hot, the bees could die.",
      "Last year they lost almost a third of the 400 hives they sent to California to help pollinate commercial almond groves. Barnes thinks those hives may have been in poor health ahead of pollination because they were unable to ward off mites when it was hot months earlier.",

      "Sometimes the heat helps. Here in Ohio, Barnes' hives last summer produced a bumper crop of honey as they feasted on nearby soybean nectar as the plants bloomed in the heat. Still, the lack of diverse plants for bees to forage in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields isn't ideal.",
      "And even the native blooms are appearing erratically, Barnes said. In autumn, his bees search for food on goldenrod, but those blooms are appearing later. And even then, he has supplemented his hive with additional food to keep them healthy into the winter.",
      "\u201cEvery single plant that blooms is something that the bee can use,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAnd every single plant is affected by climate change.\u201d",
      "It's only in the last decade that people have become aware of the magnitude of the pollinator decline globally, said Harrison, of Arizona State University. Data is limited on how much climate change and heat stress is contributing to pollinator decline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively new focus for biology,\" he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s super important, but it\u2019s not being studied a ton.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget would eliminate the research program that funds the USGS Bee Lab, which supports the inventory, monitoring and natural history of the nation\u2019s wild bees. Other grants for bee research are also in jeopardy.",

      "\u201cRather than taking bold action to protect them, the Trump administration has proposed a reckless budget that would zero out funding for critical research aimed at saving important pollinators,\u201d he said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Harrison said his research on this topic would come to a halt if cuts are made to his federal funding, and it would be more difficult in general for scientists to study the disappearance of bees and other pollinators and improve how they prevent these losses. Not being able to manage these pollinator deaths could cause the price of fruits, vegetables, nuts, coffee and chocolate to jump or become scarce.",
      "\u201cHopefully, even if such research is defunded in the U.S., such research will continue in Europe and China, preventing these extreme scenarios,\u201d said Harrison.",

      "Archaeologists have identified a 250-year-old shipwreck uncovered on a remote Scottish beach",
      "LONDON -- When a schoolboy going for a run found the ribs of a wooden ship poking through the dunes of a remote Scottish beach, it sparked a hunt by archaeologists, scientists and local historians to uncover its story.",
      "Through a mix of high-tech science and community research, they have an answer. Researchers announced Wednesday that the vessel is very likely the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century warship that saw action in the American War of Independence before a second life hunting whales in the Arctic \u2014 and then a stormy demise.",
      "\u201cI would regard it as a lucky ship, which is a strange thing to say about a ship that\u2019s wrecked,\u201d said Ben Saunders, senior marine archaeologist at Wessex Archaeology, a charity that helped community researchers conduct the investigation.",
      "\u201cI think if it had been found in many other places, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily have had that community drive, that desire to recover and study that material, and also the community spirit to do it,\u201d Saunders said.",
      "The wreck was discovered in February 2024 after a storm swept away sand covering it on Sanday, one of the rugged Orkney Islands that lie off Scotland\u2019s northern tip.",
      "It excited interest on the island of 500 people, whose history is bound up with the sea and its dangers. Around 270 shipwrecks have been recorded around the 20-square-mile (50-square-kilometer) island since the 15th century.",
      "Local farmers used their tractors and trailers to haul the 12 tons of oak timbers off the beach, before local researchers set to work trying to identify it.",
      "\u201cThat was really good fun, and it was such a good feeling about the community \u2013 everybody pulling together to get it back,\u201d said Sylvia Thorne, one of the island\u2019s community researchers. \u201cQuite a few people are really getting interested in it and becoming experts.\u201d",
      "Dendrochronology \u2014 the science of dating wood from tree rings \u2014 showed the timber came from southern England in the middle of the 18th century. That was one bit of luck, Saunders said, because it coincides with \u201cthe point where British bureaucracy\u2019s really starting to kick off\u201d and detailed records were being kept.",
      "\u201cAnd so we can then start to look at the archive evidence that we have for the wrecks in Orkney,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIt becomes a process of elimination.",
      "\u201cYou remove ones that are Northern European as opposed to British, you remove wrecks that are too small or operating out of the north of England and you really are down to two or three \u2026 and Earl of Chatham is the last one left.\u201d",

      "Further research found that before it was the Earl of Chatham, the ship was HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate built in Chichester on England\u2019s south coast in 1749.",
      "Its military career saw it play a part in the expansion \u2014 and contraction \u2014 of the British Empire. It helped Britain wrest control of Canada from France during the sieges of Louisbourg and Quebec in the 1750s, and in the 1770s served as a convoy escort during Britain\u2019s failed effort to hold onto its American colonies.",
      "Sold off by the navy in 1784 and renamed, the vessel became a whaling ship, hunting the huge mammals in the Arctic waters off Greenland.",
      "Whale oil was an essential fuel of the Industrial Revolution, used to lubricate machinery, soften fabric and light city streets. Saunders said that in 1787 there were 120 London-based whaling ships in the Greenland Sea, the Earl of Chatham among them.",
      "A year later, while heading out to the whaling ground, it was wrecked in bad weather off Sanday. All 56 crew members survived \u2014 more evidence, Saunders says, that this was a vessel blessed with luck.",
      "The ship\u2019s timbers are being preserved in a freshwater tank at the Sanday Heritage Centre while plans are discussed to put it on permanent display.",
      "Saunders said that the project is a model of community involvement in archaeology.",

      "\u201cOne of the biggest things I\u2019ve got out of this project is realizing how much the past in Sanday is just constantly with you \u2014 either visible or just under the surface,\u201d said Ruth Peace, another community researcher.",

      "MIAMI -- Elon Musk fought court cases on opposite coasts Monday, raising a question about the billionaire that could either speed his plan to put self-driving Teslas on U.S. roads or throw up a major roadblock: Can this wildly successful man who tends to exaggerate really be trusted?",
      "In Miami, a Tesla driver who has admitted he was wrong to reach for a dropped cell phone moments before a deadly accident, spoke of the danger of putting too much faith in Musk's technology \u2014 in this case his Autopilot program.",
      "\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said George McGee, who ran off the road and killed a woman out stargazing with her boyfriend. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d",
      "In unusual coincidence, regulators arguing an Oakland, California, case tried to pin exaggerated talk about the same Tesla technology at the center of a request to suspend the carmaker from being able to sell vehicles in the state.",
      "Musk's tendency to talk big \u2014 whether it's his cars, his rockets or his government costing-cutting efforts \u2014 have landed him in trouble with investors, regulators and courts before, but rarely at such a delicate moment.",
      "After his social media spat with President Donald Trump, Musk can no longer count on a light regulatory touch from Washington. Meanwhile, sales of his electric cars have plunged and so a hit to his safety reputation could threaten his next big project: rolling out driverless robotaxis \u2014 hundreds of thousands of them \u2014 in several U.S. cities by the end of next year.",
      "The Miami case holds other dangers, too. Lawyers for the family of the dead woman, Naibel Benavides Leon, recently convinced the judge overseeing the jury trial to allow them to argue for punitive damages. A car crash lawyer not involved in the case, but closely following it, said that could cost Tesla tens of millions of dollars, or possibly more.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen punitive damages go to the hundreds of millions, so that is the floor,\u201d said Miguel Custodio of Los Angeles-based Custodio & Dubey. \u201cIt is also a signal to other plaintiffs that they can also ask for punitive damages, and then the payments could start compounding.\u201d",
      "That Tesla has allowed the Miami case to proceed to trial is surprising. It has settled at least four deadly accidents involving Autopilot, including payments just last week to a Florida family of a Tesla driver. That said, Tesla was victorious in two other jury cases, both in California, that also sought to lay blame on its technology for crashes.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Miami case argue that Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature, called Autopilot, should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles-an-hour in an April 2019 crash. Tesla said that drivers are warned not to rely on Autopilot, or its more advanced Full Self-Driving system. It says the fault entirely lies with the \"distracted driver\" just like so many other \u201caccidents since cellphones were invented.\u201d",
      "Driver McGee settled a separate suit brought by the family of Benavides and her severely injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.",
      "McGee was clearly shaken when shown a dashcam video Monday of his car jumping a Key West, Florida, road and hitting a parked Chevrolet Tahoe which then slammed into Benavides and sent her 75 feet through the air to her death. Asked if he had seen those images before, McGee pinched his lips, shook his head, then squeaked out a response, \u201cNo.\u201d",

      "Tesla's attorney sought to show that McGee was fully to blame, asking if he had ever contacted Tesla for additional instructions about how Autopilot or any other safety features worked. McGee said he had not, though he was heavy user of the features. He said he had driven the same road home from work 30 or 40 times. Under questioning, he also acknowledged he alone was responsible for watching the road and hitting the brakes.",
      "Summarizing the testimony, Tesla said in a statement after the court adjourned that McGee had \"stated the simple truth that we all know: If he had just paid attention to the road instead of searching for his dropped cell phone and pressing the accelerator \u2014which he was doing for over a minute before the crash \u2014 this tragic accident would never have happened.\u201d",
      "But lawyers for the Benavides family had a chance in the courtroom at parrying that line of argument, asking McGee if he would have taken his eyes off the road and reached for his phone had he been driving any car other than a Tesla on Autopilot.",
      "McGee responded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201d",
      "The case is expected to continue for two more weeks.",
      "In the California case, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing before an administrative judge that Tesla has misled drivers by exaggerating the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features. A court filing claims even those feature names are misleading because they offer just partial self-driving",
      "Musk has been warned by federal regulators to stop making public comments suggesting Full Self-Driving allows his cars to drive themselves because it could lead to overreliance on the system, resulting in possible crashes and deaths. He also has run into trouble with regulators for Autopilot. In 2023, the company had to recall 2.3 million vehicles for problems with the technology and is now under investigation for saying it fixed the issue though it\u2019s unclear it has, according to regulatory documents.",

      "MOSCOW -- Russian lawmakers on Tuesday approved a bill that punishes online searches for information that is deemed \u201cextremist,\u201d the latest move by government authorities in their relentless crackdown on dissent.",
      "The bill passed by the lower house, the State Duma, moves to its all-but-certain endorsement in the upper house and then goes to President Vladimir Putin to be signed into law.",
      "The legislation punishes what it describes as \u201cdeliberately searching for and accessing extremist materials\u201d online. First-time offenders face a fine of up to the equivalent of $64.",
      "The official definition of extremist activity is extremely broad and includes opposition groups like the Anti-Corruption Foundation, created by the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and the \u201cinternational LGBT movement.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not clear how authorities will track down violators. Officials and lawmakers said ordinary internet users won't be affected and only those who methodically seek outlawed content will be targeted. They didn't explain how the authorities would differentiate between them.",
      "Some observers have suggested the information would likely come from internet providers or social media platforms, and police also could randomly check the search history of cellphones or computers.",
      "The new legislation also contained a ban on advertising of virtual private network services and fines for VPN resources that fail to comply with government regulations, but stopped short of banning their use. It did list the use of a VPN as an \u201caggravating circumstance\u201d in case of other violations of the law.",
      "Russians widely use VPN services for access to banned content, but authorities have sought to tighten restrictions, trying to close the loopholes. The state communications watchdog has increasingly used technology to analyze traffic and block specific VPN protocols.",

      "When the KissCam at a Coldplay concert last week landed on a couple who suspiciously escaped their embrace and tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work",
      "NEW YORK -- When the \u201cKissCam\u201d at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work.",
      "In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video \u2014 and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.",
      "The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world \u2014 about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through \u201csocial media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.",
      "So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see?",
      "It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.",
      "From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product \u2014 and the center of attention.",
      "And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket \u2014 and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.",
      "Ellis Cashmore, author of the book \u201cCelebrity Culture,\u201d proposes that the rapid fame of last week\u2019s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: \u201cIs the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there\u2019s no such thing as the private life anymore,\u201d he notes. \u201cCertainly not in the traditional sense of the term.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,\u201d adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume privacy on the street anymore.\u201d",
      "Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events \u2014 from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It\u2019s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What\u2019s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.",
      "That isn\u2019t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online \u2014 where it can zip around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the camera,\" Bock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the distribution system that is wild and new.\u201d",

      "Then there's the second ring of exposure \u2014 what happens after the video or photos spread.",
      "Experts point to growing instances of social media users rushing to publicly identify, or dox, the people captured on camera \u2014 much like how quickly the internet committed to finding those involved in the Coldplay moment, for example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer\u2019s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.",
      "But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances \u2014 including AI \u2014 have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. \u201cWhen you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",
      "And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved.",
      "At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee \u2014 leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.",
      "For the now-viral moment, \u201cwe can talk about what\u2019s right and wrong, and whether they deserved it,\u201d says Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. Still, it\u2019s a \u201cvery frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cThere are real human beings behind this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away \u2014 and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to \u201cthink before you share\u201d and question whether something\u2019s really accurate.",
      "\u201cSocial media has changed so much,\u201d Bock says. \u201cBut we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.\u201d",

      "The Muscogee Nation Supreme Court has ruled in favor of two descendants of former slaves held by the tribe",
      "The Muscogee Nation Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that two descendants of people once enslaved by the tribe are entitled to tribal citizenship.",
      "The court found that the tribal nation\u2019s citizenship board violated an 1866 treaty when it denied the applications of Rhonda Grayson and Jeffrey Kennedy in 2019 because they could not identify a lineal descendant of the tribe.",
      "\u201cAre we, as a Nation, bound to treaty promises made so many years ago? Today, we answer in the affirmative, because this is what Mvskoke law demands,\u201d the court wrote in its opinion.",
      "The Muscogee Nation is one of five tribes in Oklahoma that once practiced slavery, and in that 1866 treaty with the U.S. government, the tribe both abolished it and granted citizenship to the formerly enslaved. But in 1979, the tribal nation adopted a constitution that restricted membership to the descendants of people listed as \u201cMuscogee (Creek) Indians by blood\u201d on the Dawes Rolls, a census of members of the five tribes created around 1900.",
      "When the Dawes Rolls were created, people were listed on two separate rolls: those who were Muscogee and those who were identified by the U.S. government as Freedmen. In its ruling Wednesday, the court remanded the matter back to the Muscogee Nation's citizenship board and directed it to apply the Treaty of 1866 to Grayson and Kennedy's applications, as well as any future applicants who can trace an ancestor to either roll.",
      "The decision could create a path to tribal citizenship for thousands of new members who are not Muscogee by blood.",
      "The ruling is a long-awaited affirmation of their ancestors and their rightful place in the Muscogee Nation, said Rhonda Grayson.",
      "\u201cWhile this victory honors our past, it also offers a meaningful opportunity for healing and reconciliation. It\u2019s time now to come together, rebuild trust, and move forward as one united Nation, ensuring future generations never again face exclusion or erasure,\" she said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cWhen I heard the ruling, I felt generations of my family exhale at once,\" Kennedy added in a statement. \u201cOur ancestors signed that treaty in good faith, and today the Court finally honored their word.\u201d",

One provision of the constitution requires that citizens be at least one quarter Muscogee \u201cby blood\u201d to run for office.",
      "\u201cWe are currently reviewing the order to understand its basis as well as its implications for our processes,\u201d Muscogee Nation Chief David Hill said in a statement. \u201cIt may be necessary to ask for a reconsideration of this order to receive clarity so that we can ensure that we move forward in a legal, constitutional manner.\u201d",
      "Successful legal cases were brought against two of the five tribes, the Seminole Nation and the Cherokee Nation, which have since granted citizenship to Freedmen descendants. But how that citizenship is implemented could come down to politics, said Jonathon Velie, an attorney who worked on behalf of Freedmen in both cases.",
      "The roughly 2,500 Freedmen citizens in the Seminole Nation are not allowed to run for higher office and do not have access to certain resources, like tribal housing and education assistance. The 17,000 Freedmen citizens in the Cherokee Nation, however, have been embraced by the last two administrations and are given the full benefits of tribal members.",
      "When it comes to the U.S. Department of the Interior, which oversees many of the resources owed to tribes through treaty rights, the Freedmen citizens in both tribes are the same, said Velie \u2014 their tribes just honor their citizenship differently.",
      "\u201cI hope the (Muscogee) Creek Nation welcomes them back in, because what they won today wasn\u2019t the U.S. Government or the U.S. courts telling them, they told themselves in their own judicial system,\" Velie said.",

      "NEW YORK -- The fertility rate in the U.S. dropped to an all-time low in 2024 with less than 1.6 kids per woman, new federal data released Thursday shows.",
      "The U.S. was once among only a few developed countries with a rate that ensured each generation had enough children to replace itself \u2014 about 2.1 kids per woman. But it has been sliding in America for close to two decades as more women are waiting longer to have children or never taking that step at all.",
      "The new statistic is on par with fertility rates in western European countries, according to World Bank data.",
      "Alarmed by recent drops, the Trump administration has taken steps to increase falling birth rates, like issuing an executive order meant to expand access to and reduce costs of in vitro fertilization and backing the idea of \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d that might encourage more couples to have kids.",
      "But there's no reason to be alarmed, according to Leslie Root, a University of Colorado Boulder researcher focused on fertility and population policy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this as part of an ongoing process of fertility delay. We know that the U.S. population is still growing, and we still have a natural increase \u2014 more births than deaths,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the statistic for the total fertility rate with updated birth data for 2024.",
      "In the early 1960s, the U.S. total fertility rate was around 3.5, but plummeted to 1.7 by 1976 after the Baby Boom ended. It gradually rose to 2.1 in 2007 before falling again, aside from a 2014 uptick. The rate in 2023 was 1.621, and inched down in 2024 to 1.599, according to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",

      "That brought the yearly national total to just over 3.6 million babies born.",

      "What happened? CDC officials said it was due to recalculations stemming from a change in the U.S. Census population estimates used to compute the birth rate.",

Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, the command said in a statement.

      "The gun is made by New Hampshire-based manufacturer Sig Sauer, which is defending itself against multiple lawsuits alleging that its popular related gun, the P320 pistol, can go off without the trigger being pulled. Sig Sauer denies the claims, saying the P320 is safe and the problem is user error. It has prevailed in some cases.",
      "The P320 was adopted by the U.S. military as M17 and M18 pistols, and the M18 is now the official sidearm of all branches of the U.S. military, Sig Sauer says on its website. In 2019, Sig Sauer announced it had delivered its 100,000th M17 and M18s to the U.S. military.",
      "The pause is so far limited to the Global Strike Command, which includes more than 33,700 Airmen and civilians. The rest of the Air Force and the other armed services have not announced any orders to avoid using the pistols.",

      "Earlier this year, Sig Sauer appealed a ban of the P320, M17 and M18 pistols by the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission, arguing that it appears to be based on inaccurate and incomplete information. The commission banned the weapons after a recruit said his P320 discharged while he was drawing it, even though his finger was not on the trigger.",
      "And just this month, Sig Sauer announced that the Michigan State Police is adopting the M18 as its primary sidearm.",

That\u2019s in addition to lawsuits filed in other states, including one in Pennsylvania last year alleging a wrongful death.",
      "They say the P320 design requires an external mechanical safety, a feature that is optional. The most recent New Hampshire case, representing 22 plaintiffs in 16 states, was filed in March. A judge heard arguments Monday on Sig Sauer\u2019s motions to dismiss the lawsuit or break it up and transfer it to districts where the plaintiffs live.",
      "There also was discussion of a 2-month-old law in New Hampshire, created in response to the lawsuits, that prohibits product liability claims against Sig Sauer and other gun makers based on the \u201cabsence or presence\u201d of the external safety and several other optional features. Claims can still be filed over manufacturing defects. The law hasn't yet been incorporated into the case.",

      "\u201cI share the desire expressed by others to understand the why,\u201d Hippler said. \u201cBut upon reflection, it seems to me, and this is just my own opinion, that by continuing to focus on why, we continue to give Mr. Kohberger relevance, we give him agency and we give him power.\u201d",
      "The crime horrified the city, which had not seen a homicide in about five years, and prompted a massive search for the perpetrator. Some students took the rest of their classes online because they felt unsafe. Kohberger, a graduate student in criminology at nearby Washington State University, was arrested in Pennsylvania, where his parents lived, roughly six weeks later.",
      "A Q-tip from the garbage at his parents\u2019 house and genetic genealogy was used to match Kohberger\u2019s DNA to material recovered from a knife sheath found at the home, investigators said. They used cellphone data to pinpoint his movements and surveillance camera footage to help locate a white sedan that was seen repeatedly driving past the home the night of the killings.",
      "But investigators told reporters after Wednesday's hearing that exhaustive efforts failed to find the murder weapon, the clothes Kohberger was wearing at the time or any connection between him and the students.",
      "Within hours of the sentencing, the Moscow Police Department posted hundreds of documents about the investigation on its website. They detailed how investigators processed the gruesome crime scene; ran down tips from people who claimed to have gone on a Tinder date with Kohberger or to have seen him walking along a highway; and tested soil and pollen found on a shovel in his car to see if they could narrow down where it had been used.",
      "\u201cThis world was a better place with her in it,\u201d said Scott Laramie, Mogen's stepfather. \u201cKaren and I are ordinary people, but we lived extraordinary lives because we had Maddie.\u201d",

      "A judge has scheduled sentencings in December for five former Memphis police officers convicted of federal charges in the beating death of Tyre Nichols",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A judge on Thursday scheduled sentencings in December for five former Memphis police officers convicted of federal charges in the 2023 beating death of Tyre Nichols, after the sentencings were delayed when the previous judge in the case surprisingly recused himself.",
      "During a hearing, U.S. District Judge Sheryl H. Lipman said the five officers would be sentenced the week of Dec. 15. However, she noted those dates could change or be canceled depending on how she rules on several sealed motions, including one for a new trial for three of the men.",
      "Lipman said she could rule on the pending motions by mid-September.",
      "U.S. District Judge Mark Norris issued a terse order on June 13 saying he was recusing himself, just days before he was supposed to sentence the officers. He offered no further explanation, and the reason for his recusal has not been made public. Lipman was added to the case the same day.",
      "Norris later recused himself from a $550 million lawsuit filed by Nichols' mother against the city of Memphis, the police chief and the officers. Lipman also took over that case.",
      "Norris had overseen the case since federal indictments were issued in September 2023. He accepted guilty pleas from two of the officers and presided over the trial for the others in October.",
      "A flurry of motions were filed under seal after the recusal, including a request by defense attorneys seeking a new trial. It was not clear if any of those filings asked for Norris to step away from the case. It is unusual for a judge to recuse themself from a case between the trial and sentencing.",
      "The city of Memphis and its police chief, and the Daily Memphian news outlet, have filed motions to unseal the documents.",
      "On Jan. 7, 2023, the officers yanked Nichols from his car, then pepper-sprayed and hit the 29-year-old Black man with a Taser. Nichols fled, and when the five officers, who also are Black, caught up with him, they punched, kicked and hit him with a police baton. Nichols called out for his mother during the beating, which took place just steps from his home.",
      "Nichols died Jan. 10, 2023.",
      "Footage of the beating captured by a police pole camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled with his injuries \u2014 video that prompted intense scrutiny of police in Memphis.",

      "Bean, Haley and Smith were found guilty in federal court in October of obstruction of justice through witness tampering related to an attempt to cover up the beating.",
      "The officers failed to say that they or their colleagues punched and kicked Nichols and broke Memphis Police Department rules when they did not include complete and accurate statements about what type of force they used.",
      "Bean and Smith were acquitted of more serious civil rights charges by the federal jury. Haley was found guilty of violating Nichols\u2019 civil rights by causing bodily injury and showing deliberate indifference to medical needs. He was also convicted of conspiracy to tamper with witnesses.",
      "Bean, Haley and Smith were acquitted in May of all state charges, including second-degree murder.",
      "Martin and Mills pleaded guilty in federal court last year to violating Nichols\u2019 civil rights by causing death and conspiracy to witness tamper. They did not stand trial in federal court with their former colleagues. Martin and Mills also avoided the trial in state court after reaching agreements to plead guilty there. Both Martin and Mills testified in the federal trial, and Mills also took the stand in the state trial.",
      "The officers were part of a crime suppression team called the Scorpion Unit that was disbanded weeks after Nichols died. The team targeted illegal drugs and guns and violent offenders, and sometimes used force against unarmed people.",
      "In December, the U.S. Justice Department said a 17-month investigation showed the Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people. The investigation also found that the police department conducts unlawful stops, searches, and arrests.",
      "In May, the Trump administration announced it was retracting the findings of Justice Department civil rights investigations of police departments, including Memphis, that were issued under the Biden administration.",
      "The city has created a task force to address police department reforms. The task force has not announced any recommendations.",

      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has made a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room and targeted President Donald Trump\u2019s political enemies",
      "WASHINGTON -- As the national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard is responsible for guarding America's secrets and discovering threats from overseas. But when she made a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room Wednesday, her targets were President Donald Trump\u2019s political enemies.",
      "Escalating her attempts to undermine the long-settled conclusion that Russia tried to help Trump beat Hillary Clinton for the presidency nearly a decade ago, she unspooled what she called unshakable proof that then-President Barack Obama and his advisers plotted nothing short of a coup.",
      "\u201cThey conspired to subvert the will of the American people,\u201d she said, claiming they fabricated evidence to taint Trump\u2019s victory.",
      "Little of what she said was new, and much of it was baseless. Gabbard said her investigation into the former Democratic administration was designed to stop the weaponization of national security institutions, but it spurred more questions about her own independence atop a spying system intended to provide unvarnished intelligence.",
      "Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who ran for president herself before joining Trump\u2019s idiosyncratic political ecosystem, seemed prepared to use her presentation to burnish her own standing. She was trailed by her cinematographer husband, who held a video camera to capture the moment.",
      "And Trump, who had previously expressed public doubts about Gabbard\u2019s analysis of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, appeared satisfied. He posted a video of her remarks, pinning them at the top of his social media feed.",
      "It was a display that cemented Gabbard\u2019s role as one of Trump\u2019s chief agents of retribution, delivering official recognition of Trump\u2019s grievances about the Russia investigation that shadowed his first term. The focus on a years-old scandal also served Trump\u2019s attempts to shift attention from the Jeffrey Epstein case and questions about the president\u2019s own association with an abuser of underage girls.",
      "During her White House remarks, Gabbard said she has referred the documents to the Justice Department to consider for a possible criminal investigation. Hours later, the department announced the creation of a \u201cstrike force\u201d to investigate the findings.",
      "Obama\u2019s postpresidential office declined to comment Wednesday but issued a rare response a day earlier. \u201cThese bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,\u201d said Patrick Rodenbush, an Obama spokesman.",
      "The White House rejected questions about the timing of Gabbard\u2019s revelations and whether they were designed to curry favor with Trump or distract attention from the administration\u2019s handling of files relating to Epstein.",
      "Still, Trump was quick to reward Gabbard\u2019s loyalty this week, calling her \u201cthe hottest person in the room.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, she released a report by the Republican staff of the House Intelligence Committee produced during the first Trump administration. It did not dispute that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, but cites what it says were trade craft failings in the assessment reached by the intelligence community that Russian President Vladimir Putin influenced the election because he intended for Trump to win.",
      "Gabbard went beyond some conclusions of the report in describing its findings from the White House podium. She, along with the report, also seized on the fact that a dossier including uncorroborated tips and salacious gossip about Trump\u2019s ties to Russia was referenced in a classified version annex of an intelligence community assessment released in 2017 that detailed Russia\u2019s interference.",
      "The dossier was not the basis for the FBI\u2019s decision to open an investigation in July 2016 into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, but Trump supporters have seized on the unverified innuendo in the document to try to undercut the broader probe.",
      "Gabbard said she didn't know why the documents weren't released during Trump's first administration. Her office did not respond to questions about the timing of the release.",
      "Responding to a question from a reporter about Gabbard's motivations, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused journalists of looking for a story where there wasn't one.",

      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe served briefly as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term but did not release any of the information declassified by Gabbard. The CIA declined to comment on Gabbard's remarks Wednesday.",
      "Gabbard told Congress in April that Iran wasn\u2019t actively seeking a nuclear weapon, and Trump dismissed her assessment just before U.S. strikes on Iran.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care what she said,\u201d Trump said in June on Air Force One when asked about Gabbard\u2019s testimony.",
      "Gabbard recently shared her findings about the Russia investigation in an Oval Office meeting with Trump, according to two administration officials who requested anonymity to discuss a private conversation. Afterward, one of the officials said, Trump expressed satisfaction that Gabbard\u2019s findings aligned with his own beliefs.",
      "On Friday, Gabbard\u2019s office released a report that downplayed the extent of Russian interference in the 2016 election by highlighting Obama administration emails showing officials had concluded before and after the presidential race that Moscow had not hacked state election systems to manipulate votes in Trump\u2019s favor.",
      "But Obama\u2019s Democratic administration never suggested otherwise, even as it exposed other means by which Russia interfered in the election, including through a massive hack-and-leak operation of Democratic emails by intelligence operatives working with WikiLeaks, as well as a covert influence campaign aimed at swaying public opinion and sowing discord through fake social media posts.",
      "Earlier this month Ratcliffe released a report criticizing aspects of the intelligence community assessment and suggesting the process had been rushed. The report did not address multiple investigations since then, including a report from the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee in 2020 that reached the same conclusion about Russia\u2019s influence and motives.",
      "Lawmakers from both parties have long stressed the need for an independent intelligence service. Democrats said Gabbard\u2019s reports show she has placed partisanship and loyalty to Trump over her duty and some have called for her resignation.",
      "\u201cIt seems as though the Trump administration is willing to declassify anything and everything except the Epstein files,\u201d Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Warner predicted Gabbard's actions could prompt U.S. allies to share less information for fear it would be politicized or recklessly declassified.",

But Mollie learned the neonatal team at Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital was performing lifesaving measures on babies born at 21 weeks gestation. She went into labor days before that benchmark, but with medical help, she was able to stall the birth to exactly 21 weeks.",

      "Pro wrestling icon Hulk Hogan has died, police and World Wrestling Entertainment said. He was 71.",
      "First responders were called to the Clearwater Beach, Florida, home of Hogan, whose real name was Terry Bollea,  around 9:50 a.m. Thursday, police said.",
      "\"The nature of the call was for a cardiac arrest,\" the Clearwater Police Department said in a statement. He was taken to Morton Plant Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.",
      "\"There were no signs of foul play or suspicious activity,\" Maj. Nate Burnside told reporters.",
      "Hogan was perhaps the biggest star in WWE's long history. He was the main draw for the first WrestleMania in 1985 and was a fixture for years, facing everyone from Andre The Giant and Randy Savage to The Rock and even company chairman Vince McMahon.",
      "He won at least six WWE championships and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005.",
      "\"One of pop culture's most recognizable figures, Hogan helped WWE achieve global recognition in the 1980s. WWE extends its condolences to Hogan's family, friends, and fans,\" WWE said in\u00a0a statement posted on social media.",
      "\"Hulkamania,\" as the energy he created was called, started running wild in the mid-1980s and pushed professional wrestling into the mainstream. He was a flag-waving American hero with the horseshoe mustache, red and yellow gear and massive arms he called his \"24-inch pythons.\"",
      "Hogan was also a celebrity outside the wrestling world, appearing in numerous movies and television shows, including a reality show about his life on VH1, \"Hogan Knows Best.\"",
      "In recent years, Hogan added his celebrity to politics. At the 2024 Republican National Convention, he merged classic WWE maneuvers with then-candidate Donald Trump's rhetoric to passionately endorse him for president.",
      "\"Let Trumpamania run wild brother! Let Trumpamania rule again! Let Trumpamania make America great again!\" Hogan shouted into the raucous crowd.",
      "He ripped off a T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of himself on a motorcycle to reveal a bright red Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath. Trump stood to applaud the move.",
      "\"We lost a great friend today, the 'Hulkster,'\" President Trump wrote on his social media site Thursday.",
      "He praised Hogan's speech at the RNC, calling it \"absolutely electric\" and \"one of the highlights of the entire week.\"",
      "\"He entertained fans from all over the World, and the cultural impact he had was massive,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Hogan lately began to invest in alternatives to theatrical, professional wrestling, announcing plans in April to serve as the first commissioner for the Real American Freestyle organization, which describes itself as \"the first unscripted pro wrestling\" league in the world. The first event is Aug. 30 at Cleveland State University.",
      "\"The idea was so exciting that I get a chance to be involved with all these young people and help guide them in any way, especially to make them huge stars and create a future for them,\" Hogan said. \"People might be surprised, but wrestling is wrestling, brother.\"",
      "Hogan first became champion in what was then the World Wrestling Federation in 1984, and pro wrestling took off from there. His popularity helped lead to the creation of the annual WrestleMania event in 1985, when he teamed up with Mr. T to beat \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and \"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff in the main event.",
      "He slammed and beat Andre the Giant at WrestleMania III in 1987, and the WWF gained momentum. His feud with the late \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage \u2014 perhaps his greatest rival \u2014 carried pro wrestling even further.",
      "Hogan was a central figure in what is known as the Monday Night Wars. The WWE and World Championship Wrestling were battling for ratings supremacy in 1996. Hogan tilted things in WCW's favor with the birth of the Hollywood Hogan character and the formation of the New World Order, a villainous stable that put WCW ahead in the ratings.",
      "He returned to the WWE in 2002 and became a champion again. His match with The Rock at WrestleMania X8, a loss during which fans cheered for his \"bad guy\" character, was seen as a passing of the torch.",
      "Hogan was perhaps as well known for his larger-than-life personality as he was his in-ring exploits. He was beloved for his \"promos\" \u2014 hype sessions he used to draw fans into matches. He often would play off his interviewer, \"Mean\" Gene Okerlund, starting his interviews off with, \"Well, lemme tell ya something, Mean Gene!\"",
      "In 2016, a Florida jury awarded Hogan $115 million in a lawsuit against Gawker Media and then added $25 million in punitive damages. Hogan sued after Gawker in 2012 posted a video of him having sex with his former best friend's wife. He contended the post violated his privacy.",
      "Hogan smiled and wore black throughout the three-week trial.",
      "\"Everywhere I show up, people treat me like I'm still the champ,\" he said of the support from fans.",

Social media lit up with discussion of a possible reunion, seven years after Buckingham was fired from Fleetwood Mac.",

      "Nicks and Buckingham released \"Buckingham Nicks\" shortly before joining Fleetwood Mac in 1974. It was a commercial failure, resulting in their label, Polydor Records, dropping the pair from their contract.

We have every intention of putting that album back out and possibly even doing something along with it, but I can't put any specifics on that.\"",

He announced in 2023 that he would retire from touring.",
      "\"Ozzy was someone who lived hard, rocked hard and retired over and over again, starting, I think, first in the '90s,\" Joe Levy, a contributor for Rolling Stone magazine, told CBS News on Tuesday following news of Osbourne's death. \"He retired at least two times, kept coming back, and the fact that his Parkinson's diagnosis kept him from performing made it all the more amazing that just two weeks ago, he took the stage for what absolutely would be the final time.\"",

      "Black Sabbath's 1969 self-titled debut LP has been likened to the Big Bang of heavy metal. It came during the height of the Vietnam War and crashed the hippie party, dripping menace and foreboding. The cover of the record was of a spooky figure against a stark landscape. The music was loud, dense and angry, and marked a shift in rock 'n' roll.",

      "In a statement posted to its Facebook page Tuesday, the Alamo said it was \"saddened to hear\" of Osbourne's death.",
      "\"His relationship with the Alamo was marked initially by a deeply disrespectful incident in 1982,\" the statement reads. \"This act profoundly and rightfully upset many who hold this site sacred. However, redemption and reconciliation eventually became part of his history as well. In 1992, Ozzy personally apologized to then-Mayor Nelson Wolff and expressed genuine remorse for his actions. Decades later, in 2015, he revisited the Alamo grounds to learn and appreciate the site's profound history, openly demonstrating humility and understanding.\"",
      "Osbourne was sued in 1987 by parents of a 19-year-old teen who died by suicide while listening to his song \"Suicide Solution.\" The lawsuit was dismissed. Osbourne said the song was really about the dangers of alcohol, which caused the death of his friend Bon Scott, lead singer of AC/DC.",
      "Then-Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York claimed in 1990 that Osbourne's songs led to demonic possession and even suicide. \"You are ignorant about the true meaning of my songs,\" the singer wrote back. \"You have also insulted the intelligence of rock fans all over the world.\"",
      "Audiences at Osbourne shows could be mooned or spit on by the singer. They would often be hectored to scream along with the song, but the Satan-invoking Osbourne would usually send the crowds home with their ears ringing and a hearty \"God bless!\"",
      "He started an annual tour \u2014 Ozzfest \u2014   in 1996 after he was rejected from the lineup of what was then the top touring music festival, Lollapalooza. Ozzfest has gone on to host such bands as Slipknot, Tool, Megadeth, Rob Zombie, System of a Down, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park.",
      "Osbourne's look changed little over his life. He wore his long hair flat, heavy black eye makeup and round glasses, often wearing a cross around his neck. In 2013, he reunited with Black Sabbath for the dour, raw \"13,\" which reached No. 1 on the U.K. Albums Chart and peaked at No. 86 on the U.S. Billboard 200. In 2019, he had a Top 10 hit when featured on Post Malone's \"Take What You Want,\" Osbourne's first song in the Top 10 since 1989.",
      "In 2020, he released the album \"Ordinary Man,\" which had as its title song a duet with Elton John. \"I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky/And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man,\" he sang. In 2022, he landed his first career back-to-back No. 1 rock radio singles from his album \"Patient Number 9,\" which featured collaborations with Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Mike McCready, Chad Smith, Robert Trujillo and Duff McKagan. It earned four Grammy nominations.",
      "At the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2024, Jack Black called him \"greatest frontman in the history of rock and roll\" and \"the Jack Nicholson of rock.\" Osbourne thanked his fans, his guitarist Randy Rhoads and his longtime wife, Sharon.",
      "The beginnings of Black Sabbath",
      "John Michael Osbourne was raised in the gritty city of Birmingham, England. Kids in school nicknamed him Ozzy, short for his surname. As a boy, he loved the Four Seasons, Chuck Berry and Little Richard. The Beatles made a huge impression.",
      "\"They came from Liverpool, which was approximately 60 miles north of where I come from,\" he told Billboard. \"So all of a sudden it was in my grasp, but I never thought it would be as successful as it became.\"",
      "In the late 1960s, Osbourne had teamed up with Butler, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward as the Polka Tulk Blues Band. They decided to rename the band Earth, but found to their dismay there was another band with that name. So they changed the name to the American title of the classic Italian horror movie \"I Tre Volti Della Paura,\" starring Boris Karloff: Black Sabbath.",
      "Once they found their sludgy, ominous groove, the band was productive, putting out their self-titled debut and \"Paranoid\" in 1970, \"Master of Reality\" in 1971, \"Vol. 4\" in 1972 and \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" in 1973.",
      "The music was all about industrial guitar riffs and disorienting changes in time signatures, along with lyrics that spoke of alienation and doom. \"People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time,\" Osbourne sang in one song. \"All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy/Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify.\"",
      "The Guardian newspaper in 2009 said the band \"introduced working-class anger, stoner sludge grooves and witchy horror-rock to flower power. Black Sabbath confronted the empty platitudes of the 1960s and, along with Altamont and Charles Manson, almost certainly helped kill off the hippy counterculture.\"",
      "After Sabbath, Osbourne had an uncanny knack for calling some of the most creative young guitarists to his side. When he went solo, he hired the brilliant innovator Rhoads, who played on two of Osbourne's finest solo albums, \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and \"Diary of a Madman.\" Rhoads was killed in a freak plane accident in 1982; Osbourne released the live album \"Tribute\" in 1987 in his memory.",
      "Osbourne then signed Jake E. Lee, who lent his talents to the platinum albums \"Bark at the Moon\" and \"The Ultimate Sin.\" Hotshot Zakk Wylde joined Osbourne's band for \"No Rest for the Wicked\" and the multiplatinum \"No More Tears.\"",
      "\"They come along, they sprout wings, they blossom, and they fly off,\" Osbourne said of his players in 1995 to The Associated Press. \"But I have to move on. To get a new player now and again boosts me on.\"",
      "Music world reacts to Osbourne's death",
      "Several musicians and celebrities, including Osbourne's Black Sabbath bandmates, took to social media to respond Tuesday to the news of his death.",
      "\"I just can't believe it! My dear dear friend Ozzy has passed away only weeks after our show at Villa Park,\" Black Sabbath guitarist and band co-founder Tony Iommi\u00a0wrote on X, referring to the farewell show earlier this month. \"It's just such heartbreaking news that I can't really find the words, there won't ever be another like him. Geezer, Bill and myself have lost our brother. My thoughts go out to Sharon and all the Osbourne family. Rest in peace Oz.\"",
      "Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler wrote on X: \"Goodbye dear friend - thanks for all those years - we had some great fun. 4 kids from Aston- who'd have thought, eh? So glad we got to do it one last time, back in Aston. Love you.\"",
      "On Instagram, Elton John described Osbourne as a \"dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods \u2014 a true legend. He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met. I will miss him dearly. To Sharon and the family, I send my condolences and love.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, who took part in Osbourne's farewell concert, wrote on X that he was \"so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\"",
      "Kiss co-founder Gene Simmons called Osbourne a \"giant\" who was \"Admired and loved by millions of fans worldwide. Prayers and condolences go out to the Osborne family.\"",
      "Actor Jason Momoa, who hosted the farewell show, wrote on Instagram, \"Love you @ozzyosbourne All my aloha @sharonosbourne and ohana. So grateful. RIP.\"",
      "Mike McCready, lead guitarist and founding member of Pearl Jam, wrote on X that he discovered Black Sabbath's music in high school.",
      "\"'War Pigs' was terrifying and mesmerizing at the same time,\" McCready wrote. \"It was Ozzy's voice that took me away to a dark universe. A great escape. Then when The 'Blizzard of Ozz' record came out I was instantly a fan. Randy Rhoads was an influence on me to play lead guitar. Luckily I got to play on the song 'Immortal' on the last record. Thanks for the music, Ozzy it makes our journey in life better.\"",
      "Courting controversy \u2014 and wholesomeness",
      "Whomever he was playing with, Osbourne wasn't likely to back down from controversy. He had the last laugh when the TV evangelist the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart in 1986 lambasted various rock groups and rock magazines as \"the new pornography,\" prompting some retailers to pull Osbourne's album.",
      "When Swaggart later was caught with a sex worker in 1988, Osbourne put out the song \"Miracle Man\" about his foe: \"Miracle man got busted/miracle man got busted,\" he sang. \"Today I saw a Miracle Man, on TV cryin'/Such a hypocritical man, born again, dying.\"",
      "Much later, a whole new Osbourne would be revealed when \"The Osbournes,\" which ran on MTV from 2002-2005, showed this one-time self-proclaimed madman drinking Diet Cokes as he struggled to find the History Channel on his new satellite television or warning his kids not to smoke or drink before they embarked on a night on the town.",
      "Later, he and his son Jack toured America on the travel show \"Ozzy & Jack's World Detour,\" where the pair visited such places as Mount Rushmore and the Space Center Houston. Osbourne was honored in 2014 with the naming of a bat frog found in the Amazon that makes high-pitched, batlike calls. It was dubbed Dendropsophus ozzyi.",
      "He also met Queen Elizabeth II during her Golden Jubilee weekend. He was standing next to singer-actor Cliff Richard. \"She took one look at the two of us, said 'Oh, so this is what they call variety, is it?' then cracked up laughing. I honestly thought that Sharon had slipped some acid into my cornflakes that morning,\" he wrote in \"I Am Ozzy.\"",
      "Thelma Riley and Osbourne married in 1971; Osbourne adopted her son Elliot Kingsley, and they had two more children, Jessica and Louis. Osbourne later met Sharon, who became her own celebrity persona, when she was running her father's Los Angeles office. Her father was Don Arden, a top concert promoter and artist manager. She went to Osbourne's hotel in Los Angeles to collect money, which Osbourne had spent on drugs.",
      "\"She says she'll come back in three days and I'd better have it. I'd always fancied her and I thought, 'Ah, she's coming back! Maybe I have a chance.' I had pizza hanging from my hair, cigarette ashes on my shirt,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2000. They married in 1982, had three children \u2014 Kelly, Aimee and Jack \u2014 and endured periodic separations and reconciliations.",
      "He is survived by Sharon, and his children.",

      "Warner drowned Sunday afternoon in Cocles de Lim\u00f3n, on Costa Rica's Caribbean coast, the country's Judicial Investigation Department said. He appeared to have been pulled out to sea by a current.",
      "Warner was assisted by people who were at the beach, but he was declared dead by the staff of the Costa Rican Red Cross, the department said. An autopsy determined his cause of death to be asphyxiation by submersion.",
      "In a statement Monday, the Costa Rican Red Cross said it was alerted to a water accident on Sunday at 2:10 p.m. local time, and it dispatched three ambulances.",
      "The Red Cross said two adult men were treated on-site and one was transferred to a local clinic in critical condition. They tried to resuscitate Warner, but he didn't show vital signs and was declared dead. Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Department said the other person involved in the incident had \"entered the sea to try to help Mr. Warner.\"",
      "Warner starred as Theo Huxtable on \"The Cosby Show\" from 1984 to 1992. His performance earned him an Emmy nomination for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series in 1986.",
      "In 2023, Warner told CBS Pittsburgh that being part of \"The Cosby Show\" was an \"awesome\" experience.",
      "\"That show had such an impact on the culture here in America but also a global impact on how Black people saw ourselves globally and how the rest of the world saw us,\" he said. \"So I'm proud to have been part of that legacy and it's been a great ride ever since.\"",
      "Warner said in a 2015 interview with The Associated Press that he was saddened that the show's legacy was \"tarnished\" by \"Cosby Show\" patriarch Bill Cosby, who was\u00a0accused of sexual assault by multiple women. Cosby's\u00a0conviction in a Pennsylvania case\u00a0was later overturned.",
      "Warner went on to star in other TV shows, including \"Malcolm & Eddie\" (1996-2000), \"Reed Between the Lines\" (2011-2015) and \"The Resident\" (2018-2023). He also voiced The Producer on \"The Magic School Bus\" (1994-1997). He made his feature film debut in \"Drop Zone\" in 1994.",
      "Warner also directed episodes of several TV shows, including \"The Cosby Show,\" \"All That,\" \"Keenan & Kel\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" according to his biography on his website.",
      "Most recently, he appeared in a few episodes of \"Alert: Missing Persons Unit\" and was hosting the podcast \"Not All Hood,\" looking at the different experiences of Black Americans.",
      "Warner was also a poet and a musician. He won a Grammy for best traditional R&B performance in 2015 for his part in a cover of Stevie Wonder's \"Jesus Children of America,\" and was nominated for another Grammy for best spoken word poetry.",
      "Fellow poet and author Kevin Powell, who was a friend of Warner's, described him as a devoted husband and father who was humble, kind and supportive of other people.",
      "\"You would have never known he was a major child star,\" Powell said in an interview Monday with CBS News. \"He was never someone who was into the celebrity of it. He knew what he was. He knew, you know, that he was America's son. He literally was America's son as the only male child on that historic show, 'The Cosby Show.'\"",
      "Powell said he was struck by the emotional reactions from fans on social media. \"It's someone you came of age with,\" he said of Warner.",
      "Powell recalled publishing a poem Warner wrote in a special issue of the magazine \"African Voices\" for the 50th anniversary of hip-hop in 2023.",
      "Warner was a lifelong hip-hop fan, Powell said, but he also was \"concerned about a lot of the images that were being put out there.\"",
      "\"So that became kind of his thing in the last few years, like how are we representing ourselves as a community, as a people, with the art that we're creating?\" he said. \"That sticks with me because he was someone who understood he had a huge platform. He had a famous name and people would pay attention if he said certain things. ... That's who Malcolm-Jamal was.\"",
      "The news of Warner's death was \"devastating,\" a spokesperson for Bill Cosby said. The spokesperson, Andrew Wyatt, said Cosby compared it to learning of the death of his son Ennis, who was shot and killed in a robbery in 1997. \"It felt the same way,\" Wyatt said.",
      "Cosby shared a memory of Warner with CBS News' Jericka Duncan on Monday, saying, \"He was never afraid to go to his room and study and make sure he followed whatever he had learned in the acting school he went to.\"",

      "\"Pepsi Prebiotic Cola represents the next leap forward in giving consumers choice, optionality and functional ingredients in their cola experience, without sacrificing the iconic Pepsi taste we're known for delivering,\" Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages U.S., said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The new cola will be available for purchase online this fall and in stores next year, Pepsi said.",
      "The product announcement comes only months after Pepsi\u00a0acquired Poppi, which is marketed as a healthier alternative for soda lovers, for nearly $2 billion. The low-calorie soda contains a mix of prebiotics, fruit juice and apple cider.",
      "The prebiotic and probiotic food and drink sector has grown quickly in recent years as consumers increasingly seek out gut-healthy alternatives to soda that contain less sugar.\u00a0According\u00a0to consulting firm Future Market Insights, the prebiotic soda market was valued at $262 million in 2024. Global sales are expected to grow 7.6% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"Consumer demand is certainly moving healthier,\" said Christopher Palmedo, an associate professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy. \"Decades ago, gargantuan Big Gulps were the rage. Now it's probiotic Pepsi.\"",
      "\"From a public health perspective, that's a good trend,\" Palmedo said, while noting that most beverages in the market, including probiotic drinks like Pepsi's are \"ultra-processed\" making their health claims questionable.",

    "summary": "President Trump is visiting the Federal Reserve's headquarters in Washington, keeping up the intense pressure he's been putting on Fed chair Jerome Powell because the Fed hasn't lowered interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is visiting the Federal Reserve headquarters in Washington on Thursday, a week after indicating that Fed chair Jerome Powell's handling of an extensive renovation project on two Fed buildings could be grounds for firing.",
      "Mr. Trump and Powell appeared side by side on the construction site Thursday, with the two men disagreeing over the cost and scope of the project.",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Powell for months because the Fed has kept the short-term interest rate the Fed controls at 4.3% this year after cutting it three times last year. Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Mr.\u00a0Trump's sweeping tariffs, which Powell says could push up inflation.",
      "Powell's caution has infuriated the president, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt.",
      "The Fed has been renovating its Washington headquarters and a neighboring building. With some of the construction occurring underground and as building materials have soared in price after inflation spiked in 2021 and 2022, the estimated cost has ballooned to about $2.5 billion from $1.9 billion.",
      "When asked last week if the costly rebuilding could be grounds to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"I think it is.\"",
      "\"When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it's really disgraceful,\" the president said.",
      "Firing Powell would threaten the Fed's independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors, and would almost certainly rattle financial markets.",
      "Mr. Trump has at various times referred to his handpicked Fed chair as a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule.\"",
      "The president asked a group of House Republicans in an Oval Office meeting\u00a0last week\u00a0if he should fire Powell, sources told CBS News. Mr. Trump told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he would, though he\u00a0confirmed\u00a0he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Renovations have been underway for years",
      "Plans for the renovation were first approved by the Fed's governing board in 2017. The project then went through several local commissions for approval, at least one of which, the Commission for Fine Arts, included several Trump appointees. The commission\u00a0pushed for more marble\u00a0in the second of the two buildings the Fed is renovating, known as 1951 Constitution Avenue, specifically in a mostly glass extension that some of Trump's appointees derided as a \"glass box.\"",
      "The National Planning Commission, another local body, pushed the Fed to add marble to a rooftop addition.",
      "Fed staff also said tariffs and inflationary increases in building material costs also drove up costs. Mr. Trump in 2018 imposed a 25% duty on steel and 10% on aluminum. Steel prices are up about 60% since the plans were approved in June, while construction materials costs overall are up about 50%, according to government data.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 14:06:47 -0400",
    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, as employers seek out AI-capable workers to assist them in AI adoption and development.",
      "In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found. For its report, Brookings analyzed data from Lightcast, a labor market analytics company. AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 outstripping the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, the report showed.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies are starting to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing of goods or services has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% by mid-2025, according to the report, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Still, while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s, according to its AI Adoption Tracker.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What sort of AI jobs exist?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, the global head of research at Lightcast. In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, according to the Brookings report, up from 3,780 in 2010.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the use of AI by more businesses is spurring demand for consulting jobs, which are intended to help businesses integrate AI into their workflow. Job postings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay on average 28%, or $18,000, more per year than job postings for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are these jobs growing the most?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in the tech hubs like Silicon Valley. The renown San Francisco area accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings, while Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "That being said, AI jobs are starting to diffuse into other parts of the country including the Sunbelt, a wide swath of land that stretches from the Southeast and Southwest, and along the east coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, Muro added, given their role in developing talent bases and training students in computer science.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data. As for the people landing these jobs, they tend work for tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Apple and Google as well as AI companies such as OpenAI, according to Magrini.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by firms to increase more rapidly in the coming years, as the practical use of the technology becomes more obvious to businesses.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration told CBS MoneyWatch it would continue issuing paper checks for beneficiaries, including recipients of retirement and disability benefits, who have no other means of getting\u00a0payments. But the program will also emphasize the advantages of electronic transfers to its roughly 70 million beneficiaries in an effort to encourage check recipients to switch, a Social Security spokesperson added.",
      "The about-face comes after the agency\u00a0said\u00a0on July 14 that it would phase out paper checks beginning in October, citing the advantages of electronic deposits including faster payment processing and enhanced security. Eliminating paper also saves the federal government money, with checks costing 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer, the agency said at the time.",
      "The reversal of the policy to eliminate paper checks comes after Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, met with Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano on Wednesday morning and asked about the plan to discontinue paper checks, along with other changes at the agency.",
      "\"There are about 600,000 Americans who still receive their paper checks \u2014 it's a small fraction of people who receive Social Security payments, but it's a population that often needs checks through paper\" versus electronic deposit, Warren said in a press call to discuss her meeting with Bisignano.",
      "She added that Bisignano \"made a commitment that no one will be left behind and that people who have access to paper checks will get access to paper checks.\"",
      "Millions of people in the U.S. are \"unbanked,\" meaning they lack traditional bank accounts, often because they believe they don't earn enough to qualify for an account or are worried about costs or other issues, according to Bankrate. Typically, these people rely on check-cashing services or other non-bank financial companies, such as PayPal or Venmo, rather than banks.",
      "About one out of every five households headed by someone over the age of 65 is unbanked or underbanked, according to the AARP. People who are underbanked may have a bank account but still primarily rely on alternative banking services, like check cashing establishments, to handle their money.",
      "Focus on customer service",
      "Warren also said she addressed other issues with Bisignano, including concerns that a major workforce reduction at the Social Security Administration this year could affect customer service.",
      "The senator said Bisignano agreed to her request that the agency's inspector general conduct an independent audit to assess the state of customer service at SSA, such as call wait times and how many Social Security recipients are able to reach a human employee when they call for help.",
      "\"More accurate data is absolutely essential to oversight, to holding the Social Security Administration accountable to the job they are required to do,\" Warren said.",
      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration said\u00a0customer service is improving, noting that the agency has reduced its phone response time to an average of 18 minutes in 2025, down from 30 minutes in 2024.",
      "\"Commissioner Bisignano had a productive meeting with Senator Warren where he presented improved customer service metrics that are currently being realized on the phone, in field offices and online,\" a Social Security Administration spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Senator Warren reacted positively to many of the indicators, specifically lower phone and field office wait times, the reduction of the disability claims backlog by 25% and the speed at which the SSFA payments were completed \u2014 give months ahead of schedule.\"",

It's expected to include a mix of both personal time, and political business. As was the case during his last visit as president in 2018, he is likely to be greeted by protests everywhere he goes in his mother's native land.",
      "The plan is for Mr. Trump to pay visits to his two luxury golf resorts in Scotland, Trump International on the east coast of Aberdeenshire, which he bought in 2012, and Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire, about 200 miles away on the west coast, which he purchased in 2014.",

Some Scots believe the American real estate mogul-turned-president has been good for the country, bringing in investment and with it, some employment, but others criticize the polices he has adopted during his second term.",
      "In advance of Mr. Trump's arrival, the Stop Trump Scotland protest group has been\u00a0 organizing demonstrations at Aberdeen and outside the U.S. consulate in Scotland's capital, Edinburgh \u2014 part of a so-called \"Festival of Resistance\" that aims to mix city-based actions with countryside activism around Mr. Trump's golf resorts.",

But with that in mind, we've got a really experienced team of officers working as part of planning the operation.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's 2018 trip to Scotland, CBS News' partner network BBC News says there were more than 5,000 police officers deployed, with the U.K. Treasury chipping in about \u00a35 million ($6.8 million) to help cover the costs to the Scottish police force.",
      "Trump's visit is private, but with some politics",
      "While he made his preference for Mr. Trump's opponent clear before the last U.S. election, the head of Scotland's government said it was his duty to meet with the U.S. president during his upcoming visit.",
      "\"I've taken a decision that's in Scotland's interest to meet with the president of the United States so that I can use every opportunity to protect and to promote the interests of the people of Scotland,\" Swinney told Britain's PA news agency. \"There's obviously a range of issues that we can cover around the international situation that's causing such anxiety to people in Scotland, around the situation the Middle East, and the situation in Ukraine, and the domestic issues that are important to us around about the implications of, for example, trade and tariffs on some of our key sectors, including Scotch whisky.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",
      "President Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imported British steel. Starmer hopes to get that rate lowered, to zero if possible, to shore up the U.K.'s steel industry, which has seen its output plummet by around 80% since the 1960's.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that the two leaders would meet \"to refine the historic U.S.-U.K. trade deal\" brokered in May.",

    "summary": "This week's U.S. trade agreement with Japan could provide a framework for a pact with the European Union, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and the European Union are racing to clinch a trade deal\u00a0by the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, with economists warning that a sharp hike in tariffs could raise costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "As the clock ticks down, a series of pacts with other U.S. trading partners in recent days have raised hopes of avoiding a potentially damaging trade war with Europe, with experts saying a\u00a0deal with Japan announced on Tuesday could serve as a template for a deal with the EU.",
      "The U.S. has also recently announced the outlines of trade deals with China, Indonesia, the Philippines and U.K., though with many details still remaining to be finalized.",
      "For consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, much is riding on the outcome of the trade talks. Absent a deal, President Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tax. In preparing possible countermeasures, the European Commission has said it would impose tariffs on more than $100 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Aug. 7, AFP reported on Wednesday.",
      "Negotiations are ongoing and a U.S.-EU trade war could yet be avoided. Citing EU diplomats, AFP also said officials with the trading block could be open to a 15% U.S. tariff rate, with potential carveouts for key sectors, according to the wire service.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the status of talks with the EU, including whether the Trump administration expects to reach a trade deal by the Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday struck a trade deal with Tokyo that calls for a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, the deal calls for Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including cars and certain farm products.",
      "The 15% tariff rate on Japanese goods is five percentage points higher than a baseline tariff the Trump administration imposed on all foreign imports on April 2. But it is lower than the 25% he threatened against Japan earlier this month and the 24% duties his administration\u00a0proposed\u00a0in early April.",
      "\"The Japan deal solidifies this pattern we've seen thus far, which is some market access relief, a commitment to purchase U.S. goods, and a slightly lower, but above the universal baseline, tariff level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a public policy research firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The Japan deal certainly provides a framework of what [Mr. Trump] looking for,\" Jacquez said. \"It's about accepting a baseline tariff at or above 10%, and then making purchase commitments.\"",
      "Key catalysts for trade deals",
      "A key element of Mr. Trump's trade deals has been a commitment by other nations to invest in the U.S. The president has defended tariffs as a way to revive the country's domestic manufacturing base and make American exports more competitive, as well as to generate additional federal revenue.",
      "\"We are learning that the promise of greater investment into the U.S. works well with the administration,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said. \"The promise to invest $550 billion was a big part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal. It was a key catalyst to securing a deal.\"",
      "The EU, whose member states have a combined gross domestic product of $20 trillion, could likely commit to a large investment in the U.S. because it could span a number of years and focus on key sectors, such as technology, energy or artificial intelligence, Daco added.",
      "Additional commitments by the EU to purchase American-made goods and to lower trade barriers to U.S. exports could also help close a deal, he said. \"Those don't cost much, and they're an easy bargaining chip to put forward.\"",
      "Risk of higher prices",
      "Although a 15% baseline U.S. tariff on EU imports would represent a retrenchment from Mr. Trump's earlier threats, it would still drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, according to Daco.",
      "\"While it may seem like a great deal, it's still much higher than the tariffs that the U.S. was imposing at the end of 2024,\" he noted. \"So there would still be a positive inflation shock because of higher tariffs. There would also be demand erosion coming from reduced business investment, hiring,and reduced consumer spending as a result of these higher tariffs.\"",
      "Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports is around 15%, according to his analysis. If Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs go into effect, that rate would rise to more than 20%. If the EU agrees to a 15% tariff rate, however, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports from around the world would drop to 19.5%.",
      "\"That's still a significant increase in the average rate,\" Daco said. \"It's a lot higher than the 2.5% where we started the year.\"",
      "Because most U.S. imports from the EU include industrial inputs like components, raw materials and machinery, any added costs would take tie to work their way through the supply chain, according to Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"It would \u00a0affect manufacturing exports faster than it would affect American consumers, but it would raise prices all around,\" Young said.",

      "She issued a statement under the headline: \"Make Agriculture Great Again Trade Wins.\"",
      "\"American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world. It's absurd that non-scientific trade barriers prevented our beef from being sold to consumers in Australia for the last 20 years,\" Rollins said. \"Gone are the days of putting American farmers on the sidelines.

They won't take any of our beef. They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers and, you know, I don't blame them, but we're doing the same thing right now.\"",

      "\"I want to see the science and it should be predicated on science. I'm suspicious of the speed at which this has been done,\" Littleproud told reporters.",
      "\"We need to give confidence to the industry, but also to you (the public): this is not just about animal welfare, this is about human welfare, this is about BSE potentially coming into this country and having a human impact, so I think it's important the government's very transparent about the science and I don't think it's even beyond the question to have an independent panel review that science to give confidence to everybody,\" he added.",
      "Around 70% of Australian beef is exported. Producers fear that export market would vanish overnight if diseases including mad cow or foot-and-mouth disease infected Australian cattle.",
      "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been only six BSE cases in U.S. cattle since the major international outbreak of the disease \u2014 which was centered in the U.K. and other European nations \u2014 in the late 1980s and early 1990s. One of those cows was imported from Canada and believed to have been infected there, and the other five, \"were diagnosed with atypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by contaminated feed,\" the CDC says.",
      "Will Evans, chief executive of Cattle Australia who represents more than 52,000 grass-fed beef producers across the nation, said he was confident the agriculture department had taken a cautious approach toward U.S. imports.",
      "\"The department's undertaken a technical scientific assessment and we have to put faith in them. They've made this assessment themselves. They've said: 'We've looked at this, we've looked at the best science, this is a decision that we feel comfortable with,'\" Evans said.",

      "Will Australians buy more U.S. beef?",
      "Evans, of Cattle Australia, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he wasn't worried about the new government policy flooding Australia's domestic market with American beef. He said the U.S. domestic market currently relieds on imports of Australian beef, which he said was about 50 cents cheaper than U.S. beef per pound.",
      "\"The likelihood of them (U.S.) turning around and looking to Australia as a really high value market [to export to] is very low,\" he said. \"If I was an exporter of U.S. beef, I would be looking at Japan, Korea and China as being really viable and valuable markets. I don't really think Australia rates highly on that list.\"",
      "Simon Quilty, an analyst with Global Agri Trends, agreed that it was unlikely Australian consumers would soon see U.S. beef in on their grocery stores shelves.",
      "\"Honestly, if there is a pound of U.S. beef shipped to Australia in the next three years, I will be gobsmacked,\" he told ABC.",
      "Beef prices have been rising in the U.S. for years, due to factors including prolonged drought and shrinking domestic herd numbers. The average price of a pound of ground beef in the U.S. rose to $6.12 in June, up nearly 12% from a year ago, according to U.S. government data. The average price of all uncooked beef steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound.",

This is something Sacks, a former PayPal executive, has highlighted after a 2024 incident in which Google's AI image generator created pictures of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show one of the countries Founding Fathers.",
      "\"We believe that AI systems should be free of ideological bias and not be designed to pursue socially engineered agendas,\" Sacks said on Wednesday. \"And so we have a number of proposals there on how to make sure that AI remains truth-seeking and trustworthy.\"",
      "To that end, Kratsios said the plan will update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with AI developers whose systems \"allow free speech expression to flourish.\"",
      "The plan also seeks to maintain the U.S.' edge in the global race for AI dominance as it competes with countries like China, which has moved quickly to expand its AI capabilities. A senior White House official said the report supports export controls to make sure \"that our most advanced technology doesn't get into the hands of [other] countries.\"",
      "As part of its efforts, the White House also seeks to remove what it refers to as \u00a0\"onerous regulation\" that the Trump administration says is hindering AI innovation. The official added that the plan calls for the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion and climate funding requirements from the Biden administration's CHIPS Act.",

    "story": [
      "The fallout from Elon Musk's plunge into politics a year ago is still hammering electric vehicle-maker Tesla, as both sales and profits dropped sharply again in the latest quarter.",
      "Tesla revenue dropped 12%, and profits slumped 16% in the three months through June as buyers continued to steer clear, and in some cases, turn to more affordable competitors' offerings.",
      "\"The perception of Elon Musk, its chief executive, has rubbed the sheen right out of what once was a darling and soaring automotive brand,\" Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said in a research note, in which he called Tesla \"a toxic brand that is inseparable from its leader.\"",
      "Quarterly profits at the electric vehicle, battery and robotics company fell to $1.17 billion, or $0.33 a share, from $1.4 billion, or $0.40 a share, dropping for a third straight quarter. On an adjusted basis, the company said it earned $0.40, in line with Wall Street analysts' estimates.",
      "Revenue fell from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion in the April through June period, slightly beating Wall Street's forecast.",
      "Tesla shares were little changed in after-hours trading as investors awaited Musk's comments on the company's earnings call.",
      "Betting on robotaxis",
      "Musk, who helped elect President Donald Trump with a massive campaign donation and then headed his DOGE cost-cutting program, has pinned the future of the company squarely on its autonomous Robotaxi venture, which launched in Austin, Texas last month. It's expected to take years, though, before Musk's focus on robotaxis and humanoid robots turns a profit or the company.",
      "\"We are at a 'positive crossroads' in the Tesla story: Musk is laser focused as CEO, Robotaxi/autonomous expansion has begun, demand stabilization has begun especially in China, and Tesla is about to embark on an aggressive AI focused strategy that we believe will include owning a significant piece of xAI,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note. \"While near-term and this quarter the numbers are nothing to write home about, we believe investors are instead focused on the AI future at Tesla with a motivated Musk back driving Tesla's future.\"",
      "Foreign EV buyers have also turned away from Tesla toward competitors' vehicles, research shows. Musk alienated potential Tesla customers in Great Britain, France, Germany and elsewhere through his political activities. Rival electric vehicle makers such as China's BYD and German's Volkswagen, meanwhile, have gained market share.",
      "Tesla faces other headwinds, too. The new federal budget just passed by Congress eliminates a $7,500 credit for EV buyers. It also wipes out penalties for car makers that exceed carbon emission standards. That threatens Tesla's business of selling its \"carbon credits\" to traditional car companies that regularly fall short of emission standards.",
      "Tesla generated $439 million from credit sales, down sharply from $890 million a year ago.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 14:48:17 -0400",
    "summary": "The Education Department has temporarily paused loan forgiveness for an income-based repayment plan. Here are the details.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who are enrolled in a popular repayment plan are now in limbo, with the Department of Education saying it has temporarily paused forgiveness for borrowers in its income-based repayment plan, or IBR.",
      "Such plans offer a double benefit for borrowers by lowering a person's monthly loan repayment to reflect their income, while also promising to provide forgiveness after a number of years. Specifically, the government can cancel the balance of student loan after people have made payments for at least 20 years.",
      "About 40% of the roughly 33 million people repaying student loans were enrolled in one of the Education Department's four such repayment plans at the end of 2024, according to data from the National Student Loan Data System and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "But three of those programs had previously been halted by a court ruling, while forgiveness for the roughly 2 million people enrolled in the fourth \u2014 IBR \u2014 is now also paused.",
      "On Tuesday, Education Department deputy press secretary Ellen Keast told CBS MoneyWatch that the agency \"has temporarily paused discharges for IBR borrowers in order to comply with ongoing court injunctions regarding the Biden Administration's illegal attempts at student loan forgiveness.\"",
      "The court injunctions stem from 2024\u00a0lawsuits related to the Biden administration's flagship student loan repayment plan, called the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. That initiative, created to fix long-standing issues with the Education Department's previous income-based plans, proved popular with borrowers, with almost 8 million enrollees at the end of 2024, National Student Loan Data System data shows.",
      "Because the SAVE plan could count toward loan discharges in the IBR program, the Education Department is now temporarily halting forgiveness for enrollees in that plan. The Education Department said the loan discharges will resume at some point, but didn't provide a timeframe for when that might occur.",
      "What income-driven repayment plans are legally blocked?",
      "Student loan forgiveness under three of the federal government's income-driven plans \u2014 SAVE; Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR); and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) \u2014 is currently paused after a court ruled last summer that Congress exceeded its authority in approving those plans.",
      "The legal action last year called into question whether student loan forgiveness was authorized under the federal statute that governs those plans. But the IBR plan was created under a different authority.",
      "When will the Education Department start forgiving loans again?",
      "The Education Department didn't specify a timeframe in its statement to CBS MoneyWatch. It noted that the SAVE plan allowed forbearances \u2014 when loan payments are temporarily halted or reduced \u2014 to be counted toward loan forgiveness, but that the rule was halted by the court ruling.",
      "Because of the injunction, the Education Department said it needs to recalculate how many payments made by borrowers should contribute toward repayment.",
      "\"Legal IBR discharges will resume as soon as the Department is able to establish the correct payment count,\" said Keast of the Education Department.",
      "Should a borrower continue making IBR payments for now?",
      "Yes. Borrowers in the federal IBR plan are eligible to have their student loans canceled after making payments for at least 20 years. However, some people eligible for such forgiveness have yet to see their loans canceled. They should continue making those payments, and the Education Department will eventually refund them, according to the agency.",
      "\"For any borrower that makes a payment after the date of borrower eligibility, the Department will refund overpayments when the discharges resume,\" Keast said.",
      "Borrowers can also request forbearance from their loan servicer. In that case, interest would continue to accrue on any remaining balance.",

      "Price increases typically take around 90 days to take effect, although the timeframe varies by retailer, the spokesperson added.",
      "Global cocoa shortage",

      "The majority of the world's cocoa supply comes from Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which have faced heatwaves and heavy rain linked to climate change. These unfavorable weather conditions have led to diseases like Black pod rot, which kills cocoa crops. Chronic underinvestment in cocoa farms is another reason behind the spike in cocoa prices,\u00a0according to an article from J.P. Morgan Global Research.",
      "\"Cocoa is a market where the grower produces a very high-value good but receives a very low share of the actual value chain.

The threats came near the end of a 90-day pause on most of the sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs Mr. Trump unveiled against dozens of countries on \"Liberation Day\" in April.",
      "The Trump administration has hoped the letters will lead to a blitz of trade deals in the coming weeks, before the higher tariff rates kick in at the start of August. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted Sunday\u00a0that the next two weeks will be \"for the record books.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump said he's \"thinking about\" eliminating capital gains tax on home sales. Here's what that would mean for the housing market.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday floated the possibility of eliminating the federal capital gains tax on home sales, in a move that would change the way real estate profits are taxed for the first time in 30 years.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested he is weighing supporting\u00a0legislation\u00a0introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia that would nix the existing capital gains tax on home sales. Greene called the tax \"an outdated, unfair burden\u2014especially in today's housing market, where values have skyrocketed.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about that,\" Mr. Trump responded to a reporter, when asked how important it is that the capital gains tax be eliminated in order to \"unleash\" the housing market. \"It would also unleash it just by lowering the interest rates,\" the president said, adding, \"If the fed would lower the rates we wouldn't even have to do that. But we are thinking about no tax on capital gains on houses.\"",
      "Currently, single-tax filers can exclude up to $250,000 in capital gains from sales of their primary homes from their taxable incomes under what's called the Section 121\u00a0exclusion. That amount rises to $500,000 for joint filers. Both amounts have remained fixed since 1997.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said it had nothing additional to add to Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "\"Homeowners who have lived in their homes for decades, especially seniors in places where values have surged, shouldn't be forced to stay put because of an IRS penalty,\" Greene said in a statement announcing the proposed No Tax on Home Sales Act. \"My bill unlocks that equity, helps fix the housing shortage, and supports long-term financial security for American families.\"",
      "According to Research from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the current federal policy on the capital gains tax on home sales is \"quietly distorting the housing market\" by \"locking in older homeowners, and strangling inventory just when America needs it most.\"",
      "\"Stay-put penalty\"",
      "A NAR study found that 34% of homeowners, or 29 million Americans, would exceed the $250,000 threshold were they to sell their homes, while 10%, or eight million Americans, would surpass the $500,000 threshold for joint filers.",
      "As a result, older homeowners are disincentivized to sell their homes, in what NAR researchers refer to as a \"stay-put penalty.\" For example, seniors who might otherwise consider moving closer to family, or downsizing, are staying in place \u2014 and keeping housing inventory tied up.",
      "\"This stagnation in housing turnover is rippling through the entire market, driving up costs and limiting opportunity \u2014 exactly the opposite of what public policy should be encouraging,\" Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer,\u00a0 said in a statement. \"And it grows worse each month.\"",
      "Critics say eliminating the tax would only benefit wealthy Americans who can afford to pay tax on gains from home sales that exceed the limit.",
      "Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS MoneyWatch that a lot of home sellers already benefit from the $250,000 exclusion limit, and that eliminating the capital gains tax altogether would primarily benefit wealthier Americans who own residences that have appreciated by more than $250,000, or $500,000 in the case of joint filers.",
      "\"It wouldn't really move the needle for a regular family, unless you have a home that's appreciated a lot,\" Berner told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If your home has appreciated by more than $1 million, there would be a benefit to removing the capital gains tax.\"",
      "Inventory release",
      "He also suspects abolishing the capital gains tax on home sales would release inventory onto the housing market.",
      "\"It could be a good thing for the market. In particular where inventory is constrained, it could benefit regular folks,\" Berner said.",
      "By contrast, eliminating the federal tax would also erase revenue paid to the government, and could spark increased interest from investors and speculators, which could also drive up home values. That would contribute to the nation's housing affordability problem, according to Berner.",
      "Nearly 27% of all homes sold in the first three months of the year were bought by investors \u2014 the highest share in at least five years, according to a report by real estate data provider BatchData.",

      "Coca-Cola said on Tuesday it plans to launch a beverage for the U.S. market that use cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup.",
      "The announcement, which came as the company reported second-quarter earnings, follows a social media post by President Trump last week claiming that he had persuaded\u00a0Coca-Cola to use real cane sugar in its U.S. cola.",

      "Coca-Cola already makes soda with cane sugar in Mexico, where it's sold in glass bottles. Coke's U.S. cola formula uses high-fructose corn syrup,\u00a0according\u00a0to Coca-Cola's website. The Mexican version is typically pricier when it's imported and sold in the U.S.",
      "Cane sugar is nearly 100% sucrose, which consists of roughly 50% glucose and 50% fructose. By contrast, the most common form of high-fructose corn syrup contains 55% fructose and 45% glucose. Fructose is handled differently in the body than other sugars, and some experts warn that it contribute to a range of health issues.",

      "\"Pepsi Prebiotic Cola represents the next leap forward in giving consumers choice, optionality and functional ingredients in their cola experience, without sacrificing the iconic Pepsi taste we're known for delivering,\" Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages U.S., said in a\u00a0statement.",

      "The product announcement comes only months after Pepsi\u00a0acquired Poppi, which is marketed as a healthier alternative for soda lovers, for nearly $2 billion. The low-calorie soda contains a mix of prebiotics, fruit juice and apple cider.",
      "The prebiotic and probiotic food and drink sector has grown quickly in recent years as consumers increasingly seek out gut-healthy alternatives to soda that contain less sugar.\u00a0According\u00a0to consulting firm Future Market Insights, the prebiotic soda market was valued at $262 million in 2024. Global sales are expected to grow 7.6% over the next 10 years.",

    "story": [
      "The official start of fall is still months away, but the season is just around the corner for Starbucks fans.",
      "The coffee chain's popular Pumpkin Spice Latte is set to return on Aug. 26, Starbucks announced Monday. Although that's a later release date than last year, the 2025 return of the PSL is still on the earlier side for the company, which traditionally had waited until September to bring back the seasonal drink, closer to the actual start of autumn, which falls on Sept. 22 this year.",
      "The popular menu item consists of espresso, milk, Pumpkin Spice Syrup and whipped cream, with pumpkin pie spice sprinkled on top. The coffee chain started adding real pumpkin to the drink in 2015.",
      "The return of the Pumpkin Spice Latte as well as Starbucks' new fall menu comes at a critical juncture for Starbucks, which is pulling all of the levers it can to lure customers back into its stores. After enjoying years of strong growth, the company's progress has stalled, with U.S. same-store sales slipping 2% last year.",
      "The return of the Pumpkin Spice Latte as well as new menu items are \"cultural touchstones that spark connection, nostalgia and excitement,\" said Starbucks global chief brand officer Tressie Leiberman in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The perennial debut of the Pumpkin Spice Latte may not be enough on its own to turn around the fate of Starbucks. But if past years are any indication, it's sure to be a crowd pleaser and revenue booster.",

      "Starbucks said several other fall-inspired drinks will be returning to its menu, including the Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew, Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai and the Pecan Crunch Oatmilk Latte.",
      "The chain is also adding a new fall drink, called the Pecan Oatmilk Cortado, with Leiberman describing it as combining \"fall flavors with our bold espresso.\" Starbucks is also adding a fall menu item, Italian Sausage Egg Bites.",

      "The rise of PSL",
      "Starbucks introduced the drink in 2003 after a months-long brainstorming session to create the company's first fall beverage. Led by Peter Dukes, who is credited as the father of the drink, the group's goal was to match the success of the peppermint mocha.",
      "Little did they know it would become their most popular seasonal beverage of all time. Since debuting over 20 years ago, the Pumpkin Spice Latte, also known by its initials PSL, has skyrocketed in popularity, with hundreds of millions of beverages sold.",
      "\"Nobody knew at the beginning what it would grow to be,\" Dukes\u00a0said in a story posted on the Starbucks website for the beverage's 20-year anniversary. \"Twenty years later, it's taken on a life of its own.\"",
      "Starbucks initially considered naming the drink the fall harvest latte, but changed it to the Pumpkin Spice Latte \"because the spices play a really important role in bringing out the flavors of pumpkin,\" Dukes said in a Starbucks post.",
      "The Starbucks-induced pumpkin craze led Merriam-Webster to add the \"pumpkin spice\" to the dictionary in 2022. It also prompted other chains like Dunkin' and McDonald's to introduce their own pumpkin-inspired beverages in 2007 and 2013, respectively.",

    "story": [
      "Social Security is facing a growing number of challenges that threaten to undermine the retirement program's stability even as more retirees today say they urgently need the monthly payments compared with 20 years ago, according to a new AARP survey.",
      "About two-thirds of retirees said they substantially rely on Social Security for retirement income, or plan to do so, according to the survey, which polled more than 1,200 retirees as well as more than 2,000 younger Americans. When the advocacy group for older Americans asked the same question in 2005, about half of retirees indicated a heavy reliance on their monthly checks.",
      "The surge in retirees who largely rely on Social Security income to make ends meet comes as the program faces key challenges, from recent staffing cuts to a long-term financial crunch that could cause payments to be slashed starting in 2034.",
      "The AARP survey, conducted to mark the 90th anniversary of President Franklin D. Roosevelt signing the Social Security Act on August 14, 1935, underscores both the ever-growing importance of the program as well as its vulnerabilities.",
      "\"More than three-quarters of people in the U.S. \u2014 78% \u2014 are worried that Social Security won't provide enough to live on during retirement,\" AARP CEO Myechia Minter-Jordan said in a conference call to discuss the group's findings. \"That's an increase from five years ago, when 74%\" expressed concern.\"",
      "Confidence in the future of Social Security is also declining, with only 36% of Americans today saying they believe it will continue to pay out reliably and at the same level, a dip of seven percentage points from 2020, the study found. At the same time, 96% of Americans said they believed Social Security is important, with little difference between age groups or political party affiliations, AARP said.",
      "\"We're concerned that faith in the system ... is waning,\" Minter-Jordan added. \"We're concerned about their confidence that they will be able to receive benefits that they have paid into over time.\"",
      "Americans in their 30s are the most pessimistic about the future of Social Security, although confidence in the program's outlook tends to rise as people approach retirement age and get closer to claiming their benefits, the study found.",
      "\"Younger people have always underestimated how important Social Security will be to them in the future,\" Bill Sweeney, senior vice president of government affairs at AARP, said on the call.",
      "He added, \"Receiving Social Security changes how people view the program. They realize how important that inflation-adjusted treatment income is.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the survey's findings.",
      "Social Security filings at a record",
      "Meanwhile, Social Security Administration data shows that Americans are filing for benefits at a record rate in 2025. This comes as experts are pointing to rising concerns about the program's reliability and future solvency, given job cuts at the agency and other changes.",
      "Wealth inequality is also a growing issue among retirees, with some white-collar workers heading into their golden years with hefty retirement savings thanks to corporate 401(k) programs with company matches. But about half of all private-sector workers lack access to corporate retirement accounts, creating hurdles for saving for retirement, a recent Pew Charitable Trusts study found.",
      "Last year, a record 68 million retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers relied on Social Security, a 42% jump from two decades ago,\u00a0data shows. The number of Social Security beneficiaries is forecast to swell to 82 million by 2035, AARP said.",
      "Despite the retirement program's importance, many Americans lack a grasp of the basics of Social Security, the new AARP study also found. For instance, only 24% of those surveyed correctly identified 70 years old as the age at which individuals can maximize their Social Security benefits.",
      "And about one-third of respondents said the potential insolvency of the Social Security trust funds would lead to a complete cessation of benefits, which is false. If the trust funds aren't shored up and they run out of money, which is currently forecast to occur in 2034, monthly benefits would be reduced by about 20%.",

      "\"Assigned seating unlocks new opportunities for our Customers \u2014 including the ability to select Extra Legroom seats \u2014 and removes the uncertainty of not knowing where they will sit in the cabin,\" Tony Roach, executive vice president of customer & brand at Southwest Airlines, said in a statement.",

Epstein served 13 months in a jail work-release program after he was originally accused of sexually abusing dozens of girls and young women.",
      "Johnson argued the Massie-Khanna effort does not include enough protections for Epstein's victims. He said Congress has a moral and legal obligation \"to protect the people who have been the victims of these unspeakable crimes so that their names are not drug through the mud.\"",
      "On Wednesday, three Republicans on a House Oversight subcommittee voted with all Democrats on the panel to subpoena the Justice Department for the Epstein files. The White House has not responded to the latest congressional efforts, although Mr. Trump has referred to the whole saga as a \"hoax,\" as his administration faces criticism over the handling of the Epstein files.",
      "Epstein's financial network",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, has been looking into Epstein's financial network for three years and has called on the Trump administration to release the Treasury's records.",
      "Last year, the Biden administration allowed committee staff to look at portions of the confidential file. Wyden said it shows more than 4,700 in potentially suspicious wire transfers adding up to nearly $1.1 billion flowing in and out of just one of Epstein's bank accounts and hundreds of millions through other accounts.",
      "Wyden sent a letter this week to Attorney General Pam Bondi urging the Justice Department to further investigate Epstein's financial transactions and whether several big banks turned a blind eye to suspicious transfers. The senator's office said the attorney general has not yet responded. The Justice Department has not yet responded to a request for comment.",
      "\"The Treasury Department's Epstein file contains significant information on the sources of funding behind Epstein's sex trafficking activities,\" Wyden wrote. \"Epstein clearly had access to enormous financing to operate his sex trafficking network, and the details on how he got the cash to pay for it are sitting in a Treasury Department filing cabinet.\"",
      "Seeking testimony from Ghislaine Maxwell",
      "Lawmakers are also seeking testimony from Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence.",
      "The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Maxwell on Wednesday, requesting that she sit for a deposition in August \"to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",
      "Todd Blanche, the second-highest ranking official at the Justice Department, is meeting with Maxwell on Thursday at the U.S. attorney's office in Tallahassee.",
      "The Justice Department announced earlier this month that a review of evidence in the Epstein case found no indication of a \"client list\" and said no more files would be released, citing victims' privacy. The decision upset Trump supporters who believe that the federal government has concealed information about Epstein to protect powerful figures.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 14:54:43 -0400",
    "summary": "Democratic Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin will not seek a third term in 2026, creating the first open race for governor in the battleground state in 16 years.",
    "story": [
      "Wisconsin's Democratic governor, Tony Evers, announced Thursday that he will not seek a third term in 2026, creating the first open race for governor in the battleground state in 16 years.",
      "It will be Wisconsin's highest profile race next year, as Democrats also angle to take control of the Legislature thanks to redrawn election maps that are friendlier to the party. They are also targeting two congressional districts as Democrats nationwide try to retake the House.",
      "The Legislature has been under Republican control since 2011, and some Democrats had hoped that Evers, 73, would run for a third term to give him a chance to potentially work with a Democratic-controlled one.",
      "In a video announcing his decision, Evers said he was \"damn proud\" of working 50 years in public service. But he said it was time to focus on his family.",
      "\"For five decades, my family has sacrificed to give me the gift of service,\" Evers said. \"They're my world and I owe it to them to focus on doing all the things we enjoy and love doing together.\"",
      "Evers has drawn the ire of President Trump's administration, and his tenure has been marked by his often contentious relationship with the Legislature.",
      "Before Evers even took office, Republicans convened a lame-duck session to pass a package of laws to weaken his power.",
      "Evers angered Republicans during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when he ordered schools and nonessential businesses to close, issued a statewide mask mandate and tried, unsuccessfully, to delay the state's April presidential primary.",
      "Republicans broke with tradition to reject 21 Evers appointees. They also blocked many of his proposals, including expanding Medicare, legalizing marijuana and spending more on child care, K-12 schools and higher education.",
      "Evers used his broad veto powers to stop Republicans from enacting a wide range of conservative priorities, including making voting requirements more strict, expanding gun rights, growing the private school voucher program and making abortions more difficult to obtain.",
      "But Evers did work with Republicans to pass the most recent state budget, which included $1.5 billion in tax cuts prioritized by the GOP and more funding for both K-12 special education and the University of Wisconsin. Evers also worked with Republicans to keep the Brewers in Milwaukee and funnel more money to local governments.",
      "Evers pushed for the redrawing of Wisconsin's legislative boundary lines, which the state Supreme Court ordered after liberal justices gained a majority in 2023.",
      "The maps drawn by Republicans, which had been in place for more than a decade, were widely regarded as among the most gerrymandered in the country. The new maps drawn by Evers are more favorable to Democrats and helped them pick up seats in last November's election. Democrats are optimistic that they can win control of at least one legislative chamber next year.",
      "Evers waited until after he signed the state budget before making his retirement announcement.",
      "\"I promised you when I ran for this office that I'd always work to do the right thing, that I'd always give it to you straight, and that I'd always try to be a governor for all of Wisconsin. And I work every day to keep those promises. That'll never change,\" he said.",
      "The open race is sure to attract several Democratic and Republican candidates. Democrats mentioned as potential candidates include Attorney General Josh Kaul, Lt. Gov. Sarah Rodriguez, state Sen. Kelda Roys, Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley.",
      "Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and suburban Milwaukee businessman Bill Berrien are running as Republicans. Others, including U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany and state Senate President Mary Felzkowski, are considering it.",
      "The last open race for governor was in 2010, when Democratic incumbent Jim Doyle, similar to Evers, opted not to seek a third term. Republican Scott Walker won that year and served two terms before Evers defeated him in 2018.",
      "The only Wisconsin governor to be elected to a third four-year term was Republican Tommy Thompson, who served from 1986 to 2001. He resigned midway through his fourth term.",
      "Evers won the gubernatorial race in 2018 by little more than a percentage point. In 2022, he fended off a challenge from Trump-endorsed Tim Michels.",
      "Before being elected governor, Evers worked for 10 years as state superintendent of education after a career as a teacher and school administrator.",
      "Evers positioned himself as a folksy governor who would sprinkle the occasional mild swear word into his comments and other Midwestern colloquialisms such as \"holy mackerel\" and \"folks.\" His mild-mannered demeanor stood in stark contrast to Trump and other political firebrands.",
      "\"I think he is the most quintessential Wisconsin politician I've ever seen,\" said Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, who has been in elected office since 1991.",
      "Evers went viral during the 2024 Democratic National Convention when he \u2014 surrounded by a group of cheesehead-wearing supporters \u2014 said he was \"jazzed as hell\" to cast votes for Kamala Harris.",
      "After winning reelection in 2022, Evers noted that he is frequently described as boring, but said: \"As it turns out, boring wins.\"",
      "The Democratic Governors Association issued a statement Thursday, calling his governorship \"transformative for Wisconsin,\" and adding he \"successfully passed fair electoral maps after years of extreme partisan gerrymandering, challenged Wisconsin's pre-Civil War abortion ban, funded public schools for the next four hundred years with a stroke of his pen, and cut taxes by over $1.4 billion.\"",

      "U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon signed off on Routh's request to represent himself but said court-appointed attorneys need to remain as standby counsel.",
      "Earlier in the week, the federal public defenders had asked to be taken off the case, saying Routh had refused repeated attempts to meet with them.",
      "Routh, 59, is scheduled to stand trial in September, a year after prosecutors say a U.S. Secret Service agent thwarted his attempt to shoot Mr. Trump as he played golf.",
      "Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations. He has also pleaded not guilty to state charges of terrorism and attempted murder.",
      "The judge told Routh earlier this month that she doesn't intend to delay the Sept. 8 start date of his trial, even if she lets him represent himself. Routh, who has described the extent of his education as two years of college after earning his GED certificate, told Cannon that he understood and would be ready.",
      "In a June 29 letter to the judge, Routh said he and his attorneys were \"a million miles apart\" and that they were refusing to answer his questions. He also suggested in the same letter that he could be used in a prisoner exchange with Iran, China, North Korea or Russia.",
      "\"I could die being of some use and save all this court mess, but no one acts; perhaps you have the power to trade me away,\" Routh wrote.",
      "On Wednesday, the federal public defender's office filed a motion for termination of appointment of counsel, saying \"the attorney-client relationship is irreconcilably broken.\" Attorneys said Routh refused to meet with them for a scheduled in-person meeting Tuesday morning at the federal detention center in Miami. They said Routh has refused six attempts to meet with their team.",
      "\"It is clear that Mr. Routh wishes to represent himself, and he is within his Constitutional rights to make such a demand,\" the motion said.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has held that criminal defendants have a right to represent themselves in court proceedings, as long as they can show a judge they are competent to waive their right to be defended by an attorney.",
      "Prosecutors have said Routh methodically plotted to kill Mr. Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on Sept. 15 at his West Palm Beach country club. A Secret Service agent spotted Routh before Mr. Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot.",
      "Routh was armed with an AK-47-style rifle and was allegedly 300-500 yards away from Mr. Trump when the Secret Service agent spotted his rifle in the tree line, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.",
      "The incident followed another attempted assassination, last July, which took place at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Mr.\u00a0 Trump and two others were injured, and one man, Corey Comperatore, was killed when a gunman, Thomas Crooks, fired shots. Crooks was killed by a Secret Service sniper.",

    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration said it will continue issuing paper checks to the retirement program's beneficiaries, backing away from a previously announced plan to switch all payments to electronic deposits after Sept. 30.",
      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration told CBS MoneyWatch it would continue issuing paper checks for beneficiaries, including recipients of retirement and disability benefits, who have no other means of getting\u00a0payments. But the program will also emphasize the advantages of electronic transfers to its roughly 70 million beneficiaries in an effort to encourage check recipients to switch, a Social Security spokesperson added.",
      "The about-face comes after the agency\u00a0said\u00a0on July 14 that it would phase out paper checks beginning in October, citing the advantages of electronic deposits including faster payment processing and enhanced security. Eliminating paper also saves the federal government money, with checks costing 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer, the agency said at the time.",
      "The reversal of the policy to eliminate paper checks comes after Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, met with Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano on Wednesday morning and asked about the plan to discontinue paper checks, along with other changes at the agency.",
      "\"There are about 600,000 Americans who still receive their paper checks \u2014 it's a small fraction of people who receive Social Security payments, but it's a population that often needs checks through paper\" versus electronic deposit, Warren said in a press call to discuss her meeting with Bisignano.",
      "She added that Bisignano \"made a commitment that no one will be left behind and that people who have access to paper checks will get access to paper checks.\"",
      "Millions of people in the U.S. are \"unbanked,\" meaning they lack traditional bank accounts, often because they believe they don't earn enough to qualify for an account or are worried about costs or other issues, according to Bankrate.

      "The chat messages listed out information on a planned U.S. bombing operation in Yemen in March, and were sent to several Trump administration officials in a Signal group \u2014 which became public when a reporter was inadvertently added to the chat. At the time, administration officials denied that any classified information was shared in the chat.",
      "Key information in the messages was derived from a classified email marked \"SECRET//NOFORN,\" said the two officials, who both requested anonymity to speak about an ongoing investigation into top Trump administration officials.",
      "The \"SECRET\" designation means that the information was classified and the disclosure of this information could potentially cause serious damage to national security, potentially jeopardizing the safety of service members. The \"NOFORN\" label means the information can only be disseminated to U.S. agencies and individuals, excluding foreign nationals and even close U.S. allies.",
      "The Washington Post first reported about the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General receiving the evidence on Wednesday.",
      "Contacted by CBS News on Wednesday, the Inspector General's office said it would not comment about ongoing oversight projects. In April, the Defense Department IG announced it would evaluate the Defense Secretary's use of commercial messaging applications for official business and whether his office complied with classification and records retention requirements.",

      "Trump administration officials have faced staunch scrutiny since the existence of the Signal chat messages was first reported by The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who was accidentally added to the Signal chat group by then-National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. Trump officials in the Signal chat group have repeatedly denied that classified information was shared in the group.",
      "But the two U.S. officials with knowledge of the evidence received by the Pentagon's watchdog office told CBS News on Wednesday that the information Hegseth posted in the encrypted Signal chat group was derived from a classified email sent out by Gen. Michael \"Erik\" Kurilla to dozens of defense officials. Kurilla oversees U.S. Central Command, which is the primary Defense Department organization responsible for conducting U.S. military operations in the Middle East.",
      "The Atlantic published screenshots that it said were from the Signal chat, which appeared to show Hegseth sharing a timeline of planned attacks on Houthi rebels in Yemen. It listed the timing of two sets of F-18 launches and strikes, a set of drone strikes and some Tomahawk missile strikes.",
      "\"Just CONFIRMED w/ CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch,\" one message read, according to the magazine.",
      "Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said in an April statement: \"There was no classified information in any Signal chat, no matter how many ways they try to write the story.\" He made that claim after reporting showed Hegseth also shared details in a separate Signal chat that included members of his family.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe \u2014 both of whom appeared to be members of the chat group \u2014 also told lawmakers in March that classified material wasn't shared.",
      "Ratcliffe said that Signal \"is a permissible use\" application that has been approved by the White House for use by senior officials, and the group chat was a \"mechanism for communicating between senior level officials but not a substitute for using high side or classified communications.\"",
      "The defense secretary, according to federal regulations, has the authority to declassify information, but after the messages surfaced, Hegseth didn't answer when asked by reporters whether he took that approach before sharing the information on Signal.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans,\" Hegseth told reporters in March.",
      "Signal is a free messaging app that's popular due to its high standard of encryption, which prevents people other than the senders or recipients from viewing messages.",
      "Human error remains a vulnerability for Signal and other encrypted apps, as the episode involving Hegseth demonstrated.

It's expected to include a mix of both personal time, and political business. As was the case during his last visit as president in 2018, he is likely to be greeted by protests everywhere he goes in his mother's native land.",
      "The plan is for Mr. Trump to pay visits to his two luxury golf resorts in Scotland, Trump International on the east coast of Aberdeenshire, which he bought in 2012, and Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire, about 200 miles away on the west coast, which he purchased in 2014.",

Some Scots believe the American real estate mogul-turned-president has been good for the country, bringing in investment and with it, some employment, but others criticize the polices he has adopted during his second term.",
      "In advance of Mr. Trump's arrival, the Stop Trump Scotland protest group has been\u00a0 organizing demonstrations at Aberdeen and outside the U.S. consulate in Scotland's capital, Edinburgh \u2014 part of a so-called \"Festival of Resistance\" that aims to mix city-based actions with countryside activism around Mr. Trump's golf resorts.",
      "The demonstrations are slated to include large banners and messages in the sand of Scotland's coastline, intended to be visible to the president as he lands",

But with that in mind, we've got a really experienced team of officers working as part of planning the operation.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's 2018 trip to Scotland, CBS News' partner network BBC News says there were more than 5,000 police officers deployed, with the U.K. Treasury chipping in about \u00a35 million ($6.8 million) to help cover the costs to the Scottish police force.",
      "Trump's visit is private, but with some politics",
      "While he made his preference for Mr. Trump's opponent clear before the last U.S. election, the head of Scotland's government said it was his duty to meet with the U.S. president during his upcoming visit.",
      "\"I've taken a decision that's in Scotland's interest to meet with the president of the United States so that I can use every opportunity to protect and to promote the interests of the people of Scotland,\" Swinney told Britain's PA news agency. \"There's obviously a range of issues that we can cover around the international situation that's causing such anxiety to people in Scotland, around the situation the Middle East, and the situation in Ukraine, and the domestic issues that are important to us around about the implications of, for example, trade and tariffs on some of our key sectors, including Scotch whisky.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Wednesday declassified additional materials on the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's actions in the 2016 election, claiming in a social media\u00a0post and at a White House press briefing that they showed Obama administration officials \"manufactured\" information in order to undermine then-candidate Donald Trump.",
      "Her statement on X said the documents show Obama officials \"manufactured the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment that they knew was false, promoting the LIE that Vladimir Putin and the Russian government helped President Trump win the 2016 election.\"",
      "Democrats disputed her claims and accused Gabbard of misrepresenting the intelligence findings. Wednesday's report follows a separate set of declassified documents on the matter released by Gabbard last Friday. In a memo accompanying those documents, she similarly accused Obama administration officials of plotting a \"years-long coup\" against Mr. Trump.",
      "Obama's spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in a statement regarding the first set of materials, \"These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,\" he said, a likely reference to turmoil in Congress over the release of files related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Rodenbush also said nothing in last week's documents \"undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes.\" Rodenbush has not responded to the most recent release of material.",
      "Gabbard also said in her X statement that it was Mr. Trump who made the decision to declassify the House Republicans' report.",
      "The Wednesday release was a declassified report that was compiled in 2017 and finalized in 2020 by the House Intelligence Committee's Republican majority \u2014 where FBI Director Kash Patel was a lead staffer at the time, according to two sources familiar with the matter. It focuses at length on the intelligence community's judgment that Russian president Vladimir Putin aspired to help Mr. Trump to win the 2016 election.",
      "It includes discussions of raw intelligence provided by a human source to the CIA, as well as Signal intercepts gathered by the National Security Agency, prompting concerns from current and former intelligence officials and condemnation from Democrats about the risks it could pose to sensitive intelligence sources and methods.",
      "But the report does not fundamentally change previous assessments by the U.S. intelligence community \u2014 or the multiple reviews that followed.",
      "\"The desperate and irresponsible release of the partisan House intelligence report puts at risk some of the most sensitive sources and methods our Intelligence Community uses to spy on Russia and keep Americans safe,\" Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner said in a statement. \"And in doing so, Director Gabbard is sending a chilling message to our allies and assets around the world: the United States can no longer be trusted to protect the intelligence you share with us.\"",
      "An Office of the Directorate of National Intelligence official said the president's ultimate declassification authority meant he was not obligated to consult with intelligence agencies about redacting sensitive content in the report.",
      "At the White House briefing Monday, Gabbard accused President Obama of \"leading the manufacturing of this intelligence assessment.\" She told reporters that the documents would be sent to the Justice Department and FBI for investigation of \"criminal implications.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News correspondent Ed O'Keefe whether she thinks Obama is guilty of treason, Gabbard responded that she would leave criminal charges to the Justice Department, but said what occurred \"can only be described as a years-long coup and a treasonous conspiracy against the American people.\"",
      "She declined to directly answer another question from O'Keefe about how the latest declassified documents change previous assessments, given that the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 which included then-Sen. Marco Rubio \u2014 dedicated an entire volume of its five-volume investigation to the intelligence community's analysis..",
      "\"[W]e are ensuring that the intelligence community is not being politicized, Gabbard said. \"Look at the evidence and you will know the truth.\"",
      "The House committee's Republican-authored report criticizes the review of the analysis underlying the assessment that went into the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment, or ICA, for several reasons, including that its production was rushed to be released before Mr. Trump took office. It also claimed analysts failed to consider plausible alternative explanations for Putin's intentions and questioned whether they sufficiently took into account the human source's motivations, proximity to Putin or bias towards Mr. Trump.",
      "The GOP House committee report zeroes in on a piece of intelligence contained in a report from a human source that it contends was subjected to \"questionable interpretation\" by analysts.",
      "\"The unclear fragment (shown in bold) is part of a sentence in a [redacted] that reads, 'Putin had made this decision [to leak DNC emails] after he had come to believe that the Democratic nominee had better odds of winning the U.S. presidential election, and that [candidate Trump] whose victory Putin was counting on, most likely would not be able to pull off a convincing victory,'\" a bullet says on page 4 of the report.",
      "It adds that a senior CIA operations officer said at the time, \"We don't know what was meant by that\" and \"five people read it five ways.\"",
      "The findings align in many areas with a separate tradecraft review released earlier this month by CIA Director John Ratcliffe, which determined that the confidence level in the assessment that Putin aspired to help Mr. Trump win should have been \"moderate\" instead of \"high,\" chiefly because it was derived from one source instead of multiple. The CIA's report, however, did not include any detailed discussion of the sensitive sources or methods involved.",
      "The CIA's own review of the intelligence that informed the finding on Putin's preference \"confirmed that the clause was accurately represented\u2026and that the ICA authors' interpretation of its meaning was most consistent with the raw intelligence.\" It more broadly found that much of the tradecraft underlying the 2017 assessment was \"robust and consistent\" with analytic standards.",
      "The CIA declined to comment on the report released by Gabbard.",
      "Democrats seized on the timing of the disclosures \u2014 which they pointed out could have been made at any time during the first Trump administration or since he took office for a second time.",
      "\"It's appropriate that this shoddy and partisan report was released by Director Gabbard on the day that House Republicans are quite literally fleeing Washington, D.C., for six weeks rather than releasing the Epstein files that Trump is so desperate to cover up,\" said House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes.",
      "\"Given the rushed and unusual 'declassification' process the DNI has implemented, I fear that the public release of this report could compromise sensitive sources and methods and endanger our national security,\" Himes said.",

    "summary": "This week's U.S. trade agreement with Japan could provide a framework for a pact with the European Union, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and the European Union are racing to clinch a trade deal\u00a0by the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, with economists warning that a sharp hike in tariffs could raise costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "As the clock ticks down, a series of pacts with other U.S. trading partners in recent days have raised hopes of avoiding a potentially damaging trade war with Europe, with experts saying a\u00a0deal with Japan announced on Tuesday could serve as a template for a deal with the EU.",
      "The U.S. has also recently announced the outlines of trade deals with China, Indonesia, the Philippines and U.K., though with many details still remaining to be finalized.",
      "For consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, much is riding on the outcome of the trade talks. Absent a deal, President Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tax. In preparing possible countermeasures, the European Commission has said it would impose tariffs on more than $100 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Aug. 7, AFP reported on Wednesday.",
      "Negotiations are ongoing and a U.S.-EU trade war could yet be avoided. Citing EU diplomats, AFP also said officials with the trading block could be open to a 15% U.S. tariff rate, with potential carveouts for key sectors, according to the wire service.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the status of talks with the EU, including whether the Trump administration expects to reach a trade deal by the Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday struck a trade deal with Tokyo that calls for a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, the deal calls for Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including cars and certain farm products.",
      "The 15% tariff rate on Japanese goods is five percentage points higher than a baseline tariff the Trump administration imposed on all foreign imports on April 2. But it is lower than the 25% he threatened against Japan earlier this month and the 24% duties his administration\u00a0proposed\u00a0in early April.",
      "\"The Japan deal solidifies this pattern we've seen thus far, which is some market access relief, a commitment to purchase U.S. goods, and a slightly lower, but above the universal baseline, tariff level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a public policy research firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The Japan deal certainly provides a framework of what [Mr. Trump] looking for,\" Jacquez said. \"It's about accepting a baseline tariff at or above 10%, and then making purchase commitments.\"",
      "Key catalysts for trade deals",
      "A key element of Mr. Trump's trade deals has been a commitment by other nations to invest in the U.S. The president has defended tariffs as a way to revive the country's domestic manufacturing base and make American exports more competitive, as well as to generate additional federal revenue.",
      "\"We are learning that the promise of greater investment into the U.S. works well with the administration,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said. \"The promise to invest $550 billion was a big part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal. It was a key catalyst to securing a deal.\"",
      "The EU, whose member states have a combined gross domestic product of $20 trillion, could likely commit to a large investment in the U.S. because it could span a number of years and focus on key sectors, such as technology, energy or artificial intelligence, Daco added.",
      "Additional commitments by the EU to purchase American-made goods and to lower trade barriers to U.S. exports could also help close a deal, he said. \"Those don't cost much, and they're an easy bargaining chip to put forward.\"",
      "Risk of higher prices",
      "Although a 15% baseline U.S. tariff on EU imports would represent a retrenchment from Mr. Trump's earlier threats, it would still drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, according to Daco.",
      "\"While it may seem like a great deal, it's still much higher than the tariffs that the U.S. was imposing at the end of 2024,\" he noted. \"So there would still be a positive inflation shock because of higher tariffs. There would also be demand erosion coming from reduced business investment, hiring,and reduced consumer spending as a result of these higher tariffs.\"",
      "Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports is around 15%, according to his analysis. If Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs go into effect, that rate would rise to more than 20%. If the EU agrees to a 15% tariff rate, however, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports from around the world would drop to 19.5%.",
      "\"That's still a significant increase in the average rate,\" Daco said. \"It's a lot higher than the 2.5% where we started the year.\"",
      "Because most U.S. imports from the EU include industrial inputs like components, raw materials and machinery, any added costs would take tie to work their way through the supply chain, according to Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"It would \u00a0affect manufacturing exports faster than it would affect American consumers, but it would raise prices all around,\" Young said.",

      "\"American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world.

They won't take any of our beef. They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers and, you know, I don't blame them, but we're doing the same thing right now.\"",

      "\"I want to see the science and it should be predicated on science. I'm suspicious of the speed at which this has been done,\" Littleproud told reporters.",

      "Around 70% of Australian beef is exported. Producers fear that export market would vanish overnight if diseases including mad cow or foot-and-mouth disease infected Australian cattle.",
      "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been only six BSE cases in U.S. cattle since the major international outbreak of the disease \u2014 which was centered in the U.K. and other European nations \u2014 in the late 1980s and early 1990s. One of those cows was imported from Canada and believed to have been infected there, and the other five, \"were diagnosed with atypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by contaminated feed,\" the CDC says.",
      "Will Evans, chief executive of Cattle Australia who represents more than 52,000 grass-fed beef producers across the nation, said he was confident the agriculture department had taken a cautious approach toward U.S. imports.",

      "\"When you have a $75 billion (Australian $50 billion) industry relying on them not making this mistake, I'm sure they've been very cautious in their decision-making,\" he added.",

      "Will Australians buy more U.S. beef?",
      "Evans, of Cattle Australia, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he wasn't worried about the new government policy flooding Australia's domestic market with American beef. He said the U.S. domestic market currently relieds on imports of Australian beef, which he said was about 50 cents cheaper than U.S. beef per pound.",
      "\"The likelihood of them (U.S.) turning around and looking to Australia as a really high value market [to export to] is very low,\" he said. \"If I was an exporter of U.S. beef, I would be looking at Japan, Korea and China as being really viable and valuable markets. I don't really think Australia rates highly on that list.\"",
      "Simon Quilty, an analyst with Global Agri Trends, agreed that it was unlikely Australian consumers would soon see U.S. beef in on their grocery stores shelves.",
      "\"Honestly, if there is a pound of U.S. beef shipped to Australia in the next three years, I will be gobsmacked,\" he told ABC.",

The average price of a pound of ground beef in the U.S. rose to $6.12 in June, up nearly 12% from a year ago, according to U.S. government data. The average price of all uncooked beef steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration instructed Customs and Border Protection officials this week to offer migrant teenagers the option of voluntarily returning to their home countries, instead of being sent to government-overseen shelters, upending longstanding U.S. immigration policy, two U.S. officials told CBS News Wednesday.",
      "For many years, U.S. immigration officials were required to transfer all unaccompanied migrant children \u2014 or those who entered the U.S. without permission and without their parents or legal guardians \u2014 to the Department of Health and Human Services, if they hailed from countries outside of Mexico and Canada. HHS oversees a network of shelters where these minors are housed until they turn 18 or can be placed with a sponsor, who historically has been a U.S.-based relative.",
      "But now, CBP officials have been directed to offer unaccompanied migrant children who are 14 or older the option to self-deport to their countries of origin, the officials said. If the teenagers take that option, U.S. immigration officials would facilitate their prompt return to their native countries. If not, the teens would still be transferred to HHS' Office of Refugee Resettlement.",
      "That voluntary departure policy was previously limited to unaccompanied children from Canada and Mexico. A 2008 anti-trafficking law, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, provided special legal protections for migrant children from \"noncontiguous\" countries, including barring officials from swiftly deporting these minors.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said new authorities in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act spending law allowed the Trump administration to make the policy change.",
      "\"This is a long-standing practice used to prioritize getting children back to the safety of a parent or legal guardian in their home country and is accredited in the Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act of 2022,\" DHS said in a statement.",
      "\"The only change pursuant to the Big Beautiful Bill is expanding this option to return home to UACs from additional countries beyond Mexico and Canada,\" the department added.",
      "The policy change was first reported by CNN.",
      "It's unclear how many migrant teenagers will be affected by the recent directive. The number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border illegally has plunged to levels not seen since the 1960s amid the Trump administration's crackdown. In June, for example, Border Patrol apprehended 6,000 migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, a record monthly low that included fewer than 700 unaccompanied children.",
      "The administration has moved aggressively to deport immigrants living in the U.S. illegally or whose legal status has been revoked, ramping up operations to arrest, detain and deport them.",
      "But it has also launched a massive push to encourage unauthorized immigrants to self-deport, offering them a $1,000 self-deportation bonus and threatening them with arrest, fines and prosecution if they remain in the U.S. illegally.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-birthright-citizenship-order-unconstitutional-appeals-court/",
    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 22:06:15 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal appeals court said Wednesday that President Trump's executive order curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court said Wednesday that President Trump's executive order curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional.",
      "The policy, which has been the subject of a complicated monthslong legal back-and-forth, is currently on hold. But Wednesday's decision appears to mark the first time that an appellate court has weighed in on the merits of Mr. Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship for many children of undocumented immigrants by executive order.",
      "A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit wrote that Mr. Trump's order is \"invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment's grant of citizenship to 'all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'\"",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News: \"The Ninth Circuit misinterpreted the purpose and the text of the 14th Amendment. We look forward to being vindicated on appeal.\"",
      "On the first day of Mr. Trump's second term, he signed an executive order that said people born in the United States should not automatically get citizenship if one parent is undocumented and the other isn't a citizen or green-card holder, or if both parents are in the U.S. on temporary visas. The order directed federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents within 30 days to people who fall into those categories.",
      "The order drew a flurry of lawsuits, as most legal experts have said the 14th Amendment \u2014 which was ratified in 1868 \u2014 automatically offers citizenship to virtually everybody born within the U.S., regardless of their parents' immigration status, with extremely narrow exceptions.",
      "The Trump administration argues the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment does not apply to people whose parents are in the country illegally or temporarily \u2014 citing a clause that says citizenship is granted to those who are \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. Those parents do not necessarily have \"allegiance\" to the country, the government argues, so they therefore aren't \"subject to the jurisdiction.\"",
      "The 9th Circuit disagreed. It wrote Wednesday that a plain reading of the 14th Amendment suggests that citizenship was meant to be granted to anybody who is \"subject to the laws and authority of the United States.\"",
      "\"The Defendants' proposed interpretation of the Citizenship Clause relies on a network of inferences that are unmoored from the accepted legal principles of 1868,\" the judges wrote.",
      "\"Perhaps the Executive Branch, recognizing that it could not change the Constitution, phrased its Executive Order in terms of a strained and novel interpretation of the Constitution,\" the opinion said.",
      "The issue reached the 9th Circuit after a lower court in Washington state blocked the birthright citizenship executive order in February, responding to a lawsuit from several Democratic states. The Trump administration in March\u00a0appealed that ruling. It reasserted its arguments about who the 14th Amendment applies to, called the ruling \"vastly overbroad\" and argued the states did not have standing to sue over the order.",
      "On Wednesday, the 9th Circuit said the states did have the right to sue, pointing to the risk that states would be financially harmed by a federal policy that narrows who qualifies for citizenship. The appellate judges also upheld the district court's finding that the states are likely to succeed in showing the order violates the Constitution.",
      "The 9th Circuit's ruling was written by Clinton-appointed Judge Ronald Gould, and joined by Obama-appointed Judge Michael Daly Hawkins. A third member of the panel \u2014 Judge Patrick Bumatay, appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term \u2014 dissented in part, writing that the states don't have standing and adding \"it's premature to address the merits of the citizenship question or the scope of the injunction.\"",
      "Supreme Court hasn't weighed in on merits of birthright citizenship \u2014 yet",
      "The birthright citizenship issue reached the Supreme Court earlier this year, but not in a case involving the merits of the Trump administration's policy.",
      "Instead, the Supreme Court weighed in on whether the district courts that issued nationwide blocks against Mr. Trump's executive order were exceeding the scope of their power \u2014 a perennial topic of debate in legal circles that has frustrated presidents of both parties.",
      "The high court's ruling last month limited the use of nationwide injunctions. In a 6-3 decision, it granted a request by the administration to narrow the injunctions against the birthright citizenship order, but \"only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief.\"",
      "That doesn't mean the birthright citizenship order will take effect. Shortly after the ruling, a New Hampshire court paused the executive order\u00a0nationwide in a lawsuit that was brought as a class action, after the Supreme Court's decision left the door open to that option.",
      "The Supreme Court also did not directly address whether states can still sue over the order. In the case that the 9th Circuit ruled on Wednesday, the government has argued that courts can just block the birthright citizenship order for residents of the states that sued, rather than issuing a nationwide injunction. But the states argue that would provide them with incomplete relief because people move from state to state.",

    "story": [
      "Dewey Yopp, a retired U.S. Army Special Forces officer, was sent to Afghanistan in 2002 to train up a new Afghan army during the early days of the war in Afghanistan. He met Amir, his then-18-year-old Afghan translator, at the airport on his first day there, and says Amir went on to save his life four times.",
      "\"Amir dragged me, under fire, to a medevac point,\" Yopp told CBS News of one of those instances.",
      "After the U.S. withdrew from the country in 2021, Yopp scrambled to get Amir a special immigrant visa for Afghan allies. Amir asked CBS News to conceal his real name for safety reasons.",
      "\"If someone saves your life, your souls are bound together for eternity,\" Yopp said. \"He's like a son to me, really.\"",
      "Three years later, Amir's visa was approved, and he and his family were given green cards. They came to the U.S. and settled in Kentucky, reuniting with Yopp 22 years after they first met in Afghanistan.",
      "Yopp now spends most days with Amir's children, who call him \"grandfather.\"",
      "Thousands of Afghans living in the U.S. now fear deportation after a federal appeals court late Monday\u00a0refused to freeze\u00a0the Trump administration's efforts to end their legal status. Amir is a Special Immigrant Visa recipient, given to U.S. allies who helped during the war. Despite he and his family having green cards, he still fears being sent back, since the White House has threatened to deport green card holders, too.",
      "Amir risked Taliban retaliation to help American soldiers, because work in Afghanistan at the time was scarce and the prospect of safety abroad was enticing. He told CBS News the promise that was made to him in return for risking his life was, \"Your family will go to America. This was promised with all who work with U.S.\"",
      "Amir said he went into hiding for years after his service, feeling betrayed by the U.S., until Yopp stepped in to fulfill America's pledge and helped secure him his visa. Thousands of veterans of the Afghanistan war across the country have taken it upon themselves to help their translators and other Afghan allies come safely to the U.S. and settle here. But Amir says it is not the job of veterans to fulfill the vow of protection the government previously made to them.",
      "The Trump administration\u00a0has repeatedly targeted\u00a0Afghan refugees, stopping flights with Afghan allies from arriving, freezing resettlement services, putting Afghanistan on the travel ban list, and ending the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Afghan refugees. Yopp says it is a \"moral injury\" to veterans to see this happen to those who helped them during the war.",
      "As part of the administration's efforts to end the TPS program, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem\u00a0has claimed\u00a0that Afghanistan is now safe for Afghans to return to, a point Amir disputes.",
      "\"OK, if Afghanistan is safe, why are you saying to your citizens, 'Do not go to Afghanistan?'\" Amir said in reference to the State Department's \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for Afghanistan. \"For me, [it's] safe, but for you, [it's] not safe? I'm not sure.\"",
      "Amir fears that even as a green card holder, he and his family may be sent back, since the White House has threatened to deport green card holders, too.",
      "These days, he works two jobs, seven days a week, to support his family. He says he only got by in the past because of the $500 a month that Yopp, who is retired, would give him.",
      "\"It's been a slap in the face, really, to see the programs that were in effect, to be taken away,\" Yopp said.",
      "Amir added: \"Americans should not make a promise with Afghans, and now [you're] making a problem for them. Then why [did] you make [that] promise?\"",

    "summary": "ICE is on pace to record its most deportations since the Obama administration, internal government figures show.",
    "story": [
      "Halfway into President Trump's first year back in office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency spearheading his crackdown on illegal immigration, is on track to record the most deportations since the Obama administration, according to internal government figures obtained by CBS News.",
      "During the first six months of Mr. Trump's second presidency, ICE recorded nearly 150,000 deportations \u2014 or an average of more than 800 per day \u2014 putting the agency on a trajectory to carry out more than 300,000 removals in the president's first year back in office if deportations continue at the same pace, the data indicates.",
      "That would be the highest annual tally since fiscal year 2014, when the Obama administration recorded 316,000 ICE deportations, historical agency figures show. The government's fiscal year begins in October and ends at the end of September.",
      "Created after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, ICE is charged with deporting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally or whose legal status is revoked, including because of criminal offenses or allegations of immigration fraud. The highest deportation level reported by ICE occurred in fiscal year 2012, when the agency recorded 410,000 removals.",
      "While it would be a significant increase, more than 300,000 ICE deportations in a year would still be far short of the target of 1 million annual deportations that Trump administration officials have outlined, highlighting the operational and legal constraints on immigration enforcement that Republican and Democratic presidents alike have confronted.",
      "At the same time, it's possible ICE's deportation efforts could expand significantly in the next six months, since the agency just received an unprecedented infusion of funding through Mr. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, including $45 billion to set up more detention facilities and $30 billion to fund every stage of the deportation process.",
      "In an exclusive interview with CBS News last week, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said the 1 million annual deportation goal could \"definitely\" be \"possible\" with the new funds, saying the agency plans to use the money to hire 10,000 agents and officers to locate and arrest those suspected of being in the country illegally.",
      "ICE is also not the only federal agency that carries out deportations.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first six months, U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded more than 112,000 deportations, according to the internal government data. Those include deportations of migrants who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally, though illegal crossings there have plummeted to levels not seen since the 1960s amid Mr. Trump's government-wide crackdown.",
      "Additionally, the statistics show the Department of Homeland Security has tracked over 13,000 self-deportations since the start of Mr. Trump's second term. His administration has aggressively pushed those in the country illegally to self-deport by setting up a government app to facilitate the process, offering them a $1,000 self-deportation bonus and warning them that they will be detained, fined or even criminally prosecuted if they refuse to leave voluntarily.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, the top DHS spokeswoman, confirmed ICE's deportation tally six months into the administration. She said the administration has recorded more than 280,000 repatriations and self-deportations across the board \u2014 not just those conducted by ICE \u2014 since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "Mr. Trump, who campaigned on launching the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history, has given ICE a sweeping mandate. His administration has reversed Biden-era limits on immigration arrests in the U.S. interior, enlisted other federal agencies and the military to help ICE with its deportation goals and dramatically expanded the categories of those eligible for deportation, including by revoking the humanitarian protections of hundreds of thousands of migrants.",
      "In recent weeks, ICE has held record levels of detainees in its sprawling detention system. As of earlier this week, there were more than 57,000 detainees facing deportation in ICE custody, according to internal agency data. ICE arrests have roughly doubled since Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office, though they remain far below the daily goal of 3,000 set by Stephen Miller, one of the president's top White House advisers.",
      "While ICE routinely highlights arrests of those in the U.S. illegally who have been convicted of violent crimes, its enforcement efforts have also led to the detention of asylum-seekers attending immigration court hearings, workers in a variety of industries and other non-criminals suspected of being in the country without permission. Those operations have been strongly denounced by Democratic lawmakers and have triggered protests in communities throughout the country, including in southern California.",
      "A recent CBS News poll showed that Mr. Trump's deportation effort has lost the majority support it once enjoyed among the public, with a growing share of Americans expressing concerns about immigration authorities not focusing on arresting and deporting dangerous criminals.",
      "Lyons, the acting ICE director, told CBS News that his agency continues to prioritize the \"worst of the worst,\" but he said anyone found by his agents to be in the country illegally will be taken into custody and processed for deportation.",
      "\"We have opened up the whole aperture of the immigration portfolio,\" Lyons said.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday barred federal immigration authorities from immediately taking Kilmar Abrego Garcia into custody once he is released from criminal confinement in Tennessee and ordered the Trump administration to provide him 72 hours' notice if it plans to initiate proceedings to remove him to a country that is not his place of origin.",
      "The order\u00a0from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis was issued as a federal judge in Tennessee, who is presiding over Abrego Garcia's criminal case, ruled that the Salvadoran national should be released from the custody of federal law enforcement under conditions that will be set by a magistrate judge.",
      "The Tennessee judge, Waverly Crenshaw, denied the Justice Department's request to revoke an order allowing Abrego Garcia to be released while awaiting a criminal trial, writing that the government \"failed to carry its burden of showing that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure Abrego's appearance or the safety of others.\"",
      "But Abrego Garcia will not be released from criminal custody immediately.",
      "The magistrate judge overseeing his case granted a request from his lawyers, made last week, to hold off on issuing the order directing Abrego Garcia's release for 30 days. The judge said he will continue to remain in the custody of U.S. Marshals.",
      "\"These rulings are a powerful rebuke of the government's lawless conduct and a critical safeguard for Kilmar's due process rights,\" Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, said in a statement. \"A federal judge has now barred ICE from taking him back into custody and ordered that any future deportation attempt must come with advance notice. After the government unlawfully deported him once without warning, this legal protection is essential.\"",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, attacked Xinis for her decision.",
      "\"The fact this unhinged judge is trying to tell ICE they can't arrest an MS-13 gang member, indicted by a grand jury for human trafficking, and subject to immigration arrest under federal law is LAWLESS AND INSANE,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Abrego Garcia was charged with two criminal counts of human smuggling last month and has pleaded not guilty. While the magistrate judge said he should be released from the custody of U.S. Marshals ahead of a trial, set to begin in January, the order prompted concerns that Abrego Garcia would then be swiftly detained by federal immigration authorities and deported.",
      "But Xinis' order limits the Trump administration's ability to swiftly remove him from the U.S. In addition to blocking Trump administration officials from taking Abrego Garcia into custody upon his release in Tennessee, Xinis ordered the Department of Homeland Security to return him to supervised release under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Baltimore field office. She said Abrego Garcia should be returned to Maryland, where he lives with his family.",
      "Under that supervision order, issued in 2019, Abrego Garcia had permission to live in Maryland, as well as authorization to work. He was required to check in with an immigration officer at the ICE office in Baltimore. Court filings indicate Abrego Garcia was in compliance with the ICE supervision order when he was deported to El Salvador.",
      "Xinis said her relief allows the Trump administration to initiate immigration proceedings once Abrego Garcia returns to Maryland, but said those proceedings must begin in Baltimore, which was handling the earlier ICE supervision order.",
      "\"Once Abrego Garcia is restored under the ICE Supervision Order out of the Baltimore Field Office, defendants may take whatever action is available to them under the law,\" Xinis said.",
      "Xinis, who sits on the federal district court in Maryland, wrote that she \"must accord modest relief\" that ensures Abrego Garcia is not subject to \"re-deportation without due process\" and ensures the fulfillment of her order earlier this year that required the Trump administration to return him to the U.S. from El Salvador.",
      "Administration officials, she wrote, \"have done little to assure the court that absent intervention, Abrego Garcia's due process rights will be protected.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who visited Abrego Garcia when he was detained in El Salvador, cheered Xinis' decision.",
      "\"It's clear this administration would rather deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a third country, with no chance at due process, than argue their case in court. This order will prevent that, and ensure that Kilmar Abrego Garcia is returned to Maryland following the U.S. District Court in Tennessee's determination that he does not pose any threat to the public,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who entered the U.S. illegally in 2011, was detained by ICE in March and sent to a Salvadoran prison along with hundreds of other deportees despite a 2019 court order that barred him from being sent back to El Salvador due to a fear of persecution by gangs. The Trump administration acknowledged Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but he remained there for months \u2014 despite Xinis ordering the government to facilitate his return \u2014 until he was brought to Tennessee to face criminal charges.",
      "While the magistrate judge said he should be released pending trial, the prospect that Abrego Garcia would then swiftly be detained by the Department of Homeland Security for removal proceedings created a new tangle for the courts to unravel. He has remained in the custody of U.S. Marshals as the legal proceedings have continued.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked the Tennessee court last week to put off his release from custody for 30 days if Crenshaw denied the Justice Department's bid to keep him in confinement while awaiting trial \u2014 which the judge did Wednesday.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said in seeking the delay in his release last week that they had been advised by the government that \"if the court denies the government's motion for revocation, the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the Department of Homeland Security ('DHS'), and DHS would begin removal proceedings.\"",
      "But earlier this month, Xinis heard testimony about how Abrego Garcia's deportation proceedings could be handled by ICE. An immigration official told the judge that if Abrego Garcia were to be released from pretrial detention in Tennessee, the agency had not determined where he would be sent.",
      "\"There's been no decision made, as he is not in ICE custody,\" Thomas Giles, assistant director for ICE enforcement and removal operations, testified in federal court in Maryland.",
      "Giles was in court after Xinis ordered the government to produce someone with firsthand knowledge of any third country other than El Salvador where Abrego Garcia could be deported to if he were released from criminal custody.",
      "If Abrego Garcia were to receive a notice of removal, up until his deportation, he would be able to express fear about going to a third country, a period of time that could range from \"a day to a week,\" Giles said.",

      "Congressman Mike Lawler says he will run for reelection in his Hudson Valley House district in the 2026 midterms, forgoing a bid for New York governor.",
      "Lawler had been considering a gubernatorial run, among the Republicans looking to challenge incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul in next year's statewide election. But he said in an interview Wednesday morning that he intends to stay in the House representing the 17th Congressional District.",
      "\"There's no question Kathy Hochul is the worst governor in America,\" Lawler told \"Fox and Friends.\" \"But after months of deliberating over this and really working through it, I've decided the right thing to do for me and my family and my district is to run for reelection. My seat was determinative of control of the House back in 2022 and again in 2024. I'm one of only three Republicans that won a seat that Kamala Harris also won. Keeping the House majority is critical if we are going to continue to move this economy in the right direction.\"",
      "Lawler's seat has been targeted by Democrats in past election cycles and is a key part of Republicans' current narrow House majority.",
      "Later, Lawler couldn't resist taking a shot at Hochul, telling CBS News New York's Marcia Kramer, \"New York leads the nation in out migration, not because of the weather but because of its policies. It has the most awful business climate, the highest taxes.\"",
      "Hochul responded on social media, saying, \"This is the same Mike Lawler who caved to Trump the minute he asked to rip away New Yorkers' health care. Of course he doesn't have the spine to face me.\"",

      "President Trump appeared to weigh in on the governor's race back in May, with what experts said was a not-so-subtle attempt to clear the field for upstate Rep. Elise Stefanik to get the GOP nomination. Mr. Trump had initially tapped Stefanik to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, but she\u00a0withdrew her name from consideration\u00a0two months later as Mr. Trump asked her to stay in Congress to protect Republicans' razor-thin majority.",

      "\"As I've said repeatedly, you know, when it comes to deciding about whether to run for governor or reelection, I'll be making that decision in June, and so we're still going through that process,\" Lawler responded at the time.",
      "\"Mike Lawler is a great, effective, and hardworking Representative for New York's 17th Congressional District and is committed to protecting the House Republican Majority. As I have previously stated, I am focused on supporting strong Republican local and county candidates on the ballot this November to lay the groundwork with a strong team for next year,\" Stefanik wrote in a statement Wednesday. \"I will make a final decision and announcement after this year's November election which we are all focused on.\"",
      "Hochul and Stefanik recently\u00a0sparred during a congressional hearing on sanctuary policies, and the governor has said\u00a0\"bring it on\" to whomever she faces\u00a0next fall. Meanwhile, her number two, Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, is\u00a0also running to replace her.",
      "\"Under Kathy Hochul's failed Far Left Democrat rule, a radical Communist Defund-the-Police Antisemite may be elected mayor of New York City, a CBP officer was just brutally shot in the face by an illegal in NY due to dangerous sanctuary state laws, and New Yorkers are fleeing the highest-taxed state in the nation,\" Stefanik wrote.",

      "\"Around the globe, everyone is talking about artificial intelligence,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday. \"I find that too, 'artificial' \u2014 I can't stand it. I don't even like the name. I don't like anything that's artificial, so could we straighten that out, please? We should change the name. I actually mean that. I don't like the name artificial anything. Because it's not artificial, it's genius. It's pure genius.\"",

      "AI is like a \"beautiful baby that's born,\" he said of the technology's current state.",

      "Another focus will be on reining in what White House officials have called an \"ideological bias\" in chatbots.

      "\"We believe that AI systems should be free of ideological bias and not be designed to pursue socially engineered agendas,\" Sacks said on Wednesday. \"And so we have a number of proposals there on how to make sure that AI remains truth-seeking and trustworthy.\"",

      "As part of its efforts, the White House also seeks to remove what it refers to as \u00a0\"onerous regulation\" that the Trump administration says is hindering AI innovation.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte Macron filed a defamation lawsuit against right-wing podcast host Candace Owens on Wednesday in response to claims she peddled that France's first lady was born a man.",
      "The 22-count complaint was filed in Delaware Superior Court and seeks an unspecified amount of damages from Owens, who broadcast an eight-part series spreading a host of allegations about the Macrons, including that Brigitte Macron was born a man, stole another person's identity and transitioned to a woman.",
      "The Macrons said in the lawsuit that Owens rebuffed three separate demands for retractions, with the first coming in December and the final sent July 1, and continued to push \"outlandish, defamatory, and far-fetched fictions\" about the French president and first lady.",
      "\"These claims are demonstrably false, and Owens knew they were false when she published them,\" the lawsuit states. \"Yet, she published them anyway. And the reason is clear: it is not the pursuit of truth, but the pursuit of fame.\"",
      "Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron said in a statement that they decided to file their lawsuit after Owens doubled down on the falsehoods despite their lawyers' retraction requests.",
      "\"Ms. Owens' campaign of defamation was plainly designed to harass and cause pain to us and our families and to garner attention and notoriety,\" they said. \"We gave her every opportunity to back away from these claims, but she refused. It is our earnest hope that this lawsuit will set the record straight and end this campaign of defamation once and for all.\"",
      "In response to the lawsuit, a spokesperson for Owens said: \"Candace Owens is not shutting up. This is a foreign government attacking the First Amendment rights of an American independent journalist. Candace repeatedly requested an interview with Brigitte Macron. Instead of offering a comment, Brigitte is resorting to trying to bully a reporter into submission. In France, politicians can bully journalists, but this is not France. It's America.\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Owens went live on YouTube in response to the defamation lawsuit, calling it a public relations strategy, and she refused to back down from her claim against Brigitte Macron. She started her livestream with a clip from the movie \"Gladiator\" in which Russell Crowe's character exclaimed \"Are you not entertained?\"",
      "\"This is why you're here,\" Owens told her audience. \"This is how I feel right now. Me receiving my papers today.\"",
      "\"If read through this ... Brigitte actually and intentionally defames me throughout the filing. It says all these things are untrue, attributes quotations to me that I've never said,\" she said as she went through parts of the filing.",
      "The lawsuit takes aim at Owens for promoting unfounded theories and spreading misinformation and said she aims to \"inflame and attract attention through sensationalism and conspiracy theories.\" It alleges that the podcaster published the eight-part series about the Macrons, called \"Becoming Brigitte,\" and related posts on X with reckless disregard for the truth.",
      "\"These lies have caused tremendous damage to the Macrons,\" the suit states. Owens and her entities, it continues, have \"subjected the Macrons to a campaign of global humiliation, turning their lives into fodder for profit-driven lies. Owens has dissected their appearance, their marriage, their friends, their family, and their personal history\u2014twisting it all into a grotesque narrative designed to inflame and degrade. The result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale.\"",
      "Macron has been president of France since 2017. He and Brigitte Macron married in 2007.",
      "In addition to naming Owens as a defendant, the suit names her company, Candace Owens LLC, and the operator of her website, GeorgeTom, Inc.",
      "The baseless claims targeting Brigitte Macron began around March 2021 and were picked up by Owens in March 2024, while she was working for The Daily Wire, a conservative media outlet co-founded by Ben Shapiro, according to the lawsuit. She was fired from the outlet later that month.",
      "Following her termination, Owens launched her podcast, called \"Candace,\" in June 2024 and continued to push the allegations about Brigitte Macron.",
      "The Macrons sent their first retraction demand to Owens in December 2024, after which she published the multi-part podcast series that the couple said raised \"false and defamatory allegations\" about Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron. The third and final demand for a retraction was sent earlier this month.",
      "The Macrons allege in their suit that Owens published the defamatory statements knowing they were false, and said she acted with reckless disregard for the truth. The standard in defamation lawsuits brought by public figures is actual malice, which requires a plaintiff alleging defamation to show that the defendant knew the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for its falsity in order to prevail.",
      "France's president and first lady said Owens had a financial motivation to continue pushing the claims about Brigitte Macron, as her podcast series was monetized and used to solicit contributions, promote subscriptions and raise her brand.",
      "Tom Clare, who is representing the Macrons, said Owens' conduct is a\"clear-cut case of defamation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it will allow President Trump to fire three members of the independent Consumer Product Safety Commission, a victory for the president as he tests the bounds of his removal powers.",
      "The order from the court is the latest in which it has refused to reinstate independent regulators who were fired by the president without cause. It comes as Mr. Trump has moved to exert more control over the executive branch and has been overseeing a reorganization of federal agencies.",
      "The unsigned decision appeared to fall along ideological lines, and came over the dissent of the three liberal justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.",
      "The Supreme Court said the bid by the Trump administration to remove the trio of commissioners is controlled by its earlier ruling in a case known as Trump v. Wilcox that allowed the firings of members of two independent labor boards.",
      "\"Although our interim orders are not conclusive as to the merits, they inform how a court should exercise its equitable discretion in like cases. The stay we issued in Wilcox reflected 'our judgment that the government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty,'\" the court said. \"The same is true on the facts presented here, where the Consumer Product Safety Commission exercises executive power in a similar manner as the National Labor Relations Board, and the case does not otherwise differ from Wilcox in any pertinent respect.\"",
      "Kagan, in a dissent joined by Sotomayor and Jackson, accused the majority of using the court's emergency docket to \"destroy the independence of an independent agency, as established by Congress.\"",
      "The request for emergency relief from the high court by Solicitor General D. John Sauer arose from a federal judge's decision last month that found Mr. Trump's removal of the three commissioners \u2014 Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric and Richard Trumka Jr. \u2014 was unlawful and blocked their terminations.",
      "The officials had been named to the five-member Consumer Product Safety Commission by former President Joe Biden for seven-year terms. Boyle's term was set to end in October, Hoehn-Saric's time on the panel was due to end in October 2027 and Trumka's in October 2028.",
      "But in May, the three were told that their positions were terminated, effective immediately. Under federal law, a president cannot remove a commissioner at-will, but only for neglect of duty or malfeasance.",
      "The removed members sued over their terminations in May and asked a federal judge in Maryland, where the Consumer Product Safety Commission is headquartered, to restore them to their positions. They succeeded in their bid last month, when U.S. District Judge Matthew Maddox allowed the three commissioners to resume their roles on the panel.",
      "\"Depriving this five-member commission of three of its sitting members threatens severe impairment of its ability to fulfill its statutory mandates and advance the public's interest in safe consumer products,\" Maddox wrote in his decision. \"This hardship and threat to public safety significantly outweighs any hardship defendants might suffer from plaintiffs' participation on the CPSC.\"",
      "A unanimous panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit declined to block the district court's decision and allow Mr. Trump to fire the commissioners.",
      "The commissioners, Judge James Wynn wrote in a brief opinion, \"were appointed to serve fixed terms with statutory protections designed to preserve the commission's independence and partisan balance. Permitting their unlawful removal would thwart that purpose and deprive the public of the commission's full expertise and oversight. And because the attempted removals were unlawful, the Plaintiff-Commissioners never ceased to lawfully occupy their offices.\"",
      "The Supreme Court's order blocks the district judge's decision that reinstated the commissioners to their roles.",
      "Sauer's emergency appeal to the Supreme Court regarding the commissioners' firings was one of several involving the president's power to remove executive officers, which his administration has argued is largely unrestricted.",
      "The justices in May cleared the way for Mr. Trump to remove without cause two members of two different independent labor boards while legal fights over their terminations move forward. Over the dissent of the three liberal justices, the high court's unsigned decision said that the risk of harm to the government outweighs that of the removed officers, the line it cited in Wednesday's ruling.",
      "Sauer said that May decision from the high court regarding the removals of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board should have foreclosed the reinstatement of the Consumer Product Safety Commission members. The district court's order, he wrote, effectively transfers control of the panel from Mr. Trump to three members who were appointed by his predecessor.",
      "\"That plain-as-day affront to the President's fundamental Article II powers warrants intervention now,\" the solicitor general wrote.",
      "In her dissent, Kagan accused the conservative majority of effectively overturning the 1935 decision in the case\u00a0Humphrey's Executor v. United States, which said Congress could impose removal protections for the members of certain independent agencies.",
      "\"The majority has acted on the emergency docket \u2014 with 'little time, scant briefing, and no argument' \u2014 to override Congress's decisions about how to structure administrative agencies so that they can perform their prescribed duties,\" she wrote. \"By means of such actions, this Court may facilitate the permanent transfer of authority, piece by piece by piece, from one branch of Government to another.\"",

      "\"The facts and circumstances surrounding both your and Mr. Epstein's cases have received immense public interest and scrutiny,\" Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the chairman of the committee, wrote to Maxwell.",
      "Comer said the committee is seeking Maxwell's testimony \"to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",
      "The committee wants the deposition to take place on Aug. 11 at the Federal Correctional Institution Tallahassee, where Maxwell is imprisoned.",
      "Maxwell was\u00a0convicted in 2021\u00a0for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is\u00a0serving a 20-year prison sentence. Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges.",
      "A top Justice Department official is also planning to meet with Maxwell \"soon,\" and the government has asked federal courts overseeing the Epstein and Maxwell cases to release material from federal grand juries. The department said earlier this month that a review of evidence in Epstein case turned up no indication of a \"client list\" and said no more files would be released, citing victims' privacy. The decision sparked fierce backlash from President Trump's supporters who have called for more transparency into the case for years.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he had concerns about Maxwell providing testimony.",
      "\"If they see fit to bring in Ghislaine Maxwell for testimony, that's fine,\" the Louisiana Republican said. \"I will note the obvious concern ... Could she be counted on to tell the truth?

But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.",
      "\"Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,\" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. \"I think kids use AI to get out of thinking.\"",
      "For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you.\"",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, with 34% reporting daily usage or multiple times a week, according to\u00a0a new study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \"digital friends,\" like Character. AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",
      "In an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" on Wednesday, Common Sense founder and CEO Jim Steyer said what struck him about the study is that AI companions are \"everywhere in teens' lives.\"",
      "Common Sense's study also found that 11% of teens use AI companions to build up their courage and stand up for themselves, which Steyer said can be a good thing. However, he cautioned that problems arise when the technology replaces human relationships.",
      "\"Younger kids really trust these AI companions to be like friends or parents or therapists,\" Steyer said. \"They're talking about serious relationships, and these are robots. They're not human beings.\"",
      "As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,\" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. \"When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.\"",
      "All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an \"AI companion\" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.",
      "\"That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,\" said Nair. \"It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.\"",
      "How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers",
      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \"as satisfying or more satisfying\" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",
      "\"It's eye-opening,\" said Robb. \"When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.\" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.",
      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",
      "\"If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both.",
      "\"It's a challenge with how kids live today because they spend so many hours in front of a screen, and when you substitute a machine or a robot for human interaction, you're fundamentally changing the nature of that relationship,\" Steyer told CBS News.",
      "The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a \"risk assessment,\" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions.",
      "\"In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,\" Steyer said.",
      "A concerning trend to teens and adults alike",
      "Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot.",
      "\"Parents really have no idea this is happening,\" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up.\" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data.",
      "Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.",
      "Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.",
      "\"One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,\" said Telzer. \"They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.\"",
      "Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.",
      "\"If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,\" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.",
      "Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.",
      "\"I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,\" Perry said. \"I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.\"",
      "Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media.",
      "\"Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,\" Nair said. \"I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper \u2014 our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.\"",
      "\"It's the new addiction,\" Nair added. \"That's how I see it.\"",

      "Can you teach an old dog new tricks? Atlantic staff writer Olga Khazan set out to change aspects of her personality she didn't like by forcing herself outside of her comfort zone, and documented the progress she made in her new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change\" (Simon & Schuster/Simon Element).",
      "Among the challenges that Khazan, a lifelong introvert, set for herself: Tackling her social anxiety by enrolling in an improv class. Yes, and \u2026 how did that go?",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Susan Spencer's interview with Olga Khazan on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" July 20!",
      "\"Me, But Better\" by Olga Khazan",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "My journey into extroversion began solitarily, with me watching the improv show Middleditch & Schwartz on Netflix one night. The episode opened with two well-known actors, Thomas Middleditch and Ben Schwartz, spending an uncomfortably long time pulling a premise for their sketch out of a random audience member\u2014a photography intern. Then, on a bare stage, Middleditch pretended to interview Schwartz for a photography job, making up absurd questions like \"embody a gazelle.\"",
      "The audience laughed along gamely, but mostly, the scene reminded me that I needed to file my expense report. I felt uneasy for the actors, like at any moment the crowd could turn on them, leaving them groping for laughs in ghostly silence. I wondered why they couldn't have just written out better scenes ahead of time. And even worse, I knew that soon, I would be in their exact same position, except without the advantage of being a famous comedian.",
      "For my personality-change project, I had decided to focus on each of the five traits intensively for a few months at a time, and I tackled extroversion first. In recent years my life had descended into a rut that I didn't particularly like, and extroversion seemed like the way out. Most days, I worked, made dinner, watched TV, and worked some more. Rich and I were planning to relocate, and it occurred to me that I would have both moved into and out of my house without having met any of my neighbors. A test in a self-help book reminded me that I have \"high loneliness.\"",
      "My \"very low\" extroversion score was probably not surprising to people who know me: My friend Anastasia once sentenced me to attending a party on pain of ending our friendship. But my hard-core introversion could turn pernicious, shading at times into loneliness and isolation. I have a career in which work can expand to fill every crevice of the day, and sometimes I thought that was a good thing, because I didn't have many hobbies or friends to otherwise occupy my time. (And say what you will about extroverts, but they have plenty of hobbies and friends.) I had always told myself I could focus on socializing after my life had stabilized, but the absence of social interaction was, itself, destabilizing.",
      "Of all five traits, extroversion offers the simplest path to personality change: You just have to go out and talk to people. You don't even have to be particularly good at it, or to proclaim yourself an \"extrovert\" while you do it. You just go, and extroversion will find you, like the entire wedding follows the first intrepid dancer.",
      "Coincidentally, this is also the ethos behind improv comedy: You just have to say something. Anything! For the uninitiated, \"improv\" is short for \"improvisational theater.\" The idea is that two or more actors get up on stage without knowing what they'll say or do. They get to the \"scene\" by accepting and building on a partner's improvisations\u2014a concept known as \"yes, and.\" When this is done well, improvisers say there is virtually no difference between improv and scripted theater\u2014a claim about which opinions surely differ.",
      "I knew I needed a commitment device for extroversion\u2014something to force me out of my house and into gregariousness. I decided to try improv, which seemed like the full-immersion extrovert experience.",
      "It also felt like full-immersion insanity. Rich saw me entering my credit-card information into the website of Dojo Comedy, a cozy-looking D.C. improv theater whose logo incorporates a pair of mustachioed Groucho Marx comedy glasses. \"You doing improv is like Larry David doing ice hockey,\" he said.",
      "It's true. My general vibe is less \"yes, and\" and more \"well, actually.\" I've never really liked improv as an art form. I don't find it particularly funny\u2014it's more like an extended inside joke you're never going to get. I thought Middleditch would warm me to improv, but it only turned me off more.",
      "Before the first class a few weeks later, I donned a Groundlings-ready black T-shirt and jeans, hoping to draw as little attention to myself as possible. I tried to shake memories of being so timid in middle-school drama class that I only qualified to be the understudy for the smallest role\u2014Bob Cratchit's daughter. When I typed the address of the improv studio into my phone, I was relieved when the red snake of \"heavier than usual traffic\" indicated that I would have at least an hour to mentally prepare.",
      "The improv class met in an old townhouse, in a room that was, for no discernible reason, filled with dozens of sculptures of elephants. Six of us novices sat in a circle on chairs that looked like they'd been salvaged from Victorian funerals.",
      "The instructor, a short brunette with a brisk, friendly manner, opened by asking us about our past improv experience\u2014none, in my case. One of the other women rattled off a long list of improv classes she had taken. What kind of crazy person does improv multiple times? I wondered. (Me, as it would turn out.)",
      "Right after the instructor said, \"Let's get started,\" I prayed for someone to grab an elephant and knock me unconscious. That didn't happen, so instead I stood up to play warm-up games with a software engineer, two lawyers, and a guy who worked on the Hill. The games were meant to loosen us up for what was to come, which was \"scene work,\" or acting out unscripted mini plays with one another.",
      "First, we learned the improv standard Zip Zap Zop, which involves whooshing beams of energy at one another and taking turns saying \"Zip,\" \"Zap,\" and\u2014you guessed it\u2014 \"Zop.\" The point of the game is to stay unflustered enough to keep up the Zip-Zap-Zop sequence while still whooshing on to someone else in the circle.",
      "I struggled for several reasons: Because of the pandemic, I hadn't been in a room with other people for more than a year. On top of that, I have poor reflexes, and, because we wore masks, you had to determine whether someone was about to Zop you solely by the angle of their eyes.",
      "If someone messed up the sequence\u2014said \"Zip\" to another's \"Zip,\" for instance\u2014we would all stop, clap, and say, \"yay!,\" reinforcing the idea that it's okay to screw up in improv. The spirit of all this was so different from my job, where you can get fired for screwing up, that it felt like some sort of rehab for perfectionists.",
      "Then we moved on to juggling various invisible items between one another, including an invisible ball, which, humiliatingly, we had to refer to as \"invisible ball!\" I sensed that the others were as nervous as I was, but this being D.C., an air of try-hard overachievement subsumed everyone's true emotions. People, myself included, will behave ridiculously if they feel they have no alternative. I imagined all my fellow ball-jugglers back at work the next day, writing emails in which they promised to circle back and touch base. I wondered whether they would think back to this moment of whimsy at their brown-bag lunches, as they gravely discussed the situation in Burkina Faso. Maybe it would make the situation in Burkina Faso seem less chaotic by comparison.",
      "Soon it was time to call an invisible hawk to my arm. I noted with gratitude that at least the blinds were closed, so no one could see us from the street.",

    "summary": "Writer Olga Khazan, a lifelong introvert obsessed with work, was unhappy with who she was, and so vowed to redesign her personality by living outside her comfort zone \u2013 a journey she documented in her new book, \"Me, But Better.\"",
    "story": [
      "For years, Olga Khazan, a Virginia-based staff writer at The Atlantic, knew she had a big problem: she hated much of her own personality. \"I was constantly worried about everything,\" she said. \"Just never living in the moment. And I didn't really like doing anything fun with other people. Just wasn't my thing.\"",
      "How might she function at a party? \"I would kind of stand off to myself, and honestly, sometimes just, like, read articles on my phone or just basically not engage,\" she laughed.",
      "Not surprisingly, a lot of folks didn't want to engage with Khazan, either. \"One person called me a pressure addict, that I was sort of obsessed with working, and just doing as much work as possible, and never taking a minute to appreciate life,\" she said. \"One person told me that she was kind of afraid of me when we worked together.\"",
      "Predictably, when she took a personality test four years ago, she was off the charts \u2013 way off \u2013 in neuroticism, or negative emotions \u2026 not that she hadn't tried to find help: \"This whole time I'd been in therapy,\" Khazan said. \"I had taken different medications. I did yoga. And I did all the self-care things. Nothing was truly working.\"",
      "Frustrated, Khazan set out to do something much more radical: She vowed to redesign her whole personality. \"I decided to spend a year trying to change my personality traits,\" she laughed.",
      "Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala described one's personality as \"your characteristic way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. It's how you think about your behavior and how you act.\"",
      "I asked, \"I always assumed that once you had reached a certain age, your personality was your personality?\"",
      "\"That really is, I think, the prevailing way to think about personality, but it doesn't line up with our science,\" Sauer-Zavala replied.",
      "Personality science is her specialty, and her research at the University of Kentucky could be a game-changer for how we approach mental health issues. She says data tells us it is possible to scientifically change your personality, and that, with the right intervention, introverts can become extroverts \u2026 sloppy people can get neater \u2026 slackers can gain ambition \u2026 and anxious people can learn to be calm. \"In my almost 20 years of treating people with anxiety disorders, I've seen dramatic changes in 12, 16, 20 weeks,\" Sauer-Zavala said.",
      "Step one is a baseline personality test, which asks questions such as: \"I sometimes manipulate people into doing what I want.\"",
      "The next step is forcing yourself to act the opposite of how you normally would. If you're shy, make conversations. If you're messy, make the bed.",
      "Sauer-Zavala said, \"When we make intentional changes to our thinking, our feeling, and our behaviors, and we maintain those changes over time, then we're essentially shifting our personality. We're changing the way we're gonna fill out those bubbles on the personality questionnaire.\"",
      "\"So, you consciously adopt the behavior of the personality that you think you want?\" I asked. \"You make it sound easy.\"",
      "\"It's not easy,\" Sauer-Zavala replied. \"The principles are simple, but the execution is difficult.\"",
      "It wasn't easy for Olga Khazan, the lifelong introvert. Among other strategies to tackle her social anxiety, she enrolled in an improv class with total strangers \u2026 something completely outside her comfort zone. \"I was very, very scared,\" she said. \"Probably for the first three or four months that I did it, my heart was really beating in my chest, and I was deeply uncomfortable.\"",
      "What about it scared her? \"I didn't like looking silly!\" she laughed.",
      "Murphy McHugh, who was Khazan's improv teacher, said, \"For me, doing improv was a life-changing thing. I opened up socially. I became a better listener, a better collaborator.\"",
      "He said as Khazan continued coming to class, he noticed changes in her: \"Relaxing, a little bit less of the cross-armed body language. You see someone relaxed, you see their shoulders drop. You see them laughing, and coming into scenes with an idea.\"",
      "Along with improv, Khazan meditated, went sailing, took conversation classes, and kept a journal, as she describes in a new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change.\"",
      "\"Journaling kind of helps you focus on some of the more positive elements of your life that, if you're very neurotic, you tend to kind of gloss over or forget,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Is this a case of fake it 'til you make it?\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is fake it 'til you make it,\" Khazan said. \"Because if you think about it, anything is gonna feel fake if it feels new, right? Anything that you're not accustomed to doing is gonna feel really unnatural. But the only way to make it natural is to do it over and over and over again\"",
      "\"And just incorporate it in who you are?\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "Today, Khazan is happily married, with a 14-month-old baby. As for that personality she once so disliked, she said, \"I feel like I am a different person today than I was three years ago. I think I genuinely have a different way of living my life, and approaching problems, than I did before.\"",
      "So, what advice does Shannon Sauer-Zavala have for everyone watching with completely unsatisfactory personalities? \"Not to get stuck in a personality-type box,\" she said. \"Think about the life that you want to have, and then know that you can intentionally develop the traits that will facilitate that journey for you.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 14:06:47 -0400",
    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, as employers seek out AI-capable workers to assist them in AI adoption and development.",
      "In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found. For its report, Brookings analyzed data from Lightcast, a labor market analytics company. AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 outstripping the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, the report showed.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies are starting to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing of goods or services has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% by mid-2025, according to the report, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Still, while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s, according to its AI Adoption Tracker.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What sort of AI jobs exist?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, the global head of research at Lightcast. In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, according to the Brookings report, up from 3,780 in 2010.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the use of AI by more businesses is spurring demand for consulting jobs, which are intended to help businesses integrate AI into their workflow. Job postings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay on average 28%, or $18,000, more per year than job postings for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are these jobs growing the most?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in the tech hubs like Silicon Valley. The renown San Francisco area accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings, while Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "That being said, AI jobs are starting to diffuse into other parts of the country including the Sunbelt, a wide swath of land that stretches from the Southeast and Southwest, and along the east coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, Muro added, given their role in developing talent bases and training students in computer science.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data. As for the people landing these jobs, they tend work for tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Apple and Google as well as AI companies such as OpenAI, according to Magrini.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by firms to increase more rapidly in the coming years, as the practical use of the technology becomes more obvious to businesses.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday is signing the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies.",
      "The law establishes federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House on Thursday by a 308-122 vote after being approved\u00a0in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The measure is part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "The president on Tuesdy\u00a0posted\u00a0his support for the Genius Act on Truth Social.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 1.40% on Thursday, rising to $120,584.80; etherium's price rose 3.41% to $3,486.86.",
      "Shares of Coinbase, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, rose 3.2% on Thursday, to close at $410.75.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Content promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery is available to young TikTok users, breaching the social media platform's policies.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

Formenton had previously played for the Ottawa Senators before joining a Swiss team. All went on indefinite leave and none is on an NHL roster or has an active contract with a team in the league.",
      "All five players had pleaded not guilty to sexual assault in an encounter that took place in a London, Ontario, hotel room in the early hours of June 19, 2018. Years of speculation regarding the allegations \u2014 fueled by a lawsuit settlement, parliamentary hearings and revived investigations by the police and Hockey Canada, along with an NHL investigation \u2014 all preceded a complex trial earlier this year that included a mistrial and the dismissal of the jury, leaving the verdict to Carroccia.",
      "Carroccia explained her reasoning for the acquittals in detail over the course of five hours, highlighting the complainant's \"tendency to blame others\" for inconsistencies in her allegations. She also said the woman went to \"great lengths\" to point out that she was really drunk through the course of the night, but that is not supported by surveillance video from a bar and hotel that night and the testimony of others.",
      "McLeod was also acquitted \u2014 and pleaded not guilty \u2014 to a separate count of being a party to the offense, an unusual application of a charge that is more typically seen in murder cases.",

      "The Journal reported Wednesday that when Justice Department officials reviewed documents related to Epstein earlier this year, they learned Mr. Trump's name appeared multiple times. Bondi and her deputy told the president at a White House meeting in May that his name was in the so-called Epstein files, as were those of other public figures, according to the Journal.",

    "story": [
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson told CBS News he wants \"full transparency\" in the case of Jeffrey Epstein, as the Trump administration faces pressure \u2014 including from some Republicans \u2014 to release more information on the late child sex offender.",
      "\"We want full transparency. We want everybody who is involved in any way with the Epstein evils \u2014 let's call it what it was \u2014 to be brought to justice as quickly as possible. We want the full weight of the law on their heads,\" Johnson told CBS News' chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett in an interview Wednesday.",
      "\"It's not a hoax. Of course not,\" said the House speaker, a Louisiana Republican, when asked if he considers it a hoax \u2014 a word that has been used by President Trump to describe some of his supporters' interest in the Epstein case.",
      "Johnson said he had \"never seen the Epstein evidence, it was not in my lane.\"",
      "The Trump administration's handling of the Epstein case has drawn weeks of public scrutiny, since the Justice Department and FBI released a review of the federal investigations into the financier. The review found no evidence that Epstein had an incriminating \"client list\" or tried to blackmail powerful people. It also concluded that Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges in New York.",
      "Those findings have not satisfied some of Mr. Trump's supporters, who have called on the Justice Department to release all the information on the Epstein case. A handful of House Republicans joined with Democrats on Wednesday to vote on subpoenaing the Justice Department for some of its files on Epstein.",
      "Johnson and other House GOP leaders have resisted a push to hold a floor vote to force the release of materials on Epstein. Earlier this week, Johnson accused Democrats of playing \"political games\" by trying to force a vote. Johnson sent the House home for its summer break early amid the controversy roiling the lower chamber over the release of the Epstein files. The House had initially been scheduled to be in session through Thursday, but ended on Wednesday instead.",
      "Asked about the Epstein case \u2014 and the FBI and Justice Department's findings \u2014 Johnson told CBS News on Wednesday, \"I have the same concern and question that a lot of people do.\"",
      "At Mr. Trump's direction, the Justice Department last week asked federal courts to unseal grand jury testimony related to the federal criminal probes into Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. A judge in Florida denied a request to release grand jury material stemming from investigations into Epstein in the 2000s, which ended without federal charges. Separate requests to release material from Epstein and Maxwell's more recent cases in New York are still pending, and could take some time.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has urged his supporters to stop focusing on the issue, arguing Democrats are trying to capitalize on it.",

    "summary": "Automated license plate reader technology is used by law enforcement agencies in communities across the U.S. \u2014 but the systems sometimes get things wrong.",
    "story": [
      "In 2018, Brian Hofer and his younger brother were driving to visit their parents for Thanksgiving. It should have been a routine trip.",
      "But that evening they found themselves held at gunpoint by a group of law enforcement officers.",
      "The incident was the result of technology gone wrong. Hofer's vehicle had been flagged as stolen by an Automated License Plate Reader \u2014 ALPR \u2014 system. When he drove by, the reader alerted authorities.",
      "\"Your life definitely is different after you have guns pointed at you,\" he said.",
      "This incident is one of over a dozen cases verified by CBS News during a six-month investigation into incidents of wrongful stops and even several instances of ALPR technology being abused.",
      "The consequences of ALPR errors can range from the inconvenient \u2014 such as mistaken toll booth charges \u2014 to the potentially dangerous, such as Hofer's armed detainment. In some instances the technology was improperly used by authorities, such as in Kansas, where law enforcement officers used license plate reader systems to stalk former partners in two separate incidents.",
      "The rise of ALPR systems",
      "In use since at least the late 1990s, automated license plate reader systems have advanced quickly in recent years. They now marry high-speed, high-resolution cameras with artificial intelligence to scan every license plate passing through a designated field of vision. The data is then compared against license plate numbers in databases.",
      "Thousands of agencies use these systems daily to scan plates in real time and identify potential matches. Departments use ALPRs as a crime-fighting tool to gather evidence for investigations and reduce crime as well as for traffic compliance.",
      "According to a survey from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, every police department overseeing more than one million citizens reported using the technology, as did 90% of sheriff's offices with 500 or more sworn deputies.",
      "Law enforcement officials told CBS News that the technology has allowed them to do their job more efficiently and has helped solve crimes ranging from stolen vehicles to missing persons cases.",
      "Pat Yoes, the national president of The National Fraternal Order of Police, an organization of hundreds of thousands of sworn law enforcement officers, said in an emailed statement to CBS News that ALPRs are \"extraordinarily important in cases where there is an immediate threat to life or safety, as in an abduction or an armed threat driving to a target,\" adding that the information can be valuable in generating leads and closing cases.",
      "He said transparency is key. \"The community should be made aware of the new technology, how it's used in the field, how it contributes to public safety, and how it addresses any privacy concerns,\" he said in the statement. \"Technology like ALPRs is a valuable tool for many law enforcement agencies to make their communities safer.\"",
      "The rise of ALPR systems comes as law enforcement agencies across the country face staffing and recruiting challenges. A 2024 survey by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a professional association, found that U.S. agencies are operating at a nearly 10% staffing deficit. ALPR technology is one way to help fill this gap in manpower.",
      "Why license plate readers make errors \u2014 what we found",
      "License plate reader errors may occur for a variety of reasons. In some cases, letters or numbers are interpreted incorrectly by the Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, software. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, common issues including glare or misaligned cameras could impact accuracy. CBS News found that mistakes are often due to a mix of machine and human or administrative errors.",
      "In Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico, a 12-year-old was handcuffed after an ALPR camera misread the last number of a license plate on a vehicle driven by her older sister as a '7' instead of the '2' it actually ended with, according to a lawsuit filed against the city. A month later, in a separate incident, a 17-year-old honors student was held at gunpoint in Espa\u00f1ola on his way home from school after officers mistook his vehicle for one associated with an individual who was being sought in connection with a string of armed robberies.",
      "In Aurora, Colorado, in 2020, a mother and her family, including her 6-year-old daughter, were pulled over at gunpoint and forced to lie face down on hot pavement. Again, ALPR technology was central to the stop. Police mistakenly flagged their Colorado license plate as matching that of a completely different vehicle from a different state \u2014 a stolen motorcycle registered in Montana. The incident, captured on video and widely condemned, led to a $1.9 million settlement from the city in 2024.",
      "Privacy and accuracy concerns",
      "The ACLU warns ALPR cameras could infringe on civil rights and violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment by encouraging unreasonable searches. Despite widespread use, there is no federal legislative framework for ALPR use.",
      "Hofer, who has been involved in privacy advocacy for over a decade, is now the executive director of Secure Justice, an organization that aims to reduce government and corporate overreach. He says manual verification is necessary to see whether ALPR \"hits,\" or matches, are accurate. Even so, he said, such checks are insufficient because data errors could cause a plate to \"match\" an incorrect entry in a database.",
      "\"There are billions of scans a day in America. If there's even just a 10% error rate, that means there are so many opportunities for abuse to happen,\" Hofer said.",
      "Some concerned citizens are taking action. Last year, residents of Norfolk, Virginia, filed a federal lawsuit against the city, and in Illinois, two residents have sued the Illinois State Police over ALPR systems, arguing that their use violates Fourth Amendment rights. The latter case was dismissed without prejudice in April.",

      "It's put President Trump's allies in Congress in a bind as they try to balance the Republican base's demands for the release of all Epstein-related files against the White House's desire to move on.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump has asked that only federal grand jury transcripts be made public. One of the Justice Department's requests to unseal grand jury transcripts has been denied. The Trump administration has asked for grand jury transcripts related to investigations into Epstein in 2005 and 2007 in Florida, as well as transcripts related to separate grand juries convened in New York that resulted in charges against Epstein in 2019 and against his partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking charges in 2021.",
      "Some Republicans have rebelled and are backing efforts to make more details public. Meanwhile, Democrats are fanning the flames by trying to force Republicans to take politically risky votes on the issue and accusing the GOP of trying to hide something.",
      "\"What are they hiding from the American people? Release the files so that the American people can make a decision on their own,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said this week.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Wednesday that \"No one in Congress is blocking Epstein documents.\" A day earlier, Johnson announced the lower chamber would be heading home early as members clashed over the Epstein issue.",
      "Seeking flight logs, travel records, information about handling of Epstein materials",
      "A bipartisan effort led by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California to compel the release of Epstein-related files could have enough support to force a floor vote soon after House lawmakers return from their five-week break in September.",
      "The legislation, known as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, would require the Justice Department to release much more than the grand jury testimony that the president has asked courts to make public.",
      "It calls for the release of documents relating to all investigations into the disgraced financier and his accomplice Maxwell, flight logs and travel records, names of individuals and entities referenced in any Epstein case and internal Justice Department communications. It would also make public any records \"concerning the destruction, deletion, alteration, misplacement, or concealment of documents, recordings, or electronic data\" related to Epstein and his associates, as well as documentation about his death.",
      "Supporters of the legislation said it's necessary because it would be legally binding, unlike a Republican resolution \u2014 which may not ever get a vote \u2014 that was offered last week as a way to quiet dissent. The resolution from Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina calls for the release of much of the same documentation, but would carry no legal weight if the Trump administration does not follow through.",
      "Epstein died by suicide while in federal custody in Manhattan as he was facing sex trafficking charges in 2019. Prosecutors alleged he exploited and abused dozens of underage girls from 2002 through 2005. In Florida in 2008, he pleaded guilty to two state prostitution charges \u2014 one of them for soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, his labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, resigned following criticism of his handling of Epstein's 2008 plea deal when he was a federal prosecutor in Florida. Epstein served 13 months in a jail work-release program after he was originally accused of sexually abusing dozens of girls and young women.",
      "Johnson argued the Massie-Khanna effort does not include enough protections for Epstein's victims. He said Congress has a moral and legal obligation \"to protect the people who have been the victims of these unspeakable crimes so that their names are not drug through the mud.\"",
      "On Wednesday, three Republicans on a House Oversight subcommittee voted with all Democrats on the panel to subpoena the Justice Department for the Epstein files. The White House has not responded to the latest congressional efforts, although Mr. Trump has referred to the whole saga as a \"hoax,\" as his administration faces criticism over the handling of the Epstein files.",
      "Epstein's financial network",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, has been looking into Epstein's financial network for three years and has called on the Trump administration to release the Treasury's records.",
      "Last year, the Biden administration allowed committee staff to look at portions of the confidential file. Wyden said it shows more than 4,700 in potentially suspicious wire transfers adding up to nearly $1.1 billion flowing in and out of just one of Epstein's bank accounts and hundreds of millions through other accounts.",
      "Wyden sent a letter this week to Attorney General Pam Bondi urging the Justice Department to further investigate Epstein's financial transactions and whether several big banks turned a blind eye to suspicious transfers. The senator's office said the attorney general has not yet responded. The Justice Department has not yet responded to a request for comment.",
      "\"The Treasury Department's Epstein file contains significant information on the sources of funding behind Epstein's sex trafficking activities,\" Wyden wrote. \"Epstein clearly had access to enormous financing to operate his sex trafficking network, and the details on how he got the cash to pay for it are sitting in a Treasury Department filing cabinet.\"",
      "Seeking testimony from Ghislaine Maxwell",
      "Lawmakers are also seeking testimony from Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence.",
      "The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Maxwell on Wednesday, requesting that she sit for a deposition in August \"to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",

      "The Justice Department announced earlier this month that a review of evidence in the Epstein case found no indication of a \"client list\" and said no more files would be released, citing victims' privacy.

      "It will be Wisconsin's highest profile race next year, as Democrats also angle to take control of the Legislature thanks to redrawn election maps that are friendlier to the party. They are also targeting two congressional districts as Democrats nationwide try to retake the House.",
      "The Legislature has been under Republican control since 2011, and some Democrats had hoped that Evers, 73, would run for a third term to give him a chance to potentially work with a Democratic-controlled one.",
      "In a video announcing his decision, Evers said he was \"damn proud\" of working 50 years in public service. But he said it was time to focus on his family.",
      "\"For five decades, my family has sacrificed to give me the gift of service,\" Evers said. \"They're my world and I owe it to them to focus on doing all the things we enjoy and love doing together.\"",
      "Evers has drawn the ire of President Trump's administration, and his tenure has been marked by his often contentious relationship with the Legislature.",
      "Before Evers even took office, Republicans convened a lame-duck session to pass a package of laws to weaken his power.",
      "Evers angered Republicans during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when he ordered schools and nonessential businesses to close, issued a statewide mask mandate and tried, unsuccessfully, to delay the state's April presidential primary.",
      "Republicans broke with tradition to reject 21 Evers appointees. They also blocked many of his proposals, including expanding Medicare, legalizing marijuana and spending more on child care, K-12 schools and higher education.",
      "Evers used his broad veto powers to stop Republicans from enacting a wide range of conservative priorities, including making voting requirements more strict, expanding gun rights, growing the private school voucher program and making abortions more difficult to obtain.",
      "But Evers did work with Republicans to pass the most recent state budget, which included $1.5 billion in tax cuts prioritized by the GOP and more funding for both K-12 special education and the University of Wisconsin. Evers also worked with Republicans to keep the Brewers in Milwaukee and funnel more money to local governments.",
      "Evers pushed for the redrawing of Wisconsin's legislative boundary lines, which the state Supreme Court ordered after liberal justices gained a majority in 2023.",
      "The maps drawn by Republicans, which had been in place for more than a decade, were widely regarded as among the most gerrymandered in the country. The new maps drawn by Evers are more favorable to Democrats and helped them pick up seats in last November's election. Democrats are optimistic that they can win control of at least one legislative chamber next year.",
      "Evers waited until after he signed the state budget before making his retirement announcement.",
      "\"I promised you when I ran for this office that I'd always work to do the right thing, that I'd always give it to you straight, and that I'd always try to be a governor for all of Wisconsin. And I work every day to keep those promises. That'll never change,\" he said.",

Sarah Rodriguez, state Sen. Kelda Roys, Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley.",
      "Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and suburban Milwaukee businessman Bill Berrien are running as Republicans. Others, including U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany and state Senate President Mary Felzkowski, are considering it.",
      "The last open race for governor was in 2010, when Democratic incumbent Jim Doyle, similar to Evers, opted not to seek a third term. Republican Scott Walker won that year and served two terms before Evers defeated him in 2018.",
      "The only Wisconsin governor to be elected to a third four-year term was Republican Tommy Thompson, who served from 1986 to 2001. He resigned midway through his fourth term.",
      "Evers won the gubernatorial race in 2018 by little more than a percentage point. In 2022, he fended off a challenge from Trump-endorsed Tim Michels.",
      "Before being elected governor, Evers worked for 10 years as state superintendent of education after a career as a teacher and school administrator.",
      "Evers positioned himself as a folksy governor who would sprinkle the occasional mild swear word into his comments and other Midwestern colloquialisms such as \"holy mackerel\" and \"folks.\" His mild-mannered demeanor stood in stark contrast to Trump and other political firebrands.",

    "story": [
      "Ryan Routh, the man charged with trying to assassinate President Trump last year in South Florida, can represent himself during his trial, a federal judge ruled Thursday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon signed off on Routh's request to represent himself but said court-appointed attorneys need to remain as standby counsel.",
      "Earlier in the week, the federal public defenders had asked to be taken off the case, saying Routh had refused repeated attempts to meet with them.",
      "Routh, 59, is scheduled to stand trial in September, a year after prosecutors say a U.S. Secret Service agent thwarted his attempt to shoot Mr. Trump as he played golf.",
      "Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations. He has also pleaded not guilty to state charges of terrorism and attempted murder.",
      "The judge told Routh earlier this month that she doesn't intend to delay the Sept. 8 start date of his trial, even if she lets him represent himself. Routh, who has described the extent of his education as two years of college after earning his GED certificate, told Cannon that he understood and would be ready.",
      "In a June 29 letter to the judge, Routh said he and his attorneys were \"a million miles apart\" and that they were refusing to answer his questions. He also suggested in the same letter that he could be used in a prisoner exchange with Iran, China, North Korea or Russia.",
      "\"I could die being of some use and save all this court mess, but no one acts; perhaps you have the power to trade me away,\" Routh wrote.",
      "On Wednesday, the federal public defender's office filed a motion for termination of appointment of counsel, saying \"the attorney-client relationship is irreconcilably broken.\" Attorneys said Routh refused to meet with them for a scheduled in-person meeting Tuesday morning at the federal detention center in Miami. They said Routh has refused six attempts to meet with their team.",
      "\"It is clear that Mr. Routh wishes to represent himself, and he is within his Constitutional rights to make such a demand,\" the motion said.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has held that criminal defendants have a right to represent themselves in court proceedings, as long as they can show a judge they are competent to waive their right to be defended by an attorney.",
      "Prosecutors have said Routh methodically plotted to kill Mr. Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on Sept. 15 at his West Palm Beach country club. A Secret Service agent spotted Routh before Mr. Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot.",
      "Routh was armed with an AK-47-style rifle and was allegedly 300-500 yards away from Mr. Trump when the Secret Service agent spotted his rifle in the tree line, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.",
      "The incident followed another attempted assassination, last July, which took place at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Mr.\u00a0 Trump and two others were injured, and one man, Corey Comperatore, was killed when a gunman, Thomas Crooks, fired shots. Crooks was killed by a Secret Service sniper.",

      "Pro wrestling icon Hulk Hogan has died, police and World Wrestling Entertainment said. He was 71.",
      "First responders were called to the Clearwater Beach, Florida, home of Hogan, whose real name was Terry Bollea,  around 9:50 a.m. Thursday, police said.",
      "\"The nature of the call was for a cardiac arrest,\" the Clearwater Police Department said in a statement. He was taken to Morton Plant Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.",
      "\"There were no signs of foul play or suspicious activity,\" Maj. Nate Burnside told reporters.",
      "Hogan was perhaps the biggest star in WWE's long history. He was the main draw for the first WrestleMania in 1985 and was a fixture for years, facing everyone from Andre The Giant and Randy Savage to The Rock and even company chairman Vince McMahon.",
      "He won at least six WWE championships and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005.",
      "\"One of pop culture's most recognizable figures, Hogan helped WWE achieve global recognition in the 1980s. WWE extends its condolences to Hogan's family, friends, and fans,\" WWE said in\u00a0a statement posted on social media.",
      "\"Hulkamania,\" as the energy he created was called, started running wild in the mid-1980s and pushed professional wrestling into the mainstream. He was a flag-waving American hero with the horseshoe mustache, red and yellow gear and massive arms he called his \"24-inch pythons.\"",
      "Hogan was also a celebrity outside the wrestling world, appearing in numerous movies and television shows, including a reality show about his life on VH1, \"Hogan Knows Best.\"",
      "In recent years, Hogan added his celebrity to politics. At the 2024 Republican National Convention, he merged classic WWE maneuvers with then-candidate Donald Trump's rhetoric to passionately endorse him for president.",
      "\"Let Trumpamania run wild brother! Let Trumpamania rule again! Let Trumpamania make America great again!\" Hogan shouted into the raucous crowd.",
      "He ripped off a T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of himself on a motorcycle to reveal a bright red Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath. Trump stood to applaud the move.",
      "\"We lost a great friend today, the 'Hulkster,'\" President Trump wrote on his social media site Thursday.",
      "He praised Hogan's speech at the RNC, calling it \"absolutely electric\" and \"one of the highlights of the entire week.\"",
      "\"He entertained fans from all over the World, and the cultural impact he had was massive,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Hogan lately began to invest in alternatives to theatrical, professional wrestling, announcing plans in April to serve as the first commissioner for the Real American Freestyle organization, which describes itself as \"the first unscripted pro wrestling\" league in the world. The first event is Aug. 30 at Cleveland State University.",
      "\"The idea was so exciting that I get a chance to be involved with all these young people and help guide them in any way, especially to make them huge stars and create a future for them,\" Hogan said. \"People might be surprised, but wrestling is wrestling, brother.\"",
      "Hogan first became champion in what was then the World Wrestling Federation in 1984, and pro wrestling took off from there. His popularity helped lead to the creation of the annual WrestleMania event in 1985, when he teamed up with Mr. T to beat \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and \"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff in the main event.",
      "He slammed and beat Andre the Giant at WrestleMania III in 1987, and the WWF gained momentum. His feud with the late \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage \u2014 perhaps his greatest rival \u2014 carried pro wrestling even further.",
      "Hogan was a central figure in what is known as the Monday Night Wars. The WWE and World Championship Wrestling were battling for ratings supremacy in 1996. Hogan tilted things in WCW's favor with the birth of the Hollywood Hogan character and the formation of the New World Order, a villainous stable that put WCW ahead in the ratings.",
      "He returned to the WWE in 2002 and became a champion again. His match with The Rock at WrestleMania X8, a loss during which fans cheered for his \"bad guy\" character, was seen as a passing of the torch.",
      "Hogan was perhaps as well known for his larger-than-life personality as he was his in-ring exploits. He was beloved for his \"promos\" \u2014 hype sessions he used to draw fans into matches. He often would play off his interviewer, \"Mean\" Gene Okerlund, starting his interviews off with, \"Well, lemme tell ya something, Mean Gene!\"",
      "In 2016, a Florida jury awarded Hogan $115 million in a lawsuit against Gawker Media and then added $25 million in punitive damages. Hogan sued after Gawker in 2012 posted a video of him having sex with his former best friend's wife. He contended the post violated his privacy.",
      "Hogan smiled and wore black throughout the three-week trial.",
      "\"Everywhere I show up, people treat me like I'm still the champ,\" he said of the support from fans.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 14:06:47 -0400",
    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, as employers seek out AI-capable workers to assist them in AI adoption and development.",
      "In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found. For its report, Brookings analyzed data from Lightcast, a labor market analytics company. AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 outstripping the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, the report showed.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies are starting to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing of goods or services has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% by mid-2025, according to the report, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Still, while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s, according to its AI Adoption Tracker.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What sort of AI jobs exist?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, the global head of research at Lightcast. In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, according to the Brookings report, up from 3,780 in 2010.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the use of AI by more businesses is spurring demand for consulting jobs, which are intended to help businesses integrate AI into their workflow. Job postings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay on average 28%, or $18,000, more per year than job postings for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are these jobs growing the most?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in the tech hubs like Silicon Valley. The renown San Francisco area accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings, while Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "That being said, AI jobs are starting to diffuse into other parts of the country including the Sunbelt, a wide swath of land that stretches from the Southeast and Southwest, and along the east coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, Muro added, given their role in developing talent bases and training students in computer science.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data. As for the people landing these jobs, they tend work for tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Apple and Google as well as AI companies such as OpenAI, according to Magrini.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by firms to increase more rapidly in the coming years, as the practical use of the technology becomes more obvious to businesses.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

      "The Social Security Administration said it will continue issuing paper checks to the retirement program's beneficiaries, backing away from a previously announced plan to switch all payments to electronic deposits after Sept. 30.",
      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration told CBS MoneyWatch it would continue issuing paper checks for beneficiaries, including recipients of retirement and disability benefits, who have no other means of getting\u00a0payments. But the program will also emphasize the advantages of electronic transfers to its roughly 70 million beneficiaries in an effort to encourage check recipients to switch, a Social Security spokesperson added.",
      "The about-face comes after the agency\u00a0said\u00a0on July 14 that it would phase out paper checks beginning in October, citing the advantages of electronic deposits including faster payment processing and enhanced security. Eliminating paper also saves the federal government money, with checks costing 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer, the agency said at the time.",
      "The reversal of the policy to eliminate paper checks comes after Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, met with Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano on Wednesday morning and asked about the plan to discontinue paper checks, along with other changes at the agency.",
      "\"There are about 600,000 Americans who still receive their paper checks \u2014 it's a small fraction of people who receive Social Security payments, but it's a population that often needs checks through paper\" versus electronic deposit, Warren said in a press call to discuss her meeting with Bisignano.",
      "She added that Bisignano \"made a commitment that no one will be left behind and that people who have access to paper checks will get access to paper checks.\"",
      "Millions of people in the U.S. are \"unbanked,\" meaning they lack traditional bank accounts, often because they believe they don't earn enough to qualify for an account or are worried about costs or other issues, according to Bankrate. Typically, these people rely on check-cashing services or other non-bank financial companies, such as PayPal or Venmo, rather than banks.",
      "About one out of every five households headed by someone over the age of 65 is unbanked or underbanked, according to the AARP. People who are underbanked may have a bank account but still primarily rely on alternative banking services, like check cashing establishments, to handle their money.",
      "Focus on customer service",
      "Warren also said she addressed other issues with Bisignano, including concerns that a major workforce reduction at the Social Security Administration this year could affect customer service.",
      "The senator said Bisignano agreed to her request that the agency's inspector general conduct an independent audit to assess the state of customer service at SSA, such as call wait times and how many Social Security recipients are able to reach a human employee when they call for help.",
      "\"More accurate data is absolutely essential to oversight, to holding the Social Security Administration accountable to the job they are required to do,\" Warren said.",
      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration said\u00a0customer service is improving, noting that the agency has reduced its phone response time to an average of 18 minutes in 2025, down from 30 minutes in 2024.",
      "\"Commissioner Bisignano had a productive meeting with Senator Warren where he presented improved customer service metrics that are currently being realized on the phone, in field offices and online,\" a Social Security Administration spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Senator Warren reacted positively to many of the indicators, specifically lower phone and field office wait times, the reduction of the disability claims backlog by 25% and the speed at which the SSFA payments were completed \u2014 give months ahead of schedule.\"",

      "What started as a retirement hobby has evolved into one of Georgia's most celebrated craft distilleries, drawing thousands of visitors annually to a sprawling 70-acre estate in this rural railroad town about two hours south of Atlanta.",
      "Erik and Karin Vonk, a Dutch couple who traded corporate life for farming, have built Richland Rum into a business that critics say produces some of the finest spirits available anywhere. Their journey began 25 years ago, rooted in Erik's childhood memories of his grandfather's lessons about rum production.",

      "Rum production in the state was essentially nonexistent until the turn of the century due to complicated liquor laws. A breakthrough came in 2017 when Georgia lawmakers allowed distilleries to sell their products directly from their facilities.",
      "\"Finally in 2017, the Georgia legislator allowed us to sell our own product in our own buildings,\" Karin Vonk said.",
      "The Richland distillery houses more than 1,000 American white oak barrels stacked to the ceiling, some containing rum that has been aging for more than a decade. The aging process is crucial to the final product's quality.",
      "\"We always say the barrel decides when the rum is ready. It can be anywhere between six and 10 years,\" Karin Vonk said.",
      "Success didn't come easily. The Vonks describe years of trial and error, with Karin noting \"a lot of blisters\" in perfecting their craft.",
      "Distiller TJ Harris oversees the production process, which begins with combining 90 gallons of syrup with 500 gallons of water and six ounces of yeast. Fermentation takes seven to 10 days before the mixture moves to copper pot stills, where it's distilled at 120 proof and transferred to barrels.",
      "The operation's reputation has attracted notable attention, including from former President Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter, who grew up in nearby Plains.",
      "\"President Carter and Ms. Rosalynn had so much interest in the process that then and there, we decided we were distilling a presidential barrel right there,\" Karin Vonk said.",
      "The couple acknowledges the challenges of combining marriage with business ownership.",
      "\"Starting a distillery is an enormous challenge. Combining the two is madness,\" Erik Vonk said, laughing. \"The fact that we've been able to do that and still are enjoying it every day \u2014 and still happily married \u2014 is remarkable.\"",

    "summary": "Hundreds of documents were released by police after Bryan Kohberger was sentenced to life in prison for the murders of Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin.",
    "story": [
      "In the weeks before Bryan Kohberger killed four University of Idaho students, there were strange happenings at their rental home near campus.",
      "One of the victims, Kaylee Goncalves, told her roommates she saw a man she didn't recognize staring at her when she took her dog outside. Another time, the residents came home to find the door open, loose on its hinges. They grabbed golf clubs to arm themselves against a possible intruder.",
      "Those details were included in hundreds of documents released by police within hours of Kohberger being sentenced to life in prison Wednesday for the brutal stabbing murders of Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin early Nov. 13, 2022.",
      "It remains unclear whether the strange happenings had anything to do with the killings. But the documents do illustrate the frenzied efforts by law enforcement to follow every possible lead to find and convict Kohberger.",
      "Here's a look at some information from the documents:",
      "Strange happenings at house and mention of a stalker",
      "Bethany Funke was one of two roommates to survive the night of the stabbings. In interviews after the murders, she told police that about a month earlier, Goncalves had taken her dog, Murphy, outside when she saw an unknown man \"up above their house to the south,\" staring at her.",
      "It was concerning enough that Goncalves \"told everyone\" about it and called her roommates to ask if they'd be home soon, Funke said.",
      "A friend of Goncalves also told police that when they had lunch on Sept. 11, 2022, she made references to having a stalker, according to the documents.",
      "The friend \"thought Kaylee said something about receiving something in the mail. Some of the other friends at the lunch thought Kaylee also mentioned getting a strange message through Facebook messenger,\" the police report says.",
      "On Nov. 4, nine days before the attack, the roommates came home at 11 a.m. to find the door open, loose on its hinges, as the wind blew. Goncalves was away at the time. Kernodle's father fixed the door, Funke reported.",
      "On Nov. 13, police found a gruesome scene. Blood pooled on bed comforters, covered floors and was splattered on walls. One the victims, Kernodle, had extensive defensive wounds; in her room \"it was obvious an intense struggle had occurred,\" one officer wrote.",
      "Detailing the investigation's steps",
      "Tips poured in. A staff member at Walmart told police that two to three weeks earlier, a white, college-age male had come in looking for a black ski mask that would cover his face. People who saw online feeds of some of the victims at a food truck offered their thoughts about a possible perpetrator, and investigators also looked into leads about bar-goers they had seen earlier in the night or an Uber driver they frequently used, the documents show.",
      "A woman who lived nearby told police that in either August or September 2022, she and her daughter saw a man in their yard who \"looked nervous.\" She said she was almost certain it was Kohberger.",
      "Officers eventually identified Kohberger \u2014 a doctoral student in criminology at nearby Washington State University \u2014 using a DNA sample found on a knife sheath at the crime scene. Earlier this month, prosecutors revealed that DNA found on a discarded Q-tip proved to be a crucial breakthrough in the case.",
      "They tracked his movements that night with cellphone data, obtained online shopping records showing he had purchased a military-style knife, and linked him to a car that repeatedly drove by the students' house.",
      "The documents include memos memorializing the subpoenas or warrants they served seeking records and the responses to those requests. Investigators served a warrant on the dating app Tinder, looking for accounts Kohberger might have created with certain emails and which might link him to his victims.",
      "No such evidence emerged, and the motive for the killings remains a mystery.",
      "Kohberger spoke with police \u2014 briefly",
      "Kohberger was arrested at his parents' home in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, about six weeks after the killings. He was taken to a state police barracks to be interviewed by officers from the Moscow police department, Idaho State Police and the FBI.",
      "They chatted about the Washington State football team, Kohberger's doctorate studies in criminal justice, his required duties to be a teaching assistant while in college, and why he wanted to become a professor.",
      "Kohberger eventually said he understood they were engaging in small talk, but he would appreciate if the officers explained what they wanted. One detective told him it was because of what had happened in Moscow. Asked if he knew what had transpired, he replied, \"Of course.\"",
      "Did he want to talk about it? \"Well, I think I would need a lawyer,\" Kohberger replied.",
      "He continued speaking, though \u2014 asking what specific questions they had and asking if his parents and dog were OK following his arrest.",
      "Kohberger finally said he would like to speak to an attorney, and police ended the interview because he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right.",
      "Police at the time said they\u00a0swabbed Bryan Kohberger's DNA\u00a0and seized a silver flashlight, four \"medical-style gloves,\" a white Arizona Jean Co. T-shirt, a black Champion sweatshirt, a pair of black-and-white size 13 Nike shoes, black Under Armour socks, black Under Armour shorts and black Under Armour boxers.",
      "Behind bars with Kohberger",
      "A man incarcerated at the Latah County Jail who was once housed next to Kohberger's cell told a detective Sept. 16, 2024, that Kohberger would often question him about his past criminal offenses and why he was in the maximum security wing of the facility.",
      "The man said Kohberger's habits annoyed him, including how he washed his hands dozens of times each day and spent 45 minutes to an hour in the shower. He said Kohberger stayed awake almost all night and would only take a nap during the day.",
      "Kohberger\u00a0pleaded guilty earlier this month to the murders\u00a0as part of a plea deal that spared him\u00a0from the death penalty. He was in the courtroom Wednesday wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and listened as the families of the victims confronted him with powerful statements.",
      "When asked by the judge if he would like to make a statement at his sentencing Wednesday, Kohberger replied: \"I respectfully decline.\"",

    "summary": "A 64-year-old man living in Arizona at the time of his arrest has been charged after DNA linked him to a California cold case.",
    "story": [
      "Police have made an arrest in Arizona four decades after the cold-case murder and sexual assault of two teenagers who were attacked in a parked car in Northern California, officials said Wednesday.",
      "On December 19, 1984, the Shasta County Sheriff's Office was called to an incident in Burney, California by the California Highway Patrol. They found two 18-year-old victims, a male and a female, according to a news release from the office. The male victim, identified by police as Terrance Arndt, had sustained a gunshot wound. He was transported to an area hospital but died from his injuries. The female victim, who police did not identify, had been sexually assaulted.",
      "An investigation found that Arndt and the female victim were parked in Arndt's car talking near an area high school when an unknown person pulled up in a vehicle. Arndt tried to protect the female victim, but was shot. The female victim was then assaulted and left for dead, Shasta County Sheriff Michael L. Johnson\u00a0said in a news conference. After the suspect left the scene, she drove Arndt's car for help until she was able to reach police. Johnson said that the crime \"rocked the community for many years.\"",
      "An extensive investigation followed, Johnson said, including \"thousands of hours\" of case work. Detectives collected forensic evidence from the female victim's clothes, according to forensic genetic genealogy company Othram, and investigators also developed a DNA profile of the suspect. A man was arrested and charged in connection with the case, Othram said, but later cleared by the DNA profile.",
      "The DNA profile was entered into the Combined DNA Index System, a national database used by law enforcement to compare DNA profiles. There were no matches to any known individuals, Othram said.",
      "In 2024, the Shasta County Sheriff's Office revisited the case using forensic genetic genealogy, Johnson said. That led police to a suspect, identified as Roger Neil Schmidt Sr. Schmidt, now 64, would have been 23 at the time of the crime, police said. He also \"strongly resembled\" a sketch developed based on an account from the female victim, the sheriff's office said.",
      "Police determined that Schmidt was currently living in Tucson, Arizona but had lived in Burney, California in 1984. Detectives from the Shasta County Sheriff's Office traveled to the city to coordinate with the Tucson Police Department and obtain a search warrant. Police were able to collect a DNA sample from Schmidt and confirm that it matched the profile.",
      "Schmidt was arrested in Tucson on Saturday and charged with murder and sexual assault, police said. He made his first court appearance on Monday, CBS affiliate KOLD reported. He was in a wheelchair and using an oxygen tank.",
      "Schmidt is expected to be extradited to Shasta County, the sheriff's office said. Johnson said he hopes the arrest brings closure to the female victim and Arndt's family. He said that the families were informed of the arrest before the news conference.",
      "According to SFGate, Arndt was a star athlete at Burney High School before enrolling at Shasta College in Redding, California, where he lived at the time of his murder.",
      "\"The resolution to this case is a bit bittersweet for us,\" Johnson said. \"Although it's a monumental accomplishment for the investigators, for the agency and the closure of having a suspect in custody, it doesn't negate the fact that there is a family and families that have been forever impacted and will forever live with the trauma and the aftermath that was left behind for them.\"",

      "No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence.",
      "The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister's birthday party.",
      "The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.",
      "\"Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,\" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. \"I think kids use AI to get out of thinking.\"",
      "For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you.\"",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, with 34% reporting daily usage or multiple times a week, according to\u00a0a new study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \"digital friends,\" like Character. AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",
      "In an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" on Wednesday, Common Sense founder and CEO Jim Steyer said what struck him about the study is that AI companions are \"everywhere in teens' lives.\"",
      "Common Sense's study also found that 11% of teens use AI companions to build up their courage and stand up for themselves, which Steyer said can be a good thing. However, he cautioned that problems arise when the technology replaces human relationships.",
      "\"Younger kids really trust these AI companions to be like friends or parents or therapists,\" Steyer said. \"They're talking about serious relationships, and these are robots. They're not human beings.\"",
      "As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,\" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. \"When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.\"",
      "All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an \"AI companion\" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.",
      "\"That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,\" said Nair. \"It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.\"",
      "How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers",
      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \"as satisfying or more satisfying\" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",
      "\"It's eye-opening,\" said Robb. \"When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.\" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.",
      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",
      "\"If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both.",
      "\"It's a challenge with how kids live today because they spend so many hours in front of a screen, and when you substitute a machine or a robot for human interaction, you're fundamentally changing the nature of that relationship,\" Steyer told CBS News.",
      "The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a \"risk assessment,\" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions.",
      "\"In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,\" Steyer said.",
      "A concerning trend to teens and adults alike",
      "Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot.",
      "\"Parents really have no idea this is happening,\" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up.\" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data.",
      "Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.",
      "Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.",
      "\"One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,\" said Telzer. \"They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.\"",
      "Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.",
      "\"If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,\" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.",
      "Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.",
      "\"I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,\" Perry said. \"I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.\"",
      "Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media.",
      "\"Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,\" Nair said. \"I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper \u2014 our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.\"",
      "\"It's the new addiction,\" Nair added. \"That's how I see it.\"",

The initiative is part of an ongoing effort the White House began earlier this year with an executive\u00a0order\u00a0removing AI guardrails imposed by the Biden administration.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke about the new plan during a keynote address at an AI summit in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, after which he signed executive orders to help fast-track AI development.",
      "\"Around the globe, everyone is talking about artificial intelligence,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday. \"I find that too, 'artificial' \u2014 I can't stand it. I don't even like the name. I don't like anything that's artificial, so could we straighten that out, please? We should change the name. I actually mean that. I don't like the name artificial anything. Because it's not artificial, it's genius. It's pure genius.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said AI has the potential to \"transform every type of endeavor and domain of human knowledge, from medicine to manufacturing to warfare and national defense.\"",
      "\"Whether we like it or not, we're suddenly engaged in a fast-paced competition to build and define this groundbreaking technology that will determine so much about the future of civilization itself,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration's plan, which includes more than 90 federal policy actions, broadly will:",
      "Support the buildout of data centers, semiconductor fabrication plants and the nation's electric grid;Create rules for government contractors in an attempt to eliminate \"ideological bias\" in chatbots;Withhold funding from states that have \"burdensome\" AI regulations;Compel federal agencies to review their rules and repeal any that obstruct AI development;Establish a program to deliver AI export packages \u2014 including hardware, large language models, software, applications and standards \u2014 to U.S. allies.",

      "Withhold funding from states that have \"burdensome\" AI regulations;",
      "Compel federal agencies to review their rules and repeal any that obstruct AI development;",
      "Establish a program to deliver AI export packages \u2014 including hardware, large language models, software, applications and standards \u2014 to U.S. allies.",
      "Mr. Trump said \"a lot of very brilliant people\" tell him AI will dominate virtually every industry, although he said he doesn't know if that's true. The president said AI brings the possibility of peril, as well as progress.",
      "\"The daunting power of AI is really, it's not going to be a reason for retreat from this new frontier,\" Mr. Trump said. \"On the contrary, it is the more reason we must ensure it is pioneered first and best.\"",
      "AI is like a \"beautiful baby that's born,\" he said of the technology's current state.",
      "\"We have to grow that baby and let that baby thrive,\" the president said. That means allowing some regulation, but also cutting red tape, he said.",
      "The president thanked companies present at the summit for investing in data centers and other projects, saying they'll create thousands of jobs.",
      "The Wednesday announcement is co-hosted by the bipartisan Hill and Valley Forum and the All-In Podcast, a business and technology show hosted by four technology investors and entrepreneurs who include Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar David Sacks.",
      "\"The goal here is for the United States to win the AI race,\" Sacks said during a press call with reporters Wednesday morning.",
      "The plan is backed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and will be carried out over the next six months to a year, according to Michael Kratsios, policy director of the OSTP.",
      "\"This is a watershed day for Trump to lay out the AI vision and make sure the U.S. stays ahead of China despite all the trade deal turmoil,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What is the AI Action Plan?",
      "The AI Action Plan focuses on accelerating AI innovation and building out AI infrastructure to ensure the U.S. leads in international \"AI diplomacy,\" according to Sacks, who laid out the plan's major pillars during Wednesday's call.",
      "That includes expediting the construction of large-scale data centers, which house servers, networking gear and other technology used to power artificial intelligence.",
      "Thousands of data centers are scattered around the U.S. Most are connected to the nation's power grid and rely on massive amounts of electricity to operate. The proliferation of AI data centers has been cited as one of the drivers of burgeoning energy costs.",
      "The number of data centers is only expected to grow as technology companies \u2014 including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI \u2014 ramp up construction to meet the nation's growing energy demand stemming from the emergence of AI.",
      "In addition to investments in data centers, the new White House plan also focuses on \"expediting and modernizing programs\" for semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs, and updating the nation's electric grid to support the enormous energy demands of AI supercomputing, Kratsios said.",
      "Another focus will be on reining in what White House officials have called an \"ideological bias\" in chatbots. This is something Sacks, a former PayPal executive, has highlighted after a 2024 incident in which Google's AI image generator created pictures of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show one of the countries Founding Fathers.",
      "\"We believe that AI systems should be free of ideological bias and not be designed to pursue socially engineered agendas,\" Sacks said on Wednesday. \"And so we have a number of proposals there on how to make sure that AI remains truth-seeking and trustworthy.\"",
      "To that end, Kratsios said the plan will update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with AI developers whose systems \"allow free speech expression to flourish.\"",
      "The plan also seeks to maintain the U.S.' edge in the global race for AI dominance as it competes with countries like China, which has moved quickly to expand its AI capabilities. A senior White House official said the report supports export controls to make sure \"that our most advanced technology doesn't get into the hands of [other] countries.\"",
      "As part of its efforts, the White House also seeks to remove what it refers to as \u00a0\"onerous regulation\" that the Trump administration says is hindering AI innovation. The official added that the plan calls for the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion and climate funding requirements from the Biden administration's CHIPS Act.",
      "DEI regulations within the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act \"burden the industry\" and \"slow down the delivery of critical projects,\" they said.",

    "summary": "When the former Canadian junior hockey players were charged in early 2024\u200b, four of them played in the NHL.",
    "story": [
      "An Ontario judge acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team on Thursday in their sexual assault case, saying the complainant's allegations lacked the credibility needed to justify the charges.",
      "Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia said prosecutors could not meet the onus of proof for the charges against Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dube and Callan Foote.",
      "The players' identities were made public when they were charged in early 2024. At the time, four of them played in the NHL \u2014 Dube for the Calgary Flames, Hart for the Philadelphia Flyers, and McLeod and Foote for the New Jersey Devils. Formenton had previously played for the Ottawa Senators before joining a Swiss team. All went on indefinite leave and none is on an NHL roster or has an active contract with a team in the league.",
      "All five players had pleaded not guilty to sexual assault in an encounter that took place in a London, Ontario, hotel room in the early hours of June 19, 2018. Years of speculation regarding the allegations \u2014 fueled by a lawsuit settlement, parliamentary hearings and revived investigations by the police and Hockey Canada, along with an NHL investigation \u2014 all preceded a complex trial earlier this year that included a mistrial and the dismissal of the jury, leaving the verdict to Carroccia.",
      "Carroccia explained her reasoning for the acquittals in detail over the course of five hours, highlighting the complainant's \"tendency to blame others\" for inconsistencies in her allegations. She also said the woman went to \"great lengths\" to point out that she was really drunk through the course of the night, but that is not supported by surveillance video from a bar and hotel that night and the testimony of others.",
      "McLeod was also acquitted \u2014 and pleaded not guilty \u2014 to a separate count of being a party to the offense, an unusual application of a charge that is more typically seen in murder cases.",
      "The players, who are now between the ages of 25 and 27, were in London at the time for a gala and golf tournament marking their championship victory.",
      "The woman testified in May that she was naked, drunk and scared when four of the men showed up unexpectedly in her room at the Delta Hotel London Armouries and felt the only \"safe\" option was to do what they wanted. Prosecutors argued the players did what they wanted without taking steps to ensure she was voluntarily consenting to sexual acts.",
      "\"I made the choice to dance with them and drink at the bar, I did not make the choice to have them do what they did back at the hotel,\" she testified.",
      "Defense attorneys cross-examined her for days and suggested she actively participated in or initiated sexual activity because she wanted a \"wild night.\" Two short videos of the complainant taken by McLeod the night of the encounter were played in court. In one, the woman says it was \"all consensual,\" though she told the court that wasn't how she truly felt.",
      "Protesters gathered outside a packed London courthouse on Thursday morning, holding signs that signaled support for the complainant.",
      "The Associated Press and other news organizations do not identify sexual assault accusers unless they have granted permission to do so, which she has not.",
      "The public didn't learn of the allegations for years. Police closed their initial investigation without charges in early 2019, but the complainant sued Hockey Canada in 2022. The organization settled the lawsuit amid intense scrutiny that cost it sponsors, but police reopened their investigation.",
      "The NHL launched its own investigation in 2022. Officials pledged to release the findings, though Commissioner Gary Bettman said in February that would depend on what the league can say given the legal proceedings.",

The U.S. has fallen in the rankings every year since 2014, when its passports were ranked as the most powerful.",
      "The U.S. has visa-free access to 182 destinations, whereas a passport from Singapore, which holds the top spot, grants the holder visa-free access to 193 destinations, according to the Index.

      "In second place on this year's Henley index are Japan and South Korea, with passports from those countries both granting holders visa-free access to 190 other countries.

      "Afghanistan is ranked last. Its passport grants visa-free access to just 25 countries.",
      "Henley says its index is based on exclusive data from the International Air Transport Association, a major travel information database.",
      "\"The consolidation we're seeing at the top underscores that access is earned \u2013 and must be maintained \u2013 through active and strategic diplomacy,\" said Dr. Christian H. Kaelin, inventor of the passport-index concept, in a statement. \"Nations that proactively negotiate visa waivers and nurture reciprocal agreements continue to rise, while the opposite applies to those that are less engaged in such efforts.\"",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0President Trump is due to arrive Friday for what the White House is calling a \"working visit\" to Scotland. It's expected to include a mix of both personal time, and political business. As was the case during his last visit as president in 2018, he is likely to be greeted by protests everywhere he goes in his mother's native land.",
      "The plan is for Mr. Trump to pay visits to his two luxury golf resorts in Scotland, Trump International on the east coast of Aberdeenshire, which he bought in 2012, and Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire, about 200 miles away on the west coast, which he purchased in 2014.",
      "During his visit he's also set to meet Scotland's top official, First Minister John Swinney, who publicly backed Kamala Harris' presidential bid against Mr. Trump last year.",
      "The American leader will also meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer near the end of his trip in Scotland, and the current 25% U.S. tariffs on British steel imports could be a focus of discussion.",
      "Trump visits bring protests and security concerns",
      "Mr. Trump has Scottish roots through his mother, who was born in 1912 as Mary Anne MacLeod on the Scottish island of Lewis in the remote Outer Hebrides.",
      "But despite his ancestry, Mr. Trump can likely expect a luke-warm to cold reception on Scottish soil. Some Scots believe the American real estate mogul-turned-president has been good for the country, bringing in investment and with it, some employment, but others criticize the polices he has adopted during his second term.",
      "In advance of Mr. Trump's arrival, the Stop Trump Scotland protest group has been\u00a0 organizing demonstrations at Aberdeen and outside the U.S. consulate in Scotland's capital, Edinburgh \u2014 part of a so-called \"Festival of Resistance\" that aims to mix city-based actions with countryside activism around Mr. Trump's golf resorts.",
      "The demonstrations are slated to include large banners and messages in the sand of Scotland's coastline, intended to be visible to the president as he lands",

      "\"There's a broad range of considerations,\" said Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Emma Bond. \"It would be inappropriate for me to plan an operation and not bear in mind what has happened in other parts of the world. But with that in mind, we've got a really experienced team of officers working as part of planning the operation.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's 2018 trip to Scotland, CBS News' partner network BBC News says there were more than 5,000 police officers deployed, with the U.K. Treasury chipping in about \u00a35 million ($6.8 million) to help cover the costs to the Scottish police force.",
      "Trump's visit is private, but with some politics",
      "While he made his preference for Mr. Trump's opponent clear before the last U.S. election, the head of Scotland's government said it was his duty to meet with the U.S. president during his upcoming visit.",
      "\"I've taken a decision that's in Scotland's interest to meet with the president of the United States so that I can use every opportunity to protect and to promote the interests of the people of Scotland,\" Swinney told Britain's PA news agency. \"There's obviously a range of issues that we can cover around the international situation that's causing such anxiety to people in Scotland, around the situation the Middle East, and the situation in Ukraine, and the domestic issues that are important to us around about the implications of, for example, trade and tariffs on some of our key sectors, including Scotch whisky.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",
      "President Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imported British steel. Starmer hopes to get that rate lowered, to zero if possible, to shore up the U.K.'s steel industry, which has seen its output plummet by around 80% since the 1960's.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that the two leaders would meet \"to refine the historic U.S.-U.K. trade deal\" brokered in May.",
      "Mr. Trump will return to the U.K. for an unprecedented second official state visit on September 17, during which he is scheduled to meet with King Charles III.

    "summary": "This week's U.S. trade agreement with Japan could provide a framework for a pact with the European Union, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and the European Union are racing to clinch a trade deal\u00a0by the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, with economists warning that a sharp hike in tariffs could raise costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "As the clock ticks down, a series of pacts with other U.S. trading partners in recent days have raised hopes of avoiding a potentially damaging trade war with Europe, with experts saying a\u00a0deal with Japan announced on Tuesday could serve as a template for a deal with the EU.",
      "The U.S. has also recently announced the outlines of trade deals with China, Indonesia, the Philippines and U.K., though with many details still remaining to be finalized.",
      "For consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, much is riding on the outcome of the trade talks. Absent a deal, President Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tax. In preparing possible countermeasures, the European Commission has said it would impose tariffs on more than $100 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Aug. 7, AFP reported on Wednesday.",
      "Negotiations are ongoing and a U.S.-EU trade war could yet be avoided. Citing EU diplomats, AFP also said officials with the trading block could be open to a 15% U.S. tariff rate, with potential carveouts for key sectors, according to the wire service.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the status of talks with the EU, including whether the Trump administration expects to reach a trade deal by the Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday struck a trade deal with Tokyo that calls for a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, the deal calls for Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including cars and certain farm products.",
      "The 15% tariff rate on Japanese goods is five percentage points higher than a baseline tariff the Trump administration imposed on all foreign imports on April 2. But it is lower than the 25% he threatened against Japan earlier this month and the 24% duties his administration\u00a0proposed\u00a0in early April.",
      "\"The Japan deal solidifies this pattern we've seen thus far, which is some market access relief, a commitment to purchase U.S. goods, and a slightly lower, but above the universal baseline, tariff level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a public policy research firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The Japan deal certainly provides a framework of what [Mr. Trump] looking for,\" Jacquez said. \"It's about accepting a baseline tariff at or above 10%, and then making purchase commitments.\"",
      "Key catalysts for trade deals",
      "A key element of Mr. Trump's trade deals has been a commitment by other nations to invest in the U.S. The president has defended tariffs as a way to revive the country's domestic manufacturing base and make American exports more competitive, as well as to generate additional federal revenue.",
      "\"We are learning that the promise of greater investment into the U.S. works well with the administration,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said. \"The promise to invest $550 billion was a big part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal. It was a key catalyst to securing a deal.\"",
      "The EU, whose member states have a combined gross domestic product of $20 trillion, could likely commit to a large investment in the U.S. because it could span a number of years and focus on key sectors, such as technology, energy or artificial intelligence, Daco added.",
      "Additional commitments by the EU to purchase American-made goods and to lower trade barriers to U.S. exports could also help close a deal, he said. \"Those don't cost much, and they're an easy bargaining chip to put forward.\"",
      "Risk of higher prices",
      "Although a 15% baseline U.S. tariff on EU imports would represent a retrenchment from Mr. Trump's earlier threats, it would still drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, according to Daco.",
      "\"While it may seem like a great deal, it's still much higher than the tariffs that the U.S. was imposing at the end of 2024,\" he noted. \"So there would still be a positive inflation shock because of higher tariffs. There would also be demand erosion coming from reduced business investment, hiring,and reduced consumer spending as a result of these higher tariffs.\"",
      "Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports is around 15%, according to his analysis. If Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs go into effect, that rate would rise to more than 20%. If the EU agrees to a 15% tariff rate, however, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports from around the world would drop to 19.5%.",
      "\"That's still a significant increase in the average rate,\" Daco said. \"It's a lot higher than the 2.5% where we started the year.\"",
      "Because most U.S. imports from the EU include industrial inputs like components, raw materials and machinery, any added costs would take tie to work their way through the supply chain, according to Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"It would \u00a0affect manufacturing exports faster than it would affect American consumers, but it would raise prices all around,\" Young said.",

      "She issued a statement under the headline: \"Make Agriculture Great Again Trade Wins.\"",
      "\"American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world. It's absurd that non-scientific trade barriers prevented our beef from being sold to consumers in Australia for the last 20 years,\" Rollins said. \"Gone are the days of putting American farmers on the sidelines.

They won't take any of our beef. They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers and, you know, I don't blame them, but we're doing the same thing right now.\"",

      "\"I want to see the science and it should be predicated on science. I'm suspicious of the speed at which this has been done,\" Littleproud told reporters.",
      "\"We need to give confidence to the industry, but also to you (the public): this is not just about animal welfare, this is about human welfare, this is about BSE potentially coming into this country and having a human impact, so I think it's important the government's very transparent about the science and I don't think it's even beyond the question to have an independent panel review that science to give confidence to everybody,\" he added.",
      "Around 70% of Australian beef is exported. Producers fear that export market would vanish overnight if diseases including mad cow or foot-and-mouth disease infected Australian cattle.",
      "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been only six BSE cases in U.S. cattle since the major international outbreak of the disease \u2014 which was centered in the U.K. and other European nations \u2014 in the late 1980s and early 1990s. One of those cows was imported from Canada and believed to have been infected there, and the other five, \"were diagnosed with atypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by contaminated feed,\" the CDC says.",
      "Will Evans, chief executive of Cattle Australia who represents more than 52,000 grass-fed beef producers across the nation, said he was confident the agriculture department had taken a cautious approach toward U.S. imports.",
      "\"The department's undertaken a technical scientific assessment and we have to put faith in them. They've made this assessment themselves. They've said: 'We've looked at this, we've looked at the best science, this is a decision that we feel comfortable with,'\" Evans said.",

      "Will Australians buy more U.S. beef?",
      "Evans, of Cattle Australia, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he wasn't worried about the new government policy flooding Australia's domestic market with American beef. He said the U.S. domestic market currently relieds on imports of Australian beef, which he said was about 50 cents cheaper than U.S. beef per pound.",
      "\"The likelihood of them (U.S.) turning around and looking to Australia as a really high value market [to export to] is very low,\" he said. \"If I was an exporter of U.S. beef, I would be looking at Japan, Korea and China as being really viable and valuable markets. I don't really think Australia rates highly on that list.\"",
      "Simon Quilty, an analyst with Global Agri Trends, agreed that it was unlikely Australian consumers would soon see U.S. beef in on their grocery stores shelves.",
      "\"Honestly, if there is a pound of U.S. beef shipped to Australia in the next three years, I will be gobsmacked,\" he told ABC.",
      "Beef prices have been rising in the U.S. for years, due to factors including prolonged drought and shrinking domestic herd numbers. The average price of a pound of ground beef in the U.S. rose to $6.12 in June, up nearly 12% from a year ago, according to U.S. government data. The average price of all uncooked beef steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound.",

He told CBS News the promise that was made to him in return for risking his life was, \"Your family will go to America. This was promised with all who work with U.S.\"",
      "Amir said he went into hiding for years after his service, feeling betrayed by the U.S., until Yopp stepped in to fulfill America's pledge and helped secure him his visa. Thousands of veterans of the Afghanistan war across the country have taken it upon themselves to help their translators and other Afghan allies come safely to the U.S. and settle here. But Amir says it is not the job of veterans to fulfill the vow of protection the government previously made to them.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 19:49:52 -0400",
    "summary": "The island nation of Vanuatu prevailed in its landmark request to legally compel countries to cut emissions and compensate places facing impacts from climate change.",
    "story": [
      "The Republic of Vanuatu, a South Pacific island nation of 320,000 people, has led a growing effort since 2021 to compel the United Nations to answer one of the most crucial legal questions related to climate change: Can polluters be held legally accountable for the harm they've caused as a result of releasing large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere?",
      "The short answer is: yes. Fifteen judges who make up the International Court of Justice, located at The Hague in the Netherlands, issued a unanimous advisory opinion saying countries \"have a duty to prevent significant harm to the environment by acting with due diligence and to use all means at their disposal to prevent activities carried out within their jurisdiction or control from causing significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment.\"",
      "The court further stated that existing environmental treaties, international human rights law, and participation in the United Nations further compels countries to do everything possible to protect the climate. Any wrongful act that violates these agreements must be immediately stopped, followed by \"full reparations\" and compensation made to the injured parties.",
      "\"Vanuatu looks forward to collaborating with other States on implementing the Court's decision,\" Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's minister of climate change and environment, said in a statement. \"A victory in the world's highest court is just the beginning. Success will depend on what happens next through coordinated efforts across diplomacy, politics, litigation, and advocacy to turn this moment into a true turning point.\"",
      "For Vanuatu, a country that comprises 83 islands with a combined size roughly the same as Connecticut, the decision is monumental. Officials said the country was responsible for less than 0.0004% of global cumulative greenhouse gas emissions between 1962 and 2022, but experiences disproportionate impacts of climate change.",
      "In addition to its average temperature rising, Vanuatu is seeing more severe and intense tropical cyclones. In 2023, it was hit by three cyclones that were Category 4 or higher, impacting nearly 200,000 residents and costing the country more than $400 million in economic damages. The western tropical Pacific Ocean has risen 4-6 inches between 1992-2020, which is particularly dangerous for the country as much of it is low-lying and vulnerable to erosion. All of this, along with increased precipitation and periods of drought, has caused entire communities to be relocated by the government, and the impacts are anticipated to grow more severe.",
      "\"Today, the world's smallest countries have made history,\" Vishal Prasad, director of Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change, said in a statement. \"The ICJ's decision brings us closer to a world where governments can no longer turn a blind eye to their legal responsibilities. It affirms a simple truth of climate justice: those who did the least to fuel this crisis deserve protection, reparations, and a future. This ruling is a lifeline for Pacific communities on the frontline.\"",
      "While the advisory opinion is not legally binding, environmental organizations and law experts are hopeful that the ruling can set a legal precedent for the thousands of climate change cases around the world that are attempting to hold larger governments and companies accountable for climate pollution.",
      "\"This opinion can serve as a compass for countries who are thinking about how to prioritize justice and prioritize the safety of their citizens while also being in compliance with international law,\" said Carly Phillips, a research scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists who worked with the legal teams of seven countries that submitted supporting statements to the court asking for the opinion.",
      "The United States does not accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, but it did submit a written statement in March 2024 and participated in oral arguments, arguing that members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 2015 Paris Agreement already compel signatories to address climate change impacts and protects them from accountability for harming the climate.",
      "But Vanuatu's Prime Minister Jotham Napat has been skeptical of the power of the U.N. convention and the Paris Agreement, saying in a statement that neither are \"generating the actions the world urgently needs fast enough.\" He believes a favorable opinion from the court could \"support vulnerable nations in securing climate finance, technology, and loss and damage support.\"",
      "The court addressed this concern in its opinion and dismissed the legal argument that environmental treaties, like the Paris Agreement, protect polluters from accountability. In fact, the court emphasized that the Paris Agreement imposes strong mitigation and adaptation obligations on all parties and requires them to respond to loss and damages from climate change.",
      "Given that the United States is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world, according to international data, the decision to hold large emitters responsible might be concerning, but President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement for a second time earlier this year.",
      "The court called out countries like the United States, saying that nations that are not party to climate treaties but are members of the United Nations must meet \"equivalent obligations under customary international law.\"",
      "The impact of the opinion remains to be seen. \"It's likely not going to have a lot of influence in the United States,\" said Maria Antonia Tigre, director of global climate litigation at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.",
      "Tigre said that while the decision may not influence domestic court cases in the U.S. and the country can't be sued under the decision, the real impact could be seen internationally. A court in Brazil, for example, could cite the opinion in one of the 135 current climate change cases making its way through its domestic court system.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 15:40:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Some scientists worried that maybe the Barbados threadsnake had become extinct before it was rediscovered in March.",
    "story": [
      "For nearly two decades, no one had spotted the world's smallest-known snake.",
      "Some scientists worried that maybe the Barbados threadsnake had become extinct, but one sunny morning, Connor Blades lifted a rock in a tiny forest in the eastern Caribbean island and held his breath.",
      "\"After a year of searching, you begin to get a little pessimistic,\" said Blades, project officer with the Ministry of Environment in Barbados.",
      "The snake can fit comfortably on a coin, so it was able to elude scientists for almost 20 years.",
      "Scientifically named Tetracheilostoma carlae, the petite creature is listed as Critically Endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species when it was last assessed in 2015.",
      "Too tiny to identify with the naked eye, Blades placed it in a small glass jar and added soil, substrate and leaf litter.",
      "Several hours later, in front of a microscope at the University of the West Indies, Blades looked at the specimen. It wriggled in the petri dish, making it nearly impossible to identify.",
      "\"It was a struggle,\" Blades recalled, adding that he shot a video of the snake and finally identified it thanks to a still image.",
      "It had pale yellow dorsal lines running through its body, and its eyes were located on the side of its head.",
      "\"I tried to keep a level head,\" Blades recalled, knowing that the Barbados threadsnake looks very much like a Brahminy blind snake, best known as the flower pot snake, which is a bit longer and has no dorsal lines.",
      "On Wednesday, the Re:wild conservation group, which is collaborating with the local environment ministry, announced the rediscovery of the Barbados threadsnake.",
      "\"Rediscovering one of our endemics on many levels is significant,\" said Justin Springer, Caribbean program officer for Re:wild who helped rediscover the snake along with Blades. \"It reminds us that we still have something important left that plays an important role in our ecosystem.\"",
      "The Barbados threadsnake has only been seen a handful of times since 1889. It was on a list of 4,800 plant, animal and fungi species that Re:wild described as \"lost to science.\"",
      "There's no information on its population and the most recent record of the snake was a 2005 photograph from near Hillaby town in St. Thomas Parish, according to the IUCN. One of the oldest known records of the species dates back to 1918, and it has only been rarely spotted since then, with a few documentations from 1966, 1997 and 2008, the Switzerland-based conservation organization said.",
      "\"Given the dense human population on Barbados, if the species was simply underrecorded it seems likely that local people would be aware of additional records,\" the IUCN said on its website. \"The lack of records suggests that this species is genuinely rare and restricted.\"",
      "The snake is blind, burrows in the ground, eats termites and ants and lays one single, slender egg. Fully grown, it measures up to four inches.",
      "\"They're very cryptic,\" Blades said. \"You can do a survey for a number of hours, and even if they are there, you may actually not see them.\"",
      "But on March 20 at around 10:30 a.m., Blades and Springer surrounded a jack-in-the-box tree in central Barbados and started looking under rocks while the rest of the team began measuring the tree, whose distribution is very limited in Barbados.",
      "\"That's why the story is so exciting,\" Springer said. \"It all happened around the same time.\"",
      "S. Blair Hedges, a professor at Temple University and director of its center for biology, was the first to identify the Barbados threadsnake. Previously, it was mistakenly lumped in with another species.",
      "In 2008, Hedges' discovery was published in a scientific journal, with the snake baptized Tetracheilostoma carlae, in honor of his wife.",
      "\"I spent days searching for them,\" Hedges recalled. \"Based on my observations and the hundreds of rocks, objects that I turned over looking for this thing without success, I do think it is a rare species.\"",
      "That was June 2006, and there were only three other such specimens known at the time: two at a London museum and a third at a museum collection in California that was wrongly identified as being from Antigua instead of Barbados, Hedges said.",
      "Hedges said that he didn't realize he had collected a new species until he did a genetic analysis.",
      "\"The aha moment was in the laboratory,\" he said, noting that the discovery established the Barbados threadsnake as the world's smallest-known snake.",
      "Hedges then became inundated for years with letters, photographs and emails from people thinking they had found more Barbados threadsnakes. Some of the pictures were of earthworms, he recalled.",
      "\"It was literally years of distraction,\" he said.",
      "Scientists hope the rediscovery means that the Barbados threadsnake could become a champion for the protection of wildlife habitat.",
      "A lot of endemic species on the tiny island have gone extinct, including the Barbados racer, the Barbados skink and a particular species of cave shrimp.",
      "\"I hope they can get some interest in protecting it,\" Hedges said. \"Barbados is kind of unique in the Caribbean for a bad reason: it has the least amount of original forest, outside of Haiti.\""

    "story": [
      "A Delta flight had just begun its takeoff roll at Benito Ju\u00e1rez Mexico City International Airport when a regional jet appeared to fly over the plane and land in front of it on the same runway, forcing the Delta pilots to hit the brakes.",

The data shows that the Delta Boeing 737-800 reached 62 knots, or about 71 miles per hour, before pilots stopped the plane and halted their takeoff.",
      "The Delta pilots exited the runway and returned to the gate, the airline said. The plane received additional fuel and eventually departed for Atlanta at 9:42 a.m. The flight carrying 144 passengers and six crew members landed safely in Atlanta at 3:20 p.m. ET, according to Delta.",
      "\"Because nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and people, Delta will fully cooperate with authorities as the circumstances around this flight are investigated.

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 10:55:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is facing protests and EU criticism for the first time since Russia invaded, over changes to national anti-corruption agencies.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0In a first since Russia launched its full-scale invasion more than three years ago, widespread protests have taken place across Ukraine \u2014 not against Russia or its President Vladimir Putin, but against Ukraine's own President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the country's parliament, the Rada.",
      "Late Tuesday night, Zelenskyy signed a bill into law, after it was fast-tracked through the Rada, that gives Ukraine's prosecutor general (roughly equivalent to the U.S. attorney general), more power over two anti-corruption agencies long known for their fierce independence. The prosecutor general is a political appointee, not an elected official.",
      "In the hours before Zelenskyy signed the measure, thousands of people in the capital Kyiv, the western city of Lviv, Dnipro in the east and Odessa in the south made their frustration and fear known, defying martial law bans on mass gatherings to come out and protest. Their concern is rooted in the continued autonomy of Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), which for years have sought to combat graft by public officials, regardless of their political affiliation.",
      "Some critics argue the new law is political retribution. In April, Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau charged a former deputy head of Zelenskyy's administration, Andrii Smyrnov, with money laundering and accepting a bribe. Others fear a potential backslide back into some degree of authoritarianism in the country that was previously led by pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was known for his close ties to oligarchs.",
      "The 27-nation European Union, which has been a staunch supporter of Zelenskyy and Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion, also voiced concern over the changes to the management of the anti-corruption agencies. Demonstrably fighting corruption is crucial to Ukraine's bid to join the EU.",
      "EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos called the vote by Ukraine's parliament \"a serious step back\" in a post on social media, adding that \"independent bodies like NABU & SAPO are essential for Ukraine's EU path. Rule of Law remains in the very center of EU accession negotiations.\"",
      "Zelenskyy appeared to acknowledge the anger in his country over the new legislation, saying in a statement posted on social media after the Rada's vote: \"We all hear what society is saying.\"",
      "\"We see what people expect from state institutions \u2014 ensured justice and the effective functioning of each institution. We discussed the necessary administrative and legislative decisions that would strengthen the work of each institution, resolve existing contradictions, and eliminate threats,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Everyone will work together. At the political level, we will provide support.\"",
      "Earlier he had stressed that the two anti-corruption agencies would still \"work,\" but he said they needed to be clear of what he claimed was \"Russian influence.\" He said some major corruption cases had been \"lying dormant\" with the agencies for years without any rational explanation, but offered no explanation of the alleged Russian influence.",
      "New round of Russia-Ukraine peace talks",
      "The Kremlin, meanwhile, confirmed that a third round of direct Russia-Ukraine peace talks would begin in Turkey on Wednesday evening.",
      "\"Our delegation is flying to Istanbul, and indeed negotiations are scheduled to take place there tonight,\" said spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. \"The main topic of discussion will be peace memorandums that were shared during the second round of talks.\"",
      "He said the two sides would discuss further prisoner swaps. Over the past two months, Russia and Ukraine have exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners of war, but the negotiations have thus far yielded little hope of a ceasefire in the war.",
      "On Tuesday, Peskov said Moscow did not expect any \"miraculous breakthrough\" in Turkey, calling the two sides \"diametrically opposed.\"",
      "Moscow has demanded a litany of concessions from Ukraine, including that it give up territory Russian troops have seized during the war. Russia currently occupies about a fifth of Ukraine's territory. Putin's government has also demanded that Ukraine abandon its ambitions of joining the EU and the U.S.-led NATO alliance, and even insisted that it should significantly downsize its military and make Russian the official language of Ukraine.",

      "Italy's national news agency ANSA said the venue had canceled the concert, offering no explanation. A representative at the Reggia di Caserta confirmed the cancellation to CBS News over the phone.",
      "The move came after criticism from Italian lawmakers, human rights advocates and Russian political dissidents.",
      "Among the most vocal opponents to Italy welcoming Gergiev was Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny.

Others are collapsing in the streets. Many more may be dying unreported ... These deaths and the horrendous physical and psychological suffering caused by hunger are the result of Israel's interference with and militarization of humanitarian assistance.\"",
      "Photos emerging from Gaza in recent days have shown children and infants with severe malnutrition, including some said by hospital workers to have died of the condition. According to the National Institutes of Health, severe malnutrition typically causes symptoms including dramatic wasting, or fat and muscle loss, poor circulation and extreme fatigue.",

The U.N. and aid organizations say the quantity of food and other emergency supplies being allowed into Gaza since then has been vastly insufficient, however.",
      "Food stocks accumulated inside the Palestinian territory during the ceasefire have depleted, leaving the territory's more than two million inhabitants experiencing the worst shortages since the start of the war sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Some 1,200 Israelis were killed and 251 others taken hostage during that siege more than 650 days ago, and 20 of the captives are still thought to be alive in Gaza.",

      "Neither of the AI models scored full marks \u2014 unlike five young people at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), a prestigious annual competition where participants must be under 20 years old.",
      "Google said Monday that an advanced version of its Gemini chatbot had solved five out of the six math problems set at the IMO, held in Australia's Queensland this month.",
      "\"We can confirm that Google DeepMind has reached the much-desired milestone, earning 35 out of a possible 42 points - a gold medal score,\" the U.S. tech giant cited IMO president Gregor Dolinar as saying. \"Their solutions were astonishing in many respects.

      "The result \"achieved a longstanding grand challenge in AI\" at \"the world's most prestigious math competition,\" OpenAI researcher Alexander Wei said in a social media post.",
      "\"We evaluated our models on the 2025 IMO problems under the same rules as human contestants,\" he said. \"For each problem, three former IMO medalists independently graded the model's submitted proof.\"",
      "Google achieved a silver-medal score at last year's IMO in the city of Bath, in southwest England, solving four of the six problems.",
      "That took two to three days of computation \u2014 far longer than this year, when its Gemini model solved the problems within the 4.5-hour time limit, it said.",
      "The IMO said tech companies had \"privately tested closed-source AI models on this year's problems,\" the same ones faced by 641 competing students from 112 countries.",

      "In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes earlier this year, one of Google's leading AI researchers predicted that within just five to 10 years, computers would be made that have human-level cognitive abilities \u2014 a landmark known as \"artificial general intelligence.\"",

      "\"It's moving incredibly fast,\" Hassabis said. \"I think we are on some kind of exponential curve of improvement. Of course, the success of the field in the last few years has attracted even more attention, more resources, more talent. So that's adding to the, to this exponential progress.\"",

Standing before Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett in a Los Angeles federal court, Plasencia said his legal team had \"considered everything\" when it came to the plea and subsequent sentencing.",
      "Prosecutors agreed to drop three additional counts against Plasencia in exchange for his guilty plea. He had been scheduled to go on trial next month alongside Jasveen Sangha, aka \"The Ketamine Queen.\"",

      "\"The guilty plea by Dr. Plasencia is significant because he is the second doctor to plead guilty in relation to Mr. Perry\u2019s death, and the plea sends a strong message to drug dealers, as well as doctors and members of the medical community, that prosecutors are paying close attention and will vigorously prosecute these types of cases,\" Alabre said.",

      "\"Typically, with a plea, the defendant will get much less prison time than the maximum, hence the agreement to plead guilty. Here, the maximum sentence is 40 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of at least $2 million. I would expect significantly less in all aspects. The punishment should be a warning to all physicians handling and distributing substances to do so with extreme care and humanity toward everyone, including those who are extremely wealthy and famous.\"",

      "Matthew Perry described using ketamine therapy in his memoir, \"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing.\" (Getty Images)",
      "\"The punishment does fit the crime because Plasencia did not provide the fatal dose of ketamine that killed Perry,\" Rahmani said. \"Perry's family could file a civil lawsuit, but they don't need the money, and even though Plasencia provided the supplies and training, that may not be enough to establish medical causation for a wrongful death case. Co-defendants Sangha, Fleming, and Iwamasa are more directly liable for Perry's death.\"",

      "Obesity among adults continues to be a major public health issue in the United States and other economically developed countries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).",
      "\"It's a mix of poor diet, high stress levels, lack of muscle and lack of frequent movement,\" Lindsay Allen, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Back in Balance Nutrition in Florida, told Fox News Digital.",
      "While both overeating and lack of exercise are often to blame, a new global study suggests that one factor far outweighs the other.",
      "YOUR DNA COULD BE STOPPING YOU FROM LOSING WEIGHT, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "Scientists studied more than 4,000 adults from 34 populations, ranging from hunter-gatherer communities to office workers.",
      "They analyzed each person\u2019s total energy expenditure (TEE), which is the number of calories burned daily, along with body fat percentage and BMI (body mass index).",
      "One dietitian says a mix of poor diet, high stress levels, lack of muscle and lack of frequent movement are behind rising obesity numbers. (iStock)",
      "When adjusted for body size, people across all lifestyles and income levels burned similar amounts of energy, even if their daily routines were drastically different.",
      "\"The differences in body fat that we see across populations likely aren't due to major differences in activity level or total daily energy burned,\" study authors Amanda McGrosky (from Elon University in North Carolina) and Amy Luke (Loyola University in Illinois) told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Rather, excess body fat is\u00a0likely\u00a0primarily the product of too many 'calories in,' or eating more calories than are burned.\"",
      "SCIENTISTS MAY HAVE DISCOVERED WHY THE POUNDS COME BACK AFTER LOSING WEIGHT",
      "People in more economically developed areas burned more calories, the researchers noted \u2014 but that\u2019s primarily because they tend to weigh more, and heavier bodies naturally burn more energy.",
      "Published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the study concluded that how much people eat plays a far greater role than the amount of exercise when it comes to putting on weight.",
      "The findings suggest that overeating is roughly 10 times more important than a lack of exercise in skyrocketing obesity rates. (iStock)",
      "\"Our analyses suggest that increased energy intake has been roughly 10 times more important than declining activity rates in driving the modern obesity crisis,\" the authors stated.",
      "Dr. Brett Osborn, a Florida neurosurgeon and longevity expert, agrees with the adage that \"you can\u2019t out-train a bad diet.\"",
      "\"Exercise burns far fewer calories than people want to believe,\" Osborn, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"We\u2019re not gaining weight because we stopped moving. We\u2019re gaining because we\u2019re overfed.\"",

      "Allen pointed out that muscle mass should also be considered.",
      "\"Having sufficient muscle is what drastically improves metabolism and fat-burning capabilities,\" she told Fox News Digital, also emphasizing the importance of stress levels. \"People\u00a0who live in high-stress societies tend to be fatter because stress hormones change our metabolism and shift us into 'survival mode.'\"",
      "SCIENTISTS CAN DETECT JUNK FOOD CONSUMPTION IN BLOOD AND URINE TESTS",
      "Another finding involves ultraprocessed foods (UPFs), which have long ingredient lists that are often calorie-dense, shelf-stable and \"highly palatable.\"",

      "Ultraprocessed foods are less likely to help people feel full, causing them to overeat, experts say. (iStock)",
      "Ultraprocessed foods tend to be easier to overeat due to their flavor and texture, and they also don't keep people feeling full, the study found.",
      "They are also more calorie-dense, meaning they pack more energy into smaller volumes, and are more easily absorbed, making it harder for the body to eliminate excess energy.",
      "\"Ultraprocessed foods are engineered to override our biology, namely our satiety signaling in the brain,\" Osborn told Fox News Digital. \"They also promote inflammation and shift our physiology to a state that favors fat accumulation over fat burning.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The researchers pointed out that physical activity is still important, particularly for cardiovascular health, mental well-being and longevity.",
      "Allen noted that people \"need to consider all the other benefits of exercise and shift the mindset away from how many calories they are burning (which actually doesn't work very well for weight loss) toward building as much strength and muscle as they can.\"",
      "People should consider the benefits of exercise beyond just weight loss, a researcher advised. (iStock)",
      "Osborn agreed, recommending \"progressively intense and challenging workouts\" \u2014 strength training in particular \u2014 to help boost the metabolic rate and facilitate fat-burning.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Boasberg weighs new allegations in the Trump administration&apos;s immigration case after blocking the administration&apos;s use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans.",
    "story": [
      "'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts break down the latest legal clashes over President Donald Trump's deportations of illegal immigrants.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg pressed Justice Department officials Thursday on the status and location of more than 250 U.S. migrants deported from CECOT to Venezuela, in an attempt to weigh what, if any, opportunities the court has to order their return.",
      "Boasberg has been at the center of the sweeping immigration case since March 15, when he issued an emergency order blocking the Trump administration\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime immigration law, to deport certain migrants to El Salvador. Despite the order, hundreds of migrants were deported to the Salvadorian prison, CECOT, in March, where they remained until last week, when they were sent from the prison in El Salvador to Venezuela, as part of a prisoner exchange with the U.S.",
      "Boasberg used Thursday\u2019s hearing to primarily focus on the status of the 252 Venezuelan migrants now in the custody of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government. He pressed ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt, who is representing the class of CECOT migrants, about whether they had been in contact with the individuals sent from CECOT to Venezuela and their current status.",
      "Gelernt said Thursday that while the migrants appear to be \"thrilled\" to be out of CECOT custody, which he described in court as a \"torture chamber,\" he said they have not been able to make contact with the majority of people who were detained for processing upon arrival in Venezuela.",
      "He also cited fresh concerns about their custodial status in the country, noting that \"many, if not most\" of the people deported from the U.S. to El Salvador in March had been in the U.S. seeking asylum from Venezuela.",
      "WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS?",

      "The Trump administration has not provided, as of this writing, a list of the migrants sent to CECOT in March, or details of their immigration status in the U.S. prior to removal.",
      "Justice Department lawyer Tiberius Davis told the court earlier Thursday that talks about the prisoner exchange began earlier this year, when Maduro reached out to Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to initiate discussions. The conversations abruptly stalled, he said, noting the two countries \"hate each other,\" and revived with the U.S. as an intermediary.",
      "That, he said, coupled with the fact that the 10 American prisoners released from Venezuela were sent to El Salvador, and then to the U.S., showed that the US \"does not have constructive custody.\" Boasberg did not press them for specifics.",
      "Boasberg did, however, attempt to gauge the government's compliance ahead of any future actions or rulings.",
      "Asked Thursday whether the Justice Department would comply with the court's orders, Davis said they would \"if it was a lawful order.\" They also said they would likely seek an appeal from a higher court.",
      "Boasberg signaled eagerness to move on further contempt proceedings. He took umbrage at the lack of action from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which had stayed his original motion in April.",
      "He ruled then that the court had found \"probable cause\" to hold the Trump administration in contempt for failing to return the planes to U.S. soil, in accordance with his emergency order, and said the court had determined that the Trump administration demonstrated a \"willful disregard\" for his order.",
      "On Thursday, he revisited this, noting that the claims made by former DOJ attorney and whistleblower Erez Reuveni have \"only strengthened the case for contempt.\"",
      "The hearing ultimately ended quickly, with Boasberg ordering the government and lawyers for the migrants to submit a joint status update to the court on Thursday, Aug. 7, and ordered them to continue to do so every two weeks thereafter until the court rules otherwise.",
      "In June, Boasberg ordered the Trump administration to provide all noncitizens deported from the U.S. to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador to be afforded the opportunity to seek habeas relief in court, and challenge their alleged gang status. That was also appealed to the higher court.",
      "Speaking to reporters outside the court on Thursday, ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt characterized the Trump administration's response during the status hearing as \"the least\" of what they should be expected to do to grant due process to the class of CECOT plaintiffs now in Venezuela.",
      "\"Given that there was a constitutional violation, it's remarkable that the United States government will not simply bring the individuals back without a court order,\" Gelernt told Fox News.",
      "\"I've been doing this work for more than 30 years,\" he said. \"It's hard for me to imagine any prior administration, Democrat or Republican, not agreeing to simply bring individuals back where there was constitutional violation and the individuals have suffered so much and are continuing to be in harm.\"",

      "President Donald Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi arrive to speak at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. (Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty)",
      "The brief hearing comes as Boasberg found himself at the center of Trump's ire and attacks on so-called \"activist\" judges this year, following his March 15\u00a0temporary restraining order that sought to block Trump\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act to quickly\u00a0deport hundreds of Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador earlier this year.",
      "Boasberg ordered all planes bound for El Salvador to be \"immediately\" returned to U.S. soil, which did not happen.",
      "The emergency order touched off a complex legal saga that ultimately spawned dozens of federal court challenges across the country \u2013 though the one brought before his court on March 15 was the very first \u2013 and later prompted the Supreme Court to rule, on two separate occasions, that the hurried removals had violated migrants' due process protections under the U.S. Constitution.",
      "Boasberg, as a result, has emerged as the man at the center of the legal fallout.",
      "While the order itself has been in a bit of a holding pattern \u2013 since the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stayed it when they agreed to review the ruling \u2013 Thursday's hearing may well revive the bitterly divisive court fight.",
      "Trump administration officials have repeatedly excoriated Boasberg as an \"activist judge\" \u2013 a term they have employed for judges who have either paused or blocked Trump's sweeping policy priorities enacted via executive order. Trump himself floated the idea that Boasberg could be impeached earlier this year \u2013 prompting Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to issue a rare public warning.",

    "story": [
      "The 126 MW Omkareshwar Floating Solar Park spans 642 acres, boosting green power. Kurt Knutsson reports on this innovative solution to global energy challenges.",
      "The world's first hybrid solar cargo ship has just launched in Germany, marking a major milestone for sustainable shipping. The Blue Marlin uses advanced solar technology not only to power its onboard systems but also to drive its main propulsion, setting a new standard for eco-friendly cargo transport. By combining solar panels with a diesel-electric system, this vessel is paving the way for cleaner, more efficient movement of goods along Germany's waterways.",

      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "How solar power moves the Blue Marlin",
      "The Blue Marlin uses 192 solar panels, which can generate up to 35 kilowatts in ideal conditions. That\u2019s enough to charge over 1,400 smartphones at the same time. Wattlab designed the solar system to supply electricity directly to the ship\u2019s propulsion system. Unlike earlier vessels, the Blue Marlin uses solar energy for movement, not just for basic onboard functions. When conditions allow, the ship can run on solar power alone for short trips. For example, it can do this when traveling downstream with a light load.",
      "Hybrid technology for reliable shipping",
      "The Blue Marlin also relies on four diesel generators. This hybrid setup lets the vessel switch between solar and diesel-electric power as needed. As a result, the ship stays reliable in any weather. An automated energy management system controls how power is distributed. This system sends energy exactly where it is needed. It also reduces unnecessary fuel use, which helps the environment. In addition, the ship uses a technique called peak shaving. During high energy demand, it draws on solar and battery reserves instead of starting extra generators. This strategy lowers emissions and keeps the operation smooth.",
      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "The Blue Martin is well suited for Germany\u2019s waterways",
      "The Blue Marlin measures approximately 282 feet in length and 31 feet in width, with a shallow draft of just 3 feet 7 inches, making it well suited for Germany's canal network. Its hull was constructed in Romania and later outfitted with systems in the Netherlands. Today, the fully completed vessel operates out of Cologne, Germany. SEAFAR remote navigation technology is another feature; this system allows remote-controlled operation on select routes, improving safety and reducing the workload for the crew.",
      "The Blue Marlin\u2019s environmental impact and design benefits",
      "Each year, the Blue Marlin's solar array can generate up to 37,500 kilowatt-hours of electricity. This output helps prevent about 79,000 pounds of CO\u2082 emissions annually. Thanks to its modular design, the ship can connect with push barges and carry up to 3,430 short tons of bulk goods efficiently. Its hybrid diesel-electric system is also designed to run on cleaner fuels in the future, making it adaptable as greener energy options become more available.",
      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Blue Marlin is more than a technological showcase. By fully integrating solar power with intelligent hybrid systems, it proves that performance and environmental responsibility can work together. This vessel stands as a practical example of cleaner shipping solutions. It offers lessons and inspiration for the future of cargo transport around the world.",

    "story": [
      "Microsoft announces the first handheld Xbox device, and it\u2019s primed to take on Nintendo\u2019s best-selling Switch 2.",
      "Windows 11 has had poor adoption, with many people sticking to the good old Windows 10. Microsoft has been pushing users to upgrade, threatening to end software support and warning about potential cybersecurity risks. But Windows 11 isn\u2019t exactly the best OS to come out of Redmond. Even if it were, many people simply can\u2019t upgrade because of its steep system requirements.",
      "In fact, it took Windows 11 nearly four years after its 2021 debut to finally surpass its predecessor in user numbers. Now that Windows 10 is being phased out, many users, especially those with older PCs that don't meet the hardware requirements, are understandably concerned. Tony from Wisconsin recently asked us the same thing:",
      "\"I heard that Microsoft will stop providing security patches for Windows 10 after October. My laptop can't be upgraded to Windows 11 because the CPU is too old. Since I'm not tech-savvy and don't feel comfortable replacing the CPU (nor do I want to), I'm wondering if I have a good antivirus program, do I still need to upgrade? Or will my system still be vulnerable to hackers and viruses?\"",
      "I understand your concern, Tony. Sticking with an unsupported OS brings security risks. Security researchers warn that unsupported systems, such as Windows 10, will become increasingly attractive targets for hackers. Hackers often reverse-engineer patches released for newer systems like Windows 11 to find similar flaws in older ones like Windows 10. With no more fixes coming, those vulnerabilities remain wide open, making unsupported systems a tempting target.",
      "However, you are not without options, and you have a defense. Let's walk through what you can do if your PC is still running Windows 10.",

      "Image showing Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Windows 11 finally surpasses Windows 10 in market share: Here's why it took so long",
      "According to Statcounter, Windows 11 has finally overtaken Windows 10 in terms of desktop and laptop usage as of early July. The newer OS now accounts for 52 percent of all Windows installations, up sharply from just under 48 percent in June. In the same period, Windows 10 dropped from 53.2 percent to 44.6 percent. Interestingly, Windows 7 still holds a small but notable presence, with 2.35 percent of users refusing to let it go.",
      "This shift comes nearly four years after Microsoft announced Windows 11 in June 2021. From the start, it was criticized for strict hardware rules. It required a TPM 2.0 chip and newer processors. Many functional PCs were left unable to upgrade.\u00a0 The operating system also introduced a revamped user interface that some users found unnecessary or confusing, leading to a slow adoption rate.",
      "A man typing on a Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happens when Windows 10 support ends in 2025? Here's what you need to know",
      "Windows 10 is reaching the end of its official support on October 14, 2025. That means Microsoft will stop releasing new features and routine security updates for the general public. For most users, this marks the end of the road, unless they take specific steps to keep receiving updates.",
      "To extend security updates beyond this deadline, Microsoft is offering a program called Extended Security Updates (ESU). Normally, this would cost $30 per year for personal users. However, Microsoft is making the first year free if you back up your PC using the Windows Backup app and sync your settings to OneDrive, or if you redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.",
      "Microsoft hasn't disclosed pricing beyond the first year, so it's unclear whether the $30/year rate will remain the same in 2026 and 2027.",
      "If you don't opt into either of those methods, you'll need to pay the $30 to continue receiving critical patches through October 2026. This is especially relevant for those who can't upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations.",
      "Even after general support ends, Microsoft will keep updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows 10 until October 2028. So while full system security updates will stop for most, basic malware protection will continue for a few more years.",
      "Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can't upgrade to Windows 11? 8 Safe alternatives for Windows 10 users in 2025",
      "You can continue using Windows 10 until October 14, 2025, with full access to regular security and stability updates. After that, you can extend protection by enrolling in Microsoft's Extended Security Updates program. The first year is free if you use the Windows Backup app to sync your settings to OneDrive, or if you redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.",
      "If your computer meets the hardware requirements for Windows 11, upgrading is the easiest long-term solution. You\u2019ll get access to ongoing feature updates, improved security, and long-term support through at least 2031.",
      "Google offers a free operating system called ChromeOS Flex, designed for older PCs and laptops. It\u2019s based on the same system used in Chromebooks and focuses on speed, simplicity, and security. However, it doesn\u2019t support Android apps or some hardware features like fingerprint readers and may not work for tasks like video editing or gaming.. This can be a great option if you mostly use web apps like Gmail, Google Docs, or Zoom.",
      "Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or Zorin OS provide a stable and user-friendly experience, especially for those coming from Windows. You can use them on older hardware without any licensing fees, and they come with access to thousands of free applications. While there may be a bit of a learning curve, many users find Linux reliable and surprisingly easy to adapt to for everyday tasks like browsing, writing, and media playback.",
      "If your current system can\u2019t handle Windows 11 and you are not interested in alternatives like ChromeOS or Linux, investing in a new computer may be the most straightforward path. New devices come with Windows 11 pre-installed and are built to support it fully. This ensures you\u2019ll continue to receive updates, features, and support for several years without additional effort.",

      "If you decide to stick with Windows 10 beyond its official support period, having strong third-party antivirus protection becomes even more important. While Microsoft Defender will continue receiving updates until 2028, it may not be enough on its own once the system stops getting core security patches. Installing a reputable antivirus program can help protect your device from malware, phishing, and other threats.",

      "The end of Windows 10 support isn\u2019t a crisis, but it does require action. You should start planning your next move now. Consider upgrading to a newer version of Windows. You could also switch to a different operating system. Another option is investing in stronger security tools. And be on alert: as Windows 10\u2019s end-of-life nears, scammers will take advantage. Watch out for phone calls, emails, or pop-ups pretending to be from Microsoft offering \"urgent upgrade help.\" Microsoft doesn\u2019t call users out of the blue\u2014these are scams trying to steal your personal info or install malware.

This method sends a small, painless electrical current through your bicep and measures how easily that current flows through your tissue. Because water is a good conductor of electricity, well-hydrated tissue lets the current pass easily. When you're dehydrated, your tissues resist the current, and the sensor detects that.

For firefighters or police officers wearing heavy gear in scorching temperatures, it offers a way to stay safe on the job. Even office workers who forget to drink water during long meetings could benefit from a reminder when their hydration levels drop. The researchers believe the wearable hydration sensor could also play a major role in health care. Patients with kidney problems or cardiovascular issues often need to monitor hydration closely. Until now, that meant invasive tests or relying on symptoms. This sensor could make hydration tracking simple, accurate, and non-invasive.",
      "The science behind the hydration sensor",
      "To make sure the sensor really works, the research team ran controlled experiments. They had participants take a diuretic to promote fluid loss and tracked hydration using the sensor. At the same time, they collected urine samples to confirm results. The sensor's data closely matched the chemical markers in the samples. That means the technology is not only accurate, but it can also be trusted even during normal daily activities like walking or working. Study co-author Matija Jankovic explained that arm bioimpedance was highly sensitive to changes in hydration. It also aligned with whole-body hydration, making it a reliable alternative to traditional testing.",
      "Rigid PCB and commercial gel electrode system. (University of Texas at Austin)",
      "Traditional hydration tests fall short",
      "Standard ways of checking hydration, like urine tests or blood work, are time-consuming and not practical for everyday use. Some commercial tools already exist, but they tend to be bulky or require users to stay in one spot. They're just not built for real life. That's where this sensor has the edge. It's compact, portable, and constantly running in the background. It works while you move, exercise, or even just sit at your desk.",
      "What's next for hydration tracking",
      "Right now, the sensor tracks relative changes in hydration, which is a powerful tool on its own. But the research team wants to take it further. They plan to collect data from a larger population to create baseline values for absolute hydration levels. This step would make the device even more accurate and personal. They're also exploring new wearable designs, such as breathable e-tattoos and sweat-wicking sensors, that could offer better comfort and longer wear. Future models might track hydration in other areas of the body, like the forearm or thigh. The team is optimistic that these innovations will make hydration tracking even more seamless and accessible. Lead researcher Nanshu Lu, who has worked on similar wearable health tech in the past, says this is only the beginning. Her vision is to bring simple, real-time hydration tracking to everyone, no matter their lifestyle or profession.",
      "A woman sweating during a workout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Staying hydrated just got a whole lot easier. With a wearable hydration sensor, you no longer have to rely on guesswork or vague reminders to drink water. Whether you're powering through a workout, focused on a demanding job, or just caught up in a busy day, this device keeps tabs on your hydration status in real time. That means you get clear, instant feedback-before dehydration slows you down.",
      "While this technology is still in the research and development phase, the early results are promising. It's not yet available to the public, but the groundwork is in place. Once it moves into production, this kind of real-time hydration tracking could become a part of daily life, helping you stay healthier, more alert, and ahead of the curve.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Dehydration isn't always obvious, but it can quickly become serious. The wearable hydration sensor puts the power to monitor your health back in your hands. It's accurate, non-invasive, and built for daily life. Whether you're training for a marathon or just trying to stay sharp at work, knowing your hydration status in real time could make all the difference.",

      "What is the coffee ring effect, and why does it matter in science?",
      "Ever wondered why spilled coffee, wine or tea dries in a ring rather than evenly? This common pattern is known as the \"coffee ring effect.\" The phenomenon occurs because of the liquid's surface tension. As the drop begins to dry, water at the edges evaporates more quickly since that area is thinner. To keep up, liquid from the center flows outward, carrying tiny particles with it. Once the drop is completely dry, these particles settle along the edge, creating the signature ring stain you see on tables and countertops every day.",

      "Scientific diagram explaining the coffee ring effect in new at-home diagnostics. (UC Berkeley)",
      "How the coffee ring effect led to a breakthrough in at-home medical testing",
      "Surprisingly, that annoying coffee ring on your table has inspired a major breakthrough in medical technology. Researchers at UC Berkeley transformed this everyday nuisance into a powerful new at-home diagnostic test. This innovative test can identify diseases like COVID-19, prostate cancer and sepsis with remarkable accuracy. In fact, it is up to 100 times more sensitive than many current rapid tests. Even better, it delivers results in just twelve minutes, depending on the test.",
      "The idea began with Kamyar Behrouzi, a former Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. While developing a COVID-19 biosensor in 2020, he noticed that virus particles, much like coffee particles, tend to gather at the edge of a droplet. By using this natural effect, the researchers designed a test that captures and concentrates disease markers, making detection much easier. Thanks to this stain-inspired science, fast and reliable testing is now possible right at home.",

      "How this coffee-inspired test detects COVID-19, sepsis, and more",
      "So, how does this innovative test actually work? First, you place a small sample from your nose or cheek onto a special membrane. As the sample dries, disease proteins concentrate at the edges to form a visible ring. Next, you add a second droplet containing light-reactive particles. If certain disease biomarkers are present, these nanoparticles light up when exposed to light. You can see positive results with the naked eye in some cases, or verify them more accurately using a special AI-powered smartphone app.",
      "This rapid test does more than detect COVID-19. It can also identify early signs of sepsis, a life-threatening infection that needs quick treatment. To make home testing accessible, the UC Berkeley team even created a 3D-printed prototype for easy use on your kitchen counter. According to professor Liwei Lin, this innovative approach could transform regular health screening, with no lab visit required.",

      "Kicking a ball or climbing stairs with ease after a leg amputation above the knee is now within reach. Researchers at MIT have developed a bionic knee that redefines mobility for above-the-knee amputees. Unlike traditional socket-based prosthetics, this system anchors directly to the bone and integrates with the surrounding muscle tissue. The result is faster, smoother, and more natural movement.",
      "Led by Professor Hugh Herr, the MIT team created a solution that doesn't just mimic motion, it responds to intent. This level of control allows the prosthesis to move in sync with the body, delivering a seamless experience that challenges the very definition of artificial limbs.",

      "A man kicking a ball while wearing the e-OPRA bionic knee prosthesis. (MIT)",
      "How the e-OPRA bionic knee for amputees works",
      "The tech is called e-OPRA (Enhanced Osseointegrated Prostheses for the Rehabilitation of Amputees). It involves surgically implanting a titanium rod into the femur, which connects directly to a robotic prosthetic limb. This rod becomes the foundation of a new kind of interface between the body and machine. But it doesn't stop there.",
      "Using a specialized surgical technique known as Agonist-Antagonist Myoneural Interface (AMI), muscles are reconnected in functional pairs. These muscles \"talk\" to each other, sending signals to the robotic controller, which calculates exactly how the knee should move, mirroring how a real leg works.",
      "Natural movement restored with the bionic knee for amputees",
      "In trials, two patients with this integrated system not only performed better, but they also felt better. They moved faster, climbed stairs with more ease, and avoided obstacles with greater confidence. Most importantly, they felt like the prosthetic was part of their body.",
      "One participant with only a few inches of thigh remaining could walk, pivot, and even kick a ball smoothly. This kind of intuitive, natural movement is a game-changer for above-the-knee amputees.",
      "Illustration of a new e-OPRA bionic knee that can help people with above-the-knee amputations. (MIT)",
      "Why the bionic knee for amputees is a major breakthrough",
      "Traditional socket-based prosthetics can be uncomfortable, unstable, and prone to infections. They often feel foreign, like a tool strapped to the body rather than a part of it. The bionic knee bypasses the socket altogether. By connecting directly to bone and muscle, it improves load-bearing, reduces skin problems, and most importantly, restores a sense of control. And control isn't just physical, it's emotional and psychological. Patients using the e-OPRA system reported a greater sense of agency and body ownership than those with traditional or partially-integrated prosthetics.",
      "MIT's bionic knee for amputees driven by lived experience",
      "Professor Hugh Herr isn't just leading the research; he's living it. After losing both legs below the knee to frostbite in his teens, he returned to mountain climbing and dedicated his career to advancing prosthetic technology. His personal journey powers a lab at MIT that continues to push the boundaries of biomechatronics. And now, that journey may change the lives of above-the-knee amputees worldwide.",
      "A man kicking balls while wearing the e-OPRA bionic knee prosthesis. (MIT)",
      "When the bionic knee for amputees will be available",
      "While the results are groundbreaking, the e-OPRA system isn't on the market yet. Larger clinical trials and FDA approval are still ahead. Herr estimates that within five years, this technology could become more accessible to patients.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "We're witnessing the future of\u00a0prosthetics unfold. The bionic knee developed by MIT doesn't just restore function, it redefines it. By merging advanced robotics with the human nervous system, it offers amputees something priceless: the feeling that their body is whole again.",

      "Photo showing fentanyl pills seized at the U.S. border. (Elizabeth Denis/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID detects drugs faster than swab tests",
      "This portable air scanner, created at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is being brought to market by California-based instrument maker BaySpec. The device works by pulling in air and identifying molecules in real time using a miniature mass spectrometer.",
      "Unlike traditional swab tests that take five to thirty minutes, VaporID detects fentanyl in seconds, even at levels as low as six parts per trillion. That's like spotting a single pine needle in an entire forest.",
      "Why drug dogs may soon be outmatched by VaporID",
      "For decades, trained canines have been the gold standard at ports of entry. But dogs have limits; they tire, need handlers, and can't be reprogrammed with software updates. VaporID, on the other hand, never needs a nap. It can detect not only known drugs but also fentanyl analogs, lab-made variants designed to skirt detection.",
      "The system's cutting-edge design includes an atmospheric flow tube that allows tiny drug molecules more time to interact with charged ions. That chemical dance dramatically boosts sensitivity, making it possible to detect even the most elusive threats.",
      "During a real-world field trial at the Nogales, Arizona border crossing, the device detected trace amounts of several drugs, including fentanyl and cocaine, within seconds inside a Customs and Border Protection lab.",
      "Illustration of the action within the atmospheric flow tube that is a key to the detection of trace levels of fentanyl. (Sara Levine/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID works: Air, ions, and instant answers",
      "VaporID weighs about 40 pounds and draws in ambient air like a miniature vacuum. Suspicious molecules are filtered, tagged with electrically charged ions, and passed into a tiny mass spectrometer. Only the relevant particles make it through. This process filters out background interfering vapors from things like perfumes or cleaning agents, giving border agents a clear, accurate, and immediate read on potentially dangerous substances.",
      "What VaporID means for border security",
      "If deployed widely, VaporID could revolutionize how U.S. Customs and Border Protection detects narcotics and explosives. Its fast, hands-free scanning would help agents screen vehicles, cargo, luggage, and even people, without relying solely on canine units or invasive sampling.",
      "The device's sensitivity also opens doors for use beyond borders. The Department of Homeland Security is already working with PNNL and BaySpec to adapt the technology for mail screening, airport baggage checks, and large-scale cargo inspections.",
      "For materials like TNT (trinitrotoluene) and PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate), both powerful explosives that release very few molecules into the air, VaporID's ultra-sensitive detection provides a level of protection that's long been out of reach with current methods.",
      "Chemist Elizabeth Denis uses the PNNL system to check a substance in the laboratory. (Andrea Starr/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "VaporID\u2019s role in combating drug and explosive smuggling",
      "The U.S. is facing a deadly influx of synthetic opioids. According to the CDC, over 80,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2024, including approximately 48,400 deaths linked to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Fast, contactless detection at ports of entry could help choke off the supply chain before these deadly substances ever hit the streets. And in an era of rising geopolitical tensions, having a portable scanner that can also detect explosives could be a critical layer in national defense.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Technology doesn\u2019t just assist border agents anymore; it\u2019s starting to outperform their most trusted tools. VaporID brings speed, precision, and reliability to a job where seconds count. While drug-sniffing dogs have served well, this portable air scanner may soon lead the front line in detecting threats. As agencies prepare to roll out the system, one thing is clear. The future of border security doesn\u2019t bark. It beeps.",

Both allow it to perform seven varied medical procedures using a remote control operated by a human using foot pedals, HTC Vive trackers, and motion-capture cameras.",
      "These tasks the robot carried out ranged from physical exams like auscultation and palpation, to emergency procedures such as Bag Valve Mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation. Some of them even required a great deal of precision, like ultrasound-guided injections.",
      "There were some challenges with force control and sensor sensitivity, but the robot managed to carry out most tasks given to it with accuracy.",
      "The Unitree G1 humanoid robot performing an ultrasound. (UCSD ARCLAB)",
      "Medical robot trial results show strong potential for hospital use",
      "For examinations, it successfully used a stethoscope and performed basic physical examinations. In these tests, performance was hindered by limitations in sensor feedback and hand design. For emergency care, it achieved consistent ventilation. However, it required human assistance to maintain the necessary seal and force required for intubation.",
      "When it came to needle procedures, it performed ultrasound-guided injections. It achieved a 70% success rate when performed by non-clinicians, demonstrating its potential for training purposes. Trials showed issues with needle control and orientation during suturing, indicating that the haptic feedback mechanisms need improvement.",

      "How humanoid robots could transform healthcare and hospital staffing",
      "This is the first major study to add humanoid robots to hospital work systems. With aging populations and ongoing labor shortages, these adaptable robots could support routine and emergency tasks in hospital settings. This robot could take immense pressure off medical staff. The versatility and ability to be remotely controlled make it particularly appealing for settings that require rapid response and tools that can carry out a wide range of tasks.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you've ever waited too long in an ER, struggled to book a specialist appointment, or worried about overworked healthcare providers, this research should catch your attention. Humanoid robots like the Unitree G1 aren't replacing doctors, but they could support them in real, practical ways. From performing emergency procedures in remote areas to helping with routine physical exams in crowded hospitals, these robots could ease bottlenecks and improve care access.",
      "For patients, that could mean shorter wait times, faster treatment, and safer hospital environments where medical teams are less stretched. For families in rural or underserved areas, this technology could offer critical care support where medical staff is limited. And for healthcare workers, it could bring much-needed relief by taking on repetitive or physically taxing tasks.",
      "While the tech is still evolving, these early results suggest a future where hospitals have robotic teammates, not just tools, helping deliver faster, smarter care.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While humanoid robots like the Unitree G1 are not ready to fully replace humans, they're steadily proving how capable they are in medical environments. The researchers just need to solve issues like force control, sensitivity, and dexterity. Once they do, we will see these robots in operating rooms around the world assisting with surgeries. They will make our struggling healthcare systems far more resilient and accessible.",

      "Kinisi built KR1 to thrive in real-world industrial environments. The robot has two arms and hands, which allow it to lift items weighing up to 22 pounds. Thanks to its strong structure and careful engineering, KR1 can retrieve items from high shelves and handle breakable products without damage. It performs these tasks using a wheeled base that allows for smooth, agile movement across standard warehouse floors. Kinisi intentionally avoided complex legged systems to simplify setup and improve stability. KR1 can operate for up to eight hours on a single charge. It features hot-swappable batteries and an auto-docking system that allows for fast recharging with minimal human intervention. These features make it ideal for continuous use in busy fulfillment centers where downtime costs money.",

      "AI-powered warehouse robot learns tasks on the fly",
      "KR1 doesn't just move intelligently, it learns. Kinisi equipped the robot with built-in AI that allows it to adapt in real time to its surroundings. It recognizes obstacles, modifies its arm movement and executes precise trajectories even as the warehouse layout changes. This means workers don't need to reprogram the system each time workflows shift. One of KR1's most impressive features is its ability to learn from demonstration. Warehouse staff can guide the robot through a task once, and KR1 can replicate it accurately without complex coding. This speeds up onboarding and makes it easy to scale up operations. In a recent demo video, KR1 moved across a warehouse floor on its own. It approached various shelving units, selected a range of items, and placed them into totes with deliberate and smooth movements. It then transported the loaded containers to the correct location, all while avoiding obstacles and adjusting to its environment in real time.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "This robot works offline without relying on cloud computing",
      "While many robots rely on cloud computing, Kinisi took a different approach. KR1 processes data locally, which means it can function reliably even in environments with weak or unstable internet connections. Local processing also improves response times and enhances data privacy. This design ensures KR1 continues working even during network disruptions. It also allows the robot to make split-second decisions, which is essential in fast-paced warehouses.",

In addition to streamlining warehouse fulfillment, KR1 is built to assist with tasks in retail stocking, light manufacturing, and maintenance work. Kinisi developed the robot to blend into existing workflows, which eliminates the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades. Because the robot combines physical strength with the ability to learn, it can handle repetitive tasks that require both accuracy and endurance. As a result, companies can reduce labor costs, improve workplace safety and increase operational flexibility.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",

      "A team of academic researchers has uncovered a new Android security exploit that raises a lot of questions about the platform\u2019s permission system. The technique, named TapTrap, uses user interface animations to visually deceive you into granting sensitive permissions or performing harmful actions. Unlike earlier tapjacking attacks, TapTrap Android attack works by launching transparent system prompts over regular app interfaces. The result is a near-invisible layer that silently captures your taps and interactions.",

      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the TapTrap Android exploit tricks you into granting permissions",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, TapTrap takes advantage of how Android handles activity transitions between apps. A malicious app can launch a system-level screen using the standard start Activity function but modify how the screen appears using a custom animation. By setting both the start and end opacity to a very low value, such as 0.01, the activity becomes nearly invisible to the user.",
      "Touch input is still fully registered by the transparent screen, even though users only see the visible app underneath. Attackers can also apply a scaling animation that enlarges a specific user interface element, such as a permission button, so that it fills the screen. This increases the chance that a user will unknowingly tap the button.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The researchers released a video showing how this technique could be used in a gaming app to quietly launch a Chrome browser permission prompt. The prompt asks for camera access, and the user taps \"Allow\" without realizing what they have done. Because the malicious screen is transparent, there are no visual cues to suggest anything suspicious is happening.",
      "Image of an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why 76% of Android apps are vulnerable to TapTrap",
      "To assess how widespread the vulnerability might be, the researchers tested nearly 100,000 apps from the Play Store. About 76% were found to be potentially vulnerable, not because they are malicious, but because they lack key safeguards. These apps had at least one screen that could be launched by another app, shared the same task stack, failed to override the default transition animation, and did not block user input during the transition.",
      "Android enables these animations by default. Users can only disable them through settings that are typically hidden, such as Developer Options or Accessibility menus. Even the latest Android version, tested on a Google Pixel 8a, remains unprotected against this exploit.",
      "GrapheneOS, a security-focused operating system based on Android, confirmed that its current version is also affected. However, it plans to release a fix in its next update.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Google has acknowledged the issue and said a future Android update will contain a mitigation. While no exact timeline has been announced, Google is expected to change how input and animations are handled to prevent invisible tap interception.",
      "The company added that developers must follow strict Play Store policies and that any app found abusing this vulnerability will face enforcement actions.",
      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4 ways you can stay safe from TapTrap attack",
      "1) Consider a mobile security app:\u00a0Use a trusted antivirus or mobile security app that can detect suspicious behavior or alert you to apps using overlays or accessibility features improperly.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "2) Be selective about the apps you install:\u00a0Avoid installing apps just because they\u2019re trending or have flashy ads. Check developer credibility, recent reviews and app permissions before downloading.",
      "3) Stick to the Google Play Store:\u00a0While not perfect, the Play Store has better safeguards than random APK sources. Avoid installing apps from third-party stores or unknown websites.",
      "4) Pause before granting permissions:\u00a0If an app suddenly asks for access to your camera, microphone, or other sensitive features, take a moment. Always ask yourself if this app really needs this permission right now.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "TapTrap shows that security threats do not always come from complex code or aggressive malware. Sometimes, small oversights in visual behavior can open paths for serious abuse. In this case, the danger lies in what users do not see. People trust what they can see on their screens. This attack breaks that link by creating a visual mismatch between intent and outcome.",

      "What is Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI project?",
      "Starfish is a multi-year initiative built around generative AI. According to an internal Amazon document obtained by Business Insider, the system gathers product data from across the web, including external websites and images. It then uses large language models (LLMs) to create \"complete, correct and consistent\" product listings. This isn't a small update. Amazon expects Starfish to boost sales by $7.5 billion in 2025 alone by improving conversion rates and expanding product variety.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How Amazon is using AI to improve product listings",
      "Starfish builds on earlier AI tools that Amazon began testing in 2023. These tools could:",

      "Automatically generate product images and video ads",
      "Fill in missing data for third-party listings",
      "Rewrite product titles, bullet points and descriptions to be more relevant",
      "Now, with Starfish, Amazon wants to scale that effort across millions of listings. The AI will also collect data from 200,000 external brand websites by crawling, scraping and mapping their content to Amazon's catalog. It's not yet clear whether Amazon's own web crawler, Amazonbot, is powering Starfish. But the company confirmed to Business Insider that Starfish is already supporting its new \"Buy for Me\" feature. This feature recommends products from external websites and lets shoppers buy them directly within Amazon's app.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Amazon built the Starfish AI for marketplace listings",
      "Manually creating product listings is slow and often inconsistent. That's a problem when Amazon wants to offer a massive selection with reliable information. If shoppers can't find what they're looking for, or if the listings are vague, they may head elsewhere. Starfish addresses this by automating the tedious parts of listing creation. That helps sellers spend less time writing and more time selling. For Amazon, better listings mean higher conversion rates and happier customers. Plus, this move positions Amazon to compete more directly with Google Shopping, which also aims to be a central hub for product information.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI is expanding globally",
      "Amazon is testing Starfish's effectiveness with A/B comparisons, measuring sales performance of AI-enriched listings versus standard ones. It's also rolling out bulk listing tools and preparing to expand the system globally. This isn't just about improving Amazon's website. It's about changing the way product information is gathered, created and shared at scale.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does this mean for you as an Amazon shopper or seller",
      "If you're a shopper on Amazon, this could mean faster access to clearer, more accurate product listings, especially for obscure or hard-to-find items. As Amazon's AI fills in missing details and improves titles and descriptions, the results should help you make better decisions with less research.",
      "For sellers, this streamlines the work of creating listings. If you've struggled to write compelling descriptions or keep up with Amazon's catalog standards, the Starfish project may do much of the heavy lifting. That could save time, reduce errors and improve sales performance.",
      "However, there are some trade-offs. As Amazon scrapes more data from across the web to power its listings, brands and smaller websites may worry about how their product information is being used. And if AI-generated content becomes widespread, quality and trust in listings may vary depending on how well the system works.",
      "In short, expect a more automated Amazon shopping experience, with both conveniences and questions about how your data and the broader web are being used to power it.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Amazon's Starfish project signals a major shift in how e-commerce works. By combining web scraping, AI models and deep integration into its Marketplace, Amazon hopes to automate one of the most time-consuming parts of online selling. For buyers and sellers, this could mean more convenience and better results. But it also raises important questions about transparency, data ownership and the future role of AI in shaping what we see online.",

      "3. Use devices in low-risk areas:\u00a0Since these attacks require close proximity, avoid using Bluetooth audio devices in crowded or unfamiliar public places where someone nearby could exploit vulnerabilities.",
      "4. Pair devices with trusted sources only:\u00a0Avoid pairing your Bluetooth headphones with unfamiliar phones, computers or public terminals. Once paired, those devices can sometimes maintain a connection or reestablish one without your knowledge, increasing the risk of abuse if they're compromised.",

      "Researchers at the China Building Materials Academy (CBMA) and their partners designed the material to weigh just 12.5 pounds per cubic foot. That's about one-tenth the weight of standard concrete. Its strength comes from a network of microscopic bubbles, each coated with a special maleated rosin. This structure allows the foam to crush in a controlled way and cushion even the heaviest aircraft.",

      "An airliner taking off \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why traditional runway safety systems fall short",
      "The most dangerous parts of any flight are takeoff and landing. To reduce risk, airports use Runway End Safety Areas (RESAs). These zones are meant to stop planes that overshoot the runway. In the past, airports used sand, soil, grass, or water pools for this purpose. But each of these materials has serious drawbacks.",
      "Soil becomes unstable in wet or freezing conditions. Water can freeze in winter and attract wildlife, creating new hazards. Sand and grass don't always perform well, especially with heavier aircraft. These weaknesses have made it clear that airports need a more reliable and consistent safety solution.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How marshmallow concrete works: The science behind the softness",
      "Marshmallow concrete is engineered with a precise strength between 0.30 and 0.35 megapascals. If it's too strong, it won't crush and absorb energy. If it's too weak, it won't slow the plane. The research team compared the process to blowing bubbles into a concrete mix. These bubbles create the soft, crushable texture that helps stop a plane during an emergency.",
      "To make the bubbles strong enough to last until impact, the team used a special air-entraining agent. This forms a tough coating around each bubble. As a result, the material stays intact until an aircraft overruns the runway, then it collapses at the right moment to maximize safety.",
      "An airliner coming in for a landing (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Durability and cost benefits of marshmallow concrete for airports",
      "Unlike some international systems that rely on expensive calcium sulfoaluminate cement, marshmallow concrete uses ordinary cement, making it far more affordable for airports, especially those with limited budgets. The team also developed a two-stage strength-control system that helps the material adapt to harsh climates and maintain consistent performance throughout the year.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Real-world data from 14 airports in China, including one in the challenging climate of Tibet, show that the material's properties fluctuated by just three percent over a year. This result is well below the design tolerance of ten percent, which means airports can depend on the material to perform reliably, regardless of the weather.",
      "A China Building Materials Academy researcher at work\u00a0 (CBMA)",
      "Marshmallow concrete airport safety: The future standard?",
      "With its unique combination of low cost, environmental resilience, and life-saving performance, marshmallow concrete is poised to become the new global standard for runway safety. The material has already been installed at 14 Chinese airports, where it has demonstrated consistent and reliable performance even in extreme conditions. As more airports seek affordable ways to enhance safety, marshmallow concrete offers a promising solution that can save lives and reduce costs worldwide.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you fly in the U.S., whether for business, vacation, or visiting family, marshmallow concrete could soon make your journeys safer. While this breakthrough is currently being used at airports in China, its performance is turning heads worldwide, including among U.S. aviation experts looking for better runway safety solutions.",
      "Runway overruns don\u2019t happen often in the United States, but when they do, the consequences can be deadly. Think of high-traffic airports like LAX, JFK, or Atlanta, where a single overrun can disrupt thousands of flights and put lives at risk. Marshmallow concrete offers a low-cost, highly effective safety upgrade that could prevent these incidents or dramatically reduce their severity.",
      "The best part? This isn't some billion-dollar overhaul. Because it uses standard cement and is designed to work in all kinds of weather, including harsh winters and extreme heat, it\u2019s a practical option for airports from Maine to Arizona. That means even smaller regional airports across the U.S. could benefit.",
      "You may never see this material, but it could be quietly protecting your flight behind the scenes, ready to absorb impact and bring a plane to a safe stop if something goes wrong. As U.S. airport authorities and the FAA explore more innovative, more cost-effective ways to modernize infrastructure, marshmallow concrete could be one of the safest bets in American aviation's future.",

      "Marshmallow concrete is changing the way airports think about safety. By combining strength, flexibility, and affordability, this new material offers airports a smarter way to protect passengers and crews.

      "Ceasefire negotiations between Israel and the Hamas terrorist organization hit a setback Thursday, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recalled Israel\u2019s negotiating delegation from Doha following what officials described as a hardening of Hamas\u2019 demands.",
      "\"In light of the response Hamas delivered this morning, it has been decided to recall the negotiating team for further consultations in Israel,\" the Prime Minister\u2019s Office said in a statement. \"We appreciate the efforts of the mediators, Qatar and Egypt, and the efforts of envoy Steve Witkoff to achieve a breakthrough in the talks.\"",
      "According to reports in Israeli media, the terror group is now demanding the release of 200 Palestinians serving life sentences for murdering Israelis, and an additional 2,000 Palestinians detained in Gaza after Oct. 7.

      "\"The return of the delegation is not a collapse or a crisis, but the gaps are significant and present across all core issues,\" a senior Israeli official told Channel 12. Another official confirmed to U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff that Hamas\u2019 updated prisoner exchange terms are \"unacceptable.\"",
      "A joint statement by 25 countries condemning Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza may have further complicated already fragile ceasefire negotiations, Israeli officials suggested.

      "\"Israel rejects the joint statement published by a group of countries, as it is disconnected from reality and sends the wrong message to Hamas.\" The ministry added that \"all statements and all claims should be directed at the only party responsible for the lack of a deal for the release of hostages and a ceasefire: Hamas, which started this war and is prolonging it.\"",
      "Hostage families expressed deep concern about the breakdown in negotiations. \"The families are watching with concern as reports emerge about the negotiating team\u2019s return,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. \"Every day that passes endangers the hostages\u2019 chances of recovery and the ability to locate the dead.

      "Following last month's announcement that the majority of NATO's 32 members had agreed to increase defense spending to hit 5% of each nation's GDP, Trump drew headlines after he drastically changed his tone and declared the alliance was no longer a \"rip-off.\" But his previously tough stance saw undeniable results in how the security group operates.",
      "\"Trump has changed the game,\" Peter Doran, an expert on Russia, Ukraine, and transatlantic relations, and an adjunct senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said. \"[Then] there's Vladimir Putin, who has clearly awakened the Europeans to the danger that Russia presents to them.\"",
      "Beginning in his first term, Trump made clear his resentment that only five NATO allies were meeting their 2% GDP defense spending pledges, and those criticisms rang loudly following his return to the campaign trail for the 2024 election amid Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",

      "According to Huckabee, beginning in early 2025, the Interior Ministry\u2019s visa department stopped following the Ministry of Religious Affairs recommendations and began conducting its own investigations into each Christian organization to determine whether they should be recognized as \"Religious Institutions\" and remain eligible for visas.",
      "He cited as examples the Baptist Convention of Israel, Christian Missionary Alliance and Assemblies of God, noting that members of these groups have been denied renewals of their A3 clergy visas and are instead required to complete lengthy questionnaires about their religious beliefs.

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Jeffrey Epstein is dead, but the White House can\u2019t seem to kill his story.",
      "President Donald Trump and his aides have settled on silence as a strategy to stamp out criticism of his refusal to release files detailing the federal government's investigation of Epstein, according to a senior administration official and Republicans familiar with the White House's thinking.",
      "For weeks, stories about Epstein, the financier and pal to political luminaries who died by suicide awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019, have been making headlines.",
      "In a break from Trump\u2019s usual crisis communications template \u2014 which emphasizes an all-hands-on-deck approach to defending him on television and on social media \u2014 the Epstein case has been met with more restraint from the White House.",
      "Trump himself has signaled that he doesn\u2019t want members of his administration talking about the matter nonstop, a person close to the White House told NBC News. And White House aides have made it clear that no one in the administration is allowed to talk about Epstein without high-level vetting, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "\"The communications office has to be directly involved in every aspect of this,\" the official said. \"Every 'i' must be dotted, and every 't' must be crossed through us.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s aides would like for the Epstein storm to pass, but they know they can\u2019t keep Trump and other administration officials off television at a time when they are trying to promote his policy wins and agenda.",
      "The senior administration official said White House officials won\u2019t stop making appearances in the media, which will inevitably lead to Epstein questions. But they are still trying to determine how to balance defending Trump on the issue while deflecting inquiries by touting his accomplishments.",
      "That represents a shift of sorts for a president who has generally liked his top deputies and administration officials to robustly defend him to the media, regardless of the issue.",
      "\u201cThe questions are going to come, but whether we engage or not is part of the consideration,\u201d the official said.",
      "But Trump, who is accustomed to driving the news, is finding out there are limits to his ability to pivot away from an issue that has angered parts of his MAGA base, consumed news media, broken into popular culture and mobilized a Democratic Party that has been dormant and divided since he was re-elected in November.",
      "On Wednesday, a federal judge in Florida ruled against the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury testimony in the Epstein case, launching a raft of new headlines. Then, The Wall Street Journal, owned by Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch, reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi had told Trump in May that his name appears in the Epstein files \u2014 even though he told reporters in July that Bondi hadn\u2019t informed him that he was named.",
      "\u201cThe fact is that the president kicked [Epstein] out of his club for being a creep,\u201d White House communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement. \u201cThis is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media, just like the Obama Russiagate scandal, which President Trump was right about.\u201d",
      "Trump called Epstein a \u201cterrific guy\u201d in 2002 but said in 2019 that they had a \u201cfalling-out a long time ago.\u201d He has said he had no knowledge of what Epstein was doing.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump baselessly accused former President Barack Obama of committing \"treason\" because U.S. intelligence agencies found, during the heat of the 2016 campaign, that Russia had tried to interfere in that year's election to assist Trump.",
      "Trump made the highly charged allegation in response to a reporter's question about Epstein, and it prompted a rare rebuke from Obama's office, which called the remarks \"ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.\"",
      "White House officials hope to limit the blast radius of a self-detonated scandal, which Trump and members of his administration fueled by accusing leading Democrats of hiding information about Epstein when he was seeking the presidency. Bondi raised expectations among Trump supporters in February by promising to release long-sought files, telling Fox News that Epstein's client list was \"sitting on my desk right now.\" But her own Justice Department said this month that it didn\u2019t have any such \"client list,\" and other files remain in his administration's hands.",
      "Trump\u2019s quick pivot to a flurry of other issues that also animate his base have contained much of the unease among top MAGA influencers. Still, political operatives in both parties see the issue as one that is hurting Trump and helping Democrats.",
      "\u201cThings are, obviously, different with this one,\u201d said a Republican operative familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking. \u201cThis has blown a bit of a hole in MAGA, so reflexive defense mode, as we have often seen in the past, won\u2019t always be the go-to. Part of the problem is that this issue has leaked into conservative media. In the past, they [White House] could expect certain interviewers to be friendly and stay on script; that\u2019s not guaranteed with this one.\u201d",
      "Some Democrats see the issue as a perfect vehicle for painting Trump as an elite protecting the powerful at the expense of the masses, undercutting the image he has crafted for himself as a populist champion of the powerless.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve got his a-- on something for real, and it\u2019s just a clean, clean hit,\u201d said Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist who is working with several potential 2028 candidates. \u201cHe can\u2019t get off of it.\u201d",
      "Nellis said the Epstein imbroglio could be part of a winning midterm and 2028 presidential message because it threatens MAGA's confidence in the GOP's commitment to exposing corruption. He noted that Vice President JD Vance, widely viewed as a leading candidate for the 2028 Republican nomination, has mostly stopped talking about Epstein after having agreed in an interview with MAGA-friendly podcaster Theo Von last year that the documents should be made public. (Von last week posted a clip of the comment on X and wrote: \u201cYeah, what changed?\u201d)",
      "Vance\u2019s first post amid the recent uproar came last week, after The Wall Street Journal published an article about a letter including a racy drawing that Trump is alleged to have sent Epstein for his birthday in 2003. He called the article \u201ccomplete and utter bulls---.\u201d",
      "But other Democrats expressed reservations over getting too far in front of the Epstein files.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s emblematic of the real lack of opportunities Dems have in this moment,\u201d a national Democratic strategist said. \u201cTrump sort of gifted this, and while it\u2019s great to capitalize on it \u2014 and I\u2019m glad people are \u2014 I\u2019d caution Dems of thinking this is a hot ticket back to anything.\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Once fighting a lonely battle against President Donald Trump, GOP Rep. Thomas Massie has found an issue that is winning him more Republican friends and political allies than he has had all year: his push to release the Jeffrey Epstein files.",
      "Many of Trump\u2019s MAGA allies on and off Capitol Hill are frustrated with Trump and top officials in his administration for dragging their feet in releasing the government\u2019s remaining documents and records related to Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender.",
      "But they\u2019re rooting for Massie, who has leaned into the fight in recent weeks and made it his sole mission to get the files released. It is a rare issue on which Massie aligns more closely with many of Trump\u2019s own supporters than Trump himself. That's a big shift for Massie, a Kentucky conservative who was swimming against the current in his opposition to Trump's megabill by raising debt concerns that fell on deaf ears with other Republicans.",
      "Nearly a dozen House conservatives have signed on to Massie\u2019s resolution to defy Trump and force Attorney General Pam Bondi to publish \u201call unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\u201d that the Justice Department and FBI possess. Thirteen Democrats, including Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi of California and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have joined the effort, as well.",
      "\u201cI have the people on my side,\u201d Massie told reporters, pointing to a CBS News/YouGov poll that found that 89% of U.S. adults want all of the Epstein files released.",
      "Republicans split evenly in the CBS poll when they were asked whether they\u2019re \u201csatisfied\u201d or \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with Trump\u2019s handling of the Epstein case. That\u2019s very unusual for Trump, who tends to win lopsidedly high marks from self-identified Republicans on his handling of issues. A recent Quinnipiac University poll also found the GOP split about evenly when it comes to Trump\u2019s handling of the Epstein matter.",
      "The CBS poll found that Trump\u2019s overall approval rating has fallen to 42% but that 89% of Republicans approve of the job he has done in his first six months back in office.",

      "Massie is boldly going where no other Republican in Congress dares go: running for re-election while leaning into a confrontation with Trump, who has threatened to support a primary challenger to oust him in the GOP contest.",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re wasting millions of dollars against me, and they\u2019re going to lose the majority because of that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will embolden Republicans who are right now, quietly, agreeing with me but saying: \u2018I\u2019m afraid of winning my primary.

      "Massie\u2019s confidence drew a clapback from Calvin Moore, a former House GOP campaign operative, who said on X, \u201cHow\u2019d that work out for [Bob Good?],\u201d referring to the former Virginia congressman who lost his 2024 primary to a Trump-backed challenger.",
      "Massie\u2019s foray into the Epstein saga has also sparked a personal, very public row between him and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. Johnson, a Trump loyalist, said Wednesday that \u201cRepublicans stand for maximum transparency and truth\u201d and are \u201cpushing for the release of all credible information\u201d about the Epstein matter, but he added that Massie\u2019s Epstein resolution with Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., would provide no protection for victims\u2019 identities.",
      "\u201cWe have ... a moral obligation to protect people who have been the victims of these unspeakable crimes so that their names are not drug through the mud,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "A day earlier, Johnson invoked Massie at his weekly news conference, showing unusual frustration and saying that he was baffled by Massie\u2019s motivation in the Epstein matter and that \u201csome people seem to enjoy trying to inflict political pain on their own teammates.\u201d",
      "Massie later told reporters that introducing his Epstein resolution now would give his effort momentum over the House\u2019s five-week summer recess, which begins Thursday. He and Khanna, Massie said, plan to file a so-called discharge petition to force a vote on their resolution when the House returns in September if they can win support from 218 members.",
      "Then, in a midnight post on X, Massie shot back at Johnson: \u201c@SpeakerJohnson, why are you running cover for an underage sex trafficking ring and pretending this is a partisan issue? MAGA voted for this.\u201d",
      "Johnson\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about Massie\u2019s post. Johnson has repeatedly said anyone who has committed sex crimes should be prosecuted.",
      "And Massie\u2019s effort has been elevated by some podcasters credited with boosting Trump in the 2024 election, including Theo Von, who recently said on X, \u201cWhy cant we put the @RoKhanna @RepThomasMassie bill for a vote this week @SpeakerJohnson @JDVance??\u201d",
      "Von also publicly questioned why Vance isn\u2019t standing by his earlier comment on Von\u2019s own show that \u201cwe need to release the Epstein list; that is an important thing.\u201d",
      "Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Cory Mills of Florida and Nancy Mace of South Carolina are among the Republicans who have signed on to the Massie-Khanna resolution. Massie also has an ally in Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a fellow self-described libertarian who describes Massie as a good friend.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a big supporter of his, and vice versa. I\u2019m planning a 10-city tour with him in September to support him, and we will do what it takes. We both represent sort of the liberty wing of the Republican Party,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe want to make sure that we don\u2019t allow anybody to come in and try to defeat him.\u201d",
      "Paul is the only GOP senator who voted against Trump\u2019s megabill because of debt concerns, but, unlike Massie, he doesn\u2019t face re-election until 2028. Paul said he\u2019s \u201cvery confident\u201d Massie will beat a Trump-backed challenge.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the most fiscally conservative member of the House. He\u2019s the most pro-gun member of the House, most pro-Bill of Rights person in the House,\u201d Paul said. \u201cGood sense of humor, travels the district and is somebody who pays attention to his constituents. I think he\u2019ll do well.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve in person Thursday \u2014 an unusual move that\u2019s also a major escalation in the White House\u2019s pressure campaign against Chair Jerome Powell.",
      "Trump said on Truth Social shortly before departing the White House that he would meet Powell when he arrives to the Fed. Joining the tour would be Sens. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., budget director Russ Vought, FHFA director William Pulte and Trump's appointees to the National Capital Planning Committee. Many of those officials have been Powell's loudest critics in recent weeks.",
      "The visit will ostensibly allow Trump to inspect the $2.5 billion renovation under way at the Fed\u2019s headquarters. Powell\u2019s management of the project, beset by cost overruns, has been raised by White House officials as a possible pretext for removing him after a Supreme Court ruling indicated the president\u2019s powers over executive branch officials do not necessarily apply to the Federal Reserve.",
      "It is not clear when the visit was added to Trump\u2019s schedule, which was released late Wednesday night. The White House spent the first part of this week downplaying speculation that the president would fire Powell, even as Trump continued to harangue him on social media for leaving interest rates unchanged. Trump appointed Powell in his first term.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that tells me that [Powell] should step down right now. He\u2019s been a good public servant,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business on Tuesday. Later that day, Trump said he believes that Powell has \u201cdone a bad job\u201d but noted that Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May, will \u201cbe out pretty soon anyway.\u201d  On Wednesday, Bessent said on MSNBC that Trump isn\u2019t going to fire Powell.",
      "Trump favors lowering interest rates to boost activity in the economy. But Powell has said that forecasts of faster price growth, largely a result of Trump\u2019s tariffs, suggest interest rates should remain at their current levels to keep inflation in check. Earlier this month, Powell said the Fed would have cut rates by now if not for the expected impact of Trump\u2019s import taxes.",
      "\u201cIn effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\u201d Powell said at a European Central Bank forum in Portugal.",
      "The Fed will announce its next rate decision at the end of its next policy meeting on July 30, and is expected to leave them unchanged again.",
      "Presidential visits to the Fed\u2019s main building, a short drive from the White House, are rare. The last president to do so was George W. Bush, who attended the 2006 swearing-in ceremony of his former economic adviser, Ben Bernanke, as chair. Only two other presidents have made the trip: Gerald Ford in 1975 and Franklin D. Roosevelt to inaugurate the building in 1937.",
      "The Fed declined to comment when asked about the visit.",
      "Administration officials have decried the cost of the renovation project, saying the Fed is spending billions on a \u201clavish\u201d and \u201costentatious\u201d palace containing VIP dining rooms, terraces, fancy elevators and high-end marble.",
      "However, Powell and the central bank have repeatedly said the features of the renovation that the White House and Republicans have seized on are misleading.",
      "On June 25, Powell told the Senate banking committee: \u201cThere\u2019s no [VIP] dining room. There\u2019s no new marble. We took down the old marble, we\u2019re putting it back up. We\u2019ll have to use new marble where some of the old marble broke. But there\u2019s no special elevators. There\u2019s just old elevators that have been there.\u201d",
      "The Fed launched an FAQ page on its website that says that rising costs associated with the project are due primarily because of the cost of raw materials, consultations with review agencies and the building containing more asbestos than anticipated.",
      "Those review agencies, of which Trump appointees were members, also pushed for more marble in the renovation plans rather than glass."

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 09:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Hospitals can charge hundreds of dollars in fees, even for routine outpatient appointments. Some Cleveland Clinic patients on Florida\u2019s Treasure Coast have had enough.",
    "story": [
      "PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. \u2014 When the Cleveland Clinic started acquiring hospitals and medical offices in this palm tree-lined region six years ago, many Floridians were excited. The Ohio nonprofit, ranked among the top hospitals in the world, pledged to bring expert care and an infusion of cash to the state\u2019s Treasure Coast, an area north of Boca Raton brimming with 55-and-up gated communities.",
      "But in the years after the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s blue and green signs popped up outside dozens of medical offices, patients began receiving unexpected bills: an additional $95 for a consultation with a neurosurgeon. An extra $112 to see a family medicine physician. And $174 more for a neurologist appointment that previously cost only a $50 co-pay.",
      "Baffled, the patients contacted their doctors\u2019 offices and insurers and learned that the new costs were \u201cfacility fees\u201d \u2014 charges that hospitals have traditionally billed for inpatient stays and emergency room visits but are now increasingly charging for routine appointments in their outpatient clinics. The fees, which are often not fully covered by insurance, are meant to support the higher level of care that these doctors\u2019 offices provide, according to hospitals.",
      "For blindsided patients, that can mean paying a hospital fee \u2014 even if they never set foot in a hospital.",
      "\u201cMy heart dropped,\u201d said Brandy Macaluso-Owens, 43, a social worker who lives in Port St. Lucie. She received a $174 facility fee after a visit in March with a Cleveland Clinic gastroenterologist. \u201cI probably met with the doctor maybe as little as 15 minutes.\u201d",
      "The Cleveland Clinic defended facility fees in an email, saying they are an \u201cappropriate practice\u201d that align \u201cwith government regulations and industry guidelines.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese fees help support just some of the costs of maintaining outpatient facilities so that we can continue providing high-quality, compassionate care to all patients,\u201d the Cleveland Clinic said.",
      "The Cleveland Clinic is far from the only hospital charging facility fees, which amount to billions of dollars annually for patients across the country. The fees have become pervasive in recent years as major health systems have snapped up doctors\u2019 offices, making it harder for patients to find independent practices: More than half of all physicians nationally are now employed by hospitals or health systems, up from just a quarter in 2012.",
      "For more on facility fees, watch NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News with Tom Llamas\u201d at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT and \u201cTop Story\u201d on NBC News NOW at 7 p.m. ET.",
      "At the same time, facility fees have become more noticeable because of a rise in high-deductible health insurance plans, which leave patients paying a larger share of their medical bills before their insurance kicks in. A study last year found that the average deductible for employer-sponsored coverage had risen about 47% in a decade.",
      "These factors are affecting many patients who are already teetering financially. About half of adults in the U.S. say they would be unable to pay an unexpected $500 medical bill or would have to go into debt to pay it, according to the health policy group KFF.",
      "Facility fees can run into the hundreds of dollars, and even small amounts can quickly add up.",
      "Did your doctor's office charge you a facility fee? Here's what to know",
      "\u201cPeople are getting really high bills for simple, routine care,\u201d said Christine Monahan, an assistant research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University who has studied the issue. \u201cThey don\u2019t expect to be paying high bills for this. And it\u2019s not realistic to expect people to be able to afford this.\u201d",
      "Opposition to outpatient facility fees is a rare area of agreement between patient advocates and insurance companies, which argue that hospitals are unnecessarily inflating the cost of care. While efforts to restrict facility fees have drawn bipartisan support at the state and federal levels, the hospital industry has pushed back, arguing that the fees are necessary to help fund core services like 24/7 emergency departments, and that insurers should cover them.",
      "These national forces are all colliding in southeast Florida, where 11 patients told NBC News that the Cleveland Clinic had charged them unexpected facility fees in the past several years. For some, the fees were a mere annoyance, a sign of the escalating cost of health care. For others, the bills were a financial burden too big to shoulder. And some are refusing to pay them.",
      "Billie Paukune Boorman, a waitress, was recently charged a $174 facility fee for her 13-year-old daughter\u2019s ear, nose and throat appointment, along with over $200 in other unanticipated charges.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of money laying around,\u201d she said.",
      "The Cleveland Clinic declined an interview request from NBC News and declined to comment on individual cases but said in its email that patients are charged facility fees in doctors\u2019 offices that are classified as hospital outpatient departments, which must meet stricter quality and safety standards than nonaccredited physician practices. The facility fees reflect \u201cthe significant added costs to hospitals of complying with these standards,\u201d the Cleveland Clinic added.",
      "The Cleveland Clinic told NBC News that it has sent more than 250,000 letters to its Florida patients informing them of the fees ahead of their appointments, and said it posts signs at its offices saying that they are hospital outpatient departments. Medicare patients receive an additional notice at check-in. The letters that the Cleveland Clinic sent say patients may see \u201ca change from how you were billed in the past\u201d but do not explicitly note that patients may be charged more out of pocket. Many of the patients who spoke to NBC News did not recall receiving the letters.",
      "The health system did not answer questions about how it determines the price of a facility fee but said the costs \u201cvary depending on the facility and the type of medical services provided.\u201d",
      "Several patients said they did not notice any differences in their care after the fees were implemented.",
      "Last year, Irene Rauch, 66, a semiretired human resources executive, was charged a $95 facility fee for an appointment with a neurosurgeon she said she had seen for the same type of appointment three months earlier for just a $15 co-pay. The added charge was not something she had budgeted for."

    "story": [
      "The risk that alcohol poses to women\u2019s health has mounted over the last two decades, as they have begun to drink more frequently and in larger quantities.",
      "Alcohol-related deaths among women more than doubled from 1999 to 2020. And deaths from alcohol-related hepatitis, a disease resulting in severe liver inflammation, nearly tripled among women over the same time period.",
      "A new study, published Wednesday in the medical journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, similarly points to an elevated risk of alcohol-related liver disease among women. The condition encompasses various types of liver damage due to excessive alcohol consumption. It spans early-stage inflammation to severe scarring, known as cirrhosis, which can lead to liver failure.",
      "Women are more susceptible than men to alcohol-related liver disease for several reasons. For one, their bodies tend to have less water weight and a higher percentage of body fat. That combination increases the concentration of alcohol in their blood, which the liver then has to process. Compared with men, women also naturally have lower levels of an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase, which helps the body metabolize alcohol. That again leads to higher blood alcohol concentrations.",
      "Those physiological differences, combined with the sharp increase in alcohol use and binge drinking, have made women particularly vulnerable to alcohol-related illnesses.",
      "\u201cHistorically, there\u2019s been differences in prevalence rates [of alcohol use] between men and women. And essentially, that gap has now closed and the ratio between men and women\u2019s drinking is almost at 1 to 1,\u201d said Sherry McKee, director of the Yale SCORE Program on Sex Differences in Alcohol Use Disorder.",
      "Changes in women\u2019s lifestyles have created increasing opportunities to consume alcohol, McKee said. Today\u2019s young adults drink less compared with previous generations, but there are now more women in college than men \u2014 and college is generally associated with increased alcohol consumption, she said.",
      "\u201cYou pair that with the fact that women are delaying childbirth, delaying marriage \u2014 it just gives more space for women to continue drinking in the post-college years,\u201d McKee said.",
      "Women\u2019s heavy alcohol consumption is most common in midlife, said Katherine Keyes, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health. Some researchers attribute the trend to stress or office drinking culture, but Keyes said the main reason women are drinking more is for fun. She noted that wine and spirits are often marketed to women as luxury goods or methods of relaxation.",
      "Experts said more awareness of the health risks of drinking could help encourage women to scale back.",
      "\u201cIt isn\u2019t the case that every single person who drinks heavily will get liver disease from it. But we do know that a proportion of those folks do \u2014 about 25 to 30%,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Mellinger, a senior staff physician at Henry Ford Health, a Michigan-based health system. The more a person drinks, she added, the greater likelihood they have of getting alcohol-related liver disease of any stage.",
      "The study published Wednesday found that heavy drinkers are developing alcohol-related liver disease at more than double the rate compared with 20 years ago. The researchers suspect that\u2019s because people vulnerable to liver disease \u2014 including women and those with obesity or diabetes \u2014 are drinking more compared with decades past.",
      "\u201cThe modern American drinker looks different than it did 20 years ago,\u201d said Dr. Brian Lee, the study\u2019s lead author and a hepatologist at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California.",
      "The researchers used data from a national, government-led survey to measure drinking habits and liver health in the U.S. They characterized heavy drinkers as men who consumed at least 30 grams of alcohol per day \u2014 roughly two standard drinks \u2014 and women who consumed at least 20 grams per day.",
      "Among heavy drinkers, the risk of significant liver damage more than doubled over a 22-year period, from nearly 2% in 1999-2004 to more than 4% in 2013-20.",
      "The rate of metabolic syndrome \u2014 conditions like obesity or high blood pressure that increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke \u2014 among heavy drinkers also increased during that time, from 26% to nearly 38%. Both obesity and Type 2 diabetes can cause fat to build up in the liver, thereby elevating the risk of liver disease.",
      "\u201cIt could be the situation of a perfect storm. We have an increase in alcohol consumption \u2026 alongside changing prevalence of these other [health] conditions,\u201d Keyes said.",
      "Lee said it\u2019s important for people to be honest with their doctors about their alcohol intake, so that doctors can decide whether to screen them for liver disease.",
      "\u201cYour risk of liver disease might be higher than you think,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is that liver disease is silent, and most people \u2014 even with cirrhosis, which is end-stage liver disease \u2014 have no symptoms at all. I always say it\u2019s a blessing and a curse that you need very little healthy amounts of liver to feel perfectly fine.\u201d",
      "Keyes said women in particular tend to wait longer to seek medical care for heavy drinking due to social stigma.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really becoming this hidden epidemic where women wait too long to see someone about a really serious, alcohol-related condition,\u201d she said."

      "Born in 1940, Mangione grew up in Rochester, graduating from the New York town's Benjamin Franklin High School before attending and earning a Bachelor's Degree from Eastman School of Music, also in Rochester.",
      "According to the Bartolomeo & Perotto funeral home, Mangione taught at Eastman and later received an honorary Doctorate degree from the school. He also started the school's jazz program.",
      "Mangione's jazz career kicked off as a teenage flugelhorn player when he formed the Jazz Brothers alongside his brother, Gap, according to the obituary. It led to a decades-long career that yielded 14 Grammy nominations \u2014 and two wins \u2014 an induction into the Rochester Music Hall of Fame and more than 30 albums.",
      "Rochester Mayor Malik D. Evans called Mangione an artist \"who earned international distinction, and Rochester's pride.\"",

      "The final days of a Seattle cat were spent in \"terror\" due to Blue Angels fighter pilots, before squadron leaders blocked the feline's human mother on social media in an act of \"cowardly censorship,\" she said in a lawsuit filed this week.",
      "Layla was 14 when she died on Aug. 11 last year following a battle with heart disease, which was allegedly exasperated by the Blue Angels flying overheard days \u2014 and one year \u2014 earlier, plaintiff Lauren Ann Lombardi said in her federal civil complaint.",
      "The Blue Angels are the U.S. Navy\u2019s flight demonstration squadron and have been performing aerobatic maneuvers across the U.S. since 1946.",
      "Lombardi had voiced her concerns about the impact of Blue Angels flying over Seattle in 2023, telling off the squadron in an expletive-laden tirade.",
      "\"Stop with your F----ing bullsh-- you are terrorizing my cat and all the other animals and wildlife,\" Lombardi wrote to the squadron via Instagram on Aug. 3 last year. \"Nobody gives a f--- about your stupid little planes.\"",
      "Lombardi, a paralegal in Seattle, was then allegedly blocked a short time later.",
      "She tried to direct message the Blue Angels with a one-word response, \"cowards\" on Aug. 5 last year \"which appeared to send but was never delivered due to the blocking,\" according to the lawsuit penned by the attorney Nacim Bouchtia,  who is married to Lombardi and was listed as Layla's human father in the feline's obituary.",
      "When the Blue Angels returned a year later, Layla had just come home from the animal hospital and was in the throes of her final battle with heart disease, Lombardi said.",
      "Even though Layla was heavily sedated, her \"primitive limbic system overruled her medication and she fled in primal panic beneath furniture, her labored breathing escalating to clinically dangerous levels,\" Bouchtia wrote.",
      "Lombardi put thick blankets in windows and physically put her hands over Layla's ears \"to no avail\" as the cat's \"walnut-sized brain\" was stricken by \"pure debilitating terror,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "While her human didn't pin Layla's death on the Navy, the plaintiff lamented that the late feline \"died knowing only fear when she should have known only love,\" Bouchtia wrote.",
      "The crux of Layla's parents' lawsuit stems from the Blue Angels blocking Lombardi on Instagram, which was still in place on Thursday, according to the attorney.",
      "Whether public officials or agencies can block individuals on social media is still a rather unsettled legal question.",
      "Lombardi's lawsuit named Cdr. Adam Bryan, commanding officer of the Blue Angels, and Lt. Ben Bushong, the squadron's social media administrator, as defendants.",
      "A representative of the Blue Angels could not be immediately reached for comment on Thursday.",
      "Lombardi is seeking to have the block lifted, an order that the Blue Angels not bar \"anyone else\" on \"the basis of viewpoint\" and attorneys' fees.",
      "Even without the Lombardi and Bouchtia's dealings with the Blue Angels with Layla, they did not appear to be fans of the aviators.",
      "They called their performances \"auditory carpet bombing\" with the \"subtlety of a military occupation.\"",
      "They described squad commanders as \"emotionally fragile snowflakes\" who blocked the plaintiff on social media, transforming \"personal tragedy into Constitutional treason.\"",
      "\"Layla was the greatest cat that ever lived and her final days on this Earth were pockmarked by debilitating terror brought on my the actions of the United State Government,\" the plaintiff said.",
      "The Blue Angels are next set to perform on Aug. 2-3 at the Boeing Seafair Air Show in Seattle."

      "Liberal Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan on Thursday expressed alarm at the increase in threats against the judiciary but said judges should not be intimidated, urging them to focus on their jobs as arbiters of the rule of law.",
      "Speaking to an audience of judges and lawyers at a conference in Monterey, California, Kagan acknowledged that judges are frequent targets of harsh criticism, but said they should not be \"aggravated or maddened\" by it.",
      "\"The response to perceived lawlessness of any kind is law,\" she added.",
      "President Donald Trump and his allies have been particularly vocal in criticizing judges who have blocked his policies on a wide range of issues since he took office in January. Trump's demand that a federal judge be impeached for ruling against the administration prompted a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.",
      "The judiciary has reported a spike in threats against judges and expressed concerns about whether they are sufficiently protected.",
      "\"Judges are fair game for all kinds of criticism, strong criticism, pointed criticism, but vilifying judges in that way is a step beyond and ought to be understood as such,\" Kagan said.",
      "\"In the face of these sorts of threats to an independent judiciary, judges just need to do what they are obligated to do, which is to do law in the best way they know how to do, make independent, reasoned judgments based on precedent, based on other law, to not be inhibited by any of these threats,\" she added.",
      "Kagan also criticized how the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has increasingly issued important decisions in emergency cases without full briefing, argument or explanation. The Trump administration has often asked the court to intervene when its policies are blocked and the court has, in most cases, ruled in favor of the government.",
      "\"I think we should be cautious about acting on the emergency docket,\" she said, with her biggest concern being the court's failure to explain itself.",
      "\"I think more generally, it's the courts that are supposed to explain things. That's what courts do,\" she added."

    "story": [
      "Artist Amy Sherald canceled her upcoming show at the Smithsonian after she said the institution wanted to remove a painting of a transgender woman as the Statue of Liberty due to political fears.",
      "Sherald, who rose to fame in 2018 after painting firmer first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s official portrait, said in a statement that she decided to withdraw her exhibition, \u201cAmerican Sublime,\u201d after the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery told her it had concerns about including a portrait of a trans woman titled \u201cTrans Forming Liberty.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese concerns led to discussions about removing the work from the exhibition,\u201d Sherald said in a statement first reported by The New York Times. \u201cWhile no single person is to blame, it\u2019s clear that institutional fear shaped by a broader climate of political hostility toward trans lives played a role. This painting exists to hold space for someone whose humanity has been politicized and disregarded. I cannot in good conscience comply with a culture of censorship, especially when it targets vulnerable communities.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cAt a time when transgender people are being legislated against, silenced, and endangered across our nation, silence is not an option. I stand by my work. I stand by my sitters. I stand by the truth that all people deserve to be seen\u2014not only in life, but in art.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Smithsonian Institution, which oversees the gallery, disputed Sherald\u2019s claims and said a top Smithsonian official wanted to better contextualize the painting. More time was needed to address the issue, the spokesperson said, but Sherald withdrew the exhibit before that could be done.",
      "\u201cThe Smithsonian has a long-standing and valued relationship with artist Amy Sherald,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe are and continue to be deeply appreciative of her and the integrity of her work. While we understand Amy\u2019s decision to withdraw her show from the National Portrait Gallery, we are disappointed that Smithsonian audiences will not have an opportunity to experience American Sublime.\u201d",
      "Sherald withdrew her show in a letter to Lonnie G. Bunch III, the secretary of the Smithsonian, The New York Times reported. In the letter, which has not been reviewed by NBC News, Sherald said she understood that a video would have replaced the painting, but she still decided to cancel.",
      "\u201cThe video would have opened up for debate the value of trans visibility and I was opposed to that being a part of the \u2018American Sublime\u2019 narrative,\u201d she wrote in the letter, the Times reported.",
      "\u201cAmerican Sublime\u201d was organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and included paintings of Sherald\u2019s from 2007 to the present.",
      "According to the gallery, Sherald would have been the first contemporary Black artist to have a solo exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery."

    "story": [
      "The sound of the summer is actually not a song \u2014 it\u2019s an ad.",
      "\u201cNothing beats a Jet2 holiday,\u201d a catchphrase from the British airline\u2019s 2024 ad, mixed with English singer Jess Glynne\u2019s 2015 hit \u201cHold My Hand,\u201d has been used by more than 1.2 million users on TikTok, where it\u2019s become a viral hit in recent months. Searches for Jet2 holiday have also spiked in the last month, according to Google trends.",
      "The original Jet2 ad, which first appeared on the company\u2019s YouTube page last year, shows a family of four as they catch a Jet2 plane to their beachside summer vacation.",
      "Now, audio from the ad is being used more ironically in videos from users who juxtapose the soundbite with footage of chaotic holiday experiences. From catastrophic weather at picture-perfect resorts to passengers misbehaving on flights, the videos often document travel-related setbacks.",
      "No one was more surprised by the popularity of the ad than British actor Zo\u00eb Lister, the voice behind the viral audio. She recorded the ad about 18 months ago.",
      "\u201cSomebody sent me a video yesterday of Joe Jonas using the sound,\u201d she told NBC News in a recent video interview. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s massive!\u2019\u201d",
      "Lister, who introduced herself as the actor behind the audio in a recent TikTok video, said it\u2019s been especially interesting to see the soundbite pick up in the United States, where Americans use the word \u201cvacation\u201d rather than \u201choliday.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t even know what Jet2 holiday is,\u201d she joked. \u201cThey don\u2019t have holidays, they have vacations. Holidays are like Christmas, right? But they have got so on board with the joyful silliness of it.\u201d",
      "\u201cGoing viral for something just that is really funny and joyful \u2026 that\u2019s quite a wonderful experience,\u201d Lister added.",
      "One of the first videos to use the audio and garner millions of views was from a user who uploaded footage of what appears to be a camel attacking the person, according to meme database KnowYourMeme. Since being posted on TikTok in November 2024, the video has amassed 3.8 million views.",
      "Jet2 picked up on the popularity of the audio in the spring, posting a video on TikTok offering a giveaway for people who uploaded videos partaking in the trend. The travel company is known in the United Kingdom for offering low-cost vacations for British travelers, and providing charter flights to popular holiday destinations around the world, mostly in Europe.",
      "As for Glynne, Lister said the pop star also \u201cdid not ask for any of this\u201d fame. The singer\u2019s \u201cDarling, hold my hand\u201d line from her song is now associated with the Jet2 phrase.",
      "The two met during a Capital FM radio appearance in London on Tuesday, which Lister described as a \u201cwild\u201d moment in her life.",
      "She\u2019s \u201ca super cool mega pop star and I\u2019m this like cheeseball,\u201d Lister said.",
      "Lister, a mother of two, said she\u2019s trying to figure out how to navigate the newfound fame. She was a familiar face to many in the U.K.: From 2006-2017, she played Zoe Carpenter in the popular teen soap opera \u201cHollyoaks,\u201d which aired on Channel 4.",
      "But the virality has boosted her profile more, especially after she posted the TikTok video.",
      "\u201cWhat started happening this last week, which has been really bizarre, is when I\u2019ve been on a train or in a cafe and I can hear people watching [the meme],\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, last Friday I was out with my husband, because we were celebrating our anniversary. And the girls on the next table were literally recording their own \u2018nothing beat the Jet2 holiday\u2019 into their phone.\u201d",
      "Her husband then asked the group recording the video if they would want to meet the \u201cthe woman that does the voice.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was actually such a brilliant, fun, joyful moment,\u201d Lister said. \u201cAnd everyone was like excited. And we have photos. It was really fun.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s hoping the virality will help her expand her horizons professionally.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been planning a podcast for a while and I\u2019m happy that now I\u2019ve got more of a platform in which to launch something like that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got lots of things that I\u2019d like to do creatively and I hope that this sort of infamy will help launch things.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Missing an exit while driving on a San Diego freeway upended the life of Erick Hernandez, a DACA recipient who is now at risk of being deported to El Salvador, a country he hasn't seen in 20 years.",
      "Hernandez, 34, was giving two passengers a ride from Los Angeles to San Ysidro, known as the \"most southern community in California\" because it is so close to the Mexican border, on June 1 as a driver for a ride-share service.",
      "But he accidentally ended up in Tijuana, Mexico, after missing an exit, NBC San Diego reported this week. Because DACA recipients are not allowed to leave the country without prior approval, federal immigration authorities took Hernandez into custody when he tried to return to the U.S.",
      "Hernandez\u2019s case is one of the most recent showing how fears of possible deportation are becoming a reality for some undocumented young adults with legal permission to work and study in the U.S. under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.",
      "\"His attempt to come back to the United States and say, \u2018This was a mistake. It was an accident. I was not trying to leave the United States,\u2019 was ignored,\" Hernandez's attorney, Valerie Sigamani, told NBC San Diego. \u201cWhen that happened, he lost everything.\"",
      "\u2018A growing pattern\u2019",
      "Javier Diaz Santana, a DACA recipient who is deaf and mute, was detained in June when immigration authorities raided the car wash where he worked. And this month, a 36-year-old DACA recipient from Florida was among the first to be detained in the state's new immigrant detention center dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"",
      "Anabel Mendoza, director of communications at United We Dream, the nation\u2019s largest immigrant youth-led network, told NBC News the organization is starting to notice a \"growing pattern that is exposing the vulnerabilities\" DACA recipients face under Trump's immigration crackdown.",
      "Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told NBC News on Thursday that having \u201cDACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country.\"",
      "McLaughlin said that \"a DACA recipient may be subject to arrest and deportation.\"",
      "But DACA recipients are not breaking the law by being in the U.S. A court ruling this year determined that all current DACA recipients can keep their deportation protections and work authorizations as long as they meet their requirements and renew their status.",
      "The court ruling was issued as part of a seven-year legal challenge from the first Trump administration and nine Republican-led states seeking to end DACA, which was started in 2012.",
      "Support for 'Dreamers' \u2014 but a crackdown instead",
      "Trump\u2019s efforts to end DACA in his first term and Republican legal challenges shut out an estimated 600,000 DACA-eligible teenagers and young adults from the program, which hasn\u2019t been open to new applications because of ongoing lawsuits.",
      "Polls and surveys have consistently shown that most U.S. adults favor granting permanent legal status and a pathway to citizenship for \"Dreamers\" \u2014 young people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.",
      "In December, Trump told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d he would work on a plan \u201cto do something about the Dreamers.\u201d But last month, a White House spokesperson told NBC News this wasn\u2019t a priority for the president, who is instead focusing on \u201cdeporting criminal illegal aliens.\u201d",
      "The recent detentions of DACA recipients and the administration\u2019s comments that DACA doesn\u2019t \u201cconfer legal status\u201d highlight the need to pass permanent protections that include a pathway to citizenship for the nearly 530,000 people in the DACA program, Mendoza said.",
      "Meanwhile, DACA recipients continue to stress their ties to the U.S. and that they've abided by the law.",
      "\u201cTo qualify for DACA, we have to pass [background] checks, have a clean criminal record, and be good people,\u201d said Evenezer Cortez Mart\u00ednez, a DACA recipient who was recently denied re-entry into the U.S. and deported despite having secured permission to go on a trip to Mexico; he was able to return after two weeks.",
      "\u201cIt was very stressful. I thought I had lost everything,\u201d Cortez Mart\u00ednez told NBC News following his return home in April.",
      "When Diaz Santana was confronted by immigration authorities on June 12 during a raid at his workplace, the deaf and mute DACA recipient showed them his Real ID driver\u2019s license. Diaz Santana believed he would be safe, according to the Los Angeles Times, which first reported the story. After all, he has DACA status, no criminal history and a valid identification.",
      "Still, he was taken into custody and spent a month in a detention center in Texas. Diaz Santana was released two weeks ago on a $1,500 bond, the lowest amount possible. He is at home in California with a GPS ankle monitor that allows immigration officials to keep tabs on his whereabouts, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "\"This individual is an illegal alien. This Administration is not going to ignore the rule of law,\" McLaughlin said, though Diaz Santana has legal permission under DACA.",
      "In Florida, a 36-year-old DACA recipient was detained after  missing a court date for driving with a suspended license, WESH-TV, NBC's affiliate in Orlando, reported. Josephine Arroyo, his attorney, told NBC News on Wednesday her client has no criminal convictions and has not been formally charged with any infractions. He has a \"great job,\" she previously told WESH, adding that his employer had written a letter on his behalf.",
      "The DACA recipient has spent the past two months in immigration detention, including about two weeks in Alligator Alcatraz, which is facing allegations for keeping detainees in torturous conditions.",
      "Arroyo said she was able to get her client relocated to the Glades County Detention Center this week. When she visited him on Monday, her client said he was desperate to see his family.",
      "\"He is still shocked and surprised this happened to him,\" despite having DACA, said Arroyo, who requested that her client be granted anonymity because of the sensitivity of his case.",
      "In California, Hernandez is being held in the Otay Mesa Detention Center. He has no criminal history, his attorney and family told NBC San Diego.",
      "Sigamani, his attorney, said immigration authorities at the border asked Hernandez for an $800 bribe in exchange for letting him return to the U.S. after mistakenly ending up in Mexico.",
      "After declining, according to the attorney, Hernandez was placed in expedited removal proceedings, making him ineligible for bond and unable to witness the birth of his son next month.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just worried that if he gets deported,\" Hernandez\u2019s pregnant wife, Nancy Rivera, told NBC San Diego, \"how I\u2019m going to manage everything by myself?\"",
      "Sigamani said she filed a complaint with the FBI, hoping her client will be shielded from deportation if he is asked to cooperate in an investigation into his detention.",
      "McLaughlin said that the Office of Professional Responsibility at Customs and Border Protection is conducting a review of the allegations. She also characterized Hernandez's wrong turn while  driving as a self-deportation and his attempt to return as an illegal re-entry.",
      "\u201cA little mistake should not upend your entire life,\" said Mendoza, of United We Dream.",
      "\u201cDACA,\" she said, \"is supposed to protect them from detention and deportation.\u201d"

      "The brief, unsigned order noted that three conservative justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, would have denied the application.",
      "The case in question concerns a challenge by Native American tribes to a North Dakota legislative map that they claim violates the landmark 1965 voting rights law, which protects minority voters.",
      "But the appeals court ruled that private plaintiffs like the tribes cannot sue to enforce Section 2 of the law, an interpretation that would have far-reaching effects.",
      "If the Supreme Court were to embrace that approach and issue a ruling that would apply nationwide, it would mean only the federal government could bring such claims. But the decision to block the ruling suggests the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, may not be inclined to do so.",
      "Litigation will now continue in lower courts, with the case likely to again reach the justices at a later date through the normal appeals process.",
      "Lawyers for the two tribes, the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians and the Spirit Lake Tribe, and three individual plaintiffs argue that the 2021 state redistricting map diluted the voting strength of Native Americans by packing a large proportion of those voters in one district and distributing others around several other districts, an approach known as \u201cpacking and cracking.\u201d",
      "Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits such conduct, and a federal judge initially ruled in favor of the tribes in 2023. A new map was adopted for 2024 and three Native American candidates, including one of the plaintiffs, Collette Brown, were elected.",
      "But in May of this year, the appeals court reversed course and declined to put its ruling on hold.",
      "The tribes\u2019 lawyers had warned that if the Supreme Court did not block the ruling, Brown\u2019s status as an elected representative would have been brought into question because if the 2021 map were reimposed, she would no longer live in her district as is required.",
      "North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley, representing the state, acknowledged that courts for decades \u201chave uncritically assumed the existence of a private right of action for those claims.\u201d",
      "That this issue had not be raised before \u201cdoes not mean Congress spoke with the clarity needed to create a privately enforceable right,\u201d he added."

      "Exotic animal broker and \"Chimp Crazy\" star Tonia Haddix, who is currently embroiled in a civil lawsuit with PETA, was arrested Saturday, a little more than a week after authorities found a chimpanzee stashed in the basement of her Missouri home.",
      "Her arrest stems from an ongoing legal battle involving PETA and another chimp named Tonka. A judge had ordered the arrest of Haddix and her husband for contempt of court after they allegedly failed to pay court-ordered fees to PETA, Rolling Stone reported. Haddix was released on Sunday from the Camden County jail.",
      "Haddix was out on bond awaiting sentencing after she pleaded guilty in March to charges related to her lying to a federal judge during a hearing in her case, NBC affiliate KSDK of St. Louis reported. She tearfully claimed that Tonka, a chimp best known for his roles in the films \"Buddy\" and \"George of the Jungle,\" had died and was cremated, but it was later discovered that the chimp was actually alive and being held in her basement.",
      "Tonka was ultimately removed from her care and placed in a sanctuary.",
      "Haddix was also ordered by a judge to reimburse PETA nearly $225,000 for fees and costs incurred through the legal battle.",
      "Her attorney and manager did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.",
      "The unnamed female chimp was found in a cage in Haddix's basement after authorities executed a search warrant on July 9 at her Sunrise Beach home, according to an FBI affidavit filed Wednesday. Authorities believe the female chimp was being held in the same cage previously used for Tonka.",
      "In a sentencing memorandum, prosecutors argued that Haddix having another chimp in her basement was \"a clear violation\" of the order entered in her civil case with PETA.",
      "\"While at the time of this writing the Court has not yet made a finding relative to Defendant\u2019s violations of her conditions of release, it is the position of the United States that by possessing and concealing another chimpanzee in the basement of her residence, despite this Court\u2019s orders and warnings, Defendant has shown no remorse for her criminal conduct, and has continued to challenge and defy this Court\u2019s authority, and she should face a significant punishment as a result,\" the memorandum, filed Wednesday, states.",
      "PETA said in a statement Sunday that Haddix \"can\u2019t keep dodging the court\u2019s orders to pay back the money she owes.\"",
      "\"PETA trusts this jail time will be just a taste of the longer sentence she\u2019ll face next month,\" the animal rights organization said.",
      "Authorities had previously performed an unannounced visit to Haddix's home in April and located a large cage in her basement. The cage was empty at the time, but authorities saw \"fresh dung,\" flies, blankets, an empty Gatorade bottle and \u201ca half-eaten sucker\u201d in the case, leading them to believe that a chimp had recently been kept there.",
      "The unannounced visit was a condition of her release.",
      "Haddix's legal battle played out on HBO's \"Chimp Crazy.\" The four-part series was released last year and followed her custody case with PETA over several chimps, including Tonka. The movie star chimp had vanished in 2021 under her care after a court granted PETA permission to transfer Tonka and other chimps to a sanctuary.",
      "In a January 2022 virtual court testimony featured in the four-part series, Haddix sobbed as she told the court that Tonka had died and was cremated. In the series, Haddix revealed to the audience that Tonka was alive and celebrated her tricking the court.",
      "PETA used the HBO series as evidence in its case against Haddix."

    "story": [
      "Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers announced Thursday he won\u2019t run for re-election next year, a move that will set off a wide-open race to replace him in one of the nation\u2019s most closely divided battleground states.",
      "In a video posted to X, Evers, 73, a Democrat, said he would not seek a third term so he could spend more time with his family, while also predicting he would have won had he run.",
      "\"For five decades, my family has sacrificed to give me the gift of service. They\u2019re my world, and I owe it to them to focus on doing all the things we enjoy and love doing together. It\u2019s why, Wisconsin, I\u2019m announcing that I will not be running for a third term,\" he said. \"I'm humbled to be your governor. This is the best job I ever had.\"",
      "\"Would I win if I ran?\" Evers added. \"Of course, no question about that. But whether I'd win or not has never been part of my calculus about running again.\"",
      "Evers had said he would announce whether he\u2019d seek a third term after he reached a budget deal with Republicans in the state Legislature, which occurred earlier this month.",
      "His decision to forgo another bid is expected to result in competitive primaries for both parties. Wisconsin is one of five states President Donald Trump won last year where a Democratic-controlled governorship is on the ballot in 2026.",
      "Several Democrats have publicly or privately expressed interest in running to succeed Evers. They include state Attorney General Josh Kaul, Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley and Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson.",
      "Former Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes told NBC News he is considering a bid for governor.",
      "\u201cI am going to take my time and make the right decision for the state and for myself,\u201d said Barnes, who unsuccessfully ran for Senate in 2022.",
      "Ahead of Evers\u2019 decision, some Wisconsin Democrats had expressed concern that an expensive and divisive primary could occur if he declined to run again.",
      "\u201cIt would be a big field if he doesn\u2019t run. That could get messy,\u201d a Democratic operative familiar with Evers\u2019 thinking told NBC News earlier this month.",
      "On the Republican side, two candidates have so far entered the race, and more could follow.",
      "Josh Schoemann, the county executive of Washington County, an exurban area northwest of Milwaukee, and Bill Berrien, a Milwaukee manufacturing CEO, have both launched campaigns.",
      "In a statement put out by his campaign, Berrien accused Evers of being \u201ctoo scared to run on the Madison Democrats\u2019 record of failure\u201d and vowed to \u201cspend the next 15 months making sure whoever the Madison liberals pick from their bench of radical career politicians learns the same lesson.\u201d",
      "Businessman Eric Hovde, who narrowly lost a 2024 U.S. Senate race to Democrat Tammy Baldwin, and Tim Michels, who lost to Evers in 2022, are also weighing bids. And U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany hasn\u2019t ruled out a run.",
      "Former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also appeared to tease a potential comeback bid, posting an image of a red \"Make Wisconsin Great Again\" hat on X.",
      "Evers\u2019 decision also comes amid a broader movement within the Democratic Party to clear the way for new and younger voices, particularly following their experience with then-President Joe Biden in the 2024 campaign.",
      "Recent polling showed that Wisconsin Democrats had widely supported Evers running again, even as the general electorate in the swing state remained more split.",
      "A Marquette University Law School poll of registered Wisconsin voters released in June found that 83% of Democrats said they supported Evers seeking a third term. That poll also found that 42% of all registered voters said they wanted Evers to run again, compared to 55% who said they did not.",
      "In a statement, Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Devin Remiker praised Evers as \"one of the most successful governors in our history\" whose \"steady leadership has been instrumental in transforming our state and moving us forward.\"",
      "\"While Republican candidates rush to embrace the most extreme elements of their party and face another divisive and bitter primary battle, we will be prepared to hold them accountable and ensure Wisconsin elects a Democratic governor in 2026,\" Remiker added."

      "What attracts flies in the home?",
      "There are a few common causes for flies around the home, according to our experts. While there are a few different types of flies, in addition to other flying insects that are often confused for one another, like mosquitoes and gnats, many of them are typically caused by the following factors:",
      "Fruit and sugar: Both fruit flies and house flies, which are categorized as \u201cfilth flies,\u201d are extremely attracted to the smell of fruit, according to Bloom.  \u201cIn the home, they are typically introduced as eggs on fruit and produce which then emerge once fermentation starts,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see this relationship if you look at fruit stands.\u201d This problem arises when the fruit is left out, unwashed, overripe and/or rotting in a trash, fridge or cabinet or on a countertop. Additionally, fruit flies gravitate toward sugar substances like soda, fruit juice and candy.",
      "Fermentation: Similarly, fruit flies are often attracted to the smell of fermented foods and drinks, such as beer, wine, kombucha, yogurt, cheese and bread. While you keep these items in the fridge, things like small spills or crumbs left on the counter can attract flies. Plus, when you throw these items out, they can still attract flies due to residual matter. This is why Bloom recommends regularly rinsing out containers, cans and bottles before throwing them out to prevent flies.",
      "Decaying matter and filth: Other types of filth flies, such as the house fly, may gravitate towards fruit, but they\u2019re also attracted to dirtier materials, according to Bloom.

      "Windows and weather: Lastly, leaving windows and doors open, even for a few seconds, gives flies the easiest entry into your home. That said, you may also notice an increase in flying insects like flies, fruit flies, mosquitoes and fungus gnats during late spring and throughout summer, according to Williams. \u201cFlies and fruit flies have more access to food sources in the warmer months, as they\u2019re attracted to rotting produce that is more abundant this time of year,\u201d he says. In other words, a more humid environment makes it easier for flies to survive and reproduce.",

      "\"I was on TikTok Live, just talking to the community, and then someone was like, 'You should do a book club,'\" Jeremiah tells TODAY.com.",
      "In his official introductory video to \u201cLove Island USA,\u201d Jeremiah described himself as a \u201chuge bookworm,\u201d a descriptor that stuck with fans.",

      "\"I wouldn't let myself be happy a lot of my high school career, I would just be locked in my room playing video games angry. So then, boom, during COVID, I was like, 'Oh now I'm really stuck in the room. Let me get rid of this anger,'\" he says. \"So I turned to stoicism.\"",
      "And now, he's turning to literary fiction and romance. Jeremiah\u2019s book club will hold its first meeting on Aug. 4, where he and his followers will discuss the first 12 chapters of \u201cThe Song of Achilles.\u201d",

      "Once they picked the book, they voted on first meeting date, time and reading pace. The result is a monthly meeting, to be held on TikTok Live or Discord, which houses servers for voice, video and text communication. The Discord platform, which has more than 30,000 members, allows his followers to talk with each other \"all the time.\"",
      "\"I'll do random pop up lives, and subscribers get an extra live a month,\" he says. \"Then I'll put some questions in the Instagram channel like once or twice a week.\"",
      "Jeremiah, who was on Chapter 4 of \"Song of Achilles\" before the interview, says he hadn't read a romantic novel since high school.",
      "\"The personification, the way she describes things that aren't human as they are human. I was like, I can't believe it's (Miller's) first book. I've never read anything like this ever.\"",
      "\"I didn't expect him \u2014 I don't want to spoil it \u2014 but I didn't expect the third chapter when he got booted,\" he adds, referring to Patroclus' exile to Phthia.",

      "\u201cOne day, I went on a local talk show and wound up sitting on-air right next to Lou Ferrigno,\" he recalled in his 2009 memoir, \u201cMy Life Outside the Ring.\"",

      "Hogan first appeared in WWE in 1979 and was later named Hulk Hogan by Vincent J. McMahon, per WWE's obit.",

      "In the end, James' siblings, Richard and Honoria (Mia Threapleton) come to Jinny's aid. They hatch a plan to distract their brother and smuggle Jinny and Freddy out of the home.",
      "While James and Richard talk downstairs, Honoria finds Freddy and escapes in a carriage with the infant. But once James realizes Freddy is gone, a fight ensues. Richard briefly knocks out James and runs upstairs to free Jinny from a locked room. But as they try to escape, they encounter James holding a gun.",
      "Richard, again, distracts James so Jinny can run away. After she flees, James points the gun at his head while Richard tries to talk him down, telling his younger brother they can fix things together.",
      "The scene then cuts to Jinny hiding behind a tree on the property as a gunshot goes off. As she rushes back to the home, she finds James catatonic over Richard's lifeless body.",
      "Why Does Lord Seadown Kill His Brother, Richard?",
      "In the lead up to Richard's shocking death, his family's dynamic is explored more in depth after his mother, Lady Brightlingsea (Fenella Woolgar), helps James pull off framing Jinny at the opera. But once Jinny is removed from the asylum and back at his estate, Lady Brightlingsea admits that her middle child may have taken the situation with Jinny too far. Speaking to Richard, the matriarch recalls how James was always a \"funny fish,\" struggling to socialize with other children but desperate to please his older brother. She suggests that James wanted to marry an American woman, Jinny, because Richard did.",
      "Richard uses this knowledge to distract James in his rescue of Jinny and Freddy.",
      "Fishwick says in an interview with TODAY.com that the murder was a \"vindictive\" act on James' part and compares his character's dynamic with Richard to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel.",
      "\"You don't necessarily see a lot of it in Season 1 or 2, but it's kind of interesting looking back and thinking that there's probably some kind of status dynamic going on between Richard, who's the charming, easygoing, firstborn son, and James, who doesn't inherit a title. I think he finds people a lot more difficult. There's this kind of brotherly tension,\" Fishwick explains.",
      "Dylan tells TODAY.com that while the death may come as a surprise to audiences, he understands it. \"I think it makes a lot of sense,\" he says.",
      "He says his character's death made his scenes with Boe's Conchita, whom he married at the very start of the show\u00a0\u2014 Season 1, Episode 1\u00a0\u2014\u00a0all the more special.",
      "\"We just tried to be really present with each other and have a lot of fun,\" Dylan says. \"Our relationship is in a really lovely place when that happens.\"",
      "Boe chimes in and adds, \"It makes it more heartbreaking and gut-wrenching.\"",
      "While Conchita was introduced in the series premiere as a free spirit, wild child American who clashes with her new husband's strict family, Boe says her character's grief will put her in survival mode.",
      "\"Now she\u2019s a single mother, and on top of that, she has to worry about taking care of her household because they are in financial distress,\" Boe says. \"I think the grief of losing her Dickie, it made her have to realign her priorities and ... she just had to really hunker down and be like, 'You know what? This is what I have to do to survive.'\""

    "summary": "25 years ago, writer Liz Calvario's family attended the Backstreet Boys Millennium concert. In a full circle moment, they went to the anniversary show and celebrated the loss of her mother.",
    "story": [
      "25 YEARS AGO, my family created a lifelong connection with the Backstreet Boys. It might sound...unique for not just two fangirls, but also their parents, to be devoted to a boyband. But for our foursome, BSB has been the soundtrack to a shared life of love...and unexpected loss.",
      "The connection reached a full-circle moment this year when the group announced on TODAY their \u201cInto the Millennium\u201d Sphere residency in Las Vegas. It was a celebration of the 25-year anniversary of their hit album \u2014 but for my family, it was a reminder of a time that changed everything for us.",
      "It all began when I was about eight years old and my sister Leslie and I walked into Lucky\u2019s grocery store. She ran straight to the magazine section; four years older than me, she had recently discovered the Backstreet Boys and wanted to show me her favorite member, Nick Carter.",
      "Grabbing one of the bright teen magazines, my eyes went instead to dark-haired, green-eyed Kevin Richardson. From there, while my mom grocery shopped, our ritual became standing in that aisle, flipping the pages to every Backstreet Boys photo we could find.",
      "Our infatuation only grew as the years went by. We consumed every bit of information about all five \u201cboys,\u201d belted their songs on the radio and religiously watched \u201cTotal Request Live\u201d with Carson Daly on MTV. (My cheeks turned hot as I watched the rain scene in \u201cQuit Playing Games With My Heart.\u201d)",
      "Knowing how much we loved them, my mom often gave in to purchasing the BSB merch we saw at the mall and stores. When we begged to call \u201cTRL\u201d countless times, she always indulged us. And when we were in the car yelling every single lyric to every single song? She was right there singing along with us.",
      "By 1999, BSB was embarking on their \u201cInto the Millennium Tour,\u201d to accompany their sophomore album, \u201cMillennium.\u201d Desperate to see them in concert, Leslie and I begged our parents to let us go. By this time, our bedroom was covered in floor-to-ceiling posters; while my dad huffed about our decor choices, my mom never seemed to mind, often buying us more magazines to help us add to our collection.",
      "Finally, my dad gave in after endless pestering: \u201cIf you can save up the money to buy your own ticket, you can go.\u201d",
      "For months, my sister and I put aside the money we got from our birthdays and report cards, and we did chores around the house. I pocketed any spare change we found, including the coins by my dad's wallet. (To me, it was fair game!) When it was time to purchase tickets, we proudly stood in front of my dad with our savings: A grand total of around $100.",
      "Back in those days, we had to go to a JCPenney Ticketmaster concierge to purchase tickets. So we headed to the mall, plopped down our money and asked for two tickets to the Backstreet Boys show in Anaheim, California, the closest venue to our San Diego county town of Ramona.",
      "But then our dad chimed in saying he wanted four tickets. Perplexed, my sister and I looked at each other and told him we didn\u2019t have enough for two more.",
      "He looked at us. \u201cYou proved that you can save money for something you really want, and you did,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a treat, I will pay for your tickets, and your mom and I will also go.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 15, 1999, I attended my first Backstreet Boys concert (and first-ever concert) at the then-Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (now the Honda Center). Our seats were high up, but I remember my dad borrowing a friend's camcorder to record the entire show. Sitting next to us, he zoomed in on the stage as my sister and I fangirled. The moment the band opened the show and flew in on futuristic surfboards, we couldn't contain our screams.",
      "My mom, dad, sister and I belted out the songs we all knew from repeatedly playing their albums. And when \u201cThe Perfect Fan\u201d \u2014 the group's ode to a mother's love \u2014 came on, we dedicated it to my mom.",
      "I saved my ticket from that show, which I still have to this day. My sister and I would rewatch the recording of the concert with my mom on the VCR until it stopped working. As a Mexican household, we also loved the group's songs in Spanish, like \u201cNunca Te Hare Llorar,\u201d as well as \u201cAnywhere For You,\u201d or \u201cDonde Quieras Yo Ir\u00e9.\u201d And it was known that my dad\u2019s favorite song was \u201cI\u2019ll Never Break Your Heart.\u201d But every single birthday and Mother's Day, for my mom, we'd always play \u201cThe Perfect Fan.\u201d",
      "And then, on May 14, 2015, she died unexpectedly in a car crash.",
      "The last day my sister and I saw our mom was on Mother\u2019s Day. We had played \u201cThe Perfect Fan\u201d for her that morning. Yet somehow, inexplicably, four days later we were grieving her.",
      "The Backstreet Boys' song \u201cShow Me the Meaning of Being Lonely,\u201d suddenly took on a new significance for me and my sister. The song is about losing someone close to you; at the time it was released, Kevin Richardson was mourning the death of his father, while Howie Dorough had a sister who had also passed. Additionally, the music video was dedicated to their late producer, Denniz Pop.",
      "Still, I never imagined I'd one day listen to the song while mourning myself.",
      "Fast forward to this summer, which marked 25 years since that first \u201cMillennium\u201d concert \u2014 and 10 years after my mom died. My sister, Dad and I decided we had to attend the anniversary show in Las Vegas; it would be a way to relive an important memory while also commemorating my mom. Plus, one thing my sister and I have learned is that time is sacred \u2014 and we won't always have our dad around to make memories with.",
      "A day before the July 11 opening night concert in Las Vegas, an ache settled in my chest as I thought about my mom not being able to experience this moment with us. I know she would have been so excited to dress up, and to sing every song while spending time with us. I can even picture her once again wearing the Backstreet Boys scarf we bought at the first concert around her ponytail like she once did, much to my delight.",
      "Ahead of their anniversary shows this summer, the Backstreet Boys asked their attendees to wear white. I didn't know if my dad would abide by the suggested dress code \u2014 but to my surprise, when we met up for the show, there he was in a white button-up and steel blue pants.",
      "The group opened the show with their hit \u201cLarger Than Life,\u201d a song my dad instantly knew. We laughed as he jammed out while recording the entire thing on his phone.",
      "As the show continued, we were all hyped up and tuned in to the graphics and visuals. But when photos appeared on the screen of the Backstreet Boys with their mothers, wives and kids, we knew what song was coming: \u201cThe Perfect Fan.\u201d",
      "As the piano played, Kevin took the mic for the first verse. But then, eyes closed, he lifted the mic to his mouth \u2014 then shook his head, unable to sing. We assumed he was overcome with grief and sadness as he remembered his own late mother Ann, who died in 2022.",
      "Tears rolled down my face. I looked over at my sister, and she was also crying. My dad's face was somber; even though my parents weren't in the best place when my mom died, I knew he must have been hurting, too. I even swore I could see him mouthing some of the lyrics.",
      "After that track, all I wanted was to embrace the three of us being together, feeling the power of this shared experience. I captured video of my dad recording \u201cEverybody\u201d and \u201cI Want It That Way\u201d as he proudly sang along to the chorus.",
      "Being the mega BSB fans that we are, my sister and I attended the show for a second time the following weekend.",
      "Once again, when \u201cThe Perfect Fan\u201d came on, my sister became emotional. This time, I put my arm around her. And just like Kevin now found himself able to sing the intro of the song without tearing up, I also managed to keep it together. I thought about how happy my mom would be that we still think of her \u2014 and the memories we shared at our first concert \u2014 whenever that song plays.",
      "And when we sent a selfie to my dad from the concert, he replied in Spanish, \u201cWhat are you doing there without me?\u201d",
      "Looks like we might have to make this a new family tradition."

      "The death of rock icon Ozzy Osbourne and the birth of YouTuber Trisha Paytas\u2019s baby is combining to ressucitate an old and deeply weird conspiracy theory: the Trisha Paytas Baby Curse.",
      "According to legend, a celebrity death accompanies the birth of each of Paytas\u2019s three babies. Even though it doesn\u2019t add up \u2014 in a lot of ways \u2014 the theory persists, and memes abound suggesting that the recently departed musician will be reincarnated as the child of the podcaster who gained fame through viral YouTube videos.",
      "(For the record, TODAY.com does not endorse this theory, which is clearly meant to be tongue-in-cheek.)",
      "What? How? Why?",
      "The theory is part of an internet meme known as the \u201cTrisha Paytas Baby Curse,\u201d which links her pregnancies to the deaths, or illness, of public figures. While entirely speculative, the joke popped up when Pope Francis died while she was pregnant with her third child, who she named Aquaman.",
      "(You read that right, Aquaman. Her two older children are Malibu Barbie and Elvis.)",
      "During the April 22 episode of her podcast, \u201cJust Trish,\u201c Paytas addressed the speculation.",

      "Paytas birthed baby Aquaman on July 12, and announced his name on July 22, the same day Osbourne died.",
      "Fans were quick to note the coincidence.",
      "The internet\u2019s tongue-in-cheek conspiracy is part of a longer-running meme tied to the YouTuber\u2019s pregnancies.",
      "Who Is Trisha Paytas, and Why Is She Famous?",
      "Paytas is a YouTuber, podcaster, and media personality. She has been married to photographer Moses Hacmon since 2021.",
      "She had a cameo on Saturday Night Live in December 2024, and made her Broadway debut in February of 2025 \u2014 and event that started out as a joke, but then became reality.",
      "The Trisha Paytas Baby Curse, Explained",
      "The Trisha Paytas baby curse theory first took hold on Sept. 7, 2022. At the time, Paytas was pregnant with her first child and announced on X that she was 1 centimeter dilated. The update coincided with news of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s declining health and the monarch\u2019s death one day later on Sept. 8, 2022.",
      "\u201cAnd Trisha Paytas is 1 cm dilated\u2026 the prophecy is being fulfilled,\u201d one person wrote of the timing.",
      "When Malibu Barbie was born one week later, fans latched onto the coincidence and sparked theories that Paytas\u2019s newborn daughter was the reincarnation of the British queen.",
      "Not long after Paytas announced that she was expecting her second child, King Charles III publicly revealed his cancer diagnosis. Fans quickly began to suggest that the monarch\u2019s fate might be entangled with Paytas\u2019 pregnancy.",
      "Since his announcement in 2024, Charles has continued to undergo medical treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer. While the king is very much alive, and not reincarnated in the form of Paytas\u2019 child, the conspiracy theory continued to grow.",
      "The beloved pope died on April 21, 2025, and fans quickly connected his fate to Paytas\u2019 pregnancy. While addressing the conspiracy theory that her third child will be Pope Francis reincarnated during her April 22 podcast, Paytas leaned into the meme and joked about the possibility of naming her baby Pope or Francis.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s a boy, I guess we\u2019re naming it Pope. It\u2019s not a bad name,\u201d she commented. \u201cTechnically, there (are) girls named Frances too. So we could have a girl Frances; yeah, my dad is, my dad\u2019s name is Francis.\u201d",
      "When the revered heavy metal musician died at age 76, fans were quick to connect the dots.",
      "The meme may be coming to a natural end, however, as Paytas has publicly declared she does not intend to have more children.",
      "\u201cI feel so good about the decision,\u201d Paytas said on her podcast."

      "SREBRENICA, Bosnia \u2014 Nedzad Avdic stood on a gravel plateau with four men and boys with their hands tied behind their backs, preparing for death. Just 17, Avdic had been captured by Bosnian Serb forces days earlier. Now, he stood yards from an execution squad.",
      "Avdic said he heard shots, felt sharp pain in his right side and right arm and blacked out. When he woke up, more prisoners were being lined up for execution. When the small truck that brought him to the site drove away, Avdic and another wounded man escaped in the darkness. After walking through the woods for days, they crossed into Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "Last week, Avdic recounted his experience to members of the German parliament at an event in Berlin marking the 30th anniversary of the fall of the United Nations-protected \u201csafe area\u201d of Srebrenica. Two international courts have ruled that Bosnian Serbs\u2019 systematic killing of male Bosnian Muslim prisoners \u2014 at least 7,000 in total \u2014 was the first genocide in Europe since World War II.",
      "The following day, members of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD party, argued in parliament that the mass killings did not constitute genocide. \u201cThe Serbs shot men there, but generally spared women and children,\u201d Alexander Wolf said in a speech.",
      "A second AfD member, Martin Sichert, invoked a conspiracy theory, warning that Muslims were waging a \u201cbirth jihad\u201d in Germany, a reference to Muslim immigrants someday outnumbering Germans. \u201cSrebrenica reminds us to end multiculturalism before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Sichert warned.",
      "As disinformation spreads online, denialism about war crimes \u2014 both past and ongoing \u2014 is growing increasingly common worldwide, experts warn. From current conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza to past atrocities in Syria, Bosnia and Rwanda, as well as the Holocaust, basic facts are now disputed or dismissed.",
      "Denialism is proving politically profitable, as well. In February, the AfD won the second-most seats in Germany\u2019s parliament, the best showing by a far-right party since World War II. In Bosnia, a local Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, has gained support by spreading conspiracy theories about Srebrenica, calling it \u201can arranged tragedy.\u201d He dismisses the identification of 6,981 victims \u2014 part of the largest DNA identification project in history\u2014 as a hoax.",
      "Dodik's office did not respond to a request for comment. After this article was published, Sichert said in an email that he believes it's critical to investigate the causes of massacres \"because this way the death of the people at least has a little meaning.\"",
      "He went on to ask why is Srebenica recognized as a genocide but not Hiroshima. \"Because victors write history,\" Sichert said. \"Every civilian casualty should be considered equally no matter who won the war.\"",
      "Wolf, in a separate email, said that \"commemoration should not be one-sided\" and cited the killings of Serbs in the village of Kravica by Bosnian Muslim forces from Srebrenica during the war.",
      "But war crimes prosecutors and journalists found that of forty-five Serbs who died in Kravica, thirty-five were soldiers, including five who were killed after being taken prisoner. The number of Bosnian Muslims killed by Serb forces after being taken prisoner is in the thousands.",
      "Growing Denialism",
      "At a conference in Srebrenica marking the 30th anniversary of the mass killings here, the heads of the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda and the Auschwitz-Birkenau and Stutthof concentration camp museums in Poland warned that spreading lies online about war crimes has also become financially profitable.",
      "War crimes denialism generates so much traffic online that making money \u2014 not political or ideological gain \u2014 appears to motivate some of its purveyors.",
      "At one point, the directors discussed whether better influencers might help, and several of them agreed that they could.",
      "Avdic is determined to be one of them. As denialism spreads, he is more determined than ever to use what is left of his life to speak for the men and boys who died beside him on that gravel 30 years ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more aggressive day by day,\u201d he said, referring to denialism. \u201cYou have to know that we are all foreign bodies on this Earth, and we will all evaporate naturally sooner or later.\u201d",
      "A U.N.-protected \u2018safe area\u2019",
      "I first met Avdic 30 years ago covering the war in Bosnia as a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor. After the fall of Srebrenica, rumors spread that Bosnian Muslim men were describing mass executions. Avdic, then a shell-shocked teenager whose father was later found in a mass grave, was one of nine men who told me they had survived mass executions. When I later visited the gravel plateau beside an earthen dam in the village of Petkovci, I found two human femurs.",
      "Avdic and his father were among the roughly 10,000 Bosnian Muslim men who fled Srebrenica on foot when Bosnian Serb forces attacked in July 1995. The surrounded town had been declared an internationally protected \u201csafe area,\u201d but the United States, Europe and 600 Dutch U.N. peacekeepers did little to protect it",
      "Women, children and elderly men took refuge at a large battery factory that Dutch peacekeepers had turned into their main base. And men, most of them unarmed, set off through the woods on a 60-mile trek to Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "When Serb forces attacked the column, Avdic and his father were separated in the chaos. \u201cI lost him,\u201d Avdic recalled. \u201cI lost him immediately.\u201d He continued walking with strangers but was eventually captured. Two days later, he and other men were taken to the gravel plateau, and the executions began.",
      "Needing to speak",
      "For the next 12 years, Avdic testified at war crimes trials about the executions under a pseudonym and lived far from Srebrenica, fearing for his safety. In 2007, he returned to Srebrenica, his hometown. He and other Bosnian Muslims felt a duty to return to the area and preserve its Muslim community. Avdic, who had grown up in a village outside the town and also lost four uncles and three cousins in the killings, found being in Srebrenica comforting.",
      "\u201cI have less nightmares,\u201d he said, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cI cannot explain it.\u201d",
      "In 2014, when he visited the execution site during an event with mothers of the victims, he was filled with a desire to speak publicly about the mass killing he survived.",
      "\u201cWhen I came to the place, something forced me to say something; I felt a strong need to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cWords started to flow, something stronger than me.\u201d",
      "He met his wife, Elvisa, a Bosnian Muslim survivor whose uncle and cousin also died in the executions, in Srebrenica in 2008. The following year, they married. Now, Nedzad works as a manager at a company in Srebrenica that produces parts for luxury car interiors. Elvisa works at a local meteorological station. They have three daughters who attend local school alongside Serb children. Serbs and Muslims coexist but generally don\u2019t discuss the war.",
      "\u201cHatred destroys, first of all, those who hate,\u201d Avdic said.",
      "In recent years, Avdic has given dozens of speeches about the massacres in multiple countries and called for the protection of civilians in Ukraine and Syria. Speaking about Srebrenica is difficult but cathartic. \u201cIt was my choice to go to Berlin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not something that I wish. It is emotional, and it is difficult for me.\u201d",
      "Local Bosnian Muslims have transformed the cavernous former car battery factory that Dutch U.N. peacekeepers used as a base into a museum documenting the genocide. Across the street, the headstones of the thousands of Muslim men and boys killed in the massacres cover a lush green field and hillside.",
      "In recent years, though, Muslims have slowly left Srebrenica, many of them citing economic and safety concerns. Once a majority-Muslim town, Srebrenica is now roughly half-Serb, half-Muslim.",
      "Elvisa, Avdic\u2019s wife, said she worries about her children\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cI was 13 years old then in 1995. My daughter is now 13 years old,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m more emotional about that time. When we are older, we care more and we feel more.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur grandmother was killed,\u201d she added. \u201cThey cut her throat.\u201d",
      "Defiance and threats",
      "Avdic said provocations still happen, including when a local priest once played Serb nationalist songs to taunt Muslim residents.",
      "\u201cHe will die with his evil,\u201d Avdic said of the priest.",
      "As denialism spreads, Serb nationalists have grown more defiant. In nearby towns, Avdic is sometimes recognized and mocked by them.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of them,\u201d he said, though he acknowledged the danger. \u201cYou never know what could happen, because I\u2019m a witness.\u201d",
      "Avdic and his wife are torn. Leaving Srebrenica might be better for their children, but Avdic believes it is his duty to raise his family here and speak for the men and boys who died beside him.",
      "\u201cI will die proud,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I believe my children will be proud they were born here.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Soccer fans know it as \u201challowed ground,\u201d so when Billie Sky Walker walked onto the field at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium two years ago, she achieved a dream held by players around the world.",
      "Before a Community Shield men\u2019s match between Manchester City and Arsenal in August 2023, she proudly donned an official shirt as a representative of the Football Association, the regulatory body for soccer in England, that read, \u201cThe FA is for all.\u201d",
      "Today, the 28-year-old is barred from playing in FA-organized tournaments following a landmark judgment by Britain\u2019s Supreme Court in April that said the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is based on biological sex \u2014 a huge blow to campaigners for transgender rights that could have far-reaching implications for a wide range of life in the U.K., be it admission to changing rooms or decisions on hospital beds, equal pay claims and domestic violence shelters.",
      "After the judgment, a number of sporting governing bodies, including the FA, changed their rules so that only those born biologically female are allowed to play, excluding Walker and 28 other transgender players across England from the association. The Scottish Football Association followed suit, and Northern Ireland\u2019s Irish Football Association appears likely to do the same.",
      "Describing the ruling as \u201cconfusing and upsetting,\u201d Walker said she had been welcomed \u201cinto this space\u201d by her cisgender peers, or women whose gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth.",
      "Calling the decision to bar Walker \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d her former teammate Lucy Leiter, 24, said it was not the case that \u201conly trans women think they should play,\u201d adding, \u201cThe support has been unequivocal from everyone I\u2019ve ever played with.\u201d",
      "Walker, who said she felt that she was a girl from the age of 5 and transitioned at the age of 24, said that playing soccer on a women\u2019s team \u201creally established a huge essence of who I am, because it gave me the safety and comfort and knowledge that I\u2019m enough.\u201d",
      "Intense debate",
      "The Supreme Court ruling came amid intense and sometimes toxic public debate in the U.K. over the intersection of transgender and women\u2019s rights. The debate has also simmered in the U.S., where President Donald Trump has made it one of his signature issues by signing an executive order in February banning trans women from women\u2019s sports at the national level.",
      "In December 2022, Scottish lawmakers approved a bill that allowed anyone over the age of 16 to change their gender identity using gender certificates, removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the medical term for the distress that results from the conflict between someone\u2019s gender identity and sex assigned at birth.",
      "The campaign group For Women Scotland later brought a legal case against the semiautonomous government, arguing that sex-based protections should apply only to people who were born female.",
      "And Britain\u2019s central government blocked the law the following year, invoking for the first time a section of the 25-year-old act that gave the Scottish Parliament control over most of its own affairs.",
      "The For Women Scotland case nonetheless worked its way through the court system, reaching the Supreme Court this spring.",
      "After the court\u2019s 12 justices ruled unanimously in the group\u2019s favor, the presiding judge, Lord Hodge, said the decision should not be seen as \u201ca triumph of one side over the other,\u201d and emphasized that transgender people remain protected under the law.",
      "For Women Scotland campaigners celebrated the verdict with hugs, tears of happiness and Champagne as they left the courtroom.",
      "\u201cThere was elation and disbelief and, yes, I was absolutely thrilled,\u201d Susan Smith, one of the group\u2019s co-founders, told NBC News in a telephone interview last month. \u201cIf people were entitled to say that their sex in law had changed, you can\u2019t control who applies for that.\u201d",
      "For Smith and her group, the issue of legal gender recognition touches on who gets to make decisions about women\u2019s lives and bodies, including their access to spaces from hospital wards to rape crisis centers and prisons."

      "But around 13 million years ago, one of them may have fallen prey to an even larger creature, a team of paleontologists in Colombia have discovered after examining bite marks in a fossilized bone of one of the fearsome birds.",
      "Publishing their findings in the peer-reviewed scientific journal \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team hypothesized that it was killed and eaten or consumed through scavenging by a medium sized caiman, a crocodile-like reptile.",
      "\u201cThis is a fascinating story of the interaction of two very iconic animals in the past,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Link, the study\u2019s lead author, told NBC News in an email Wednesday. \u201cWe actually found not only the first record of a terror bird in northern south America, but the tooth marks of a large caiman that has probably fed on it,\u201d he added.",
      "Terror bird fossils, which are rare, have mostly been identified in the southern part of the continent.",
      "While tooth marks are \u201cnot uncommon\u201d in the fossil record, it\u2019s \u201cexciting\u201d to find evidence that indicates an apex predator being hunted or scavenged by another, said Link, an associate professor of  biological sciences at the Los Andes University in Colombia.",
      "Writing in \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team said the teeth marks showed no signs of healing, suggesting that the attack was fatal.",
      "Based on the finding, they added that terror birds might have faced higher risk of being killed and eaten than previously expected.",
      "To identify the attacker, Link and his team scanned the fossil and analyzed the size, shape and spacing of the tooth marks. After comparing those marks with teeth of crocodyliforms from the region, they concluded that the trace maker was likely a juvenile caiman about 15 feet long.",
      "It remains \u201cvery difficult\u201d to know if the caiman ate the terror bird after killing it or whether it scavenged the carcass, Link said. If the bird was alive, it was likely attacked while drinking at a river, researchers wrote, and conversely, if it was dead, the caiman found and fed on its body near water.",
      "\u201cThis story will not be told completely as we have no further evidence to choose between these two hypotheses.\u201d Link said.",
      "The discovery challenges the assumption of \u201ca linear relation between predators feeding on herbivores feeding in plants,\u201d he added. \u201cThe food web is really much more complex.\u201d",
      "The lower part of the bird\u2019s left leg bone used in the study was unearthed in the renowned La Venta fossil beds of Colombia two decades ago by Cesar Perdomo, a local paleontologist."

      "The deadly strike July 17 drew international condemnation, including from the Vatican, with Pope Leo XIV calling for an end to the \u201cbarbarity of war.\"",
      "President Donald Trump also spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the wake of the mortar strike, with his administration calling for an investigation.",
      "\"Everyone is appalled,\" White House spokesperson Tammy Bruce said at the time.",
      "Netanyahu's office subsequently expressed regret over the strike, while the Israeli military said it would conduct an investigation.",
      "On Wednesday, it announced that the southern command had completed its inquiry the day before, determining that troops had struck the church \"due to an unintentional deviation of munitions,\" in line with its preliminary statement that the strike was accidental.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces acknowledged that the impact of the strike \"caused damage to the structure\" of the church and \"injured several Gazan civilians.\" It did not acknowledge that three people were killed in the incident, according to church officials. Asked to comment on why the fatalities were not mentioned, the IDF acknowledged it was aware of the deaths.",
      "In an interview with Italy\u2019s Corriere della Sera newspaper shortly after the strike, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, expressed doubts over Israel's initial statements which called the incident a mistake.",
      "\u201cWe are not a target. They say it was an error. Even if everybody here believes it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Pizzaballa said.",
      "Francis had made near-nightly calls to Holy Family Church throughout the war in Gaza and up until the days before his death in April, speaking with parish priest, Rev. Gabriel Romanelli, who was injured in last week's attack.",
      "The IDF said adjustments had been made to \u201cimprove the accuracy of fire\u201d during the operation in which the church was struck \u2014 and that following the incident, \u201cguidelines for opening fire near religious buildings, shelters, and other sensitive sites were further clarified.\u201d Asked for further information on what adjustments had been made and how guidelines were further clarified, an IDF spokesperson would not elaborate beyond the initial statement.",
      "Throughout the war in Gaza, civilians have frequently been killed in strikes impacting civilian buildings and shelters, including religious sites.",
      "Last week's incident was also not the first time Holy Family Church has come under attack. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem accused Israeli forces of fatally shooting a woman and her daughter as they walked inside its grounds in December 2023.",
      "Francis condemned the attack at the time. Israeli officials denied responsibility.",
      "The IDF sought to emphasize Wednesday that it had facilitated the transfer of aid to Holy Family Church, in addition to coordinating the visit of a delegation on behalf of the Greek and Latin patriarchs, who were accompanied by a group of Christian clergy. Pizzaballa was among those to make the rare and dangerous trip, with Israel having sealed off the enclave to visits from foreign officials.",
      "The IDF's completion of its probe and the release of its findings were markedly swift, with the military still to release the results of a growing number of investigations since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Israel launched its assault following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 59,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in the enclave, while much of the territory has been destroyed."

    "summary": "MLB sees major growth opportunity in India for both fans and players, led by Blue Jays prospect Arjun Nimmala.",
    "story": [
      "Baseball is known as America\u2019s pastime, but it has long been a global game. From the Dominican Republic to Japan to Venezuela, the sport reigns supreme for fans, and countless players are on Major League Baseball rosters.",
      "The next country that could soon be on that list? India.",
      "While its residents may prefer a different game with a ball and a bat \u2014 cricket \u2014 it\u2019s also the motherland of Arjun Nimmala, the top prospect in the Toronto Blue Jays organization. Picked 20th overall in the 2023 draft, Nimmala is the first first-generation Indian American to be selected in the first round.",
      "Nimmala, who grew up outside Tampa, Florida, said his father introduced him to cricket at a young age but also taught him baseball. He fell in love with the sport and played competitively all the way through high school until the Blue Jays selected him at just 17 years old.",
      "Two years later, he is ranked No. 46 out of 900 prospects by MLB and considered a future centerpiece of the organization.",
      "While Nimmala, currently with the Blue Jays\u2019 high-A affiliate Vancouver Canadians, continues to ascend the minor leagues, MLB is doing extensive outreach in India by putting together tournaments for children and taking baseball programs to schools.",
      "\u201cWe want to try to introduce the sport to as many kids as possible,\u201d Chris Marinak, MLB\u2019s chief operations and strategy officer, told NBC News. \u201cThat\u2019s the foot in the door. That\u2019s the way that you educate kids on the game \u2014 you get kids to fall in love with it, and they become fans for the rest of their lives.\u201d",
      "He said the goal is to take baseball to India both on the fields and inside homes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on getting our MLB games on broadcast and streaming,\u201d Marinak said. \u201cWe have two partners in India right now that are putting games live for the postseason and the regular season, and we\u2019re seeing great interest from fans around consumption.\u201d",
      "MLB opened an office in India in 2019 and since 2021 has hosted the MLB Cup, a tournament for amateur youth teams across the country.",
      "Nimmala traveled to India in 2023 to see the initiatives the league was producing and to help grow the game in the country where much of his family still lives.",
      "\u201cTo be able to go there and not only see that baseball is a part of India, as well, but just also trying to make it bigger, I think that makes me super proud,\u201d Nimmala said. \u201cKnowing that I have a possibility of doing that and just seeing how much baseball is played in India already, I thought was very cool.\u201d",
      "Asked how big baseball can be in India, a country with 1.46 billion people, Marinak said MLB has high goals.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a billion fans that are watching cricket, it creates a real opportunity to grow the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can get baseball to the scale of cricket, it would be a huge penetration into that market. It would look a lot like what you see in Japan [and the] United States. It can be done.\u201d",
      "Nimmala says the goal remains to make the major leagues, though that could take multiple years because of his age and experience. His 17 home runs last year led all players ages 18 or younger, and after some early-season struggles, he turned up his production in the second half.",
      "From June 27 on, Nimmala hit .265/.331/.564 with 13 homers over his final 53 games.",
      "Known as a solid fielder, he has elite arm strength, according to MLB.com.",
      "But the stats tell only one part of his story. By just being on the field, Nimmala is inspiring a whole new generation of Indian players.",
      "\u201cI do get a lot of messages, especially on Instagram, from younger kids that are Indian that start to play baseball,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Dude, I really look up to you.\u2019 I think it\u2019s super cool to see that.\u201d",
      "But even with all the responsibilities of being a trailblazer, he\u2019s keeping his eyes on the prize.",
      "\u201cI have 100% confidence that I will play with the Toronto Blue Jays one day and make an impact.\u201d"

      "As Russian drones peppered their homes, their loved ones fought in trenches and their negotiators waded through more pessimistic diplomacy, Ukrainians waged a new battle on the streets of Kyiv and other major cities.",
      "Activists called for further protests Wednesday over a law signed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that curbs the country's top two anti-corruption agencies. The move already fueled the first major demonstrations since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, and it drew alarm from European officials and experts.",
      "\u201cDestroy Russians, not democracy,\u201d one of the hastily drawn cardboard signs in Kyiv read, while crowds yelled \u201cShame!\u201d and \u201cVeto the law!\u201d",

      "While details of the new bill haven\u2019t been made public, it appears to backtrack on the law that sparked the protests.",
      "Before Zelenskyy\u2019s announcement, Natalia, 48, a therapist who, like many in this febrile atmosphere, doesn\u2019t want to use her last name, said trying to restrict anti-corruption agencies risked \u201cendangering the values of freedom, democracy in our country and the future of our children.\u201d",

      "Many worried that the sudden crisis might have offered the Kremlin a powerful propaganda tool and could have threatened not just Ukraine\u2019s unity, but also its support from the West at a crucial moment in the war.",
      "Parliament had swiftly passed the controversial law giving Zelenskyy\u2019s prosecutor general sweeping powers over the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office. He said he did that to make them more efficient and to clear out \u201cRussian influence,\u201d but critics feared it would further enhance the power of his divisive inner circle.",
      "It prompted howls of outrage and dismay, from not just Ukrainians themselves, but also Western officials and experts alarmed that the country could be backsliding on its endemic graft problem. It came a week after the arrest of a prominent anti-corruption campaigner who had embarrassed senior officials with investigations into their affairs.",
      "All of it overshadowed a third round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine that began Wednesday in Istanbul.",
      "Though both sides remain pessimistic about serious progress, they are the first discussions since President Donald Trump gave Russian President Vladimir Putin a 50-day ultimatum to agree to a truce or face new tariffs. Most observers expect another prisoner exchange but little else.",
      "Many Ukrainians are also worried that the country\u2019s opponents will weaponize Zelenskyy\u2019s move as evidence of the corruption that they say makes supporting Kyiv untenable.",
      "The head of Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence directorate, Kyrylo Budanov, even appeared to question the move, warning that \u201cUkrainian history has taught us that a nation loses if it is torn apart by internal contradictions.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s endemic corruption is one of the reasons it hasn\u2019t been accepted into the European Union and NATO.",
      "Marta Kos, the E.U.\u2019s commissioner for enlargement, said she was \u201cseriously concerned\u201d about the new law, which she called a \u201cserious step back.\u201d",
      "Responding to the criticism Wednesday, Zelenskyy said: \u201cWe all share a common enemy: the Russian occupiers. And defending the Ukrainian state requires a strong enough law enforcement and anti-corruption system \u2014 one that ensures a real sense of justice.\u201d",
      "It also requires air defense against the nightly waves of drones launched by Russia.",

      "A podcast popular among young men shocked the internet this week with an unexpected interview guest: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "But Netanyahu\u2019s bid to appeal to young people appeared to backfire online, where the interview drew widespread criticism from viewers across the political spectrum.",
      "His interviewers, Kyle Forgeard and Aaron \u201cSteiny\u201d Steinberg, are members of the Nelk Boys, a group of social media influencers known for their vlogs and prank videos. The group, which has amassed more than 8.5 million subscribers on YouTube, attracted even more fans after its content began to highlight more conservative political figures, including President Donald Trump, whom the podcast interviewed in 2022, 2023 and 2024.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s hourlong interview, which dropped on the Nelk Boys\u2019 \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d on Monday, was met with overwhelmingly critical reception online, with viewers accusing the podcasters of asking softball questions and neglecting to push back against Netanyahu\u2019s claims.",
      "Netanyahu and his government continue to face worldwide outrage over the war in Gaza that followed the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The podcast\u2019s YouTube channel lost more than 10,000 subscribers within a day, according to the social media tracking platform Social Blade. On YouTube, top comments on the episode were critical of the hosts\u2019 apparent lack of preparedness.",
      "\u201cI see so much stuff about what\u2019s going on in Israel and Iran and Palestine, and to be honest, I just really don\u2019t know what is going on there,\u201d Forgeard said in the episode. Steinberg said he was similarly hoping to \u201cget educated\u201d by interviewing Netanyahu.",
      "At one point, the topic of discussion turned to Netanyahu\u2019s and Trump\u2019s shared affection for hamburgers. Asked about his go-to McDonald\u2019s order, Netanyahu revealed that he prefers Burger King, leading Steinberg to respond, appalled: \u201cThat\u2019s your worst take, I think.\u201d",
      "Throughout the rest of the interview, Netanyahu condemned anti-Israel protesters as \u201cun-American\u201d and contrasted life in Israel with life under the oppressive regime in Iran. He also railed against New York\u2019s Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, calling his proposals for the city \u201cnonsense.\u201d (Mamdani has called Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza \u201cgenocide\u201d and has said he would arrest Netanyahu, who is the subject of a warrant for his arrest from the International Criminal Court, if he visited New York City.)",
      "Asked why he\u2019s \u201cso hated worldwide,\u201d Netanyahu answered: \u201cWell, a lot of propaganda. First of all, I\u2019m not hated worldwide.\u201d He said Israel has received a lot of goodwill from many in Europe, claiming that Israel\u2019s attack on Iran also \u201cliberated them, because those Iranian missiles were geared at Europe, too, and ultimately at America.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe propaganda is there, I don\u2019t deny it,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cBut people also have, you know, sometimes the truth beckons. And what Israel did with President Trump is safeguard free societies from a menace. I mean, this Iranian regime hangs gays from cranes.\u201d",
      "On Monday, 25 countries, including Britain, Japan and many European nations, called on Israel to end the war in Gaza \u2014 a sign of Israel\u2019s traditional allies\u2019 dismay over the conflict\u2019s humanitarian toll. Close to 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities, with much of the enclave\u2019s population driven from their homes and pushed to the edge of starvation.",
      "The Israeli military and government officials have repeatedly accused Hamas of exploiting civilian sites, including hospitals and schools, as cover for its operations, an accusation that health officials and Hamas have denied.",
      "Israel has also faced mounting accusations of war crimes and genocide, including in a case brought by South Africa before the International Court of Justice, the United Nations\u2019 top court. The court last year ordered Israel to do everything it could to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza. Both Israel and the United States have rejected accusations of genocide.",
      "Online, clips of Netanyahu\u2019s interview drew viral backlash from viewers, many of whom accused the Nelk Boys of platforming \u201cgenocide propaganda\u201d and compared interviewing Netanyahu to interviewing Adolf Hitler.",
      "Far-left political streamer Hasan Piker and far-right white supremacist Nick Fuentes were among those who criticized the latest \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d episode Monday during separate livestreams on their platforms.",
      "\u201cYou just basically presented someone who is a war criminal, someone who is doing a genocide, in a somewhat neutral light,\u201d Piker told Forgeard and Steinberg in his stream. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t be neutral when you have someone like Benjamin Netanyahu directly in an opportunity to talk to him. But that\u2019s what happened, so there is moral culpability here for you guys individually.\u201d",
      "He added that while he would agree to interview Netanyahu if he were given the opportunity, he would be \u201cwell-equipped\u201d to fact-check his statements and push back against potentially dubious claims.",
      "Forgeard, in response, countered that their style of interviewing could \"give us the opportunity to get the biggest people in the world.\"",
      "\"And I think you\u2019ll know by the 'Full Send Podcast' when you watch it, it\u2019s like, 'Hey, these guys are going to get big guests. We might not necessarily get these guys grilling these people,'\" Forgeard said. \"And that\u2019s just what you\u2019re going to come to expect.\"",
      "Fuentes, in his own stream with Forgeard and Steinberg, also questioned the moral equivalency between himself, who has faced condemnation online for his views and beliefs, and \u201ca foreign head of state who is killing women and children.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is somebody who\u2019s in the process of committing what is effectively an ethnic cleansing and a genocide,\u201d Fuentes said.",
      "The interview struggled to land positively even among some supporters of Netanyahu\u2019s military agenda. In The Times of Israel on Tuesday, contributor Elkana Bar Eitan expressed his disappointment that Netanyahu \u201cblew it\u201d on the podcast, despite the lack of pushback he got from the hosts.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to witness how Netanyahu, once a master communicator, missed this opportunity and showed that he\u2019s lost his touch, even in English,\u201d he wrote in an opinion piece. \u201cDespite the friendly atmosphere and softball questions, Netanyahu came across as completely detached from reality.\u201d",
      "A representative for the \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d declined to comment.",
      "In a video responding to the backlash, Steinberg and Forgeard said they plan to \u201cgive the other side the opportunity\u201d to speak on their next episode, though it\u2019s unclear what guest they\u2019re referring to.",
      "\u201cSomeone has to do it,\u201d Forgeard said. \u201cAnd if we have to take the fall and be the bad guys for having the controversial people on, I think we\u2019re willing to do it.\u201d"

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s parliament on Tuesday passed legislation that would tighten oversight of two key anti-corruption agencies, which critics say could significantly weaken their independence and give President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s circle greater sway over investigations.",
      "Thousands of people gathered in Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine to urge the president to veto the controversial bill that threatens anti-corruption infrastructure. It marked the first major rally against the government in more than three years of war.",
      "Fighting entrenched corruption is crucial for Ukraine\u2019s bid to join the European Union and maintain access to billions of dollars in Western aid. The legislation\u2019s passage has triggered public outrage in Ukraine, and protest was held Tuesday in Kyiv.",
      "The changes would grant the prosecutor general new authority over investigations and cases handled by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office (SAPO)."

    "summary": "Organized crime is affecting hospitals in some Mexican states, even taking over operating rooms and emergency rooms and forcing doctors and personnel to treat the wounded.",
    "story": [
      "Despite all his years of experience and technical training, the doctor\u2019s voice trembled when he recalled how organized crime groups have taken control of emergency rooms and medical facilities in some parts of Mexico.",
      "\u201cThey force us to come in through threatening phone calls, in the early hours of the morning, and they tell us: \u2018We\u2019re just a few meters from where you live, and you\u2019re with your family. If you don\u2019t treat this person, we\u2019re going to pick you up right here,\u2019\u201d said the doctor, who works at a health center in Guanajuato, in central Mexico, and who requested complete anonymity for fear of reprisal.",
      "In many regions of Mexico, organized crime attacks have affected hospitals, even taking over operating rooms and emergency rooms, where hitmen kidnap medical personnel to force them to treat the wounded in the frequent clashes they wage with other cartels.",
      "The doctor interviewed by Noticias Telemundo in Guanajuato claimed that, on one occasion, he was contacted in the early hours by a high-ranking local drug operative, who made an unusual request.",
      "\u201cI received a call requesting treatment for a person who had been shot by a firearm. And they arrived at the main entrances of the hospitals with long guns, demanding treatment for their patient,\u201d the doctor said. On several occasions, the doctor said, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel forced him to use his equipment to treat hitmen.",
      "Noticias Telemundo confirmed that both the local boss and the hitman whose life was saved later died in a confrontation with the Mexican army. For the safety of the doctor interviewed in Guanajuato, their names are being withheld.",
      "According to the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board, cartels and criminal groups continue to contribute to the high levels of violence in Mexico.",
      "\u201cOrganized crime continues to be a key player in the lives of Mexicans. This is evident because some criminal groups have managed to force the Mexican state to lose control of certain territories, and because of the corruption and impunity that allow them to continue to reign and expand their capabilities,\u201d Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, co-director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University, said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo.",
      "So far, official data shows that from September 2024 to April 2025, there was a 32.9% decrease in the daily average of intentional homicide victims, falling from 86.9 victims per day to 58.3.",
      "However, disappearances increased significantly: In the first 100 days of Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s administration, 4,010 disappearances were recorded, an average of 40 per day, compared with the figure of 25 recorded during the previous six-year term.",
      "\u201cThere are many missing people who, in reality, have already been kidnapped by drug traffickers and buried in so-called narco-graves,\u201d said David Saucedo, a security analyst based in Mexico City. \u201cThe cartels are hiding the bodies, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing a reduction in homicides in several states across the country. But it\u2019s not that there are fewer deaths; there are fewer bodies. They\u2019re hiding the bodies,\u201d Saucedo asserted.",
      "'This shouldn't be normal'",
      "According to the latest report from the Mexican government, Guanajuato is the state with the most (980 from January to April 2025). In February 2025, the daily average reached 12.5. Last year, the National Survey of Victimization and Perception of Public Safety revealed that 87.5% of the population considered public safety to be the state\u2019s most serious problem.",
      "\u201cIn Guanajuato, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel is fighting over drug trafficking with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, and that\u2019s generating a lot of violence,\u201d Correa-Cabrera explained. \u201cThese organized crime groups are fighting for control of spaces because they need more street space, there are more feuds, and that\u2019s leading to more injuries and deaths, so they\u2019re taking control of medical centers.\u201d",
      "Noticias Telemundo visited Guanajuato to document the case of a health center in the city of Celaya, where wounded drug traffickers were treated. According to a state intelligence report, until three years ago, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel used the San Ferm\u00edn Clinic to treat its wounded hitmen. However, in November 2022, gunmen from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel killed two men there and set fire to the now-abandoned facility.",
      "\u201cThe hospital where I work in Guanajuato isn\u2019t the only one that\u2019s suffered this, nor am I the only doctor who\u2019s experienced this. We see in the news that these people are arriving at certain public hospitals,\u201d the Guanajuato doctor said, adding that \u201cI can say that more colleagues have experienced this. One lives with anxiety, and this shouldn\u2019t be normal for us.\u201d",
      "Due to the strong presence of criminal groups, the Guanajuato state police have implemented operations in clinics and hospitals in several municipalities of the state, to prevent drug cartels from continuing to infiltrate those places.",
      "\u201cWhen people injured with a firearm arrive, the prosecutor\u2019s office sends us a custody request. When these people arrive, we coordinate to provide security at the hospitals,\u201d said Bernardo Cajero, director of the Celaya police and in charge of these security operations.",
      "However, the Guanajuato doctor explained that although the Silver Code has been established in Mexico \u2014 a protocol that requires authorities to be notified when there are episodes of violence or when a person with a gunshot wound arrives at a health center \u2014\u00a0this is not always followed.",
      "\u201cThey come and take our cellphones, cut us off from communication, and start threatening us, saying that if they see anything strange, they could hurt us themselves,\u201d the doctor said, with fear in his voice. \u201cOne of the things they\u2019re asking is that we not activate Code Silver and that we not notify the authorities.\u201d",
      "'It affects us all'",
      "Although there are no official figures on armed takeovers of health centers, the Guanajuato case is not unique in Mexico. In April 2024, a 10-person armed group entered a private medical center in Cuernavaca and shot and killed a patient in intensive care. In September, gunmen threatened staff at the Mexican Social Security Institute in Mazatl\u00e1n with the phrase \u201cIf they die, you die,\u201d forcing them to care for their wounded. Two months later, two attacks were reported at the Culiac\u00e1n General Hospital.",
      "\u201cWhat the drug cartels do is take over hospitals, kidnap nurses, doctors, specialists, blood banks, operating rooms, and whatever else they need. They are hospital centers where the wounded are seen and treated, so they can return to their criminal activities,\u201d Saucedo said.",
      "In 2022, a report by Insecurity Insight for the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition \u2014 a group of nongovernmental organizations focused on protecting health care \u2014 warned that Mexico had documented the most violent incidents against health care workers in Latin America: at that time, 14 recorded incidents, including three deaths, five kidnappings, two destroyed or damaged medical facilities and a damaged or looted  medical unit.",
      "\u201cBefore, they would leave their wounded in clinics, but then they would be finished off by rival groups,\u201d Saucedo said, \u201cnow, for added security, many drug trafficking groups are setting up private hospitals for themselves.\u201d",
      "Saucedo and other experts cited as examples of this trend the complaints about the hospital built by the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as   \u201cEl Mencho,\u201d and the mobile clinic set up by the Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada.",
      "Researchers like Correa-Cabrera warn that these incidents also occur in other countries experiencing major security crises, such as Haiti, Ecuador and the Argentine city of Rosario, or in contexts of conventional warfare, such as the conflicts in Syria, Lebanon, Somalia and Libya, among others.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t something new; this is part of any armed conflict, low-intensity conflict, or war,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said, \u201cbecause health care for members of these warring groups is very important.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Guanajuato doctor says the tension generated by these incidents, in which armed groups enter hospitals, is sometimes so great that medical staff request vacation time and psychological support.",
      "\u201cThe first thing is to save that person\u2019s life, regardless of the situation or the accusations, because they are human beings,\u201d the doctor said, \u201cbut it affects us all; it can cause trauma. In fact, there were colleagues who asked for their leave, and anyone would do that. It\u2019s normal when you live with that every day.\u201d",

    "summary": "Ukranian activists warn about corruption and authoritarianism after police raids against several high-profile anti-corruption campaigners and opposition figures.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine risks backsliding on its endemic corruption problem \u2014 and even creeping toward authoritarianism \u2014 activists warn, following police raids against a high-profile anti-corruption campaigner and opposition figures.",
      "On July 11, armed police raided the home of Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center. He has accused President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of \u201ctaking the first, but confident steps toward corrupt authoritarianism,\u201d including backing laws offering amnesty to those accused of corruption in the defense industry, and passing over an independently selected candidate for a key anti-graft role.",
      "The move has perturbed even some of Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters \u2014 people who are simultaneously worried about the heavy-handed and potentially spurious crackdown on dissent, and that such criticisms against the Ukrainian leader might be used in bad faith by opponents in Moscow or Washington.",
      "\u201cThis is the red line which President Zelensky has crossed \u2014 and the red line is in a very wrong direction in terms of the development of Ukraine,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, the Kyiv-based watchdog that Shabunin co-founded. She said the State Bureau of Investigations did not have the necessary court documents for the search.",
      "Shabunin has been charged with evading military service and fraud, with prosecutors alleging that while on secondment from the front lines to continue his activism back in Kyiv, he conducted activities unrelated to his military service. His defense team and supporters say the secondment was all aboveboard and ordered by his superiors, and that the allegations are trumped up and political.",
      "The case has caused grave alarm for many inside Ukraine and abroad, with even some of those who praise Zelenskyy for making progress on corruption flagging it as cause for concern that he may be engaging in some of the same questionable practices they\u2019d hoped he was rooting out.",
      "Zelenskyy pledged to reduce corruption when he was elected in 2019, and many expert observers say he has been effective at doing so, but the tide of criticism around Shabunin\u2019s arrest comes when the president is under intense pressure to fight off Russia and keep alive support from the United States and the West that has been at risk of faltering.",
      "It\u2019s not just Shabunin\u2019s own organization that\u2019s concerned. A group of 59 nongovernmental and civil society organizations, both inside Ukraine and abroad, have signed an open letter to Zelenskyy saying the arrest \u201cbears signs of political motivation, abuse of rights\u201d and either \u201cgross incompetence\u201d or \u201ca deliberate attack to pressure\u201d Shabunin.",
      "NBC News has contacted Zelenskyy\u2019s office and the State Bureau of Investigations for comment but has not received a response.",
      "The president has been a longtime vocal advocate on the issue of fighting corruption, particularly when it comes to suggestions from the U.S. and elsewhere that the billions of dollars in military aid his country is receiving might be being misappropriated.",
      "\u201cWhere we saw risks that something could be happening with weapons, we cracked down hard,\u201d he told the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d in January.",
      "Last year Shabunin himself dismissed the idea that foreign arms could be embezzled, telling the BBC that \u201call weapons supplied by Western allies end up in the hands of Ukrainian troops who use them effectively. It is impossible to steal Western weapons.\u201d",
      "Shabunin appeared in court Tuesday and was released on \u201crecognizance\u201d \u2014 essentially released without having to post bail \u2014 until the next hearing Aug. 20.",
      "The German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank and one of the international signatories of the letter to Zelenskyy, said Ukraine had made \u201cmonumental strides\u201d on corruption in the past 11 years.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s always concerning when a government targets its vocal critics with flimsy charges in politically motivated investigations,\u201d said Josh Rudolph, managing director and senior fellow of Strategic Democracy Initiatives at the fund. \u201cAlthough this is not a sign of corruption per se, it displays an alarming disregard for the fundamental values of freedom and the rule of law at a time when the international community has been rallying around Ukraine because it is defending those very values from Russia\u2019s brutal assault.\u201d",
      "Shabunin is not the only recent arrest to cause alarm. The opposition UDAR party, headed by former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, says that a raid in April on the home of Kyiv City Council deputy Dmytro Bilotserkivets \u2014 again, they said, without the necessary documents \u2014 was a clear attempt to put pressure on political dissent.",
      "Corruption in Ukraine is a fraught and delicate topic, ripe for weaponization often in bad faith.",
      "Russia uses it as an example to support its otherwise untrue criticisms \u2014 such as Ukraine being run by neo-Nazis \u2014 while American and European politicians hold up such examples to bolster their pre-existing arguments about whether to support Kyiv\u2019s defense against Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe issue of corruption in Ukraine has long been highly politicized,\u201d said Mariya Omelicheva, a professor at the Pentagon-funded National War College in Washington, D.C.",
      "Ukrainian \u201ccorruption is almost always co-opted \u2014 either by Ukraine\u2019s supporters or, more problematically, by its adversaries,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is particularly sensitive in the current U.S. political climate, where both parties \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 have used Ukrainian corruption narratives for domestic political purposes.\u201d",
      "There is also a feeling among some Ukrainians that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d focus has allowed officials abroad to act with greater impunity knowing Washington\u2019s hitherto exacting gaze is currently less troubled by world affairs.",
      "\u201cOur international partners, particularly the United States, don\u2019t care anymore about good governance and anti-corruption and reforms,\u201d Kaleniuk said. Washington \u201cfor the last 12 years had a powerful impact on how Ukraine develops, and the U.S. was usually tough on good governance, anti-corruption reforms and developments critical for democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now America doesn\u2019t care about that.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s true Trump historically spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared to accept many of his war demands, in recent weeks he has been increasingly hostile to the Kremlin and signaled a renewed support for Ukraine, pledging Patriot missiles for Kyiv and tariffs on Moscow.",
      "It\u2019s also true that Ukraine \u2014 and Zelenskyy \u2014 have achieved some progress in the corruption fight in recent years. Transparency International, the best known international group that tracks this topic, says Ukraine has steadily improved in its annual \u201cCorruption Perceptions\u201d index \u2014 although it still ranks 105 of 180 countries worldwide.",
      "Nevertheless, domestically there are plenty of Ukrainians alarmed at what they see is a negative direction of travel when it comes to corruption in their country. Though the immediate fight is against Russia, the ultimate battle is for their values of liberty and democracy, supporters say, without which the battlefield struggle becomes pointless.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting for freedoms and for dignity,\u201d Kaleniuk said. If those are lost, \u201conly Russia will applaud.\u201d",
      "Alexander Smith and Freddie Clayton reported from London. Erin McLaughlin from Washington, D.C., and Anastasiia Parafeniuk and Daryna Mayer from Kyiv."

    "story": [
      "A genetic test may one day predict a child\u2019s risk of obesity in adulthood, paving the way for early interventions.",
      "Certain genetic variants can affect how a person\u2019s body stores fat or make them more prone to overeating. Genetic variation can also predict how well a person will respond to different weight loss drugs.",
      "In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, more than 600 researchers from around the world worked together to compile genetic data from more than 5 million people \u2014 the largest and most diverse genetic dataset to date. They also used genetic data from 23andMe.",
      "From the dataset, the researchers were able to create what\u2019s known as a polygenic risk score, which takes into account which genetic variants a person has that have been linked to a higher BMI in adulthood.",
      "The score, the researchers said, could be used to predict a person\u2019s risk of obesity as an adult \u2014 before they even turn 5.",
      "\u201cChildhood is the best time to intervene,\u201d said study co-author Ruth Loos, a professor at the University of Copenhagen\u2019s Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research. (Research conducted at the center is not influenced by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, though some of the study authors had ties to pharmaceutical companies that make weight loss drugs.)",
      "The findings come as obesity is rising around the world. Rates of obesity in adults have more than doubled globally since 1990, and adolescent rates have quadrupled, according to the World Health Organization. About 16% of adults worldwide have obesity and the situation is worse in the United States, where more than 40% of adults have obesity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics show.",
      "Twice as effective",
      "The new test is not the first that predicts a person\u2019s risk of obesity, but Loos and her team showed it was about twice as effective as the method doctors currently use to assess their patients. That polygenetic score can account for about 8.5% of a person\u2019s risk for having a high BMI as an adult. The new score increased that to about 17.6%, at least in people with European ancestry.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty powerful risk indicator for obesity, but it still leaves open a lot that is unknown,\u201d said Dr. Roy Kim, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s who was not involved with the research.",
      "Based on this score, more than 80% of a person\u2019s risk for obesity can be explained by other factors, such as where they live, what kinds of foods they have access to, and how much they exercise.",
      "The test was not nearly as effective in predicting obesity risk in non-Europeans. It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.",
      "About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.",
      "Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it\u2019s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more \u2014 and more diverse \u2014 data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.",
      "She said the score could offer one indicator \u2014 what high blood pressure is to heart disease, for example \u2014 that could help predict a person\u2019s risk of developing obesity.",
      "\u201cObesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,\u201d Loos said. \u201cFor the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.\u201d Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.",
      "Still, identifying a person\u2019s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.",
      "\u201cBehavioral things are really important,\u201d Kim said. \u201cTheir environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person\u2019s obesity risk.\u201d",
      "How important are genetics, really?",
      "Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.",
      "\u201cEven with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.\u201d",
      "Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person\u2019s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.",
      "\u201cObesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,\u201d said Simonetti, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study.",
      "Simonetti uses a person\u2019s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.",
      "\u201cThey eat but do not feel full,\u201d Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations \u201ctend to have higher weight,\u201d she said.",
      "But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said. The genes that a person inherits from either parent, even if they are not mutations, also determine how a person\u2019s body stores weight or uses energy. Both can play a big role in obesity risk.",
      "Genetic testing is also starting to be able to determine how well certain weight loss drugs will work for a person, Simonetti said, but she added this is just the beginning.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about three out of 80 mutations that we can treat,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are getting better, and the more data we have, I\u2019m hopeful that we are going to do a better job in being more precise in understanding treatment responses.\u201d"

      "For 21 months of war, the only Catholic church in Gaza has served as a fragile refuge in the besieged enclave, where hundreds of Christian and Muslim families took shelter from the Israeli assault outside its stone walls.",
      "The Israeli shelling that blasted through that sanctuary on Thursday \u2014 killing three, including the church\u2019s janitor, and wounding nine, including a priest \u2014 has seen Christians worldwide voice solidarity with their small community of fellow worshippers and drawn an unusually direct response from both the U.S. and the Vatican amid increasing global outrage.",

      "\u201cThis act, unfortunately, adds to the ongoing military attacks against the civilian population and places of worship in Gaza,\u201d he said, speaking after his Angelus prayer.",
      "Holy Family Church remains standing despite Thursday\u2019s deadly strike, which Israel said it \u201cdeeply regrets.\u201d",
      "Ornate crucifixes and paintings depicting the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ still adorn its walls. Amid the flickering candlelight, its shattered windows and scorched fa\u00e7ade attest to the strike."
