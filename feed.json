      "Hollywood megastar Tom Hardy has reunited with director Guy Ritchie 17 years after \u201cRocknRolla\u201d for a new TV series, \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tom Hardy has collected troves of knowledge and skill throughout his journey as an actor, forming a megastar career. But any education he received from director Guy Ritchie during their time on the 2008 \u201cRocknRolla\u201d film was gained from afar.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have very much to do with him ... the first time I worked with him. Gerard (Butler) was leading that film and in many elements, we were support staff,\u201d said Hardy. \"So, I got to experience being on the Guy Ritchie set, and it was a bit from a position of not being a lead, and that\u2019s a different responsibility.\u201d",
      "But time can bring people and experiences back around, especially in Hollywood. Since that film 17 years ago, Ritchie has transitioned into esteemed directorial status. And Hardy has morphed into a box office superstar with films like \u201cThe Dark Night\u201d as the imposing villain Bane, and the titular role for Marvel\u2019s \u201cVenom\u201d franchise. Now, the two have reunited for Ritchie\u2019s gritty, yet sophisticated series \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really keen to go back and work with him because he\u2019s a fellow Brit and he\u2019s done quite incredible work,\u201d explained Hardy. \u201cI wanted to go and play with him, actually, and see what that was like now I\u2019m older, and it was good fun.\u201d",
      "The Paramount+ original series follows Harry Da Souza (Hardy), an intimidating, yet calm fixer for a London-based crime family hoping to find the missing son of a rival faction to prevent a catastrophic gang war.",
      "How did Hardy prepare to play such a menacing, yet even-keeled character?",
      "\u201cNo acting required\u201d he said with a big laugh. \u201cJust turn up and, \u2018Oh, yeah, that makes sense\u2019 and say the lines. Don\u2019t bump into the furniture.\u201d",
      "The second episode of the 10-part \u201cMobLand\u201d series airs Sunday on Paramount+.",
      "The series was created by Ronan Bennett, known for popular crime shows like \u201cThe Day of the Jackal\u201d and \u201cTop Boy,\u201d and written with playwright Jez Butterworth. Ritchie serves as executive producer and directed the first two episodes. The \u201cMobLand\u201d idea began as a spinoff from Showtime\u2019s popular \u201cRay Donovan\u201d series, before becoming a stand-alone show.",
      "Two-time Oscar-winner Helen Mirren stars as the devious Maeve, matriarch and manipulator of the crime family, while Pierce Brosnan plays her husband and mob leader, marking a reunion for the pair who worked on the 1980 film \u201cThe Long Good Friday.\u201d",
      "It may be hard to think of a role that Dame Mirren hasn\u2019t played, but she found one with \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are always characters out there that are going to take you by surprise and \u2026 I think, \u2019Oh my god, I\u2019ve never done anything like that before,\u201d said the \u201c1923\u201d star who believes the line between shooting film and TV is now nearly nonexistent. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the sort of beauties of my job, actually, is to constantly be entering into such very, very different worlds.\u201d",
      "Mirren said the opportunity to work with Hardy was intriguing.",
      "\u201cTom\u2019s involvement in it was one of the reasons I signed up because I\u2019ve admired his work over many years,\u201d Mirren said. \u201cDifferent actors, you can see, \u2019Oh, they\u2019re a great actor' \u2026 they can perform. But certain actors like Tom, it\u2019s an interior power that just communicates with the camera. And Tom\u2019s got that. You know what? It\u2019s called star power.\u201d",
      "The \u201cMobLand\u201d cast features Paddy Considine of \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d fame, Joanne Froggatt, Lara Pulver, Anson Boon and Mandeep Dhillon. While this show technically reunites Mirren and Brosnan, they also shot the upcoming \u201cThe Thursday Murder Club\u201d film prior to this project.",
      "While much was unknown when Brosnan signed on, \u201cMobLand\u201d had all the right ingredients for the former James Bond to dive in, starting with Ritchie, who released his Netflix series \u201cThe Gentlemen\u201d last year.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s naughty. He\u2019s cheeky. He\u2019s bold,\u201d said Brosnan. \u201cI love his work. His movies. The way he\u2019s acquitted himself on the landscape of cinema. He\u2019s a unique talent all his own \u2026 so I said yes. I wanted to go back to London. I wanted to work.\"",
      "Next for Hardy is the crime drama film \u201cHavoc\u201d premiering later this month, and there's chatter of a potential sequel to his 2015 \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d A second season of \u201cTaboo\u201d is on the way \u2014 nearly a decade after its debut. What about a \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cVenom\u201d crossover? Hardy addressed the rumors that an alleged project fell apart, clarifying it was never in the works.",
      "\u201cPeople embellish a story. I just said I would have loved to work with \u2018Spider-Man,\u2019 but it never happened, which is a fact. It hasn\u2019t happened. And I\u2019m no longer working with \u2018Venom\u2019 \u2026 it is a shame because my kids would love to watch Venom and Spider-Man together,\u201d said Hardy. \u201cI would have liked that.\u201d",

      "A young actor\u2019s suicide in South Korea",
      "SEOUL -- A young actor\u2019s suicide in South Korea. Allegations of an underage relationship. They are part of a growing drama in the Asian entertainment world that raises questions about society\u2019s treatment of celebrities in crisis, with harsh media and online commentary amplifying their lowest moments.",
      "This week, South Korean actor Kim Soo-hyun publicly denied allegations that he dated the late actor Kim Sae-ron when she was under the age of sexual consent. His emotional press conference followed Kim Sae-ron\u2019s suicide in February, which reignited allegations that they were romantically involved.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the case.",
      "Kim Sae-ron was once one of South Korea's most promising film stars. She began acting at age 9 in the 2009 film \u201cA Brand New Life,\u201d which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. She gained further recognition with \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d (2010) and \u201cA Girl at My Door\u201d (2014), also invited to Cannes.",
      "Her career halted in May 2022 after she crashed her car in Seoul while driving under the influence. Despite offering a public apology and reportedly paying compensation to shops that lost power because of the crash, she faced relentless negative attention.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: In South Korea, callers can receive 24-hour counseling through the suicide prevention hotline 1577-0199, the \u201cLife Line\u201d service at 1588-9191, the \u201cHope Phone\u201d at 129 and the \u201cYouth Phone\u201d at 1388.",
      "___",
      "Media and online commentators scrutinized her personal life. YouTube gossip channels accused her of exaggerating financial difficulties and questioned her sincerity. Critics, and her family, say it contributed to her declining mental health.",
      "She killed herself on Feb. 16, Kim Soo-hyun's birthday.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun, 37, also has been one of South Korea\u2019s most recognized actors, known for dramas such as \u201cMy Love from the Star\u201d (2013) and \u201cQueen of Tears\u201d (2024) as well as films like \u201cThe Thieves\u201d (2012) and \u201cSecretly, Greatly\u201d (2013).",
      "Speculation about a relationship with Kim Sae-ron began last year when she posted a photo of them together, quickly deleted. Gold Medalist, the agency co-founded by Kim Soo-hyun, denied the relationship, according to South Korean media.",
      "Days after Kim Sae-ron\u2019s death, a YouTube channel known for its politically charged content, HoverLab, alleged that she and Kim Soo-hyun had been in a six-year romantic relationship beginning in 2015, when she was 15 and he was in his late 20s. The channel released what it called evidence including photos, videos and letters. Kim Soo-hyun has called them fabricated.",
      "Kim Sae-ron\u2019s family had approached HoverLab to release the materials, calling it an attempt to restore Kim Sae-ron\u2019s image.",
      "On March 27, a lawyer representing Kim Sae-ron\u2019s family presented to journalists what the family claimed was a photo of an undelivered letter written in 2024 in which Kim Sae-ron described Kim Soo-hyun as her \u201cfirst and last love\u201d and referenced a five-to-six-year relationship.",
      "The letter was written after she failed to reach Kim Soo-hyun to discuss a debt she owed his agency, according to the lawyer. After Kim Sae-ron's contract ended and wasn't renewed, the agency asked her to pay back 700 million won (about $520,000) in damages related to her drunk-driving case. Her family says the demand placed severe pressure on her.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun has acknowledged that he dated Kim Sae-ron but insisted their relationship began after she became an adult. He called claims of an underage relationship false and damaging.",
      "\u201cIt is also not true that the deceased made a tragic choice because of my avoidance (of her), or because my agency pressured her about debt,\" an emotional Kim told Monday\u2019s press conference.",
      "He refused to answer a question from the AP about when he first met Kim Sae-ron.",
      "Whether any laws were broken depends largely on timing. South Korea raised its age of sexual consent from 13 to 16 in 2020. Kim Sae-ron was born in 2000, and the family alleges the relationship began in 2015, when she was 15 and Kim Soo-hyun was 27.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun maintains that their relationship lasted from summer 2019 to fall 2020, when Kim Sae-ron was a legal adult.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun's agency has taken legal action against the family of Kim Sae-ron and HoverLab, which first aired the underage relationship claims, for distributing private photos and videos of the actor, including images of Kim Soo-hyun kissing the late actor. Kim\u2019s agency said Kim Sae-ron had visited his apartment and his family was present. The agency said they were not dating at the time.",
      "On Monday, Kim Soo-hyun's lawyer announced a civil lawsuit seeking 12 billion won (approximately $8.15 million) in damages against the YouTube channel and Kim Sae-ron's family, along with criminal complaints alleging defamation and violation of privacy laws. Kim Soo-hyun and his agency also sued the YouTube channel operator for stalking.",
      "The family\u2019s legal representative and HoverLab both told the AP on Wednesday that they plan to sue Kim Soo-hyun and his agency for making false claims about his relationship with the late actor.",
      "Kim\u2019s death reignited criticism of South Korea\u2019s relentless tabloid and digital media culture. Her family has singled out videos with speculative, unverified content portraying her as emotionally unstable and morally questionable.",
      "Suing for defamation is often a lengthy, costly battle for South Korean celebrities, as many platforms, like YouTube, are based overseas. Punishments are typically light, with fines or suspended sentences.",
      "Other high-profile cases following negative online attention have included the deaths of K-pop singers Sulli and Goo Hara in 2019 and \u201cParasite\u201d actor Lee Sun-kyun in 2023.",
      "Fashion brand Prada has ended its collaboration with Kim Soo-hyun. South Korean cosmetics company Dinto terminated its one-year contract with him, citing the seriousness of the controversy. 7-Eleven Taiwan canceled a Kim Soo-hyun fan event last month, citing schedule changes.",
      "An online petition this week calling for the age of consent to be raised from 16 to 19 has gathered nearly 40,000 signatures on the National Assembly\u2019s website.",
      "Suggested reforms in South Korea meant to discourage harsh online comments have not been passed.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- The U.S. State Department revoked the visas of members of a Mexican band after they projected the face of a drug cartel boss onto a large screen during a performance in the western state of Jalisco over the weekend.",
      "U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who was U.S. ambassador to Mexico during the first Trump administration, said late Tuesday on X that the work and tourism visas of members of Los Alegres del Barranco were revoked.",
      "The visa revocations follow widespread outrage in Mexico over the concert as prosecutors in two states have launched investigations into the projected images, and a larger national reckoning over how to address the rise of a popular musical genre criticized for romanticizing drug cartels.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in freedom of expression, but that doesn\u2019t mean that expression should be free of consequences,\u201d Landau wrote on X. \u201cThe last thing we need is a welcome mat for people who extol criminals and terrorists.\u201d",
      "The controversy broke out over the weekend when the face of Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \"El Mencho\" Oseguera layered over flames was projected behind the band, originally hailing from Sinaloa, during the concert. Finger pointing ensued among the band, concert producers and the venue.",
      "Oseguera is the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which has been connected to a ranch authorities say was used to train cartel recruits and possibly dispose of bodies in Jalisco, where searchers found human bone fragments, heaps of clothing and shoes.",
      "The Jalisco cartel is among other criminal groups in Mexico that have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.",
      "While the image was met by applause during the concert, Jalisco prosecutors quickly announced they were summoning the band to testify in an investigation into whether they were promoting violence, a crime which could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison. The state of Michoacan also announced an investigation into the Los Alegres del Barranco for projecting the same images during a concert in the city of Uruapan.",
      "Jalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus said that the state would ban musical performances that glorify violence, adding that violators would \u201cface monetary and criminal sanctions.\u201d",

      "Since, a number of the band's future shows have been cancelled, one town's government saying that the show \u201cdidn't have the municipal permissions needed\u201d to carry out the performance.",
      "Pavel Moreno, the band's accordion player and back-up singer, didn't respond to questions by fans asking if his visa had been revoked, simply thanking them for support and saying that \"everything is fine.\u201d",
      "The band was scheduled to play in Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 4. While the event hasn't been publicly cancelled, ticket sales websites read: \u201cNo tickets available for now on our site\" for that date.",
      "The dispute coincides with a larger cultural debate in Mexico as artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano usher in a global renaissance of Mexican regional music, by mixing classic ballads with trap music. In 2023, Peso Pluma beat Taylor Swift out as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "Many of the artists now topping the charts have come under fierce criticism because their lyrics often paint cartel leaders as Robin Hood-esque figures. Others say that the genre, known as \u201cnarco corridos\u201d, expresses the harsh realities of many youths across Mexico.",
      "A number of Mexican states have banned public performances of the music in recent years, the most recent being the state of Nayarit in February. Some of the bans have come as famed artists have received death threats from cartels, forcing a number of them to cancel their performances.",
      "Others, including Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, have sought a less aggressive approach to addressing the genre. Sheinbaum, who has come out against censoring the music, has suggested instead that the Mexican government push forward initiatives that promote Mexican regional music with more socially acceptable lyrics.",
      "The Mexican leader did harden her language on the topic following the Los Alegres del Barranco concert. In her morning news briefing this week, Sheinbaum demanded an investigation into the concert, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t justify violence or criminal groups.\u201d",

      "Star lived in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house on a busy street at the edge of downtown. But starting in early January, someone began tampering with the friendly reindeer and his pen.",
      "A person got inside the pen in January, and Star began losing weight. In February, someone cut the locks off the pen's gates and Star wandered downtown streets. The following night, someone sprayed some type of substance into Star's pen.",
      "Earlier, Whitehead shied away from thinking that person might have poisoned Star, but now he doesn\u2019t know.",
      "Star had a persistent cough after the February incidents and then developed pneumonia. It was believed that contents from his stomach were coming up through his nose, and Star breathing that matter back into his lungs caused the pneumonia.",
      "It\u2019s possible Star ate a plastic bag when he was wandering downtown Anchorage, which could cause indigestion problems and chronic weight loss.",
      "He was cured of pneumonia but developed a second bout.",
      "\u201cHe started to recover and then all of a sudden reversed himself, and we decided it was not possible to save him,\u201d Whitehead said. Star was euthanized Tuesday, the same day the necropsy was conducted.",
      "Results won\u2019t be known for a few weeks as to the possible cause of death or contributing factors, Whitehead said.",
      "There has been a pet reindeer housed in downtown Anchorage since the 1950s. This particular Star was the seventh in the line to live with either Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart or Whitehead after he took over for the Stewarts in 2002.",
      "Star, which had his own Facebook page, constantly got visitors to his pen, attracting tourists and locals alike. He got daily walks in downtown Anchorage, was featured in parades, was visited by schoolchildren and even appeared on reality TV shows.",

      "The jokesters' custom has been around for hundreds of years, although its exact birth is difficult to pinpoint. These days, depending on your location, it could be marked with a fish secretly pinned to someone's back or a whoopee cushion or even news reports of flying penguins (yes, that actually happened ).",

      "There are plenty of theories about where this day of pranks and hoaxes came from. It's not clear exactly which one might be true. But what is clear is that April Fools\u2019 Day has roots stretching back hundreds of years.",
      "One idea is that it dates back to France in 1564, when King Charles IX moved the New Year celebration from its weeklong observance beginning March 25 to a celebration on Jan. 1, according to the Library of Congress. Those who forgot or were never told about the change were mocked. Although the library notes that the true history of the New Year is more complicated, as different parts of the country observed it on different days.",
      "A similar theory ties April Fools\u2019 Day to the 1582 change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, according to the library. But it explains that this type of origin story has been used to explain several holidays and may be more of a \u201cmigratory legend.\u201d",
      "And then there's the theory that it could be connected to the March 21 vernal equinox, which is known as a day when people are tricked by unexpected weather changes, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.",
      "Whatever its origin, the first time there was clear documented reference to the day was in 1561 when the Flemish writer Eduard De Dene wrote in his poem about a nobleman sending his servant on pointless tasks, according to the Library of Congress. The servant soon realizes that he has been \u201csent on \u2018fool\u2019s errands\u2019 because it\u2019s April 1,\u201d the library states.",
      "In 2021, then-first lady Jill Biden pretended to be a flight attendant on an airplane traveling from California to Washington. She wore a \u201cJasmine\u201d nametag and passed out Dove ice cream bars while wearing a black mask, black pantsuit and wig. A few minutes later, \u201cJasmine\u201d reemerged without the wig \u2014 revealing herself to be Jill Biden, laughing and proclaiming, \u201cApril Fools!\u201d",
      "Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin became known for announcing outlandish ideas every April Fools\u2019 Day soon after starting their company more than a quarter century ago. One year, Google posted a job opening for a Copernicus research center on the moon. Another year, the company said it planned to roll out a \u201cscratch and sniff\u201d feature on its search engine.",
      "In 1992, NPR 's \u201cTalk of the Nation\u201d program announced that former-President Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974, would be running for president, according to the Museum of Hoaxes. A comedian had impersonated Nixon to say, \u201cI never did anything wrong, and I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d",
      "Outside of the U.S., one of the most notable pranks involved the BBC World Service in 1980 declaring that Big Ben would become a digital clock and renamed Digital Dave, according to the UK Parliament.",
      "From Scotland to Iceland to the U.S., the day is honored in a wide array of ways.",
      "In France, the day is known as poisson d\u2019avril, or \u201cApril Fish,\u201d and has long had a fish-themed pranking tradition. In modern times, it\u2019s become more of a day for children to relish in attaching paper fish to their friends\u2019 backs, Atlas Obscura says.",
      "In Scotland, April Fools' has a history of being a two-day event. April 1 is known as \u201cGowkie Day\u201d or \u201cHunt the Gowk,\u201d explained Encyclopedia Britannica. Gowk is a term used to describe a fool. On April 2, the celebration may become more physical, with children attaching \u201ckick me\u201d signs to people\u2019s backs.",
      "The day is also celebrated in Iceland, with the aim being to get people to \u201chlaupa apr\u00edl,\u201d or \u201cmake an April run.\u201d In other words, to trick someone in a way that makes them travel to a different location. News agencies have also been known to participate in pranking people.

      "For once, things are working out for Wile E",
      "NEW YORK -- For once, things are working out for Wile E. Coyote.",
      "After being shelved by Warner Bros. in 2023, the Looney Tunes film \u201cCoyote vs. Acme\u201d has found a new home. Ketchup Entertainment announced Monday that it acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film for an undisclosed sum.",
      "The deal gives new life to one of the three fully completed films that Warner Bros. elected to take a tax write-off on rather than release. The tactic, which followed a change in leadership at Warner Bros. coming out of the pandemic, was widely disparaged by creatives and fans, alike. The other two shelved movies \u2014 the $90 million DC Studios production \u201cBatgirl\u201d and the animated \u201cScoob! Holiday Haunt\u201d \u2014 remain unreleased.",
      "But \u201cCoyote vs. Acme\u201d will be salvaged from the dustbin. Ketchup Entertainment plans a theatrical release at an unspecified future date.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to have made a deal with Warner Bros. Pictures to bring this film to audiences worldwide,\u201d Gareth West, chief executive of Ketchup Entertainment, said in a statement. \u201c\u2018Coyote vs Acme\u2019 is a perfect blend of nostalgia and modern storytelling, capturing the essence of the beloved Looney Tunes characters while introducing them to a new generation.\u201d",
      "Directed by Dave Green and based on a New Yorker article by Ian Frazier, \u201cCoyote vs. Acme\u201d follows Wile E. Coyote in a lawsuit against Acme Corporation for the many faulty products that failed to catch him the Road Runner. The live-action animated hybrid stars John Cena and Will Forte.",
      "Deadline earlier reported that Ketchup paid about $50 million for the film, which cost $70 million to produce. Ketchup, a distribution company launched in 2012, also recently released another Looney Tunes film jettisoned by Warner Bros.: \u201cThe Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie.\u201d In three weeks of release, it's grossed $8.2 million in domestic ticket sales.",

      "The makers of hit Netflix show \u201cAdolescence\u201d have sparked a conversation on how to protect children from violent misogyny and other harmful content on social media",
      "LONDON -- The makers of hit Netflix show \u201cAdolescence \u201d have sparked a conversation on how to protect children from violent misogyny and other harmful content on social media.",
      "Now they have the ear of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who welcomed the filmmakers to Downing Street on Monday for talks on child protection. Starmer's office said he backed an initiative by Netflix to stream the drama series for free to secondary schools across the country, so that as many children as possible can watch it.",
      "The show, filmed in England, explores the difficult questions that arise when a 13-year-old boy is accused of stabbing a girl in his school to death. It has been watched by more than 66 million people worldwide since it launched earlier in March.",
      "Starmer said it was difficult watching the series with his 14-year-old daughter and 16-year-old son. But showing it widely in schools will \u201chelp students better understand the impact of misogyny, dangers of online radicalization and the importance of healthy relationships,\u201d his office said.",
      "Starmer added in a statement: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a challenge politicians can simply legislate for. Believe me, if I could pull a lever to solve it, I would.\"",
      "Jack Thorne, a co-writer of the show, said the team behind \u201cAdolescence\u201d made it to provoke a conversation.",
      "\u201cSo to have the opportunity to take this into schools is beyond our expectations,\u201d he said. \"We hope it\u2019ll lead to teachers talking to the students, but what we really hope is it\u2019ll lead to students talking amongst themselves.\u201d",
      "Stephen Graham, a co-creator of the drama who stars as the boy's father, has told The Associated Press he wanted the narrative to focus on the seemingly ordinary life of the accused.",
      "He said that when a knife crime among young people takes place, the first reaction may be to question the background of the murder suspect and how they were raised.",
      "\u201cBut what if it's not the family?\u201d he asked, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re all maybe accountable. School. Society. Parents. Community.\u201d",
      "The success of \u201cAdolescence\u201d has come during growing concern over children's use of smartphones and the easy availability of pornography and extreme misogynistic content on social media pushed by influencers like Andrew Tate. Tate and his brother, Tristan, who are dual U.S. and British citizens, face charges of human trafficking and forming an organized criminal group to sexually exploit women.",
      "Gavin Stephens, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, warned last week that \u201cthe harmful effect of Tate is plain to see.\u201d",
      "Police in the U.K. are now dealing with more than a million crimes related to violence against women and girls each year, or a fifth of all recorded crime.",

      "A New Mexico court has cleared the way for the release of investigative records from the deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, as long as depictions of the deceased couple are blocked from view",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- A court on Monday cleared the way for the release of investigative records from the deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, as long as depictions of the deceased couple are blocked from view.",
      "The ruling from a New Mexico judge allows the possible release of redacted police body camera video and other investigative materials, including images of the couple's dead dog. All photos, video and documents from the investigation had been restricted from release by an earlier, temporary court order.",
      "\u201cThere shall be no depiction of either body in any video production\u201d or photographic image of the bodies, Santa Fe-based Judge Matthew Wilson said in response to questions from attorneys on his ruling.",
      "A representative for the Hackman family estate had urged a New Mexico judge to keep the records sealed to protect the family\u2019s constitutional right to privacy.",
      "The partially mummified remains of Hackman and Arakawa were found in their Santa Fe home on Feb. 26, when maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police.",
      "Authorities have said Hackman, 95, died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease about a week after his wife died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is a rare, rodent-borne disease. Hackman may have been unaware Arakawa, 65, was dead.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs, a kelpie mix named Zinna, also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs were found alive. A state veterinary lab tied the dog's death to dehydration and starvation.",
      "Authorities unraveled the mysterious circumstances of the couple\u2019s deaths and described their conclusions at a March 7 news conference without releasing most related written and photographic records.",
      "New Mexico\u2019s open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of dead bodies. Experts also say some medical information is not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.",
      "In seeking to block the release of records, estate representative Julia Peters had emphasized the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media. The Hackman family estate also sought to block the eventual release of autopsy reports by the Office of the Medical Investigator and death investigation reports by the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "An attorney for the estate, Kurt Sommer, argued during Monday's hearing that the couple took great pains to stay out of the public light during their lifetimes and that the right to control the use of their names and likenesses should extend to their estate in death.",
      "The bulk of death investigations by law enforcement and autopsy reports by medical investigators are typically considered public records under state law in the spirit of ensuring government transparency and accountability.",
      "The Associated Press, CBS News and CBS Studios intervened in the matter. Gregory P. Williams, an attorney for the news outlets, told the judge that they had previously said in court filings that they would not disseminate images of the couple's bodies and would blur images to obscure them from other records.",
      "\u201cThere is certainly a public interest in knowing how their deaths were investigated and knowing how that was handled,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Susan Madore, a publicist who had worked with the Hackmans for years, testified that the couple relished living in Santa Fe because it afforded them anonymity. Hackman retired in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa had no children, while Hackman is survived by three children from a previous marriage.",
      "At Monday's hearing, an attorney for Hackman's son and daughters highlighted the possible traumatic effects of releasing conversations about the deaths within police body camera videos.",
      "Scot Sauder, an attorney for the state medical investigator, told the judge that autopsy reports for Hackman and his wife do not yet exist and won\u2019t include past health care information once completed. It can take months for autopsy reports to be completed.",
      "Privacy likely also will play a role as the couple\u2019s estate is settled. According to probate court documents, Hackman signed an updated will in 2005 leaving his estate to his wife while the will she signed that year directed her estate to him. With both dying, management of the estate is in Peters' hands.",
      "Without trust documents being made public, it\u2019s unclear who the beneficiaries are and how the assets will be divided.",

      "NEW YORK -- In an unexpected upset, the Jason Statham thriller \u201cA Working Man\u201d took No. 1 at the box office, besting the rapidly declining \u201cSnow White,\u201d according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Even after a lackluster debut, the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action remake was predicted to remain the top film in U.S. and Canadian theaters over the weekend. Instead, \u201cSnow White,\u201d plagued by bad buzz and backlash, nosedived in its second weekend and dropped 66%.",
      "At the same time, Amazon MGM Studios\u2019 \u201cA Working Man,\u201d directed by David Ayer, beat expectations with a $15.2 million debut.

      "The bigger headline, though, might have been the fast erosion of ticket buyers' appetite for \u201cSnow White.\u201d The film, directed by Marc Webb and starring Rachel Zegler, had been hoped to lift movie theaters after a painful start to 2025. Produced for more $250 million, the film has turned into a poisoned apple, with a two-week global haul of $143.1 million.",

      "\u201cDeath of a Unicorn,\u201d a horror comedy starring Jenna Ortega and Paul Rudd, portrays a father and daughter who hit a unicorn on the road while they're driving. The movie collected a modest $5.8 million from 3,050 theaters.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Richard Chamberlain, the handsome hero of the 1960s television series \"Dr. Kildare\" who found a second career as an award-winning \"king of the miniseries,\" has died. He was 90.",
      "Chamberlain died Saturday night in Waimanalo, Hawaii, of complications following a stroke, according to his publicist, Harlan Boll.",
      "\u201cOur beloved Richard is with the angels now. He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us,\" Martin Rabbett, his lifelong partner, said in a statement. \"How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul. Love never dies. And our love is under his wings lifting him to his next great adventure.\u201d",
      "Tall, with classic good looks and romantic style, Chamberlain became an instant favorite with teenage girls as the compassionate physician on the TV series that aired from 1961 to 1966. Photoplay magazine named him most popular male star for three years in a row, from 1963-65.",
      "Not until 2003 did he acknowledge publicly what Hollywood insiders had long known, that he was gay. He made the revelation in his autobiography, \"Shattered Love.\"",
      "The actor became known as \"king of the TV miniseries\" in 1978 when he landed the starring role in \"Centennial,\" an epic production 24 hours long and based on James Michener's sprawling novel. He followed that in 1980 with \"Shogun,\" another costly, epic miniseries based on James Clavell's period piece about an American visitor to Japan.",
      "He scored his greatest miniseries success in 1983 with another long-form drama, \"The Thorn Birds,\" based on Colleen McCullough's best-seller. He played Father Ralph de Bricassart, a Roman Catholic priest in Australia who falls in love with beautiful Meggie Cleary (Rachel Ward). The ABC production, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck, reportedly attracted 100 million viewers.",
      "Chamberlain won Golden Globes for his work in \u201cShogun\" and \u201cThe Thorn Birds.\u201d Years earlier, he received one for \u201cDr. Kildare.\u201d",
      "When the public began to lose interest in miniseries, Chamberlain turned to the theater, where he displayed a fine singing voice. He appeared as Henry Higgins in a 1994 Broadway revival of \"My Fair Lady\" and as Captain von Trapp in a 1999 revival of \"The Sound of Music.\"",
      "He reprised his role of de Bricassart in the 1996 TV movie \"The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years.\"",
      "He also appeared in numerous films, including \"The Music Lovers\" (as Tchaikovsky), \"The Madwoman of Chaillot,\" \"The Towering Inferno\" and \"The Three Musketeers\" and its sequels.",
      "The \"Kildare\" series was based on a string of successful 1930s and '40s films that had starred Lew Ayres in the title role.",
      "Chamberlain's hunky, all-American appearance made him an overnight star. Another medical show that debuted the same season, \"Ben Casey,\" also was a smash and made its leading man, the darkly handsome Vince Edwards, a star, too.",
      "The \"Ben Casey shirt\" became a fashion item, both shows' theme songs made the pop Top 40 (the Kildare song performed by Chamberlain himself) and there was even a pop song called \"Dr. Kildare! Dr. Casey! You Are Wanted for Consultation.\"",
      "But in his book, Chamberlain recounted how he was forced to hide his sexuality. He would escort glamorous actresses to movie premieres and other public events at the request of studio executives and dodge reporters' questions about why he had never married with a stock reply: \"Getting married would be great, but I'm awfully busy now.\"",
      "\"When I grew up, being gay, being a sissy or anything like that was verboten,\" he said in an NBC interview. \"I disliked myself intensely and feared this part of myself intensely and had to hide it.\"",
      "The book also described a troubled childhood and an alcoholic father, and Chamberlain said that writing it finally lifted a heavy emotional burden. He also expressed relief that he was no longer hiding his sexuality.",
      "\"I played a cat-and-mouse game with the press. Game over,\" said Chamberlain.",
      "Born George Richard Chamberlain in Beverly Hills on March 31, 1934, the actor originally studied at Pomona College to be a painter. But after returning from the Army, where he had served as an infantry clerk in the Korean War, Chamberlain decided to try acting.",
      "He studied voice and drama, and after appearing in guest roles in a handful of TV shows and in the 1960 film \"The Secret of the Purple Reef,\" he won the Dr. Kildare role.",
      "When \u201cDr. Kildare\u201d was canceled he initially found it difficult to shake the image of the handsome young physician.",
      "He moved to England for a time to find work and hone his acting skills. While there, he appeared in three of director Richard Lester\u2019s films, \u201cPetulia\u201d (1968), \u201cThe Three Musketeers\u201d (1973) and \u201cThe Four Musketeers\u201d (1974). He reunited with Lester in 1989 for \u201cThe Return of the Musketeers,\u201d once more playing Aramis.",
      "In 1969, Chamberlain played the title role in \u201cHamlet\u201d at England\u2019s Birmingham Repertory Company and repeated it in a TV adaptation that appeared on NBC in the United States. He also appeared as Octavius in a film version of \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d which co-starred Charlton Heston and Jason Robards.",

      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments in a South Carolina case over whether states can cut off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood",
      "WASHINGTON -- There are just two Planned Parenthood clinics in South Carolina, but every year they take hundreds of low-income patients who need things like contraception, cancer screenings and pregnancy testing.",
      "The organization has long been at the center of the debate over abortion, but its clinics across the U.S. also provide a range of other services. In South Carolina, Medicaid patients often seek out Planned Parenthood because they often have difficulty finding a doctor who accepts the publicly funded insurance.",
      "A case coming before the Supreme Court from South Carolina on Wednesday could upend that option. That's because the state's Republican governor, Henry McMaster, is pushing to block any public health care dollars from going to Planned Parenthood.",
      "Federal law already prohibits Medicaid money from going to pay for abortions, with very limited exceptions, and South Carolina now bans almost all abortions around six weeks after conception.",
      "\u201cThis case is not about abortion. This case is about general health care,\u201d said Katherine Farris, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.",
      "Still, Republican leaders in conservative-led states have long said that no public health care dollars should go to an organization that provides abortions, and states should instead be able to direct that money as they choose. A few states already have cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood and more could follow if South Carolina prevails.",
      "\u201cThe people in this state do not want their tax money to go to that organization,\u201d McMaster said.",
      "The Trump administration is joining South Carolina for the arguments on Wednesday, which are playing out against the backdrop of a wider push by abortion opponents to defund Planned Parenthood.",
      "Health care advocates, meanwhile, say the effects of the case transcend abortion. The legal question at its center is whether Medicaid patients can sue over their legal right to choose their own qualified provider.",
      "The American Cancer Society and other public-health groups say in court papers that lawsuits are the only real way that patients can assert those rights. Losing the ability to go to court would hurt their access to care, especially in rural areas.",
      "\u201cIf no one is able to enforce the statute or no one\u2019s willing to enforce the statute at the federal level, then it\u2019s a right on paper only,\u201d said Julian Polaris, a lawyer who regularly advises state Medicaid programs and health care providers. States could also move to restrict access to treatments like gender-affirming care if the court sides with South Carolina, he said.",
      "One in five American women of reproductive age is now enrolled in the Medicaid program, said Heidi Allen, an associate professor at Columbia University. This means that finding providers who can offer quality family planning services \u2014 a requirement for Medicaid \u2014 is crucial for meeting the needs of those patients.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s concerning that states would eliminate a site of care for politically motivated reasons, \u201cAllen said.",
      "The case stretches back to 2018, before the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to abortion, when McMaster first moved to cut Planned Parenthood funding in a fulfillment of a campaign promise. He signed an executive order removing Planned Parenthood from a list of providers for things like birth control, and sexually transmitted disease testing.",
      "\u201cThere are plenty of good organizations that provide maternal health advice, counseling and care and we need more of those,\u201d McMaster said last week.",
      "His order was blocked in court, but since then judges have ruled in favor of similar moves in Texas and Missouri, said John Bursch, an attorney for the conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level, this case is about whether states have the flexibility to direct Medicaid moneys to best benefit low-income women and families,\u201d he said.",
      "He acknowledged that a win for South Carolina could curtail other Medicaid lawsuits, but suggested that could be good for the program overall because it would mean less money going to legal fees. There is also an administrative appeals process available, he said.",
      "\u201cNo one is losing their access to health care clinics,\u201d Busch said. If the state is allowed to cut off Planned Parenthood, Medicaid patients could go to one of 200 other publicly funded health care clinics in the state, he said.",
      "In South Carolina, $90,000 in Medicaid funding goes to Planned Parenthood every year \u2014 a tiny fraction of a percentage point of the state\u2019s total Medicaid spending.",
      "Most counties in the state have already been federally designated as having too few primary care providers, said Amalia Luxardo, CEO of the South Carolina-based Women\u2019s Rights and Empowerment Network. Fourteen of the state\u2019s counties have no practicing OB-GYN physicians and five other counties have just one, she said, meaning many women already have to travel longer distances to find the right provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood has flexible hours and can get appointments scheduled quickly, factors that bring in patients from around the state, she said.",
      "\u201cWe are already in a health care crisis,\u201d said Luxardo, whose group has filed court briefs supporting Planned Parenthood. \u201cAnd when decisions like these negatively impact our constituents, the crisis is going to only increase.\u201d",

      "Mexico says a government-sponsored junk food ban in schools has taken effect as the country tries to tackle one of the world\u2019s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics",
      "MEXICO CITY -- A government-sponsored junk food ban in schools across Mexico took effect on Saturday, officials said, as the country tries to tackle one of the world\u2019s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics.",
      "The health guidelines, first published last fall, take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavored peanuts.",
      "Announcing that the ban had become law, Mexico's Education Ministry posted on X: \u201cFarewell, junk food!\u201d It encouraged parents to support the government's crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids.",
      "\u201cOne of the core principles of the new Mexican school system is healthy living,\" said Mario Delgado, the public health secretary. \u201cThere's a high level of acceptance of this policy among parents.\u201d",
      "Mexico's ambitious attempt to remake its food culture and reprogram the next generation of consumers is being watched closely around the world as governments struggle to turn the tide on a global obesity epidemic.",
      "In the United States, for instance, the Trump administration\u2019s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has vowed to upend the nation's food system and \u201c Make America Healthy Again \" by targeting ultra-processed foods to curb surging obesity and disease.",
      "Under Mexico's new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying even one black warning logo marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that compulsory front-of-package labeling system in 2020.",
      "Enforced from Monday morning, the start of the school week, the junk food ban also requires schools to serve more nutritious alternatives to junk food, like bean tacos, and offer plain drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips,\u201d said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has championed the ban.",
      "Mexico\u2019s children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to UNICEF, which classifies the nation\u2019s childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency. Sugary drinks and highly processed foods account for 40% of the total calories that children consume in a day, the agency reports.",
      "\u201cAt my daughter's school, they told us that future activities wouldn't have candy, it would be completely different, with fruit, vegetables and other food that's healthy for kids,\u201d said Aurora Mart\u00ednez, a mother of two. \u201cIt will help us a lot.\u201d",
      "One-third of Mexican children are already considered overweight or obese, according to government statistics.",
      "School administrators found in violation of the order face stiff fines, ranging from $545 to $5,450.",
      "But enforcement poses a challenge in a country where previous junk food bans have struggled to gain traction and monitoring has been lax across Mexico\u2019s 255,000 schools, many of which lack water fountains \u2014 even reliable internet and electricity.",
      "It also wasn't immediately clear how the government would forbid the sale of junk food on sidewalks outside school campuses, where street vendors typically hawk candy, chips, nachos and ice cream to kids during recess and after the school day ends.",
      "\u201cIt will be difficult,\u201d said Abril Geraldine Rose de Le\u00f3n, a child therapist. \u201cBut it will be achieved in the long run.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A groundbreaking initiative could soon be bringing surgeons closer to patients in Africa's remote corners where the doctor-to-patients ratio is among the lowest in the world",
      "KOFORIDUA, Ghana -- Charles Owusu Aseku has traveled across Ghana and beyond in search of care for the large growth of tissue called a keloid on his neck since 2002. The 46-year-old was growing increasingly frustrated after two unsuccessful surgeries and a trip to South Africa that ended with just a consultation.",
      "Aseku was preparing for yet another medical trip until late February when he joined others in the first trial of 3D telemedicine technology in Ghana powered through computer screens in the back of a van.",
      "Those behind the initiative, developed by Microsoft\u2019s research team in partnership with local doctors and researchers, say the remote assessment will help provide medical consultations for patients awaiting surgery or after an operation, in a region where the doctor-to-patient ratio is among the lowest in the world.",
      "The project builds on earlier trials in Scotland and now works as a portable system with enhanced lighting and camera upgrades.",
      "Once inside the van, cameras will capture a 3D model of each patient and the image is then projected onto a large computer screen. Multiple doctors can join the consultation session online and manipulate the 3D model to assess the patient.",
      "\u201cThe idea behind the van is to allow it to travel to those remote villages that don\u2019t have specialized care ... to perform a pre or post-surgical consult,\u201d said Spencer Fowers, principal software developer and 3D-telemedicine project lead at Microsoft Research.",
      "The initiative also gives patients the opportunity to have multiple opinions. Aseku\u2019s session had doctors from Rwanda, Scotland and Brazil, an experience that he said gave him hope.",
      "\"I see a lot of doctors here and I am very happy because experience will come from each of them and maybe they will find a solution to my problem,\u201d the 46-year-old said.",
      "Researchers hope the trial at the Koforidua Regional Hospital, in Ghana\u2019s eastern region, is the start of a wider project that could expand the service and explore new use cases.",
      "Recent years have seen growing use of telemedicine, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say such digital tools can benefit patients in Africa the most because there are so few specialist doctors for the continent's 1.4 billion people.",
      "George Opoku, 68, was referred to the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in the capital Accra \u2014 nearly 100 kilometers away from the Koforidua hospital, which is much closer to his home \u2014 where he had first gone to seek care for sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that develops in the bones and soft tissues.",
      "Upon hearing about the 3D telemedicine trial, his doctor decided to register him for the process, saving him the extra expenses and stress of long-distance travel.",
      "\u201cThis time I had to sit in a van and to introduce myself and condition to not only one doctor but several of them. I was able to answer all their questions and I am hopeful that they will discuss and cure me of my condition,\u201d Opku said. \u201cI feel well already and I am hopeful.\"",
      "A key challenge for the project is the lack of stable internet access, a common problem in remote parts of Africa.",
      "At the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, the technology is helping patients in need of plastic surgery. An inadequate number of plastic surgeons means that patients often have to consult with different doctors during each visit.",
      "Dr. Kwame Darko, consultant plastic surgeon at the hospital and one of the principal investigators on the project, said that 3D telemedicine could give patients the chance to be seen by multiple doctors during one session.",
      "The 3D technology could make a difference if replicated in Ghana and elsewhere, according to Dr. Ahensan Dasebre, chief resident doctor at the National Reconstructive Plastic Surgery and Burns Centre at Korle-Bu, who was not part of the project.",
      "\u201cWe are already behind in terms of how many doctors are available to care for a certain number of the population,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf somebody is in a remote part of town where he doesn\u2019t have access to these specialized services, but needs it, the referring doctor could actually use this telemedicine thing to get access to the best of care.\u201d",

      "Reaction to a court verdict ousting South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol from office was a vivid window into the nation\u2019s deep political divisions",
      "SEOUL -- Dancing and consoling hugs. Wild whoops and anguished screams. Tears, both of joy and rage. Reaction to the court verdict ousting South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol from office Friday was a vivid window into the nation's deep political divisions, as tens of thousands of Yoon opponents and supporters aired their feelings in downtown Seoul.",
      "As South Korea now turns to elect a new president, that divide is only likely to harden. It will be particularly on display as both sides try to answer one question about the night of Dec. 3, when the conservative leader decreed martial law, setting himself on the road to impeachment and the loss of the presidency:",
      "What was he thinking?",
      "Yoon was confronting North Korea-sympathizing politicians intent on destroying South Korea's democracy, his supporters say. No, no, liberals maintain: He was trying to deflect attention from corruption investigations of him and his wife. Or maybe he was in the sway of right-wing YouTubers who claim liberals have subverted the election process?",
      "This national attempt to pick through the wreckage of Yoon's decision to send heavily armed soldiers to encircle the National Assembly will be front and center as a violently fractured South Korea begins a fierce campaign to elect a new president within two months.",
      "Deploying troops to the streets of any democracy is serious. But it is especially sensitive in South Korea, where memories of military rule from the 1960s to 1980s are fresh.",
      "And the move has further exposed the country's fault lines, along politics, national security, social standing, economics, gender and age.",
      "Division is intrinsic to South Korea\u2019s origin story. The Korean Peninsula was split into northern and southern halves in 1945 by Soviet and U.S. troops, formally broken up in 1948 when both Koreas became independent countries, and then militarily separated at the Demilitarized Zone at the end of the Korean War in 1953.",
      "The fractures will likely get worse as presidential election campaigning gains force.",
      "Yoon's supporters tend to frame the martial law decree as a crucial tool for a president stymied at every turn by the liberal opposition Democratic Party, which controls parliament.",
      "Kim Min-seon, a Yoon supporter, said it was the only way to deal with liberals blocking Yoon's efforts to fight Pyongyang's and Beijing\u2019s alleged campaigns to threaten South Korea\u2019s democracy through cyberattacks, disinformation and technology theft. The Democratic Party has denied these accusations.",
      "\u201cI strongly condemn Lee Jae-myung\u2019s Democratic Party, which is an axis of evil,\u201d Kim said during a recent rally. Lee, the opposition leader, is Yoon's archrival and seen as the presidential front-runner.",
      "Yoon supporters' fears are further fueled by false claims about election fraud.",
      "On Dec. 3, Yoon sent troops to National Election Commission offices to investigate alleged vulnerabilities to its computer systems that he insisted could affect the credibility of election results.",
      "Such claims are unsubstantiated and there is no evidence of electoral fraud, but there's a worry that the specter could undermine confidence in future elections.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that we had election fraud, and the president made a crucial decision to expose such massive wrongdoing,\u201d Kwon Kyung-hee, another Yoon supporter, said during a rally this week.",
      "Many Yoon critics see something strikingly different: a leader increasingly in the sway of conspiracy theories that portray him as a victim of a North Korea-sympathizing opposition.",
      "Instead, they say, he was merely an inept politician, unable to work with rivals to get things done.",
      "\u201cThe president\u2019s imposition of martial law was a terrible political decision made by a foolish former prosecutor who mistook compromise for surrender and dialogue for interrogation,\u201d said Choi Hyun-seok, a Seoul office worker.",
      "But others see a reason closer to home, accusing Yoon of being desperate to protect himself from corruption investigations.",
      "Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the Democratic Party, said Yoon\u2019s martial law decree was likely an attempt to cover up \u201cdisgraceful\u201d allegations about Yoon and his wife that had caused the president's approval ratings to plummet.",
      "The scandal revolves around allegations that Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee unlawfully influenced the conservative People Power Party to select a specific candidate for a parliamentary by-election in 2022 at the request of election broker Myung Tae-kyun. Yoon has denied any wrongdoing by him or his wife.",
      "Park noted that it was Dec. 2 when Myung, facing the threat of criminal prosecution and increasing scrutiny, revealed he would hand over a phone that contains communications with Yoon and Kim.",
      "\u201cProsecutors indicted Myung Tae-kyun a day later, and Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law on the same day,\u201d Park said during a January party meeting. \u201cIsn\u2019t this too coincidental to be dismissed as mere chance?\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not immediately clear how much of a role the Myung scandal played in influencing Yoon\u2019s decree, which investigators say had been brewing for months.",
      "Prosecutors\u2019 indictments, instead, say Yoon was driven to martial law by disputes with the opposition over budget cuts, impeachment attempts against his allies, and baseless election fraud conspiracy theories. Though they did also briefly mention that Yoon discussed the scandal with his defense minister.",
      "Both Yoon's party \u2014 which is in disarray following the court ruling \u2014 and the opposition \u2014 whose leader also faces several corruption investigations \u2014 have big challenges ahead.",
      "And the stakes couldn't be higher for South Korea: How the political standoff plays out will determine its democratic future, but also its relations with the nuclear-armed North, a newly protectionist United States, and its major trading partner but uneasy neighbor China.",

Exports to the U.S. accounted for 28% of the EU\u2019s total wine export value, it said.",

      "Dmitriev, the head of Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, was sanctioned by the Biden administration after the invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. had to temporarily lift the restrictions to allow him to travel to Washington this week.",

      "Lammy said that while Putin should be accepting a ceasefire, \u201che continues to bombard Ukraine. It\u2019s civilian population. It\u2019s energy supplies. We see you, Vladimir Putin. We know what you are doing.\u201d",

      "Sitting under stained glass windows around a wrestling ring, churchgoers roared as burly wresters body-slammed and threw one another to the floor",
      "SHIPLEY, England -- Sitting around a wrestling ring, churchgoers roared as local hero Billy O\u2019Keeffe body-slammed a fighter named Disciple. Beneath stained-glass windows, they whooped and cheered as burly, tattooed wresters tumbled into the aisle during a six-man tag-team battle.",
      "This is Wrestling Church, which brings blood, sweat and tears \u2014 mostly sweat \u2014 to St. Peter\u2019s Anglican church in the northern England town of Shipley. It's the creation of Gareth Thompson, a charismatic 37-year-old who says he was saved by pro wrestling and Jesus \u2014 and wants others to have the same experience.",
      "Thompson says the outsized characters and scripted morality battles of pro wrestling fit naturally with a Christian message.",
      "\u201cBoil it down to the basics, it\u2019s good versus evil,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I became Christian, I started seeing the wrestling world through a Christian lens. I started seeing David and Goliath. I started seeing Cain and Abel. I started seeing Esau having his heritage stolen from him. And I\u2019m like, \u2018We could tell these stories.\u2019\u201d",
      "Church attendance in the U.K. has been declining for decades, and the 2021 census found that less than half of people in England and Wales now consider themselves Christian. Those who say they have no religion rose from 25% to 37% in a decade.",
      "That has led churches to get creative in order to survive.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take a few risks,\" said the Rev. Natasha Thomas, the priest in charge at St. Peter\u2019s. She acknowledged that she \u201cwasn\u2019t entirely sure what it was I was letting myself in for\u201d when she agreed to host wrestling events.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not church as you would know it. It\u2019s certainly not for everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s bringing in a different group of people, a different community, than we would normally get.\u201d",
      "At a recent Wrestling Church evening, almost 200 people \u2014 older couples, teenagers, pierced and tattooed wrestling fans, parents with excited young children \u2014 packed into chairs around a ring erected under the vaulted ceiling of the century-old church.",
      "After a short homily and prayer from Thomas, it was time for two hours of smackdowns, body slams and flying headbutts. The atmosphere grew cheerfully raucous, as fans waved giant foam fingers and hollered \u201cknock him out!\u201d at participants.",
      "Some longtime churchgoers have welcomed the infusion of energy.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely wonderful,\u201d said Chris Moss, who married her husband Mike in St. Peter's almost 50 years ago.",
      "\u201cYou can look at some of the wrestlers and think\u201d \u2014 she scrunched her face in distaste. But talking to them made her realize \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover.\u201d",
      "Thompson, whose wrestling moniker is Gareth Angel, both wrestles and presides over the organized mayhem. He\u2019s a mix of preacher and ringmaster, wearing a T-shirt that says \u201cPray, eat, wrestle, repeat.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s loved wrestling since it provided solace and release during a troubled upbringing that saw him survive childhood sexual abuse and a period of homelessness as a teenager.",
      "\u201cI could watch Shawn Michaels and the Rock and Stone Cold (Steve Austin) and I could be like, I want to be like them,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s always been an escape for me, and a release and a way to get away from stuff. But then God has obviously turned that around now and it\u2019s become this passion.\u201d",
      "He found Christianity in 2011, ran his first Wrestling Church event in a former nightclub-turned-church in 2022, and moved to St. Peter\u2019s last year.",
      "As well as the monthly Saturday night shows, his charity Kingdom Wrestling runs training sessions for adults and children in a back room of the church, along with women\u2019s self-defense classes, a men\u2019s mental health group and coaching for children who have been expelled from school.",
      "For many in the close-knit community of U.K. wrestlers and fans, religion is a new ingredient, but not an unwelcome one.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m mainly here for the wrestling,\u201d said 33-year-old Liam Ledger, who wrestles as Flamin\u2019 Daemon Crowe. Sitting in a pungent changing room as wrestlers discussed fight plans, donned knee pads and laced up their many-holed boots, he said it\u2019s a bit \u201csurreal\u201d when baptisms are held between bouts.",
      "\u201cIt works both ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s people that come here that are big on religion, and they\u2019re here for all of that sort of stuff. And then they go, \u2018Oh, actually this wrestling is sort of fun.\u2019\u201d",
      "Kiara, Kingdom Wrestling\u2019s reigning women\u2019s champion, said the organization has helped her bring her Catholic faith into her wrestling life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s thanks to Kingdom Wrestling that I\u2019ve had the confidence to pray in the locker room now before matches,\u201d said Kiara, 26, known outside the ring as Stephanie Sid. \u201cI invite my opponent to pray with me, pray that we have a safe match, pray that there\u2019s no injuries and pray that we entertain everybody here.\"",
      "Only a handful of people have gone from watching the wrestling to attending Sunday-morning services at St. Peter\u2019s, but Wrestling Church baptized 30 people in its first year. Thompson, whose brand of born-again Christianity is more muscular than many traditional Anglicans', plans to expand to other British cities. One day, he says, he may start his own church.",
      "There has long been overlap between Christianity and wrestling in the U.S., where figures like Thompson's hero Shawn Michaels proudly proclaim their faith. But Britain is a less religious place, and Shipley, a former mill town 175 miles (280 kilometers) north of London, is a long way from the Bible Belt.",
      "Thompson, though, is unfazed by doubters.",
      "\u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh, wrestling and Christianity, they\u2019re two fake things in a fake world of their own existence,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in it, of course you will think that of it. But my own personal experience of my Christian faith is that it is alive and living, and it is true. The wrestling world, if you really believe in it, you believe that it\u2019s true and you can suspend your disbelief.",
      "\u201cYou suspend it because you want to get lost in it. You want to believe in it. You want to hope for it.\u201d",

      "Three years after winning South Korea\u2019s closest presidential race, President Yoon Suk Yeol was formally removed from office as the Constitutional Court upheld his impeachment over a stunning December martial law imposition \u2014 a self-inflicted downfall t...",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Three years after becoming president of South Korea, Yoon Suk Yeol was formally removed from office on Friday as the Constitutional Court upheld his impeachment over an ill-fated December decision to impose martial law. Yoon's self-inflicted downfall continues a trend of troubled presidencies.",
      "Yoon\u2019s ouster comes eight years after the same court dismissed another conservative president, Park Geun-hye over an explosive scandal involving bribery, extortion, leaking state secrets and abuse of power. Several former presidents, their family members, or top aides have been embroiled in corruption scandals near the end of their terms or after leaving office. There have been coups, an assassination and a suicide.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the country\u2019s history of troubled presidencies.",
      "Syngman Rhee, an American-educated Christian leader and independence activist, became South Korea\u2019s first president in 1948 with U.S. support, three years after the Korean Peninsula was liberated from Japanese colonial rule at the end of World War II. His government grew increasingly authoritarian, especially after the 1950-53 Korean War, and critics accused him of corruption and nepotism as he sought to extend his grip on power. He secured a fourth presidential term in 1960 amid widespread allegations of vote-rigging, triggering nationwide protests that forced him to flee to Hawaii, where he died in 1965.",
      "Park Chung-hee, an army general, seized power in a 1961 coup, toppling the government that had replaced Rhee. Park is credited with industrial policies that fueled the country\u2019s rapid economic growth in the 1960-70s, but critics remember him as a ruthless dictator who jailed, tortured, and executed dissidents. Park, also the father of future President Park Geun-hye, was assassinated by his own spy chief during a late-night drinking session in 1979.",
      "Park was replaced by an interim government, but within months another army general and his military allies seized power in a coup in December 1979, deploying tanks and troops into Seoul. President Chun Doo-hwan ruled as a military dictator but massive pro-democracy protests forced his government to accept a constitutional revision allowing direct presidential elections in 1987. After leaving office, Chun spent two years in exile at a remote Buddhist temple amid public demands for accountability for corruption and human rights abuses, and in 1995 he was arrested for crimes including the coup that brought him to power and received a death sentence that was later commuted to life imprisoned before he was pardoned. Chun died in 2021.",
      "Roh Tae-woo, a close associate of Chun, won the country\u2019s first democratic, direct presidential election in decades in 1987, largely due to a split opposition vote among liberal candidates. Two years after Roh left office, both he and Chun were arrested in late 1995 on charges of accepting bribes from businessmen during their presidencies. They were also indicted for mutiny and treason over the 1979 coup that put Chun in power and the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Gwangju in 1980, which killed hundreds. In 1996, Chun was initially sentenced to death, while Roh received 22\u00bd years in prison. In April 1997, South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court reduced Chun\u2019s sentence to life imprisonment and Roh\u2019s to 12 years, before both were pardoned later that year. Roh died in 2021.",
      "Kim Young-sam, a longtime opposition leader who fought for democratization, initially enjoyed strong public support for ambitious anti-corruption reforms and the arrests of Chun and Roh. But Kim's popularity nosedived as the late-1990s Asian financial crisis wreaked havoc on South Korea\u2019s economy, toppling some of the country\u2019s debt-ridden conglomerates and forcing the government to accept a $58 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund. He pardoned Chun and Roh in December 1997, accepting a proposal from president-elect Kim Dae-jung, as a gesture for national unity. Kim Young-sam left office amid a corruption scandal that saw his son arrested and jailed. He died in 2015.",
      "Another longtime opposition leader and democracy activist, Kim Dae-jung rose to the presidency in 1998. In 2000, he held an unprecedented summit with then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, ushering in an era of rapprochement between the war-divided rivals. That same year, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. However, his presidency was also marred by corruption scandals involving his aides and sons. He was also accused of arranging for the Hyundai business group to pay North Korea more than $400 million ahead of the summit. Kim died in 2009.",
      "Roh Moo-hyun, a self-taught lawyer who rose to political prominence as a reformist, won the 2002 election as a liberal candidate with vows to fight corruption. However, his direct and outspoken style contributed to constant clashes with conservatives who held the legislative majority during the early part of his presidency. In 2004, lawmakers impeached Roh over election law violations and other allegations, but the Constitutional Court reinstated him two months later, concluding that the accusations were not serious enough to justify his removal. Roh died by suicide in 2009, a year after his term ended, amid allegations that some of his family members took bribes during his presidency. His older brother received a prison term for influence-peddling in 2009 and was later pardoned.",
      "Elected in 2008 on a promise to boost the economy, ex-Hyundai CEO Lee Myung-bak saw his popularity decline quickly due to unmet economic goals and media policies criticized as attacks on free speech, and left office with rock-bottom approval ratings amid corruption scandals involving himself, his family and key government officials. In 2018, Lee was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison for a range of crimes before and during his presidency, including accepting millions of dollars in bribes from major corporations, embezzling funds from his own company, and taking bribes from his ex-spy chief in exchange for favors. He was released on bail months later but was imprisoned again in 2020 after the Supreme Court upheld a 17-year sentence from an appellate court. Lee was pardoned by Yoon Suk Yeol in December 2022.",
      "Park Geun-hye was elected as the country\u2019s first female president in 2012, defeating her liberal rival Moon Jae-in by a million votes after securing support from conservative voters who see her father as an industrial hero who lifted the country from postwar poverty. But her popularity declined following a 2014 ferry disaster that claimed more than 300 lives, while an uncompromising leadership style led to impasses with the liberal opposition. Her presidency collapsed after allegations emerged that she had colluded with a friend to extort and accept millions of dollars in bribes from the country\u2019s biggest business groups and allowed her friend to manipulate state affairs. Park was formally ousted from office and arrested in March 2017. She called her trial political revenge and refused to attend hearings before being convicted and sentenced. Park served less than a quarter of her 22-year sentence before Moon, who won a presidential by-election following her ouster, pardoned her in December 2021 in what he called an effort to promote political unity.",
      "Yoon, a staunch conservative and longtime prosecutor, went from political novice to president in 2022, ending five years of liberal rule characterized by failed efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis and ongoing economic trouble. He clashed continuously with the liberal opposition, which retained its majority in the National Assembly and hindered his agenda. Aiming to quash a legislature he portrayed as a \u201cden of criminals,\" Yoon declared martial law on Dec. 3, 2024 and sent hundreds of troops to the legislature and election offices. Despite troop blockades, lawmakers gathered a quorum and unanimously voted to lift martial law just hours later. The assembly impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, suspending his powers as prosecutors opened criminal investigations into the events. Yoon and his allies denied that he intended to shut down the legislature or arrest opponents, but the eight-member Constitutional Court unanimously rejected their arguments, describing his actions as unconstitutional and ordering his removal. The former president still faces a criminal trial for rebellion, and could be charged with additional crimes now that he has been stripped of presidential immunity.",

      "South Korea's Constitutional Court has upheld parliament's impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol and removed him from office",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s political rise was fast: the former star prosecutor clinched South Korea\u2019s presidency only a year after he entered politics.",
      "But his downfall was even faster: The Constitutional Court removed him from office on Friday, about four months after he made a deeply baffling decision to declare martial law and send troops to Seoul's streets.",
      "Yoon's style \u2014 highly assertive and strong-willed, but often uncompromising and inflexible \u2014 worked for a prosecutor standing up to higher-ups, but not for a president forced to work with an opposition-dominated legislature on an array of contentious issues.",
      "Yoon, 64, a conservative, said his martial law decree was a desperate attempt to call on public support for his fight against \u201canti-state\u201d liberal rivals who used their parliamentary majority to obstruct his agenda and impeach top officials. But many observers say the stunt was political suicide, as the liberal opposition-controlled parliament quickly struck down Yoon's decree before impeaching him and sending his case to the Constitutional Court. '",
      "Yoon was separately indicted by prosecutors for rebellion, a charge that can carry the death penalty or life imprisonment.",
      "Here's what you need to know about Yoon\u2019s life to understand the sudden end of his presidency.",
      "Before becoming president in 2022, Yoon worked as prosecutor for about 26 years, establishing an image as a strong-minded, uncompromising prosecutor who didn\u2019t yield to pressure from powerful figures.",
      "Yoon rose to stardom in 2013, when he publicly accused his boss of pressuring him to drop a high-stakes investigations into allegations that the state intelligence agency had carried out an illegal online campaign to help conservative Park Geun-hye win the previous year\u2019s presidential election.",
      "During a hearing at parliament, Yoon famously said, \u201cI\u2019m not loyal to (high-level) people.\u201d",
      "He was demoted, but after Park\u2019s government was toppled over a separate corruption scandal in 2017, liberal President Moon Jae-in made Yoon head of a Seoul prosecutors\u2019 office that investigated Park and other conservative leaders. Yoon was later appointed as Moon\u2019s prosecutor general.",
      "In 2021, Yoon left the Moon administration and entered politics following disputes over probes of Moon allies. Moon\u2019s supporters accused Yoon of attempting to frustrate Moon\u2019s push to reform the Korean prosecution service and boost his political standing. Yoon, for his part, called the Moon government \u201ccorrupt,\u201d \u201cincompetent\u201d and \u201carrogant.\u201d",
      "Yoon joined then the opposition People Power Party, the country\u2019s biggest conservative party, whose leaders he previously investigated, as it was looking to embrace a popular outside figure to lead its fight to regain power in the following year's presidential election.",
      "In 2022, in his first national election campaign, Yoon defeated Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung in the country\u2019s most closely fought presidential election.",
      "The election race got nasty, with Yoon describing Lee\u2019s party as \u201cHitler\u201d and \u201cMussolini\u201d while an associate called Lee\u2019s purported aides \u201cparasites.\u201d Lee\u2019s allies called Yoon \u201ca beast,\u201d \u201cdictator\u201d and \u201can empty can\u201d and derided his wife over claims she had had plastic surgery.",
      "On foreign policy, Yoon was credited with working hard to reinforce South Korea\u2019s military alliance with the U.S. and repairing disputes with Japan over historical traumas to build a stronger trilateral security partnership to cope with North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear program.",
      "In April 2023, Yoon charmed a White House state dinner by singing \u201cAmerican Pie\" at the request of then-President Joe Biden. In August 2023, Yoon, Biden and Japan's then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida met at Camp David in their countries\u2019 first stand-alone trilateral summit, where they agreed to bolster defense cooperation. Yoon and Kishida revived stalled high-level talks and withdrew reciprocal economic restrictions imposed under their predecessors.",
      "But domestically, Yoon\u2019s time in office was marred by near-constant political strife with Lee\u2019s party, unprecedented even in South Korea\u2019s deeply polarized political world.",
      "With control of the National Assembly, the Democratic Party filed a total of 30 impeachment motions against senior officials. None has yet been upheld by the Constitutional Court, except that of Yoon. The Yoon administration vetoed opposition-led bills about 40 times.",
      "Eventually, Yoon tried to break through the gridlock by declaring martial law. He says that it was an attempt to appeal for the public's help to overcome the \u201cwickedness\u201d of the Democratic Party. Critics say he was simply aiming to use force to impose his will on the legislature.",
      "In his martial law announcement, Yoon called the Democratic Party-led assembly \u201ca den of criminals,\u201d \u201ca monster\u201d and \u201canti-state forces.\u201d Democratic Party leaders lambasted Yoon's martial law, calling him \u201can alcoholic,\u201d \u201ca madman\u201d and \u201cringleader of a rebellion.\u201d",
      "Some observers say the martial law decree was more likely driven by Yoon's hopes to frustrate an opposition-led bid to open a special investigation into allegations involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee.",
      "Kim's allegations include spy camera footage showing the first lady accepting a luxury bags as a gift from a pastor; speculation she was involved in a stock price manipulation scheme; and revelations that she, along with Yoon, exerted inappropriate influence on the People Power Party to pick a candidate to run for a parliamentary by-election in 2022.",
      "Kim's scandals and Yoon's refusal to apologize and accept investigations provided the Democratic Party political ammunition throughout his term.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A lack of training, qualifications and experience among the crew on board a New Zealand navy ship that ran aground, caught fire and sank off the coast of Samoa have been identified by a military Court of Inquiry in a final report released Friday as contributing to the disaster.",
      "The deficiencies were among a dozen failings of the crew, ship and New Zealand's Navy that contributed to the loss of the HMNZS Manawanui in October 2024, the 120-page report said. An interim report last November had already divulged that the ship\u2019s crew didn\u2019t realize the vessel was on autopilot and believed something else had gone wrong as it plowed toward a reef.",
      "All 75 people on board evacuated to safety as the boat foundered about 1.6 kilometers (a mile) off the coast of Upolu, Samoa's second largest island. The ship was one of only nine in New Zealand\u2019s navy and was the first the country lost at sea since World War II.",
      "Officials did not immediately know the cause of the sinking and the Court of Inquiry was ordered to find out. Insufficient training, lack of qualified personnel on board and inadequate risk management, were among a raft of problems uncovered in its findings released Friday.",
      "The report also underlined the so-called hollowness of New Zealand's navy \u2014 which prompted the organization to \u201ctake risks\u201d to meet demands \u201cwith a lean and inexperienced workforce,\u201d its authors wrote.",
      "\u201cIt's an indictment on the fact that our navy was left in quite a perilous state,\u201d Defense Minister Judith Collins told reporters in Auckland Friday. The whole of the country's military needed a \u201cserious uplift,\u201d she added.",
      "The state of New Zealand\u2019s aging military hardware has prompted several warnings from the defense agency, which in a March 2024 report described the navy as \u201cextremely fragile,\u201d with ships idle due to problems retaining the staff needed to service and maintain them.",
      "The Court of Inquiry could not make findings of guilt, it said, and suggested a separate disciplinary investigation for individual members of the crew who were not named in the report. Their suggested offenses were redacted.",
      "The report included a dramatic transcript of what unfolded on the bridge, with one crew member saying to another that the ship was \u201cnot really doing what I want it to do\" as they tried to change the vessel's course.",
      "\u201cIt's a bad day for the navy,\u201d said Rear Admiral Garin Golding, the leader of the navy. \u201cOur reputation has taken a hit.\u201d",
      "The navy would \u201clearn from\u201d the episode and ensure it wasn't repeated, he added. Friday\u2019s findings, however, also urged recognition for those involved in the decision to abandon ship, who the report found saved lives during the evacuation.",
      "The specialist dive and hydrographic vessel had been in service for New Zealand since 2019 and was surveying the reef that it ran aground on. Its sinking provoked alarm, demands for compensation and fear of environmental catastrophe for Samoan villagers living on the coast where it capsized, who say they fear permanent damage to the fragile reef ecosystem.",
      "A no-fishing zone around the vessel was lifted by Samoa's government in February.",
      "New Zealand's military said this month that it had completed months of work to remove diesel fuel and other pollutants from the ship, which remains where it sank. Salvage work to retrieve equipment and weapons continues.",
      "Seawater and marine life in the area are \u201cuncontaminated\u201d, the military said, citing Samoa's scientific research agency. A decision about whether the ship will eventually be removed has not been made.",

      "Argentina\u2019s senate has rejected the two Supreme Court candidates that President Javier Milei nominated by decree earlier this year, dealing a major blow to the libertarian leader",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentina\u2019s senate on Thursday rejected the two Supreme Court candidates that President Javier Milei nominated by decree earlier this year, dealing a major blow to the libertarian leader.",
      "The congressional defeat could complicate the implementation of Milei's radical state overhaul of Argentina, as analysts say the president had hoped to fill the Supreme Court vacancies with appointees who would rule favorably on challenges to his economic reforms.",
      "Milei in February bypassed Congress to appoint two controversial Supreme Court candidates, invoking a clause in Argentina\u2019s constitution that he said empowered him to fill the vacant seats during the legislature's summer recess.",
      "Politicians sharply criticized the move as an overreach of executive power, saying that a president has extremely limited authority to make judicial appointments during a congressional break.",
      "\u201cIt's a serious institutional conflict that the executive branch has initiated against the legislative and judicial branches,\u201d said Sen. Anabel Fern\u00e1ndez Sagasti from Uni\u00f3n por la Patria party, the hardline opposition bloc. \u201cWhat we are discussing is an institutional assault.\u201d",
      "Both of Milei's candidates \u2014 federal judge Ariel Lijo and conservative law professor Manuel Garc\u00eda-Mansilla \u2014 had failed last year to secure the two-thirds majority required to confirm the candidates in the senate, where the president's libertarian coalition holds just seven of the 72 seats.",
      "Milei resorted to presidential decree to fill the two vacant seats on the five-judge court, testing the boundaries of his executive power as he has repeatedly done over the past year to overcome his minority in Congress.",
      "His nominees have provoked fierce debate across the political spectrum. Lijo has drawn criticism from anti-corruption watchdogs and opposition from centrist parties scandalized by allegations that he laundered money, abused judicial authority and stalled graft cases assigned to him in federal court. Lijo has denied the accusations.",
      "During the heated hours-long debate over the candidates on the senate floor Thursday, centrist lawmaker Luis Juez referred to Lijo by the name of a famous Argentine hypnotist, saying, \u201cI call him that because he'll put your judicial case to sleep if it suits political powers.\"",
      "Garc\u00eda-Mansilla has faced resistance from the left-leaning Peronist opposition movement, which holds 45% of seats in the senate, for his conservative stance on social issues like abortion.",
      "The vote was not close. Lijo failed to pass with 43 \u201cno\u201d votes and 27 for, while Garc\u00eda-Mansilla received 51 votes against and just 21 in favor.",
      "Milei has fiercely defended his candidates as worthy of serving on the nation's highest court and accused lawmakers of unfairly politicizing his nominations.",
      "In a statement late Thursday, Milei's office said it \u201crepudiated\u201d the senate vote.",
      "\u201cThe senate has rejected nominations proposed by the president for purely political reasons and not for reasons of suitability,\u201d it said, arguing that leaving the two seats empty on the court constituted an effort to obstruct justice.",
      "It said Milei would seek to \u201crestore people's confidence in the institutions using all the tools that the constitution and popular vote have placed in his hands.\u201d",
      "Others breathed a sigh of relief at what they saw as a sign of Argentina's democracy working.",
      "\u201cToday the Argentine Senate put a stop to one of the most serious attacks on judicial independence since the country\u2019s return to democracy,\" said Juan Pappier, deputy director of the Americas at Human Rights Watch. \u201cPresident Milei risked undermining some the very basic checks and balances of Argentina\u2019s democratic system.\u201d",

      "The bill, which is being debated by lawmakers, was approved by the coalition government of populist Prime Minister Robert Fico, who has frequently attacked NGOs.",
      "The organizers of the rally in Bratislava said that the draft legislation looks inspired by Russian law, which they said \u201cmakes it possible to liquidate the civil sector and turn into a criminal anyone who is not loyal to those in power.\u201d",
      "They said it's designed to scare and control people who stand up against the government.",
      "The latest version of the draft says that NGOs will be considered lobbyists, but gives no clear definition of what lobbying is, according to an analysis by Via Iuris, a nonprofit organization.",
      "The group said that the draft law violates Slovakia's constitution and European Union rules, and its goal is to \u201cstigmatize and limit the activities of civic groups.\u201d",
      "The government said that the law is meant to make transparent the financing and functioning of civic groups.",

      "It was a rare visit to the Kremlin by an EU leader since Moscow\u2019s all-out invasion of Ukraine began more than three years ago and his recent remarks that Slovakia might consider leaving the 27-nation EU and NATO.",
      "Protests in about three dozen locations across Slovakia and abroad are planned for Friday.",
      "Fico has been a divisive figure at home and abroad. He returned to power in 2003 after his leftist Smer (Direction) party won a parliamentary election on a pro-Russia and anti-American platform.",
      "His government moved to overhaul public broadcasting to give the government control of public television and radio.",
      "That, along with an amendment to the penal code to eliminate a special anti-graft prosecutor, showed that Fico was leading Slovakia down a more autocratic path, following the direction of Hungary under populist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.",

      "A powerful explosion has killed at least five people, including a pregnant woman and 1-year-old baby, during a standoff between rival groups of gold miners in northwestern Bolivia",
      "SORATA, Bolivia -- A powerful explosion killed at least five people, including a pregnant woman and 1-year-old baby, during a standoff between rival groups of gold miners early Thursday in northwestern Bolivia, police said, a rare instance of territorial disputes between the nation's mining cooperatives turning fatal.",
      "The blast thundered through the Yani mining camp as two rival mining groups dispute access to the gold mine near the mountain town of Sorata, some 150 kilometers (about 90 miles) northwest of the country's administrative capital of La Paz, said Col. Gunther Agudo, a local police officer. Several gold deposits straddle the remote area.",
      "Agudo had initially reported six people killed but revised the toll to five after firefighters finished recovering the bodies from under the rubble. The dead included three men, a pregnant woman and an infant, he said.",
      "Bolivia's deputy interior minister, Jhonny Aguilera, said the suspected perpetrator of the attack was killed by the explosion, which was detonated by remote control.",
      "The predawn explosion at the mine struck a three-story house and set cars and tractors alight. The fires wrecked several other structures and cut electricity.",
      "Bolivia\u2019s mining industry stands out for its huge sector of cooperatives \u2014 legal groups of artisanal miners \u2014 which drive 58% of mining production, according to the latest government figures. The thousands of groups also wield political clout in the resource-rich country where they have representation in Parliament.",
      "Cooperatives historically emerged in Bolivia as more established mining operations dismissed legions of workers in the risky, boom-and-bust business, compelling miners to organize themselves when commodity prices slumped and lay-offs loomed.",
      "Over the decades, cooperatives have increasingly fought over the chance to extract minerals \u2014 hurling rocks and dynamite sticks at each other and against unionized, salaried workers from Bolivia\u2019s state-run mining company, Comibol.",
      "Comibol came to dominate the crucial industry under former President Evo Morales, a socialist leader who governed the landlocked Andean nation from 2006 to 2019 and barred foreign companies from having a controlling stake in mineral extraction.",
      "In Thursday\u2019s clash, the struggle for control of certain veins of the gold reserve between two rival cooperatives had simmered for years, said Jhony Silva, a legal adviser to one of them. Gold remains one of Bolivia's main mineral exports, with almost $2.87 billion worth of the mineral shipped out of the country in 2023.",

      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- The leader of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council announced Thursday that it was taking measures to crack down on a surge in gang violence, acknowledging that the country has \u201cbecome hell for everyone.\u201d",
      "Fritz Alphonse Jean spoke a day after gunfire erupted in the Port-au-Prince capital as thousands of protesters demanding an end to gang violence clashed with police outside the offices of the council and the prime minister.",
      "It was the biggest protest held since the council was installed a year ago.",
      "\u201cHaitian people, you\u2019ve spoken, and we\u2019ve heard you,\u201d Jean said. \u201cWe understand your misery. We know your pain and your suffering.\u201d",
      "More than 4,200 people have been reported killed across Haiti from July to February, and another 1,356 were injured, according to the U.N.",
      "Recent gang violence also left more than 60,000 people homeless in one month alone, according to the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration.",
      "\u201cThis national address comes at a decisive moment for the transitional government,\u201d said Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. \u201cProtesters from various parts of the capital deliberately marched toward key government buildings to express their frustration.\u201d",
      "He noted that Jean\u2019s address marked the first anniversary of the political agreement that established the new transitional government\u2019s structure and objectives. Since then, cohesion between political parties involved in creating that government \u201chas now largely collapsed,\u201d Da Rin said.",
      "\u201cThe groups that originally supported this government are now calling for a change in leadership,\u201d he noted.",
      "The council has not addressed those concerns, which also have been voiced by the international community.",
      "During his public address, Jean rattled off a list of neighborhoods that gangs have recently attacked.",
      "\u201cYou lost your homes, you lost your businesses, you lost your jobs, they raped you, they raped your kids. The criminal gangs killed a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fight against the darkness is not insignificant. But we are not insignificant ourselves\u2026 It\u2019s nothing compared with the battle we fought to get out of slavery.\u201d",
      "Jean referenced how Haiti became the world\u2019s first free Black republic in a bid to rally support from Haitians, asking them to help law enforcement officials and eschew efforts by gangs to recruit people, especially children.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t let people profit from your distress and drag you in bad directions,\u201d he said.",
      "Jean said the council would take \u201cimportant measures\u201d to help quell the persistent violence, including setting aside a special budget and incorporating agents from an armed state environmental group known as BSAP.",
      "\u201cThe council asks the prime minister and the police to take these measures without delay,\u201d Jean said. \u201cWe are telling everyone in this government that we are at war.\u201d",
      "Jean did not provide further details, including how much money would be set aside for the budget and how many BSAP agents would join the fight against gangs.",
      "Jean also said that the electoral council is working so that Haiti can have new leadership once the transitional presidential council\u2019s term ends on Feb. 7 next year. He added that officials are taking steps so that the diaspora can vote in what would be the first general elections held in almost a decade.",
      "Haiti has not had a president since former President Jovenel Mo\u00efse was killed in July 2021, with gangs becoming increasingly powerful in the aftermath.",
      "Last year, a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police arrived in Haiti to help local authorities quell gang violence, but the mission remains understaffed and underfunded, with only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel originally envisioned.",
      "Da Rin noted that throughout his speech, Jean emphasized the transnational dimension of Haiti\u2019s security crisis, stressing that the gang issue is part of a broader problem involving money laundering and arms and drugs trafficking that spans several countries.",
      "\u201cBy framing Haiti\u2019s gang problem as a matter of transnational crime that goes beyond Haiti\u2019s borders, the president seems to be seeking to rally international support for further security assistance that matches the escalating threats,\u201d he said.",

The force mostly comprises local units engaged in defensive operations and ambushes.",
      "The Three Brotherhood Alliance, made up of three powerful ethnic guerrilla armies, on Tuesday announced its own one-month ceasefire. Its groups control significant swaths of territory in northeastern and western Myanmar, and the ceasefire gives them an opportunity to consolidate their grip.",
      "On Wednesday night, the army, which has been widely reported to have continued aerial bombings even after the earthquake, announced a similar unilateral ceasefire to help carry out rescue and recovery operations, to last until April 22.",
      "All sides reserved the right to act in self-defense. Another ethnic minority group battling the army, the Kachin Independence Organization, announced its own ceasefire on Thursday.",

      "Because the resistance forces seized the moral high ground by declaring ceasefires, his high-profile trip to Bangkok would have cast an even darker shadow on his government if it did not match them. The military\u2019s critics were still protesting his participation in the meeting after his arrival on Thursday.",

    "story": [
      "One big loser in President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating trade war is likely to be the U.S. electric vehicle industry",
      "DETROIT -- President Donald Trump's tariff blitz has sent shock waves throughout every aspect of the global economy, including the auto sector, where multi-billion-dollar plans to electrify in the United States are especially at risk.",
      "Here's what consumers should know about the impact of tariffs on electric vehicles.",
      "EVs accounted for about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. in 2024, according to Motorintelligence.com.",
      "Some of those sales can be attributed to expanded tax credits for EV purchases, a Biden-era policy that spurred car buyer interest.",
      "Tesla held a majority of U.S. EV market share in 2024, at 48%. But that share has declined in recent years, as brands including Ford (7.5%), Chevrolet (5.2%) and Hyundai (4.7%) began to offer a wider variety of electric models at better price points, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Electric vehicles remain more expensive than their gasoline-powered equivalents. New gas vehicles sold for $48,039 on average last month, Kelly Blue Book data says, while EVs sold for $55,273 on average.",
      "Tariffs add on to the costs of an EV transition that was already volatile and uncertain, said Vanessa Miller, a litigation partner focused on automotive manufacturing at law firm Foley & Lardner.",
      "Biden\u2019s tax credits essentially required automakers to get more and more of their EV content from the U.S. or trade allies over the coming years in order for their vehicles to qualify. Automakers have worked to build an EV supply chain across the country and significant investment has gone toward these efforts.",
      "EVs assembled here include Tesla models, the Ford F-150 Lightning and more. Tesla actually might be least vulnerable given how much of its vehicles come from the U.S.",
      "Though the industry is growing, tariffs mean costs for automakers and their buyers will stay high and might go higher, as well as hike up the prices of the many parts of EVs still coming from China and elsewhere. From the critical minerals used in battery production to the vehicles themselves, China laps the U.S. industry.",
      "Automakers were already pulling back on ambitious electrification plans amid shrinking federal support and are strapped for cash on what is the less lucrative side of their businesses.",
      "Higher prices might push car buyers to the used car market, but they aren't likely to find much respite there.",
      "If consumers don't buy as many vehicles, automakers will have to prioritize their investments and manufacturing. That means the cars that buyers want and that are most profitable. Automakers still lose thousands of dollars on each EV they make and sell, but they make money from big, popular gas-guzzling pickup trucks and SUVs.",
      "These manufacturers \u201chave put a certain amount of investment into EVs, and it would probably be even more wasteful to completely walk away from them than it is to find the new level at which it makes sense to maintain production of them,\" said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at auto research site iSeeCars.com. That level \u201cwill assuredly be lower than what it was,\u201d he added.",
      "Making fewer EVs won\u2019t help bring their cost down further anytime soon.",
      "Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said in a statement the EV and battery sector is working to ensure that the American auto industry grows and that his group will work with the administration on productive trade policy.",
      "\u201cTariffs on our longstanding trade partners, many of whom have committed billions in direct investment into U.S. factories, introduces uncertainty and risk into an industry that is creating jobs and bringing new economic opportunities to communities across the country,\u201d Gore said.",
      "Trump has already taken a hatchet to federal EV policy. He campaigned on a vow to end what he called former President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cEV mandate.\u201d",
      "Biden\u2019s EV policies did not require automakers to sell EVs or consumers to buy them, but they did incentivize manufacturers to increase their electric offerings in the coming years. Trump put an end to Biden\u2019s target for 50% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2035 in his first days in office.",
      "Also under Biden, Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rules on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy were to get increasingly tougher, but could be met by automakers selling a growing number of EVs alongside more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles. Trump's administrators are already reevaluating emissions standards.",
      "He's also likely to seek to repeal the tax credits.",

      "There's only one way for Dampt to fight back and maintain a presence in the U.S.: bring down his prices and cut his profit. But he said \"it's not an easy thing to do\" especially now when he had already lost about 50% of his crop last year, mostly due to hail storms and killer frost.",

      "\u201cWhile this new measure will affect exports, potentially costing Bourgogne wines up to 100 million euros, it will not bring trade to a sudden halt, as would have been the case with higher tariffs,\" the trade association noted.",
      "The U.S. remained last year the largest export market for wines produced in the EU, with 4.88 billion euros ($5.36 billion), the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en des Entreprises Vins (European Committee of Wine Businesses), or CEEV, said in a statement. Exports to the U.S. accounted for 28% of the EU\u2019s total wine export value, it said.",
      "The new tariff would create \"economic uncertainty and result in layoffs, deferred investments and price increases,\u201d said Marzia Varvaglione, CEEV president. \u201cThere is no alternative wine market that could compensate the loss of the U.S. market.\"",
      "Macron denounced the tariffs as \"brutal and unfounded.\u201d In addition to the wine industry, the meeting at the Elysee palace gathered representatives from aeronautics, chemical and metal sectors, electronics, health, luxury, cosmetics and food industry.",
      "Macron said France is likely to be slightly less impacted than some of its neighbours, because exports to the U.S. represent 1.5% of France's GDP, while they represent over 3% for Italy and 4% for Germany. Yet, \u201cit\u2019s not a small thing,\u201d Macron said.",
      "He emphasized that the U.S. economy will first experience the negative impact of the tariffs.",

      "Lebanon\u2019s crisis is rooted in decades of corruption by the country\u2019s political and financial leaders that drained state resources and eventually led to a run on the banks in 2019 afterwhich people have lost access to their deposits.

      "Out of 254 square kilometers of land that originally needed to be cleared, only about 23 square kilometers are left to deal with. Whether that can be achieved by the 2028 deadline will depend on continued funding.",
      "Nayeemudeen said once the aid suspension was announced, Sri Lanka's foreign ministry appealed and the U.S allowed the usage of its allocated funds pending a review, a decision on which is expected on May 1.",
      "\u201cWe hope that on completion of the 90-day review period that commenced from Jan. 24, 2025, the U.S government funding assistance will continue,\" said Ananda Chandrasiri head of Delvon Assistance for Social Harmony, one of the four demining groups operating in the country.",
      "\"Otherwise it will create a grave problem for Sri Lanka to achieve mine-free status by the end of 2027 as targeted ... A huge reduction of staffing levels of the four operators would be inevitable.\u201d",
      "There are around 3,000 workers, most of them recruited from among the civil war-affected communities. With the uncertainty, some groups have already started terminating their staff, Nayeemudeen said.",
      "Sri Lanka's civil war ended in 2009 when government troops crushed the Tamil Tiger rebels, ending their quarter-century separatist campaign. According to conservative U.N. estimates, about 100,000 people were killed in the conflict.",
      "Civilian properties were demined, but large areas were still contaminated when hundreds of thousands of civilians who were displaced by the conflict came back to resettle. Mine awareness campaigns were held, but there were many accidents.",
      "Kumarakulasingham Dinojan has lost his left hand below his wrist and has damaged fingers in his right hand from a mine blast. As a 9-year-old boy, he tried to open a metal container that he found in the woods. His brother, who was playing with him, also suffered wounds.",
      "\u201cMy grandmother went into the woods to get firewood and we also followed her. We did not know that she had reached home through another way. We found a container which looked like a perfumed powder, and when we tried to open it, it exploded,\u201d said Dinojan.",

      "Vidya Abhayagunawardena, coordinator of the Sri Lanka Campaign to Ban Land Mines, said it's critical for Sri Lanka to ratify Protocol V on Explosive Remnants of War. He also called for the enactment of domestic legislation to enforce the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, ratified in 2016, to bolster the legal rights of the country\u2019s disabled population.",
      "Dinojan's older brother, Vilvaraj Vinothan, said his brothers becoming land mine victims made him take action and become involved in mine clearance. He has worked with the Mine Advisory Group for six years.",

      "\u201cThe reason for my choosing demining for livelihood is not only because of poverty. I also have a desire to see this land to be free of mines,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI don't want to see our future generations being injured or affected by war. I can say that I am carrying the burden of both my family and of the country on my shoulders.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Lawmakers in Oregon and Washington are considering whether striking workers should receive unemployment benefits",
      "SEATTLE -- Lawmakers in Oregon and Washington are considering whether striking workers should receive unemployment benefits, following recent walkouts by Boeing factory workers, hospital nurses and teachers in the Pacific Northwest that highlighted a new era of American labor activism.",
      "Oregon's measure would make it the first state to provide pay for picketing public employees \u2014 who aren't allowed to strike in most states, let alone receive benefits for it. Washington's would pay striking private sector workers for up to 12 weeks, starting after at least two weeks on the line.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is this helps level the playing field,\u201d said Democratic state Sen. Marcus Riccelli, who sponsored Washington's bill. \u201cWithout a social safety net during a strike, workers are faced with tremendous pressure to end the strike quickly or never go on strike in the first place.\u201d",
      "But the bills are raising questions about how they would affect employers, especially amid economic uncertainties tied to federal funding cuts and tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate to unbalance the bargaining table in a way that forces employers to pay for the costs of a striking worker,\u201d Lindsey Hueer, government affairs director with the Association of Washington Business, told senators during a committee hearing in February. \u201cUnemployment insurance should be a safety net for workers who have no job to return to.\"",
      "So far only two states, New York and New Jersey, give striking workers unemployment benefits. Senate Democrats in Connecticut have revived legislation that would provide financial help for striking workers after the governor vetoed a similar measure last year.",
      "The measures in Washington and Oregon have been passed by the state Senate of each and are now in the House. The Washington bill faces its final committee hearings on Friday and Monday.",
      "The Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit, pro-labor think tank in Washington, D.C., has studied the effects of giving unemployment benefits to striking workers and found it to be good for workers and employers alike, said Daniel Perez, state economic analyst for the organization.",
      "First, he said, lengthy strikes are extremely rare. More than half of U.S. labor strikes end within two days \u2014 workers wouldn't receive pay in those cases \u2014 and just 14% last more than two weeks. Second, the policy costs very little \u2014 less than 1% of unemployment insurance expenditures in every state that has considered legislation.",
      "Bryan Corliss, spokesperson for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace union, told The Associated Press that the big winners would be low-wage workers.",
      "\u201cIf low-wage workers had the financial stability to actually go on strike for more than a day or two without risking eviction, we believe that would incentivize companies to actually come to the table and make a deal,\" he said.",
      "During a hearing in the Washington House labor committee last week, several Republican lawmakers tried to amend the bill to require striking workers to look for other jobs or to shorten the time covered from 12 weeks to four. The Democratic majority shot those ideas down.",
      "Republican Rep. Suzanne Schmidt said the bill might be good for workers, but it would hurt employers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen instances of this with the Boeing strike last year for the machinists,\" she said. \"We had 32,000 people on strike at the same time and if this had been in play it would have cost millions of dollars to cover those workers. Boeing did actually lose billions having the workers on strike for several months.\u201d",
      "The Oregon bill, which also would make striking workers eligible for unemployment benefits after two weeks, sparked a similar debate, both among Democratic and Republican lawmakers as well as constituents, with hundreds of people submitting written testimony.",
      "The state has seen two large strikes in recent years: Thousands of nurses and dozens of doctors at Providence's eight Oregon hospitals were on strike for six weeks earlier this year, while a 2023 walkout of Portland Public Schools teachers shuttered schools for over three weeks in the state's largest district.",
      "The Oregon Senate passed the measure largely along party lines, with two Democrats voting against it.",
      "On the Senate floor, Democratic Sen. Janeen Sollman said she worried about the effect on public employers such as school districts, which \u201cdo not have access to extra pots of money.\u201d Private employers pay into the state's unemployment trust fund through a payroll tax, but few public employers do, meaning that they would have to reimburse the fund for any payments made to their workers.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Gorsek, who supported the bill, argued it wouldn't cost public employers more than what they've already budgeted for salaries, as workers aren't paid when they're on strike. Also, those receiving unemployment benefits get at most 65% of their weekly pay, and benefit amounts are capped, according to a document presented to lawmakers by employment department officials.",
      "\u201cUnemployment insurance is partial wage replacement, so unemployment insurance in and of itself is not an additional cost to the employer,\" Gorsek said. \u201cIn fact, the only way Senate Bill 916 would yield additional cost for what was already budgeted by the employer is if the employer decided to hire replacement workers.\u201d",

      "Everything from crude oil to Big Tech stocks to the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies has fallen. Even gold, a traditional safe haven that recently hit record highs, pulled lower after Trump announced his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d set of tariffs,\u2019 which economists say carries the risk of a potentially toxic mix of weakening economic growth and higher inflation.",

      "In other trading early Friday, the U.S. dollar fell to 145.39 Japanese yen from 146.06. The yen is often used as a refuge in uncertain times, while Trump's policies are meant in part to weaken the dollar to make goods made in the U.S. more price competitive overseas. The euro gained to $1.1095 from $1.1055.",
      "Trump announced a minimum tariff of 10% on global imports, with the tax rate running much higher on products from certain countries like China and those from the European Union. Smaller, poorer countries in Asia were slapped with tariffs as high as 49%.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cplausible\u201d the tariffs altogether, which would rival levels unseen in more than a century, could knock down U.S. economic growth by 2 percentage points this year and raise inflation close to 5%, according to UBS.",
      "That's such a big hit it \u201cmakes one\u2019s rational mind regard the possibility of them sticking as low,\u201d according to Bhanu Baweja and other strategists at UBS.",
      "Trump has previously said tariffs could cause \u201ca little disturbance\u201d in the economy and markets. On Thursday he downplayed the impact.",
      "\u201cThe markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom and the country is going to boom,\u201d Trump said as he left the White House to fly to Florida.",
      "The S&P 500 sank 4.8% to 5,396.52 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 4% to 40,545.93. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 6% to 16,550.61.",
      "Some of the worst hits walloped smaller U.S. companies, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 6.6% to pull more than 20% below its record.",
      "Four of every five that make up the S&P 500 declined.",
      "Best Buy fell 17.8% because the electronics that it sells are made all over the world. United Airlines lost 15.6% because customers worried about the global economy may not fly as much for business or feel comfortable enough to take vacations. Target tumbled 10.9% amid worries that its customers, already squeezed by still-high inflation, may be under even more stress.",
      "Investors knew Trump was going to announce sweeping new tariffs, and fears surrounding it had already pulled Wall Street\u2019s main measure of health, the S&P 500 index, 10% below its all-time high.",
      "Some analysts and investors believed Trump might use tariffs simply as a tool for negotiations, rather than as a long-term policy. But he indicated Wednesday that he sees them as a way to bring factory jobs back to the United States, which could take years.",
      "The Federal Reserve could cut interest rates to support the economy, but lower rates can push up inflation, already a worry given that U.S. households are bracing  for sharp increases to their bills due to the tariffs.",
      "Yields on Treasurys tumbled in part on rising expectations for coming cuts to rates, along with general fear about the health of the U.S. economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.04% from 4.20% late Wednesday and from roughly 4.80% in January.",

      "WASHINGTON -- After a long wait, the Senate is launching action on President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\u201d of tax breaks and spending cuts at a risky moment for the U.S. and global economy.",
      "More than a month after House Republicans surprised Washington by advancing their framework for Trump's $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $2 trillion in spending cuts, Senate Republicans voted Thursday to start working on their version. The largely party-line vote, 52-48, sets the stage for a potential Senate all-nighter Friday spilling into the weekend.",
      "But work on the multitrillion-dollar package is coming as markets at home and abroad are on edge in the aftermath Trump's vast tariffs scheme, complicating an already difficult political and procedural undertaking on what Republicans hope will become their signature domestic policy package.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., opened the chamber Thursday saying they expected to be ready to begin.",
      "Trump says he's on board with the plan and Republicans, in control of Congress, are eager to show the party is making progress toward delivering on their campaign promises. By nightfall, as voting began, one Republican, the libertarian-leaning Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against, as did all Democrats.",
      "Democrats, as the minority party, don't have the votes to stop the GOP plan. But they intend to use the procedural tools available to prolong the process. Democrats argue that Republicans are focusing on tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of the programs and services millions of Americans rely on for help with health care, child care, school lunches and other everyday needs.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re mean, they\u2019re nasty, they\u2019re uncaring,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said about the Republicans. \u201cWe, tonight and tomorrow, are going to show just who they are.\"",
      "Senate Democrats started consuming up to 25 hours of their available debate time, holding the floor into the night and railing against potential GOP cuts to Medicaid, veterans programs, DOGE cuts and the impact of Trump's tariffs.",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Budget committee, repeated a slogan he has been sharing: \u201cFamilies lose and billionaires win.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat,\" he said, \u201cis the Republican plan.\u201d",
      "Fundamental to the Senate package is making sure Trump\u2019s first-term tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of the year, are continued and made a permanent fixture of the tax code. The senators also will consider adding Trump's proposed tax cuts on tipped wages, Social Security income and others.",
      "The Senate package also would bolster border security funds by some $175 billion to carry out Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign, which is running short of cash, and it would add national security funds for the Pentagon \u2014 all priorities the Senate GOP tucked into an earlier version that was panned by House Republicans.",
      "Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the party whip, said that without action tax cuts would expire, becoming a $4 trillion tax hike on Americans. \u201cRepublicans are focused on getting America back on track,\u201d he said.",
      "What's unclear is how it will all be paid for, since Republican deficit hawks typically require spending offsets to help defray the lost tax revenue and avoid piling onto the nation's $36 trillion debt load.",
      "While House Republicans approved their package with $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and up to $2 trillion in spending cuts, the Senate Republicans are taking a different tack.",
      "Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham is making the case that since the existing Trump tax breaks are the current policy, they are not considered new, and do not need to be offset with reductions in spending \u2014 an approach Democrats compare to \u201cgoing nuclear\u201d with the normal rules, particularly if the strategy is put to the test with an unfavorable ruling before the Senate parliamentarian.",
      "Instead, Senate Republicans are considering offsets mostly for any new Trump tax breaks. Raising alarms from the most conservative budget hawks, the senators have set a floor of about $4 billion in budget reductions to health and other programs \u2014 a fraction of the package's expected $4 trillion-plus price tag for tax breaks.",
      "GOP leaders are assuring the deficit hawks within their own ranks that the legislation says the cuts can rise to as much as $2 trillion.",
      "After an expected Friday night vote-a-rama, with dozens of amendments being offered to the package, the senators are planning to stay into Saturday if needed to take a final vote to approve it, sending it to the House for action.",
      "The House and Senate will ultimately need to merge their frameworks into a final product, expected in May, but House Speaker Mike Johnson's intention to have it all wrapped up by Memorial Day could prove optimistic.",
      "The political environment is uncertain, and the public's appetite for steep budget cuts is being tested in real time, with Trump's Department of Government Efficiency headed by billionaire Elon Musk blazing through federal offices, firing thousands of workers and shuttering long-running government mainstays \u2014 from scientific research projects on diseases to educational services for schoolchildren to offices that help with Social Security, tax filing and the weather.",
      "At the same time, the staunchest fiscal conservatives in both the House and Senate, many aligned with the Freedom Caucus, are pushing for even more cuts.",
      "Trump told senators publicly and privately this week he would have their backs, particularly when it comes to standing up for the spending reductions. At a White House announcing the tariffs Wednesday, Trump said the Senate plan had his \u201ccomplete and total support.\u201d",

      "An executive order the president signed Wednesday will eliminate the \u201cde minimis provision\u201d for goods from China and Hong Kong on May 2. The tax exemption, which applies to packages valued at $800 or less, has helped China-founded e-commerce companies like Shein and Temu to thrive while cutting into the U.S. retail market.",
      "\u201cShoppers had a full array of product and options of timing,\u201d Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor at market research firm Circana, said. \u201cNow, they\u2019re going to have a limited array of options and timing: so you can still buy this product, but you may have to wait three or four weeks.\u201d",
      "U.S. politicians, law enforcement agencies and business groups have described the long-standing policy as a trade loophole that gave inexpensive Chinese goods an advantage and served as a portal for illicit drugs and counterfeits to enter the country.",
      "The sweeping tariffs Trump announced on Wednesday also aim to end the duty-free exception for all imported goods worth less than $800, but only when the U.S. government has the personnel in place to process parcels from every country.",
      "A White House fact sheet said small packages of Chinese products sent through the international postal network will be subject to a duty rate of either 30% of their value or $25 per item, an amount that will increase to $50 per item after June 1.",
      "Commercial carriers such as FedEx and UPS will be required to report shipment details and remit the appropriate duties to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, according to the White House. After Trump's latest round of tariffs, the tariff rate for Chinese products will be at least 54%.",
      "Supporters of the de minimis exception have argued that its elimination would drive up costs and hurt low-income consumers and small businesses.",
      "The tariff costs threaten to deal a blow to the U.S. operations of companies like Shein and Temu, which rapidly expanded in the U.S. using the de minimis provision to deliver ultra-cheap fast fashion items from China.",
      "However, it's unclear what impact the loss of the tax exemption will have on the two online retailers, as well as on American companies like Amazon and Walmart, whose platforms include virtual marketplaces where international sellers offer products.",
      "Shein and Temu already have been building warehouses in the U.S. so they could get orders to U.S. shoppers more quickly. Shein recently opened a fulfillment and logistics hub in the Seattle area. Neither company could be reached for comment Thursday.",

      "Hilton Beckham, an assistant commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the federal agency was ready to implement the latest tariffs.",

      "Introduced in 1938, the de minimis exception was intended to facilitate the flow of small packages valued at no more than $5, the equivalent of about $109 today. The threshold increased to $200 in 1994 and $800 in 2016. But the rapid rise of cross-border e-commerce, driven by China, has challenged the intent of the decades-old customs exception rule.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to a February report by the Congressional Research Service. And the U.S. market has been a major destination.",
      "The Chinese government, which sees cross-border e-commerce as a critical part of its foreign trade, has introduced favorable policies, including financial support and infrastructure building, to foster its growth.",
      "Former President Joe Biden proposed a rule last year that said foreign companies can\u2019t avoid tariffs simply by shipping goods that they claim to be worth $800 or less. Trump tried in February to end the exception but his initial order was called off within days when it appeared the U.S. was not prepared to process and collect tariffs on the millions of parcels.",
      "U.S. Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, said she was pleased Trump acted a second time to eliminate the rule.",

      "In 2023, for the first time, more than 1 billion such packages came through U.S. customs, up from 134 million in 2015. By the end of last year, Customs and Border Protection said it was processing about 4 million small shipments a day.",
      "The cheap prices and increasing popularity of Shein and Temu squeezed fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21 and H&M. Forever 21 blamed the tax exemption in part for its decision to file for bankruptcy last month  and close its U.S. stores,",
      "\u201cWe have been unable to find a sustainable path forward, given competition from foreign fast-fashion companies, which have been able to take advantage of the de minimis exemption to undercut our brand on pricing and margin,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brad Sell said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon launched late last year a low- cost online storefront featuring electronics, apparel and other products priced under $20, in an apparent effort to compete with Temu and Shein. Amazon shipped the products to U.S. customers from a warehouse it operates in China, according to documentation the company provided to sellers.",

      "Mexico is celebrating having dodged the latest round of tariffs from the White House taking aim at dozens of U.S. trading partners around the world",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico celebrated Thursday having dodged the latest round of tariffs from the White House taking aim at dozens of U.S. trading partners around the world, but was also quickly reminded that in a global economy the effects of uncertainty can\u2019t be entirely avoided.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum said the free-trade agreement signed by Mexico, Canada and the U.S. during Trump\u2019s first administration had shielded Mexico.",
      "Now her government will focus on the existing 25% U.S. tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum, while accelerating domestic production to safeguard jobs and reduce imports.",
      "\u201cDuring my last call with President Trump, I said that, in the case of reciprocal tariffs, my understanding was that there wouldn\u2019t be tariffs (on Mexico), because Mexico doesn\u2019t place tariffs on the United States,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard noted that despite having free-trade agreements with the U.S., many countries were targeted by the tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump announced Wednesday on what he dubbed \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d Trump framed the tariffs as a way to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.",
      "Noting that Mexico escaped the latest round of tariffs, Ebrard said swaths of Mexican exports including agricultural products like avocados, clothing and electronics will continue to enter the U.S. without import duties.",
      "Ebrard said it wasn't a given that the free-trade agreement would be preserved, \u201cbecause in a new commercial order based on tariffs it's very hard for a free-trade agreement to survive.\u201d The fact that it did, puts Mexico at a competitive advantage, because \u201cit's going to be cheaper to produce in Mexico than in any other part of the world.\u201d",
      "Oscar Ocampo, a specialist in foreign trade at the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, a think tank, said \u201cthe United States is closing off to the rest of the world and in relative terms closing off less with Mexico and that is an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum is seeking to use that opportunity to encourage companies producing in Mexico who had not been exporting under the free-trade agreement for various reasons to take the necessary steps to qualify. She cited major German auto producers as an example.",
      "Qualifying for the free-trade agreement could involve anything from doing paperwork to making adjustments to the sourcing of a product.",
      "Despite Trump's latest tariffs not being imposed on Mexico, the uncertainty they created and the interconnectedness of the North American auto supply chains meant it didn\u2019t take long for the effects to touch Mexico.",
      "Stellantis, maker of auto brands including Dodge and Jeep, announced that it would pause production at its assembly plant in Toluca west of Mexico City for the month of April while it assesses the tariffs' impact on its operations. The company has more than 15,000 employees in Mexico. A similar temporary production halt was scheduled for an assembly plant in Canada and some 900 workers were to be temporarily laid off across several plants in the United States.",
      "That uncertainty is part of the reasons why Sheinbaum is pushing Plan Mexico, an initiative to promote and cultivate more domestic production.",
      "As an example, she cited a collaboration between her government, local universities and Mexican companies Megaflux and Dina to produce electric buses for public transportation.",
      "Ebrard said recently that the buses represent not only a technological advance in Mexico, but also a \u201cstrategic decision\u201d in favor of Mexico\u2019s industrial sovereignty.",
      "At a factory in Mexico City, the electric buses called Taruk \u2014 trail-runner in the Indigenous Yaqui language \u2013 are already in production. Megaflux Director General Roberto Gottfried said the company hopes to deliver some 200 by year's end.",
      "He noted that some 70% of the Taruk's components are produced in Mexico, including its motor, but the lithium batteries that power them come from China.",
      "In a country where one out of every three people use public transportation every day, developing this sector domestically is critical, Gottfried said.",
      "Despite the global economic challenges presented by the uncertainty caused by tariffs, he said, Mexico\u2019s large internal market gives the initiative a competitive advantage to develop and weather the storm.",

      "KINSHASA, Congo -- A Trump administration official said Thursday the United States is in talks with conflict-plagued Congo on developing its mineral resources under a deal the Congolese president has said could help make his country safer.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump's senior adviser for Africa, Massad Boulos, did not provide details of the potential deal following talks with Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi in Kinshasa, but he said it could involve \u201cmultibillion-dollar investments.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have heard about a minerals agreement. We have reviewed\" the Congo's proposal, Boulos said. \u201cI am pleased to announce that the president and I have agreed on a path forward for its development.\u201d",
      "American companies would be \u201coperating transparently\u201d and would \u201cstimulate local economies,\" Boulos said.",
      "Congo is the world\u2019s largest producer of cobalt, a mineral used to make lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and smartphones. It also has substantial gold, diamond and copper reserves.",
      "Tshisekedi said last month that he was open to a deal on developing critical minerals with the United States if the American involvement could help quell insurgencies and boost security in the African country.",
      "\u201cI think that the U.S. is able to use either pressure or sanctions to make sure that armed groups ... can be kept at bay,\u201d he said on U.S. TV broadcaster Fox.",
      "The Trump administration also is negotiating with Ukraine over a minerals deal in that country, which originally was proposed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last fall in hopes of strengthening his country's hand in its conflict with Russia by tying U.S. interests to Ukraine\u2019s future.",
      "Eastern Congo has been in conflict for decades with more than 100 armed groups, most of which are vying for territory in the mineral-rich region near the border with Rwanda. The conflict has created one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises with more than 7 million people displaced, including 100,000 who fled homes this year.",
      "The M23 is the most potent armed group and is backed by Congo\u2019s neighbor Rwanda. In a major escalation since January, the M23 rebels have captured the cities of Goma and Bukavu and several towns in eastern Congo, prompting fears of regional war.",
      "On Thursday, M23 withdrew from Walikale, a key mining town in eastern Congo it captured last month, after weeks of fighting with Congolese forces and its allied Wazalendo militia.",
      "M23 spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka said the group decided to \u201creposition its forces\u201d from Walikale and its surrounding areas in line with a unilateral ceasefire it declared in February.",
      "Willy Mishiki, a national deputy representing Walikale, said the rebels left under pressure from the Wazalendo. Walikale resident Faustin Kamala said it's not clear where the rebels went.",
      "The Walikale area is home to the largest tin deposits in Congo and to several significant gold mines. The Bisie tin mine, around 60 kilometers (35 miles) northwest of the town, accounts for the majority of tin exports from North Kivu province.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s expansive new tariff regime reverses a decades-long global trend of lower trade barriers that will likely raise prices for U.S. consumers and threatens to sharply slow the economy this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's expansive new tariffs reverse a decades-long global trend of lower trade barriers and are likely, economists say, to raise prices for Americans by thousands of dollars each year while sharply slowing the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House is gambling that other countries will also suffer enough pain that they will open up their economies to more American exports, leading to negotiations that would reduce the tariffs imposed Wednesday.",
      "Or, the White House hopes, companies will reverse their moves toward global supply chains and bring more production to the United States to avoid higher import taxes.",
      "But a key question for the Trump administration will be how Americans react to the tariffs. If prices rise noticeably and jobs are lost, voters could turn against the duties and make it harder to keep them in place for the time needed to encourage companies to return to the U.S.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab estimates the Trump administration's tariffs would cost the average household $3,800 in higher prices this year. That includes the 10% universal tariff plus much higher tariffs on about 60 countries announced Wednesday, as well as previous import taxes on steel, aluminum and cars. Inflation could top 4% this year, from 2.8% currently, while the economy may barely grow, according to estimates by Nationwide Financial.",
      "Investors turned thumbs-down on the new duties Thursday, with the S&P 500 index dropping 4.8% at the close of trading, its worst day since the pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 1,600 points.",
      "Still, Trump was upbeat Thursday when asked about the stock market drop.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s going very well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an operation, like when a patient gets operated on and it\u2019s a big thing. I said this would exactly be the way it is.\"",
      "The average U.S. tariff could rise to nearly 25% when the tariffs are fully implemented April 9, economists estimate, higher than in more than a century, and higher than the 1930 Smoot-Hawley tariffs that are widely blamed for worsening the Great Depression.",
      "\u201cThe president just announced the de facto separation of the U.S. economy from the global economy,\u201d said Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Relations. \u201cThe stage is set for higher prices and slower growth over the long term.\"",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick argued the policies will help open markets overseas for U.S. exports.",
      "\u201cI expect most countries to start to really examine their trade policy towards the United States of America, and stop picking on us,\u201d he said on CNBC Thursday. \u201dThis is the reordering of fair trade.\u201d",
      "Bob Lehmann, 73, who stopped by a Best Buy in Portland, Oregon, Wednesday opposed the tariffs. \u201cThey\u2019re going to raise prices and cause people to pay more for daily living,\u201d he said.",
      "Mathew Hall, a 64-year-old paint contractor, called the tariffs a \u201cgreat idea\u201d and said potential price increases in the short term were worth it.",
      "\u201cI believe in the long term, it\u2019s going to be good,\u201d he said, adding that he felt the U.S. had been taken advantage of.",
      "But a former trade official from Trump\u2019s first term, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk candidly about the impact, suggested that Americans, including those who voted for Trump, may have difficulty accepting the stiff duties.",
      "Americans \u201chave never faced tariffs like this,\u201d the former official said Thursday. \u201cThe downstream impact on clothing and shoe stores, it\u2019s going to be pretty significant. So we\u2019ll have to see how the Trump voters view this ... and how long their support for these policies goes.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, automaker Stellantis, which owns the Jeep, Citroen and Ram brands, said it would temporarily halt production at plants in Canada and Mexico in response to Trump's 25% tax on imported cars. The reduced output means the company is temporarily laying off 900 workers at plants in Michigan and Indiana.",
      "Some exporters overseas may cut their prices to offset some of the tariffs, and U.S. retailers could eat some of the cost as well. But most economists expect much of the tariffs to bring higher prices.",
      "The tariffs will hit many Asian countries hard, with duties on Vietnamese imports rising to 46% and on Indonesia to 32%. Tariffs on some Chinese imports will be as high as 79%. Those three countries are the top sources of U.S. shoe imports, with Nike making about half its shoes last year and one-third of its clothes in Vietnam.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab estimates all Trump\u2019s tariffs this year will push clothing prices 17% higher.",
      "On Thursday, the Home Furnishings Association, which represents more than 13,000 U.S. furniture stores, predicted the tariffs will increase prices between 10% and 46%. Vietnam and China are the top furniture exporters to the U.S.",
      "It said manufacturers in Asia are offsetting some of the costs by discounting their products and lowering ocean freight rates, but that won't be enough to avoid price hikes. Even domestically made furniture often relies on imported components.",
      "\u201cWhile many in the industry support the long-term goal of reshoring manufacturing, the reality is that it will take at least a decade to scale domestic production,\u201d Home Furnishings Association CEO Shannon Williams said in a statement. \u201cPermitting, training a skilled workforce and managing the higher costs of U.S. manufacturing are significant hurdles.\u201d",
      "At Gethsemane Garden Center in Chicago, there are Canadian-grown tulip, daffodil and hyacinth bulbs, though only about 5% of center plants are imported. Thousands of lemon cypress trees from Canada are sold year-round and Canadian mums are sold in the fall.",
      "Regas Chefas, whose family has owned Gethsemane for decades, says all the tariffs won't be passed onto customers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to absorb some of the increase. The growers will absorb some of the increases and then the customers will pay a little bit higher price,\u201d he said.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, which represents Coca-Cola, General Mills, Nestle, Tyson and Del Monte as well as Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive, said its companies already make the majority of their goods in the U.S.",
      "But there are critical ingredients and inputs \u2014 like wood pulp for toilet paper \u2014 that are imported because of scarce domestic availability. Cinnamon is harvested from trees that can\u2019t survive in the U.S.. Domestic production of coffee and cocoa is also limited.",
      "\u201cWe encourage President Trump and his trade advisers to fine-tune their approach and exempt key ingredients and inputs in order to protect manufacturing jobs and prevent unnecessary inflation at the grocery store,\u201d said Tom Madrecki, the association\u2019s vice president of supply chain resiliency.",
      "Outside a Tractor Supply south of Denver, two family members on opposite sides of the political spectrum debated the tariffs.",
      "Chris Theisen, a 62-year-old Republican, said: \u201cI feel a good change coming on, I feel it\u2019s going to be hard, but you don\u2019t go to the gym and walk away and say, \u2019God, I feel great.\u201d",
      "Nayen Shakya, a Democrat and Theisen\u2019s great nephew, said higher prices are already a hardship. At the restaurant where he works, menu prices have been raised to account for higher ingredient costs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really easy sometimes to say some things in a vague way that everyone can agree with that is definitely more complex under the surface,\u201d said Shakya. \"The burden of the increased prices is already going to the consumer.\u201d",
      "Listening to his nephew, Theisen added: \u201cI understand this side of it, too.\"",

      "The rate fell to 6.64% from 6.65% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.82%.",

      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also fell this week, pulling the average rate down to 5.82% from 5.89% last week. A year ago, it averaged 6.06%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by factors including bond market investors\u2019 expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions.",

      "The yield slid to 4.06% Thursday as a sharp sell-off on Wall Street following the White House\u2019s latest and most severe volley of tariffs fueled expectations among bond investors that the Fed may have to cut its main interest rate if the economy sours.",
      "\u201cThe 10-year Treasury has dipped even further this morning as investors are exiting the stock market, so it\u2019s likely that mortgage rates will continue to come down in the coming months as a result,\u201d said Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com. \u201cThis shock to the system will be felt in the housing market for the rest of the year.\u201d",
      "Recent forecasts by housing economists generally called for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain around 6.5% this year.",
      "Lower mortgage rates can help spur home sales by make homeownership more affordable. At the same time, many Americans may put off buying a home if they're worried about losing their job or taking a hit on their stock portfolio during an economic downturn.",
      "\u201cIt remains to be seen whether relief from mortgage rates will spur buyers to make a move in 2025, or if the broader economic conditions will slow things down,\u201d Berner said.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "Easing mortgage rates and more homes on the market nationally helped drive sales higher in February from the previous month, though they were down year-over-year.",

      "\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to do is change the acoustics, so every minute detail in the room has been conserved and preserved, so the sound doesn't shift,\u201d said Sally Davies, managing director of Abbey Road Studios.",
      "The reverb of the 4,844-square-foot (450-square-meter) room has been maintained at 2.3 seconds, the same as it was in the 1970s. There\u2019s been no redecorating or style makeover, leaving the original Art Deco wall panels untouched.",
      "\u201cWe have simply washed down the walls to preserve that sound,\u201d said Davies, adding that the floor was re-sanded and oiled, but not varnished.

It\u2019s also hosted other music greats like Maria Callas, Igor Stravinsky, Daniel Barenboim, Fats Waller and Glenn Miller.",
      "Due to its huge size, more than double Studio Two, it can fit a 100-piece orchestra and 100-member choir at the same time \u2014 which is perfect for recording film soundtracks, and explains why six to seven out of every 10 Hollywood films are scored at Abbey Road, according to the studio.",
      "Standing on the balcony, overlooking the 40-foot-high (12-meter-high) room, Davies points out the original screen that was used to show \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d (1981) while musicians played along to record the soundtrack.",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was once called the most popular politician on Earth by then-U.S. President Barack Obama. Those times are long gone.",
      "Halfway through his latest four-year term, Lula's approval rating has plunged down to levels never before seen in any of this three administrations. Brazil's economy is growing and its unemployment is decreasing, but people are complaining about higher food prices and crime.",
      "Lula\u2019s approval rating has dropped to 24%, according to the country\u2019s most prominent pollster Datafolha in its latest February poll, which interviewed 2,007 people across Brazil with a margin of error of 2 percentage points. That is an all-time low across his time in office from 2003 to 2010, and since he took office again in 2023. The previous record was 28% in 2005. Surveys by other firms also show a rise in discontent.",
      "And in an apparent attempt to claw back support, the government on Thursday is hosting an event in the capital, Brasilia.",
      "\u201cThe objective is to present the achievements of the Federal Government in the first two years,\u201d the presidential palace said in a statement this week.",
      "Lula\u2019s difficulties come against a Brazilian political landscape in upheaval, with his predecessor and bitter rival former President Jair Bolsonaro due to stand trial on charges that the right-wing politician attempted a coup.",
      "The plunge in support also comes as Lula, 79, weighs whether to run for re-election next year.",
      "For many observers, the increase in the cost of food is a top reason for Lula\u2019s fall in popularity. Food and drinks were nearly 8% more expensive in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to Brazil's national statistics agency.",
      "\u201cFood inflation has a direct impact on people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Carla Beni, a professor of economics at Getulio Vargas Foundation, pointing especially to the rise of the cost of meat, a staple of Brazilians' diet.",
      "Beni said prices have soared due to the impact of climate change on crops and the strengthening of the dollar against the real.",
      "An uptick in food prices particularly affects the poor \u2013 Lula\u2019s historical support base. A poll by private firm Genial/Quaest released Wednesday showed a surge in disapproval among women, Black people and in Brazil\u2019s poorer northeast. In six months, the percentage of respondents who disapprove of Lula's administration in the northeast jumped from 26% to 46%. And more women have a poor opinion of the government than they do a positive one.",
      "\u201cNot only are things expensive, but we\u2019re also living in a dangerous country,\u201d said Anderson Vianna, 45, a sales representative who lives Rio de Janeiro's low-income northern zone. \u201cIf you have your phone in hand, you can\u2019t relax,\u201d added the man who voted for Lula in 2002, 2006 and 2022.",
      "To reign in food inflation, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin announced on March 6 that the government would reduce import taxes to zero on a series of products, including meat and coffee.",
      "But the measure does not appear to have turned the public\u2019s perception of the government. Jo\u00e3o Feres, a political scientist at Rio de Janeiro State University, said Lula\u2019s government has a myriad of public policies but \u201cthe problem is communicating the results of these policies.\u201d",
      "A blow to Lula came in January, when his government said it would increase oversight of financial transactions, including Brazil\u2019s popular instant payment system PIX.",
      "That sparked a flurry of fake news pushed by far-right politicians close to Bolsonaro, who said the government planned to impose a new tax on PIX payments. The administration denied the accusation, but ended up backtracking on the step.",
      "\u201cThat was the first point that really damaged Lula\u2019s image,\u201d said Paulo Feldmann, an economist at the University of Sao Paulo.",
      "Crime and violence are other top concerns.",
      "\u201cSince the end of restriction of movement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it's in first place\u201d in the ranking of Brazilians' worries, said Marcos Calliari, the country's director of pollster IPSOS.",
      "Over the weekend, the video of an influencer inadvertently filming the moment her phone was stolen at the Lollapalooza festival in Sao Paulo went viral. Almost one in 10 Brazilians had their phone stolen between July 2023 and June 2024, according to Datafolha.",
      "Lula has sharpened his tone against thieves in recent weeks. \u201cWe will not allow criminals to take over our country,\u201d he said on March 19.",
      "The justice ministry is planning to send a bill to Congress that would increase the maximum sentence for receiving and benefiting from stolen cellphones from eight to up to 12 years, it said in a statement on Friday.",
      "Lula\u2019s government is also preparing a wider bill on security.",
      "To woo back voters, the government is also counting on a proposal to cut taxation for the poor. Mid-March, the administration sent a bill to Congress that seeks to exempt individuals earning up to 5000 reais (around $880) per month from income tax, up from around 2,300 reais currently.",
      "If Congress approves the bill, observers say it could be a big win for Lula, though it's uncertain whether it will restore his popularity.",
      "With Lula struggling in the polls and Bolsonaro barred from running until 2030, the next election is much more unpredictable than the previous one, Beni said.",

      "Employer-sanctioned groups designed to enhance diversity and inclusion began in corporate America in the 1970s to help address tensions around race, gender and sexual orientation",
      "NEW YORK -- After moving to the United States from South Korea at age 6, Jenny Jang found it challenging to navigate through school and her first jobs.",
      "\u201cIn all of the environments I was in, I was always a minority,\u201d Jang said. \u201cComing to the States, I didn\u2019t have a road map for me. And I couldn\u2019t ask these questions to my parents, so I had to seek mentorship from elsewhere.\u201d",
      "Now based in Atlanta and working at an international elevator company, Jang launched the organization's business resource groups in North America. The gatherings offered ways for employees to find support and connect around an identity or theme.",
      "The first group, for women employees, drew 500 members in three years. Jang brought in a facilitator to lead conversations on topics such as balancing family responsibilities and a career in a male-dominated industry. A group for veterans and supporting military families came next.",
      "The gatherings \u201cbecame a safe space where employees could share their experiences,\u201d she said.",
      "Employee resource groups, which are voluntary, employer-sanctioned groups designed to enhance diversity and inclusion, began in corporate America in the 1970s to help address tensions around race, gender and sexual orientation. Over the years, the focus has expanded to recognize other affiliations and experiences, such as caring for a family member, mental health challenges, neurodiversity and generational divides.",
      "Critics of ERGs have become more outspoken in arguing that such groups give participants unfair advantages and damage staff morale by splintering colleagues based on personal characteristics or beliefs. In some cases, companies have responded to complaints by revising the purpose and scope of their employee groups.",
      "An executive order President Donald Trump signed with the goal of ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government and beyond has created additional uncertainty around the future of ERGs. Here is some information about starting, participating in or evaluating the groups at your company:",
      "The Equal Employment Opportunities Commission released guidance in March which said that limiting membership in ERGs to workers covered by anti-discrimination laws, such as only women or people of a particular race, can be considered unlawful segregation.",
      "To comply with the EEOC's interpretation, employers should ensure workplace groups are open to all employees.",
      "\u201cThey want to make sure these programs are not offering some tangible benefit to one group of employees at the expense of another,\u201d said Infinito Associates CEO Kevin England, whose consulting group helps organizations start ERGs.",
      "If an ERG offers mentorship or opportunities only to people who identify as a member of a legally protected class, \"you absolutely do need to open that up,\u201d said David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law.",
      "Some employee resource groups organized around an identity create separate email lists for members who share the identity and members who describe themselves as allies. Glasgow advises against doing that. \u201cIt raises the question of what you're excluding people from,\u201d he said.",
      "The Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, a conservative public interest law firm and policy organization, has received dozens of complaints from employees who felt excluded from their workplace ERGs, according to Deputy Counsel Dan Lennington. Opening employee groups to everyone will not necessarily satisfy those concerns, he said.",
      "\u201cThe question is, are you treating employees differently based on race?\u201d Lennington said. \u201cAre you making employees feel uncomfortable about their race or gender or sexual identity?\u201d",
      "Proponents of ERGs list numerous benefits for employees and management. For participants, the groups are places to find community, develop leadership skills and create a channel for sharing their views with higher-ups. Companies often sponsor affinity groups as a tool for recruiting and retaining diverse employees.",
      "\u201cEmployee engagement is great because it creates, typically, higher effort and retention,\u201d said Helena Pagano, chief people and culture officer at insurance and financial services firm Sun Life. \u201cOne way that you drive engagement is making people feel like they had a voice. They had a place to express opinions and drive policies and outcomes that matter in the company.\u201d",
      "England, the consultant, was working at a bank call center when he joined and then took on a leadership role in an ERG for people who identify as LGBTQIA+.",
      "\u201cI was terrified to speak publicly, and because of that role, I had to do a lot of that,\u201d England said. \u201cI was able to develop skills that were completely unrelated to my day job.\"",
      "Anna Ettin co-founded Bank of America\u2019s intergenerational employee network about a decade ago, and worked on bridging gaps between millennials and baby boomers. Now, as co-founder of Tapestry Partner Solutions, a consulting group that specializes in intergenerational dynamics and skills development, she's doing the same work with Generation Z.",
      "\u201cThere are some real differences in the way they\u2019re coming into the workplace and what their needs are, their expectations,\" Ettin said. \u201cWe\u2019re really helping companies think through, how do you retain the incredibly talented staff you have and also be appetizing to Gen Z?\u201d",
      "When Ettin worked in a call center about 20 years ago, she noticed few women in management roles. \u201cThere was a clear gap in the leadership pipeline for women,\u201d she said. She gathered 20 highly engaged women and they started by planning events on interviewing skills, resume writing and talks with senior female leaders about their career paths and obstacles they'd overcome.",
      "Experts recommend finding a senior leader to act as a sponsor. In Ettin's case, that meant convincing the call center manager to approve and participate in the group.",
      "Groups typically begin when 10 or 20 people find each other organically and get together for happy hours or lunches, England said. \u201cYou get some momentum going, and sometimes that group of 20 people becomes 50 or 100 people,\u201d he added.",
      "Then you can tell leaders, \u201cwe already have an informal collection of employees with this shared experience, and we would love to do something more with this,\" England said. \"We think that this group of friends and colleagues could help the organization.\u201d",
      "Some ERGs are given company funds for meals, events or travel to conferences. A new group should be prepared to make a business case for a budget request. Experts also advise collecting data to show the group\u2019s impact in areas such as employee retention.",
      "It's easier to start a new ERG when an organization already has one in place because there's a road map of what worked and who supported the initial group. But if none exist at your workplace, you can start with one and build from there, Jang said. \u201cThere is no perfect recipe,\u201d she said. \u201cStart small.\u201d",
      "As organizations absorb various federal directives, they're deciding which direction to take. Some have adjusted to make it clear that all are welcome. Others have shuttered their ERGs altogether, wiping out years of work, Ettin said.",
      "\u201cThe underrepresented, underserved communities still need the programs, support, connectivity and advocacy that they\u2019ve needed for the last decades,\" Ettin added. \"That hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d",

      "He had a roof and four walls for protection, but gang violence forced him and his family to flee their home twice.",
      "Now, Asperges, 58, his wife and their two children are forced to sleep on the floor of a soiled and overcrowded makeshift shelter with thousands of other Haitians also left homeless by gang violence.",
      "\u201cBullets fall here all the time,\u201d he said.",
      "Having lost all his work equipment, Asperges relies solely on his phone, but he remains undeterred like dozens of other journalists in Haiti who are under attack like never before. They are dodging bullets, defying censorship and setting personal struggles aside as they document the downfall of Haiti\u2019s capital and the surge in violence blamed on powerful gangs that control 85% of Port-au-Prince.",
      "Heavily armed gangs attacked at least three TV and radio stations in March. Two of the buildings were already abandoned because of previous violence, but gunmen stole equipment that had been left behind.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a message: You don\u2019t operate without our permission, and you don\u2019t operate at all in our turf,\u201d said David C. Adams, an expert on press freedom issues in Haiti.",
      "Gangs sent an even deadlier message on Christmas Eve, when they opened fire on journalists covering the failed reopening of Haiti\u2019s largest public hospital, saying they had not authorized its reopening.",
      "Two journalists were killed and at least seven others were injured, including Asperges, who was shot in the stomach. It was the worst attack on reporters in Haiti in recent history.",
      "\u201cEveryone is threatened. Everyone is under pressure,\u201d said Max Chauvet, director of operations at Le Nouvelliste, Haiti\u2019s oldest independent newspaper.",
      "Donning a bulletproof vest emblazoned with \u201cPRESS\u201d on it is now a dangerous move in Haiti. What used to serve as a symbolic and physical shield has become a target.",
      "At least 10 journalists covering a major March protest were attacked, including Jephte Bazil, a videographer who runs his own media company, Machann Zen Ha\u00efti.",
      "He was threading his way through a protest in the Canap\u00e9-Vert neighborhood of Port-au-Prince when three men dressed in black and with their faces covered called him over.",
      "\u201cWhat the hell are you doing around here?\u201d Bazil recalled them asking.",
      "They searched his bag, took away his cellphone and demanded multiple forms of ID. Bazil handed over only his passport, keeping his ID card hidden because it stated he was from Martissant, a community that gangs seized several years ago. He was too scared to show it and possibly be accused of being a gang member or a sympathizer.",
      "\u201cI believe I could have been killed,\u201d Bazil said.",
      "After an interrogation that lasted at least half an hour, Bazil said the men released him. As he walked away, one followed him with a machete to see if he was headed where he said he was going.",
      "Once he reached his destination, Bazil said the man told him: \u201cIf you had made any other turn, I would have\u2026cut your head off.\u201d",
      "It was not the first time Bazil feared for his life. He was injured in December\u2019s hospital attack and, in February, while covering a confrontation between police and gangs, his motorcycle was shot but he was spared.",
      "\u201cJournalists are targets now, whether police or gangs,\u201d he said.",
      "Haitians increasingly distrust the media, accusing local journalists of working for gangs. Meanwhile, gang members have taken to social media to threaten journalists. One gang leader said he would kidnap radio reporters and ensure they won\u2019t ever talk into a microphone again, while another threatened a talk show host based outside of Haiti, saying that if he ever set foot in the country, it would be the last time he would do so.",
      "As a result, Haiti\u2019s Online Media Collective has advised that journalists not cover incidents involving armed groups.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just journalists who are the victims, it\u2019s press freedom itself,\u201d said Obest Dimanche, the collective\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "But given the persistent attacks by heavily armed gangs in the capital and beyond, most journalists disregard that advice.",
      "They travel in packs and zoom around on motorcycles through Port-au-Prince\u2019s hilly neighborhoods, ducking in unison when shots are fired. At the end of the day, they check in on each other to ensure everyone returned safely home. Those who lost their homes to gang violence like Asperges go back to a shelter while others sleep on the floor of their media company.",
      "\u201cYou feel in danger doing your job nowadays,\u201d said Jean Daniel S\u00e9nat, a journalist at Le Nouvelliste and Magik9 radio station.",
      "He lamented how journalists no longer have access to many neighborhoods in the capital because of gang violence: \u201cIf you can\u2019t talk to the people\u2026you won\u2019t be able to report.\u201d",
      "The violence also has forced media companies to close, lay off reporters or stop printing, as was the case for Le Nouvelliste when gunmen attacked and occupied its offices last year. Since then, the newspaper has operated solely online.",
      "On March 13, Haiti\u2019s prime minister condemned the attack on the building that once housed Radio et T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Cara\u00efbes, the country\u2019s oldest radio station, and pledged to protect media institutions.",
      "Located on Rue Chavannes, the station\u2019s former headquarters were considered a \u201cheritage monument,\u201d said journalist Richecarde C\u00e9lestin, who works for the station.",
      "Founded in 1949, the station has reported on Haiti\u2019s tumultuous history: its coups, dictatorships and first democratic elections.",
      "Considered one of Haiti\u2019s most influential radio stations, it was a blow to many to see smoke and flames rising from the building.",

      "Also attacked that week was radio station M\u00e9lodie FM and TV station T\u00e9l\u00e9 Pluriel.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now, kind of the wholesale targeting of the media, is different,\u201d said Adams, the expert on press freedom issues in Haiti. \u201cIn the old days, individual journalists were targeted.\u201d",
      "According to UNESCO, at least 21 journalists were reported killed from 2000 to 2022 in Haiti, with nine killed in 2022, the deadliest year for Haitian journalism in recent history.",
      "The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists reported one journalist killed in 2023 and two more in 2024.",

The legislation wouldn't end meeting the carbon neutrality standard by 2050 as the 2021 law still requires.",
      "Senate bill supporters contend getting rid of the 70% target deadline would help Duke Energy \u2014 the state\u2019s dominant electric utility \u2014 assemble less expensive power sources now and moderate the electricity rate increases necessary to reach the 2050 standard. Besides, they say, state regulators already recently pushed back the interim deadline, as the law allows.",
      "The effort comes as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has proposed rolling back federal environmental and climate change policies, which critics say could boost pollution and threaten human health. Republicans in Washington, D.C., and Raleigh are touting them as ways to reduce the cost of living and boost the economy.",
      "Trump \u201cis taking bold action to make America energy-dominant!\u201d state Senate leader Phil Berger, a bill sponsor, wrote on the social platform X. \u201cTo bolster his efforts here in NC, we\u2019re cutting costs for families, removing arbitrary benchmarks, and encouraging new nuclear facilities.\u201d",
      "At least 17 other states \u2014 most controlled by Democrats \u2014 have laws setting similar net-zero power plant emissions or 100% renewable energy targets, the Natural Resources Defense Council says. North Carolina and Virginia are the only ones from the Southeast.",
      "Some North Carolina environmental groups didn't embrace the 2021 law, saying it lacked low-income customer assistance and contained loopholes to delay the 2030 mandate. Now they're criticizing the bill passed by the Senate in March as stalling climate action and benefiting Duke Energy financially. The 2021 law also lets the utility seek multiyear rate increases and performance-based incentives.",
      "\u201cDuke Energy agreed four years ago to carbon-reduction goals in exchange for an easier path to rate increases. It\u2019s taken full advantage of the smoother rate-setting process, but now wants to renege on its end of the deal,\u201d North Carolina Sierra Club director Chris Herndon said.",
      "Last fall, the state Utilities Commission, which regulates rates and services for public utilities, accepted that it was \u201cno longer reasonable or executable\u201d for Duke Energy to seek the 70% reduction by 2030, pushing that deadline back by at least four years. Eliminating the interim standard likely would mean scaling back or delaying solar and wind energy production now and relying more on natural gas over the next decade, according to modeling from Duke Energy and a state agency that represents consumers before the Utilities Commission.",
      "\u201cThe interim goal is not allowing our commission to make least-cost decisions, because the interim goal is driving fast, expensive behavior selecting generation types,\u201d said outgoing Sen. Paul Newton, a retired Duke Energy executive and bill sponsor. The bill also would open the door to the long-term construction of a large nuclear power plant, Newton added.",
      "Senate Republicans cite the models to estimate that removing the interim goal would reduce by at least $13 billion what Duke Energy would have to spend \u2014 and pass on to customers \u2014 in the next 25 years. Democrats voting against the measure questioned the $13 billion figure and supported an interim goal.",
      "\u201cNot having any target, even an aspirational target, could mean that we don\u2019t stay on track to get to our 2050 goal,\u201d Democratic Sen. Julie Mayfield said.",
      "The bill, now in the House, also would allow Duke Energy to seek higher electric rates to cover incremental construction costs of a nuclear or gas-powered plant, rather than wait until the project's end. Newton said the option would avoid one massive rate increase at the project\u2019s conclusion, reining in customer costs. Critics say it would boost Duke Energy\u2019s profits on expensive projects even if never completed.",
      "In supporting the bill, Duke Energy said the \u201clegislation allows modern, efficient and always-on generation to be deployed faster and cheaper\u201d and pointed to the commission's order last fall. While the North Carolina Chamber backs the bill, some companies oppose it.",
      "Any approved final bill would head to Cooper\u2019s successor, Gov. Josh Stein. The Democrat contends the bill would hurt electricity users and threaten the state\u2019s clean-energy economy.",
      "\u201cWe should be looking for solutions that create jobs and lower costs for hardworking North Carolinians, not increasing their financial burden,\u201d Stein spokesperson Morgan Hopkins said.",
      "While Democrats have enough legislative seats to uphold Stein\u2019s vetoes if they remain united, Duke Energy often finds allies in both parties. Three Democrats voted for the Senate bill with Republicans.",
      "Uncertainty over the bill's future could grow after Newton resigned from the Senate last week to take a university job.",

      "After weeks of anticipation and speculation, President Donald Trump followed through on his reciprocal tariff threats by declaring on Wednesday a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade...",
      "WASHINGTON -- After weeks of anticipation and speculation, President Donald Trump followed through on his tariff threats by declaring on Wednesday a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the United States.",
      "In announcing what he has called reciprocal tariffs, Trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise by raising U.S. taxes on foreign goods to narrow the gap with the tariffs the White House says other countries unfairly impose on U.S. products.",
      "Trump's higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the United States than they buy. But economists don\u2019t share Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for tariffs since they\u2019re a tax on importers that usually get passed on to consumers. It\u2019s possible, however, that the reciprocal tariffs could bring other countries to the table and get them to lower their own import taxes.",
      "The Associated Press asked for your questions about reciprocal tariffs. Here are a few of them, along with our answers:",
      "Tariffs are taxes on imports, collected when foreign goods cross the U.S. border by the Customs and Border Protection agency. The money \u2014 about $80 billion last year \u2014 goes to the U.S. Treasury to help pay the federal government\u2019s expenses. Congress has authority to say how the money will be spent.",
      "Trump \u2014 largely supported by Republican lawmakers who control the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives \u2014 wants to use increased tariff revenue to finance tax cuts that analysts say would disproportionately benefit the wealthy. Specifically, they want to extend tax cuts passed in Trump's first term and largely set to expire at the end of 2025. The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, has found that extending Trump\u2019s tax cuts would reduce federal revenue by $4.5 trillion from 2025 to 2034.",
      "Trump wants higher tariffs to help offset the lower tax collections. Another think tank, the Tax Policy Center, has said that extending the 2017 tax cuts would deliver continued tax relief to Americans at all income levels, \u201cbut higher-income households would receive a larger benefit.\u2019\u2019",
      "It depends on how businesses both in the United States and overseas respond, but consumers could see overall prices rising within a month or two of tariffs being imposed. For some products, such as produce from Mexico, prices could rise much more quickly after the tariffs take effect.",
      "Some U.S. retailers and other importers may eat part of the cost of the tariff, and overseas exporters may reduce their prices to offset the extra duties. But for many businesses, the tariffs Trump announced Wednesday \u2014 such as 20% on imports from Europe \u2014 will be too large to swallow on their own.",
      "Companies may also use the tariffs as an excuse to raise prices. When Trump slapped duties on washing machines in 2018, studies later showed that retailers raised prices on both washers and dryers, even though there were no new duties on dryers.",
      "A key question in the coming months is whether something similar will happen again. Economists worry that consumers, having just lived through the biggest inflationary spike in four decades, are more accustomed to rising prices than they were before the pandemic.",
      "Yet there are also signs that Americans, put off by the rise in the cost of living, are less willing to accept price increases and will simply cut back on their purchases. That could discourage businesses from raising prices by much.",
      "The U.S. Constitution grants the power to set tariffs to Congress. But over the years, Congress has delegated those powers to the president through several different laws. Those laws specify the circumstances under which the White House can impose tariffs, which are typically limited to cases where imports threaten national security or are severely harming a specific industry.",
      "In the past, presidents generally imposed tariffs only after carrying out public hearings to determine if certain imports met those criteria. Trump followed those steps when imposing tariffs in his first term.",
      "In his second term, however, Trump has sought to use emergency powers set out in a 1977 law to impose tariffs in a more ad hoc fashion. Trump has said, for example, that fentanyl flowing in from Canada and Mexico constitute a national emergency and has used that pretext to impose 25% duties on goods from both countries.",
      "Congress can seek to cancel an emergency that a president declares, and Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, has proposed to do just that regarding Canada. That legislation could pass the Senate but would likely die in the House. Other bills in Congress that would also limit the president's authority to set tariffs face tough odds for passage as well.",
      "U.S. tariffs are generally lower than those charged by other countries. The average U.S. tariff, weighted to reflect goods that are actually traded, is just 2.2% for the United States, versus the European Union\u2019s 2.7%, China\u2019s 3% and India\u2019s 12%, according to the World Trade Organization.",
      "Other countries also tend to do more than the United States to protect their farmers with high tariffs. The U.S. trade-weighted tariff on farm goods, for example, is 4%, compared to the EU\u2019s 8.4%, Japan\u2019s 12.6%, China\u2019s 13.1% and India\u2019s 65%. (The WTO numbers don\u2019t count Trump\u2019s recent flurry of import taxes or tariffs between countries that have entered into their own free trade agreements, such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that allows many goods to cross North American borders duty-free.)",
      "Yet the Trump administration has used its own calculations to come up with far greater tariffs that they say other economies impose on the U.S. For example, the White House said Wednesday that the European Union's effective tariffs on the U.S. equal 39%, far higher than the WTO's numbers. It says China's equal 67%.",
      "Previous U.S. administrations agreed to the tariffs that Trump now calls unjust. They were the result of a long negotiation between 1986 to 1994 \u2014 the so-called Uruguay Round \u2014 that ended in a trade pact signed by 123 countries and has formed the basis of the global trading system for nearly four decades.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate has passed a resolution that would thwart President Donald Trump\u2019s ability to impose tariffs on Canada",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed a resolution Wednesday night that would thwart President Donald Trump\u2019s ability to impose tariffs on Canada, delivering a rare rebuke to the president just hours after he unveiled sweeping plans to clamp down on international trade.",
      "The Senate resolution, passed by a 51-48 vote tally with four Republicans and all Democrats in support, would end Trump\u2019s emergency declaration on fentanyl trafficking that underpins tariffs on Canada. Trump earlier Wednesday announced orders \u2014 his so-called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d \u2014 to impose import taxes on a slew of international trading partners, though Canadian imports for now were spared from new taxes.",
      "The Senate\u2019s legislation has practically no chance of passing the Republican-controlled House and being signed by Trump, but it showed the limits of Republican support for Trump\u2019s vision of remaking the U.S. economy by restricting free trade. Many economists are warning that the plan could cause an economic contraction, and GOP senators are already watching with unease as Trump upends the United States\u2019 relationship with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump earlier Wednesday singled out the four Republicans \u2014 Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Rand Paul of Kentucky \u2014 who voted in favor of the resolution.",
      "In a statement following the vote, McConnell, the former Senate Republican leader, said, \u201cAs I have always warned, tariffs are bad policy, and trade wars with our partners hurt working people most.\u201d",
      "To justify the tariffs, Trump has argued that Canada is not doing enough to stop illegal drugs from entering the northern border. Customs and Border Protection seized 43 pounds of fentanyl in its northern border sector during the 2024 fiscal year, and since January, authorities have seized less than 1.5 pounds, according to federal data. Meanwhile, at the southern border, authorities seized over 21,000 pounds last year.",
      "\u201cThis is not about fentanyl. It\u2019s about tariffs. It\u2019s about a national sales tax on American families,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine, the Virginia Democrat who initiated the resolution, at a news conference Wednesday.",
      "Democrats argued that Trump is using the tariffs to pay for proposed tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy, but will also make it more expensive to build homes, buy cars and pay for imported grocery products. Kaine pointed to aluminum imported from Canada that is used by businesses ranging from pie makers to shipbuilders.",
      "\u201cToday, Donald Trump takes a sledgehammer to the American economy and even to the American dream,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech.",
      "On the heels of election results in Wisconsin and Florida that delivered early warning signs to Republicans about the popularity of Trump's agenda, Schumer said that the president is particularly vulnerable when it comes to the economy.",
      "\u201cOnce the American people say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to embrace somebody, I don\u2019t want to vote for somebody, I don\u2019t want to support somebody who embraces Trump\u2019s policies,\u2019 things are going to change,\" he told reporters. \u201cPublic sentiment is everything.\"",
      "At the White House on Wednesday, Trump singled out Canada as a beneficiary of \u201cunfair\u201d trading practices with the U.S., though his latest order did not add to tariffs already in place on Canada and Mexico.",
      "\u201cWhy are we doing this? I mean, at what point do we say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to work for yourselves and you\u2019ve got to\u2019? This is why we have the big deficits,\" Trump said.",
      "For their part, Republican leaders tried to hold their members in line not by talking about the impacts of tariffs, but by emphasizing that Trump was acting to address fentanyl trafficking and border security.",
      "Majority Whip Sen. John Barrasso argued in a floor speech that former President Joe Biden had \u201calso thrown open the northern border. The criminal cartels noticed and they took advantage.\u201d",
      "\"There are unique threats to the United States at our northern border,\" the Wyoming senator said. \u201cPresident Trump is taking the bold, decisive, swift action that is necessary to secure that border as well.\u201d",
      "Republicans lined up on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon to underscore the need to act to halt fentanyl trafficking, including at the northern border. However, it was not enough to persuade a key group of Senate Republicans who objected to the tax on Canadian imports.",
      "In a floor speech Wednesday, Collins said she would support the resolution and noted, \u201cThe fact is the vast majority of fentanyl in America comes from the southern border.\u201d",
      "Collins said that Canada is already beefing up border security to address drug trafficking, yet she was concerned about what tariffs would do to businesses and households in Maine. She pointed to a paper mill in her home state that pumps paper pulp from Canada.",
      "\u201cA tariff placed on this pulp would jeopardize the financial wellbeing of this vital paper mill, which employs more than 500 people in rural, northern Maine. There is not another big employer in that area that can possibly compensate for the loss of those 510 direct jobs,\u201d Collins said.",
      "Paul, a Kentucky Republican who often supports libertarian economic views, also delivered an impassioned floor speech, arguing that the president should not be given unilateral authority to impose taxes on imports.",
      "\u201cEvery dollar collected in tariff revenue comes straight out of the pockets of American consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cConservatives used to understand that tariffs are taxes on the American people. Conservatives used to be uniformly opposed to raising taxes because we wanted the private marketplace, the private individuals to keep more of their income.\u201d",
      "While a younger group of Republicans closely aligned with Trump has spoken out in favor of the president's plans to aggressively reshape the economy, a sizable portion of the Republican Conference voiced concerns about the tariff impacts on farmers and other industries. Still, most wanted to give Trump room in hopes that he would negotiate better trade deals.",
      "North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer said that he has been in constant talks with both Canadian officials and businesses in his state, like Bobcat, which does a significant amount of its sales in Canada. He voted against the resolution. Instead, he hoped that Trump's order would just be a starting point for negotiations to mutually drop tariffs.",
      "The Republican added: \u201cI\u2019m not overly concerned about it, but obviously it occupies a lot of attention and time and a lot of political anxiety.\"",
      "Democrats planned to keep pressing into that anxiety. After Trump\u2019s announcement, Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on social media he would also force a similar vote in the House on the tariffs.",
      "\u201cRepublicans can\u2019t keep ducking this \u2014 it\u2019s time they show whether they support the economic pain Trump is inflicting on their constituents,\u201d he said.",

      "She averaged 19.5 points and 6.7 rebounds in 241 regular-season games. She also played in 40 playoffs games, where she averaged 17.9 points, 6.1 boards and 2.3 assists.",
      "\u201cWords cannot adequately express how thankful I am to my family, all of my incredible teammates, friends, executives, sponsors, staff and most importantly the amazing fans that have accompanied me on this journey,\u201d she wrote. \"This game has been my life, and I am grateful for the memories and how much it\u2019s given me.

      "He was the villain. And he doesn't mind.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been the villain for the last two years now,\" Morant said. \"Not even just to this crowd.\u201d",

      "It wasn't. At least, not the whole story.",

      "He was criticized this week for making a finger-shooting motion in the direction of the Golden State Warriors' bench, evidently avoiding league sanction because Buddy Hield of the Warriors was doing the same his way.

      "\u201cI'm kind of used to it,\u201d Morant said. \u201cI was pretty much a villain for two years now. Every little thing, if somebody can say something negative about me, it's going to be out there. So, yeah. I don't care no more.\u201d",
      "The Grizzlies had nothing negative to say Thursday.",
      "Morant had a tough first half, three points on 1 for 7 shooting. He was 10 for 15 in the second half, getting 27 of his 30 points in that span \u2014 including the game-winner, a play where he knew exactly what he was going to do for the entire 13.8 seconds of the possession.",
      "\u201cI mean, that\u2019s beautiful to watch,\" said Grizzlies interim coach Tuomas Iisalo, who got his first win in his fourth attempt since taking over. \"It gives a lot of confidence, not just for me as a coach, but especially for the whole team, to have a guy like that.\u201d",
      "The win lifted Memphis out of the play-in tournament range and back to No. 6 \u2014 which will be the last guaranteed playoff spot \u2014 in the Western Conference. And Morant celebrated afterward, which was to be expected, after he was able to come through in a hostile road environment.",
      "\u201cI think anyone would relish that,\u201d Grizzlies center Jaren Jackson Jr. said. \u201cBut him specifically, I think he thrives off that. I mean, I wouldn't boo him. I wouldn't boo him.\u201d",

      "Francona said there\u2019s no common thread between the games that explains his lineup's struggles. The Reds have faced different styles of pitchers each time.",
      "Eovaldi is a veteran right-hander who went the distance while allowing four hits and no walks. Leiter\u2019s a hard-throwing rookie right-hander. Cortes, a veteran left-hander, doesn\u2019t have the velocity of Eovaldi or Leiter but effectively mixed his cutter and changeup with his fastball.",
      "Cincinnati\u2019s struggles Thursday may have been particularly frustrating because Cortes looked so awful in his last start, a 20-9 loss to the New York Yankees. Cortes allowed homers on each of his first three pitches that day and ended up yielding eight hits and five walks in two innings of a game that drew attention to the Yankees' use of \u201ctorpedo bats.\u201d",
      "The Reds made Cortes look like an entirely different pitcher.",
      "\u201cIt was embarrassing, what happened to me last time,\u201d Cortes said. \u201cI think, as a starter, you\u2019ve got 30 or 32 of these. There\u2019s going to be a lot of bad ones throughout the way. You\u2019ve just got to learn how to brush them off and go to the next one. That\u2019s what I did.\u201d",
      "The Reds\u2019 lone hit off Cortes came from Jose Trevino, who delivered a one-out double in the third off his former Yankees teammate. Cincinnati\u2019s only other hit Thursday was a single by Jeimer Candelario off Elvis Peguero in the seventh.",
      "Cincinnati has a combined nine hits, three walks and 27 strikeouts during the skid.",

We\u2019re out there putting some good at-bats together. We\u2019re going to turn this thing around. I have full confidence in this team.\u201d",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Cale Makar scored to become just the ninth NHL defenseman with 30 goals in a season and the Colorado Avalanche clinched a playoff berth with a 7-3 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Thursday night.",
      "Makar also had two assists while Charlie Coyle, Nathan MacKinnon and Devon Toews also had a goal and two assists each for the Avalanche, who scored five straight times after falling behind 3-2 in the second period.",
      "Miles Wood, Parker Kelly and Brock Nelson also scored for Colorado while Mackenzie Blackwood made 27 saves.",
      "Sean Monahan, Zachary Aston-Reese and Boone Jenner scored for the Blue Jackets and Elvis Merzlikins made 21 saves before being lifted with about 14 minutes to play.",
      "The Avalanche secured a berth in the Stanley Cup playoffs with the win, their second in two nights after beating the Chicago Blackhawks 3-2 in a shootout on Wednesday.",
      "The Blue Jackets needed a win to stay close in the chase for an Eastern Conference wild card, but the loss coupled with Montreal's win over Boston put them four points behind the Canadiens.",
      "After Jenner extended his points streak to six games with a second-period goal that gave Columbus a 3-2 lead, Coyle and Kelly scored just 1:23 apart later in the period to give Colorado the lead for good.",
      "With his goal, Makar became just the ninth NHL defenseman and first since Washington\u2019s Mike Green in the 2008-2009 season to reach the 30-goal mark in a season. Makar put the Avalanche up 5-2 by scoring a power-play goal with 38 seconds left in the second period.",
      "Columbus forward Zach Aston-Reese scored his fifth goal of the season and first since Nov. 15 \u2014 a span of 58 games.",
      "The Avalanche finish a three-game road trip at the St. Louis Blues on Saturday night. The Blue Jackets visit the Toronto Maple Leafs, also on Saturday night.",

Cortes yielded eight runs, five walks and six hits in two innings of a game that helped draw attention to the Yankees' use of \u201ctorpedo bats.\u201d",

      "One day after a 6-and-5 win in the opening round, Henderson pulled away late by winning five of the last seven holes Thursday in a 5-and-4 win over Peiyun Chien of Taiwan.",
      "One more day of round-robins matches remain at Shadow Creek before the winner of each of the 16 groups advance to the knockout stage on the weekend. While no one clinched her group, at least 18 players were eliminated on another day of this fickle format.",
      "Nelly Korda, the defending champion and No. 1 player, will have to beat Ariya Jutanugarn to win her group. Korda halved her opening match and she had a few shaky moments in a 1-up win over Jennifer Kupcho.",
      "Korda had a 4-foot putt to go 3 up with three holes to play, missed the putt, and then gave away the the par-5 16th with a bogey. It came down to the 18th, and Kupcho pulled her drive to the left side of the hazard. Her next shot clipped a tree and she stopped watching, only to discover the ball was on the green.",
      "Korda's approach was 40 feet long, and she did well to lag it to a foot. Kupcho missed her 30-foot birdie attempt and Korda moved on to a decisive match against Jutanugarn. The Thai is 2-0 and would only need a halve against Korda.",
      "\u201cVery questionable by me,\u201d Korda said of her play. \u201cDefinitely don\u2019t have my best stuff right now.. That\u2019s the greatest thing about match play, is even if you don\u2019t have your best stuff you have to grind it out.\"",
      "Lydia Ko joined Henderson as the only players who have yet to play the 15th hole in either of the two rounds. The difference is Ko lost her first match (6 and 4) before a 6-and-5 victory Thursday over Gabriela Ruffels. Everyone in Ko's group is 1-1.",
      "If any group ends in a tie, the winner is decided by a sudden-death playoff.",

      "Rose Zhang conceded her match against Albane Valenzuela after three holes. Zhang had complained about a neck injury in the opening round. That sets up a strange scenario.",
      "If Zhang can't play against Meghan Khang, Valenzuela would be eliminated. If Zhang can play and beats Khang, Valenzuela could win the group by beating Nataliya Guseva.",
      "Among those eliminated are Jin Young Ko and Leona Maguire in another bizarre situation.",
      "Ko needed to win the match to have any shot at the weekend. The match was dormie after 16, meaning Ko was eliminated. But the South Korean won the next two holes to halve the match, and that eliminated Maguire.",

      "Coming off his second AL MVP award, Judge fell a triple short of the cycle and is hitting .417 with five homers and 15 RBIs in the first six games this season. He has 320 homers, 175 doubles and five triples in 999 games, and only DiMaggio (853) and Gehrig (869) reached 500 extra-base hits in fewer games among Yankees.",

I just feel like he should get an extra- base hit every time. I kind of say it out loud just to try and remind myself what we\u2019re watching every day.\u201d",
      "Judge lined a 1-1 fastball from Merrill Kelly at 112.1 mph to the opposite field and into the Yankees bullpen for a 3-0 lead. He added a run-scoring single in the fourth inning as the Yankees moved ahead 7-3, hit a 111.3 mph double in the sixth. He also flied out and hit a 109.5 mph groundout.",

      "\u201cHe gives me a little smirk when I get on base like that,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cHe's starting to steal bags now. It's just getting ridiculous out of him, man,\u201d Chisholm said.",

      "New York had 22 homers on a 4-2 opening homestand, five more than any other team ever hit in its first six games. Even though it was game No. 6, the Yankees felt an urgency after losing the Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "\u201cBig G said a couple words before the game, just about this was our home turf. We got to go out there and we don\u2019t get swept at home,\" he said of Giancarlo Stanton. \"Guys took that to heart.\"",

Luke Weaver got four outs for his first save this season, ending Arizona\u2019s three-game winning streak.",
      "Judge repeatedly refers to last year's World Series loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. It weighs on him far more than historical accomplishments.",

      "Torpedo bats drew attention over the weekend when the New York Yankees hit a team-record nine homers in one game",
      "KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa. -- A 70-year-old man who plays in an area senior hardball league popped into Victus Sports this week because he needed bats for the new season. Plus he just had to take some cuts with baseball's latest fad and see for himself if there really was some wizardry in the wallop off a torpedo bat.",
      "Ed Costantini, of Newtown Square, picked up the custom-designed VOLPE11-TPD Pro Reserve Maple, and took his hacks just like MLB stars and Victus customers Anthony Volpe or Bryson Stott would inside the company's batting cage and tracked the ball\u2019s path on the virtual Citizens Bank Park on the computer screens.",
      "Most big leaguers use that often indistinguishable \u201cfeel\u201d as a qualifier as to how they select a bat.",
      "Costantini had a similar process and thought the hype surrounding the torpedo since it exploded into the baseball consciousness over the weekend was a \u201choax.\u201d But after dozens of swings in the cage, where he said the balance was better, the ball sounded more crisp off the bat, the left-handed hitter ordered on the spot four custom-crafted torpedo bats at $150 a pop.",
      "\u201cThe litmus test that I used was, I could see where the marks of the ball were,\u201d Costantini said. \u201cThe swings were hitting the thickness of the torpedo as opposed to the end of the bat.\u201d",
      "More than just All-Stars want a crack at the torpedo \u2014 a striking design in which wood is moved lower down the barrel after the label and shapes the end a little like a bowling pin \u2014 and Costantini\u2019s purchase highlighted the surge of interest in baseball\u2019s shiny new toy outside the majors.",
      "Think of home runs in baseball, and the fan\u2019s mind races to the mammoth distances a ball can fly when slugged right on the nose, or a history-making chase that captivates a nation.",
      "Of lesser interest, the ol\u2019 reliable wood bat itself.",
      "That was, of course, until Paul Goldschmidt and Cody Bellinger hit back-to-back homers for the New York Yankees last Saturday to open a nine-homer barrage. Victus Sports, known as much for their vibrant bats painted as pencils or the Phillie Phanatic dressed as a King\u2019s Guard, had three employees at the game and they started a text thread where they hinted to those back home that, perhaps more than home runs were taking off.",
      "Business was about to boom, too.",
      "Yankees crowed about the torpedo-shape concept that had baseball buzzing -- and pitchers grumbling. The scuttlebutt and headlines stoked their super curious peers, most with an eye out for any legal, offensive edge, into asking Victus and other bat manufacturers about the possibility of taking a swing with the most famous style of bat since Roy Hobbs grabbed a \u201cWonderboy.\u201d",
      "Victus spent most of the last 14 years trying to help shape the future of baseball. The company\u2019s founders just never imagined that shape would resemble a bowling pin.",
      "\u201cIt was the most talked about thing about bats that we ever experienced,\u201d Victus co-founder Jared Smith said.",
      "Victus isn't the only company producing the bulgy bats, but they were among the first to list them for sale online after the Yankees' made them the talk of the sports world. The torpedo bat took the league by storm in only 24 hours, and days later, the calls and orders, and test drives -- from big leaguers to rec leaguers -- are humming inside the company\u2019s base, in a northwest suburb of Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cThe amount of steam that it\u2019s caught, this quickly, that\u2019s certainly surprising,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf the Yankees hitting nine home runs in a game doesn\u2019t happen, this doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d",
      "Victus was stamped this season as the official bat of Major League Baseball and business was already good: Phillies slugger Bryce Harper is among the stars who stick their bats on highlight reels.",
      "But that torpedo-looking hunk of lumber? It generated about as much interest last season in baseball as a .200 hitter. Victus made its first torpedoes around 2024 spring training when the Yankees reached out about crafting samples for their players. Victus, as dialed-in as anyone in the bat game, only made about a dozen last season, and about a dozen more birch or maple bats this spring.",
      "This week alone, try hundreds of torpedoes.",
      "\u201cEvery two minutes, another one comes out of the machine,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Who knew there would be a baseball bat craze?",
      "On a good day, Victus makes 600-700 bats, but the influx of pro orders -- the company estimates at least half of every starting lineup uses Victus or Marucci bats -- has sent production into overdrive. The creation of a typical bat is usually a two-day process, but one can be turned around without a finish in about 20 minutes. Victus crafted rush-order bats Monday morning for a few interested Phillies and dashed to Citizens Bank Park for delivery moments before first pitch. All-Star third baseman Alec Bohm singled with one.",
      "Stott tested bats at the Marucci hit lab down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, churning through styles until the company found the right fit.",
      "\u201cThey connect all these wires to you, and you swing 1,000 bats,\u201d Stott said. \u201cAnd they kind of tell you where you\u2019re hitting the ball mostly.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s the surprising part of the torpedo bat: For all its early hype, the bat is no rookie in the game.",
      "The lethal lumber has been used by some sluggers in baseball for at least a year or two only, well, no one really noticed. Giancarlo Stanton and Francisco Lindor used torpedoes last season. Other players experimented with it and no one \u2014 not the bulk of other players or journalists or fans \u2014 ever really picked up on the newfangled advance in hitting innovation.",
      "Smith said only \u201ca few baseball junkies\u201d inquired about the bats.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s just one of those things that until you\u2019re looking for it, you might not see it,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNow when you look at pictures, you\u2019re like, oh yeah, it\u2019s a torpedo.\u201d",
      "Aaron Leanhardt, a former Yankees front-office staffer who now works for the Miami Marlins, was credited as the one who developed the torpedo barrel to bring more mass to a bat\u2019s sweet spot.",
      "A member of Victus\u2019 parent company, Marucci Sports, worked with Leanhardt in a Louisiana branch of their hit lab last year to get the bat off the ground and into the hands of big leaguers.",
      "\u201cI think getting past the shape being different was the hardest barrier,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThen the team goes out and hits those home runs like they did and everyone is willing to try it.\u201d",
      "Before last weekend, Victus had no plans to mass produce the bat, making it only available to professionals.",
      "Now, Smith said, \u201cI think it\u2019s our job to kind of educate the public in what\u2019s out there.\u201d",
      "The odd shape off the bat \u2014 like making a sausage, the meat is simply pushed down the casing \u2014 has little to no effect at Victus on the dynamics of making a baseball bat. The cost is the same as a standard bat, too, with a sticker price starting at around $200. Only the slogan is punched up: Get your hands on the most-talked about bat in the game.",
      "Victus was created by Smith and Ryan Engroff in a Blackwood, New Jersey, garage in 2012 and exploded in popularity over the last decade thanks in the large part to its bat art. Bruce Tatum, an in-house artist known as \u201cThe Bat King,\u201d calls his memorable designs such as the No. 2 pencil and crayon bats notably used in the Little League Classic \u201cswingable art.\u201d The Victus walls look straight out of an art gallery, only instead of classic paintings, rows and rows of colorful bats emblazoned with everything from Harper\u2019s face to Gritty\u2019s eyes are on display.",
      "\u201cNormally people are here to talk about the Bat King,\u201d Smith said, laughing.",
      "He was busy, sketching ideas for next year\u2019s bats for the baseball All-Star game in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cBruce\u2019s cheesesteak bat, I\u2019m just telling you, is going to be the talk of the town,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI guarantee it.\u201d",
      "Victus has over 300 employees and 60 alone inside their King of Prussia headquarters. The company has outgrown its base and is busting at the seams, and when a bat suddenly goes viral, \u201call our seams are exposed.\u201d",
      "The folks at Victus \u2014 who previously have experimented with axe handle and puck knobs \u2014 have no fear the bat will become the baseball equal to the NFL\u2019s tush push, a fresh wrinkle that some might try to legislate out of the game.",
      "MLB has relatively uncomplicated bat rules, stating under 3.02: \u201cThe bat shall be a smooth, round stick not more than 2.61 inches in diameter at the thickest part and not more than 42 inches in length. The bat shall be one piece of solid wood.\u201d It goes on to state there may be a cupped indentation up to 1 1/4 inches in depth, 2 inches wide and with at least a 1-inch diameter, and experimental models must be approved by MLB.",
      "The torpedo is 100% legal.",
      "Year after year, Victus' bat business has picked up. Jonny Gomes used a Victus bat when he went deep in the 2013 World Series and Harper stamped the company as a major player when he played for Washington and swung a \u201cWe The People\u201d bat and tossed it in the air to win the 2018 Home Run Derby.",
      "\u201cOur product kept getting better and it got to the point where he probably felt like we had the best bat, and we felt like we had the best bat,\u201d Smith said.",
      "There's not enough data yet to truly know how much oomph \u2014 or hits and homers \u2014 a torpedo bat may help some hitters. Cincinnati's Elly De La Cruz picked one up for the first time Monday and had a single, double and two home runs for a career-high seven RBIs.",
      "Not all hitters are believers \u2014- or at least feel like they need to tinker with their lumber.",
      "Yankees slugger Aaron Judge, who hit an AL-record 62 homers in 2022 and 58 last year en route to his second AL MVP award, declined to try the new bat, asking, \u201cWhy try to change something?\u201d Phillies All-Star shortstop Trea Turner said the hoopla was \u201cblown out of proportion.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve still got to hit the ball,\u201d Turner said.",
      "Turner, though, said he was open to trying the torpedo.",
      "Arizona pitcher Zac Gallen grew up a Mark McGwire fan and compared the fad to the bloated barrel used by the retired St. Louis Cardinals\u2019 slugger\u2019s old Nerf bat.",
      "\u201cThe concept seems so simple. For it to take this long is wild,\u201d Gallen said.",
      "No matter. The bat is here today and not going anywhere \u2014 except perhaps flying off the shelves.",
      "\u201cFor bats to be the hot topic out in the zeitgeist is cool,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like our time to shine, in a way.\u201d",

      "Freshly crowned overall World Cup skiing champion Federica Brignone has broken multiple bones in her left leg during a giant slalom crash at the Italian championships",
      "It was meant to be a celebratory final week of competition in the best season of her career.",
      "The celebrations ended abruptly for freshly crowned overall World Cup skiing champion Federica Brignone when she broke multiple bones in her left leg during a giant slalom crash at the Italian championships on Thursday \u2014 10 months before a home Olympics.",
      "Brignone was set to undergo surgery and will be out for \u201cmonths,\u201d Italian Winter Sports Federation medical chief Andrea Panzeri said.",
      "Brignone was the race leader at the Lusia ski area in Val di Fassa but in her second run she crashed through a gate and lost control, prompting her to tumble and crash through the next gate, too. She was flown by helicopter to a hospital in Trento.",
      "The Italian star was diagnosed with multiple fractures in her tibial plateau and fibula bone, the federation said. She was then transferred to a hospital in Milan where Panzeri was to operate on Brignone immediately.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a serious fracture. But she\u2019s strong and fortunately healthy as she had never had any big injuries before today,\u201d Panzeri said. \"It\u2019s tough to make estimates now. I\u2019ll tell you more afterward. Don\u2019t ask me about the Olympics or recovery times yet. We need to see how we can reduce the fracture and then we\u2019ll be able to be more precise later (today) or tomorrow morning.\u201d",
      "Brignone, who won the giant slalom at the world championships in February, also won 10 World Cup races across three different disciplines (five giant slaloms, three super-Gs and two downhills) this season. At 34, she became the oldest woman to win a World Cup race.",

      "\u201cIf I didn\u2019t get a good pitch to hit, I was willing to walk,\u201d Ohtani said through a translator. \u201cComing into the inning, tied in that last at-bat, it just felt like we really had a good shot to win.\u201d",
      "At 8-0, the Dodgers are off to the best start ever by a defending World Series champion. They've trailed in six of those games, but they already have two walk-off wins. And Ohtani has scored in every game.",

      "Dodgers starter Blake Snell said: \u201cWhen he was coming up and it\u2019s his bobblehead night \u2014 everyone knew. We knew. It\u2019s just what he does.\u201d",
      "Thousands lined up hours before first pitch to secure the first of four Ohtani bobbleheads this season. As like last year, traffic snarled around the stadium with helicopters showing the chaos on local television.",
      "\u201cJust grateful as a player to just be able to perform and have an opportunity like this,\u201d said Ohtani, who finished 3 for 5. \u201cI think the credit really goes to Max Muncy to be able to pull through and tie the game.\u201d",

      "The Dodgers rallied from a 5-0 deficit after Muncy's two early errors at third base led to five unearned runs by the Braves against Snell, a two-time Cy Young Award winner making his second start for his new team.",
      "\u201cI was dumbfounded with the way we were playing. I didn\u2019t recognize that club in the first couple of innings,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWe had no business winning that game, but to our guys\u2019 credit we just kept fighting.\u201d",
      "The bullpen picked up Snell, allowing just three hits over the final five innings. Rookie reliever Jack Dreyer earned his first major league win with two hitless innings.",
      "\u201cWe all believe,\u201d Snell said. \u201cWe got each other\u2019s backs, and it\u2019s a good feeling to have.\u201d",

      "Even as he grows older, Microsoft founder Bill Gates still fondly remembers the catalytic computer code he wrote 50 years ago that opened up a new frontier in technology.",
      "Although the code that Gates printed out on a teletype machine may look crude compared to what's powering today's artificial intelligence platforms, it played a critical role in creating Microsoft in April 1975 \u2014 a golden anniversary that the Redmond, Washington, company will celebrate on Friday.",
      "Gates, 69, set the stage for that jubilee with a blog post reminiscing on how he and his old high school friend \u2014 the late Paul Allen \u2014 scrambled to create the world's first \u201csoftware factory\u201d after reading an article in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics magazine about the Altair 8800, a minicomputer that would be powered by a tiny chip made by the then-obscure technology company, Intel.",
      "The article inspired Gates, who was just a freshman at Harvard University, and Allen to call Altair's maker, Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, and promise the company's CEO Ed Roberts they had developed software that would enable consumers to control the hardware. There was just one hitch: Gates and Allen hadn't yet come up with the code they promised Roberts.",
      "Gates and Allen tackled the challenge by latching onto the BASIC computer language that had been developed in 1964 at Dartmouth College, but they still had to figure out a way to make the technology compatible with the forthcoming Altair computer, even though they didn't even have a prototype of the machine.",
      "After spending two months working on the program with little sleep, Gates finished the code that became the basis for the Altair's first operating system. \u201cThat code remains the coolest I\u2019ve ever written,\u201d Gates wrote in his blog post, which includes an option to download the original program.",
      "The code would go on to provide the foundation for a business that would make personal computers a household staple, with a suite of software that include the Word, Excel and PowerPoint programs, as well as the Windows operating system that still powers most PCs today.",
      "\u201cThat was the revolution,\u201d Gates said of the code in a video accompanying his post. \u201cThat was the thing that ushered in personal computing.\u201d",
      "Gates' recollection of the code is part of a nostalgic kick that he has been on this year as he prepares to turn 70 in October.",
      "The trip down memory lane included the February release of a memoir exploring his early years as an often-misunderstood child with few friends, and a hailing of the 25th anniversary of the philanthropic foundation he created after stepping down as Microsoft's CEO in 2000. The tech giant initially stumbled after Gates' departure but has been thriving under CEO Satya Nadella, and has amassed a market value of about $2.8 trillion.",
      "In his memoir, Gates also reflected on his tempestuous relationship with fellow PC pioneer, the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, whose company will be celebrating its golden anniversary next year.",
      "\u201cFifty years is a long time,\u201d said Gates, whose personal fortune is estimated at $108 billion. \u201cIt's crazy that the dream came true.\u201d",

      "Discovered late last year, the asteroid 2024 YR4 was predicted at one point to have a 3% chance of smacking Earth in 2032. Additional observations prompted scientists to reduce the threat to virtually zero, where it remains. But there's a slight chance it could hit the moon then. The asteroid swings our way every four years.",
      "NASA and the European Space Agency released the photos \u2014 showing the asteroid as a fuzzy dot \u2014 on Wednesday. Webb confirm the asteroid is nearly 200 feet (60 meters) across, or about the height of a 15-story building, according to the two space agencies. It\u2019s the smallest object ever observed by the observatory, the biggest and most powerful ever sent into space.",
      "Johns Hopkins University astronomer Andrew Rivkin said the observations by Webb served as \u201cinvaluable\u201d practice for other asteroids that may threaten us down the road. Ground telescopes also have tracked this particular space rock over the past few months.",
      "All this \u201cgives us a window to understand what other objects the size of 2024 YR4 are like, including the next one that might be heading our way,\u201d Rivkin, who helped with the observations, said in a statement.",

      "VIENNA -- As construction crews churned up dirt to renovate a Vienna soccer field last October, they happened upon an unprecedented find: A heap of intertwined skeletal remains in a mass grave dating to the 1st-century Roman Empire, likely the bodies of warriors in a battle involving Germanic tribes.",
      "On Wednesday, after archaeological analysis, experts at the Vienna Museum gave a first public presentation of the grave \u2014 linked to \u201ca catastrophic event in a military context\" and evidence of the first known fighting ever in that region.",
      "The bodies of 129 people have been confirmed at the site in the Vienna neighborhood of Simmering. The excavation teams also found many dislocated bones and believe the total number of victims tops 150 \u2014 a discovery never seen before in Central Europe.",
      "\u201cWithin the context of Roman acts of war, there are no comparable finds of fighters,\" said Michaela Binder, who led the archaeological dig. \"There are huge battlefields in Germany where weapons were found. But finding the dead, that is unique for the entire Roman history.\u201d",
      "Soldiers in the Roman Empire were typically cremated until the 3rd century.",
      "The pit where the bodies were deposited suggests a hasty or disorganized dumping of corpses. Every skeleton examined showed signs of injury \u2014 to the head, torso and pelvis in particular.",
      "\u201cThey have various different battle wounds, which rules out execution. It is truly a battlefield,\" said Kristina Adler-W\u00f6lfl, head of Vienna city archaeological department. \u201cThere are wounds from swords, lances; wounds from blunt trauma.\u201d",
      "The victims were all male. Most were aged 20 to 30 years old and generally showed signs of good dental health.",
      "Carbon-14 analysis helped date the bones to between 80 and 130 A.D. That was cross-checked against known history of relics found in the grave \u2013 armor, helmet cheek protectors, the nails used in distinctive Roman military shoes known as caligae.",
      "The most indicative clue came from a rusty dagger of a type in use specifically between the middle of the 1st century and the start of the second.",
      "The research continues: Only one victim has been confirmed as a Roman warrior. Archaeologists hope DNA and strontium isotope analysis will help further identify the fighters, and whose side they were on.",
      "\u201cThe most likely theory at the moment is that this is connected to the Danube campaigns of Emperor Domitian \u2014 that\u2019s 86 to 96 A.D.,\" Adler-W\u00f6lfl said.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The owners of what was once Pennsylvania's biggest coal-fired power plant said Wednesday that they will turn it into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus designed to capitalize on the fast-growing energy demands of Big Tech companies to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing applications.",
      "The former Homer City Generating Station, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Pittsburgh, will host seven gas-fired turbines to power data centers on site with up to 4.5 gigawatts of electricity, according to the owners, an investor group named Homer City Development.",
      "That amount of electricity is enough to power about 3 million homes.",
      "Construction is expected to begin this year and power could start flowing by 2027, the group said in a statement. The cost to prepare the site and build the data centers could exceed the initial $10 billion investment by billions more, the group said.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders have spurred more than 130 lawsuits, but one related to TikTok barely generates a peep",
      "WASHINGTON -- After TikTok was banned in the United States earlier this year, President Donald Trump gave the platform a reprieve, barreling past a law that was passed in Congress and upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court that said the ban was necessary for national security.",
      "The Republican president's executive orders have spurred more than 130 lawsuits in the little more than two months he has been in office, but this one barely generated a peep. None of those suits challenges his temporary block of the 2024 law that banned the popular social video app after the deadline passed for it to be sold by ByteDance, its China-based parent company.",
      "Few of the 431 members of the House of Representatives and the Senate who voted for the law have complained.",
      "Despite a bipartisan consensus about the risk to national security posed by TikTok\u2019s ties to China, \"it\u2019s as if nothing ever happened,\u201d said Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "TikTok continues to function, much to the delight of its 170 million users in the U.S., and the tech giants Apple, Google and Oracle have been persuaded to continue to offer and support the app, on the promise that Trump\u2019s Justice Department would not use the law to seek potentially steep fines against them.",
      "Trump declared he was suspending the law for 75 days, though no provision of the rule would appear to allow for that, to give ByteDance a fresh chance to find a U.S. buyer. The president has suggested he could extend the pause, but he has since said he expects a deal by Saturday, when the reprieve expires. He is meeting Wednesday with aides about possible suitors for TikTok. Oracle and the investment firm Blackstone are among the potential investors.",
      "Trump's action followed a fast-tracked free-speech challenge by TikTok and its users that ended with a unanimous Supreme Court ruling days before Trump's inauguration, in which the justices held that national security concerns overcame their usual receptivity to First Amendment claims.",
      "The court's opinions dealt at length with the potential for China to harvest vast quantities of TikTok users' data that could allow it to track the locations of federal employees and contractors.",
      "\u201cThe record before us establishes that TikTok mines data both from TikTok users and about millions of others who do not consent to share their information,\u201d Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a brief separate opinion. \u201cAccording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, TikTok can access \u2018any data\u2019 stored in a consenting user\u2019s \u2018contact list\u2019 \u2014 including names, photos, and other personal information about unconsenting third parties.\u201d",
      "TikTok, which has headquarters in Singapore and Los Angeles, has said it prioritizes user safety, and China's Foreign Ministry has said China\u2019s government has never and will not ask companies to \u201ccollect or provide data, information or intelligence\u201d held in foreign countries.",
      "The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users, but it came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "The president's position has evolved over time. During his first term, he used an executive order to try to ban TikTok on national security grounds. But federal courts blocked it. His administration then tried to negotiate a sale of the platform, but it failed.",
      "Trump changed his tune during his 2024 campaign and said he would \u201csave TikTok,\u201d then credited the platform with helping him win more young voters. He issued the 75-day pause on the first day of his second term.",
      "The law allows for one 90-day reprieve, but only if there's a deal on the table and a formal notification to Congress.",
      "Trump's actions so far violate the law, said Alan Rozenshtein, an associate law professor at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThe law does not permit the sort of \u2018extension\u2019 that Donald Trump has announced,\" Rozenshtein said.",
      "But both he and Kreps acknowledged a court challenge or other pushback is unlikely.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s the constituency? You have 170 million Americans using the app, and they\u2019re pretty happy to see this continue to be available to them,\u201d Kreps said.",
      "It also might be hard for someone to establish the legal right, or standing, to sue, Rozenshtein said. A plaintiff would have to be able to show harm from the delay in enforcing the law, he said.",
      "More importantly, he said, the TikTok executive order was an early \"example of the Trump administration not caring about the rule of law.\u201d",
      "While Trump has directed the Justice Department not to seek fines from the tech companies, they still are taking a legal gamble, according to Democratic lawmakers who oppose the TikTok ban but also criticize Trump for his actions. A future administration might have its own reasons to pursue legal claims against Apple, Google and Oracle, they wrote Trump in a letter last week.",
      "Companies could face hundreds of billions of dollars in legal liability for facilitating TikTok's operations since the law's effective date of Jan. 19, Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Ed Markey of Massachusetts wrote.",
      "The companies themselves acknowledged their legally uncertain situation in their initial response to Trump's order. Oracle continued to provide cloud services to TikTok, the senators said, but \u201cApple and Google, however, initially came to a different decision and refused to reinstate TikTok in their app stores.\"",
      "The companies changed course only after receiving written assurance from the Justice Department.",
      "The Democrats have called for amending the law to extend the deadline for a sale to October. Other opponents of the TikTok ban support a full repeal.",
      "Among the few supporters of the ban to speak out is Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "But rather than take on Trump, Moolenaar has focused his criticism on ByteDance and its ties the Chinese Communist Party. \u201cIf ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal \u2014 plain and simple,\u201d Moolenaar said in remarks to a TikTok event on Capitol Hill last week.",
      "Several potential bidders have stepped forward.",
      "Perplexity AI presented ByteDance in January with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "Another possibility is a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic adviser. Investors in the consortium previously said they offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. They had planned to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they said would provide users with more control over their online data.",

      "The utility announced that its board picked Moul as president and chief executive to replace Jeff Lyash, who said in January that he would retire no later than September. The move comes less than a week after Trump removed one of the utility's board members without indicating why. With the firing of Michelle Moore, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, the board currently has five members and four vacancies.",
      "The board firing and CEO hiring come after Tennessee's two Republican U.S. senators urged officials to opt for \u201can interim CEO trusted by the president\u201d before hiring someone long-term.",
      "Moul has served as TVA's executive vice president and chief operating officer since June 2021. In a news release announcing his selection, TVA focused in part on Moul's leadership in the advancement of nuclear energy technologies and his experience as a licensed senior reactor operator. He starts in the new role on April 9.",
      "\u201cTVA needs a steady hand right now,\" Moul said in the news release. \"I will build on the momentum that Jeff and our team have created -\u2013 making sure we continue to invest in new generation, strengthen our grid and enhance system reliability.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty wrote a guest column arguing that the TVA board was bogging down a project that seeks to build a small modular reactor with studies and hurdles.",
      "Blackburn and Hagerty also said that hiring a CEO from within would forgo the chance to recruit a \u201ctop-quality leader\u201d from outside the utility, which provides power to 10 million people across seven Southern states.",
      "In part, advocates for nuclear energy have called for its expansion to help meet the demand from companies to power their artificial intelligence technologies, and do so without carbon emissions that speed up climate change.",
      "Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, called the op-ed by Blackburn and Hagerty \u201creckless interference.\u201d He said they don't understand the \u201crisk of rushing nuclear technology before it\u2019s ready for prime time both economically and safety-wise.\u201d",
      "Clean energy advocates have also criticized TVA's decision to replace several of its aging coal plants with another fossil fuel, natural gas.",
      "Trump put TVA and the outgoing CEO Lyash on the hot seat in his first term.",
      "In 2020, Trump fired the former TVA board chairman and another board member and drove TVA to reverse course on the hiring of foreign labor for information technology jobs.",
      "He also called for Lyash\u2019s replacement and the position\u2019s pay to be capped at $500,000.",
      "In response, TVA has noted that the CEO pay ranks in the bottom quartile of the power industry. Lyash\u2019s total compensation topped $10.5 million in the 2024 budget year, including various pension and performance incentives worth millions of dollars. Additionally, the utility has stressed that it doesn\u2019t receive federal taxpayer money and instead is funded by electricity customers.",

      "Rescue teams in Myanmar and Thailand are searching for survivors after Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake that toppled buildings and damaged roads. The disaster has killed more than 2,000 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in Thailand, mainly at a Bangkok office tower construction site.",
      "Most rescues happen in the 24 hours after a disaster. The chances of survival drop with each day after that, experts say. Most victims are badly injured or buried by falling stones or other debris.",
      "Trapped victims are more likely to survive if they are in a debris-free pocket that prevents major injury while they await rescue, like under a sturdy desk, said geophysicist Victor Tsai from Brown University in an email. Experts call this a survivable void space.",
      "If fire, smoke or hazardous chemicals were released as a result of the building collapse, they may decrease a person's survival odds, said emergency response expert Dr. Joseph Barbera, an associate professor at George Washington University.",
      "Beyond that, having air to breathe and water to drink are crucial as the days go on.",
      "\u201cYou could survive a while without food,\u201d Barbera said. \u201cYou could survive less without water.\u201d",
      "Temperatures where someone is trapped may affect survival, and temperatures outside the rubble can affect rescue missions.",
      "Power outages and spotty communications have slowed relief operations in Myanmar, where many are searching for survivors by hand in daily temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). A lack of heavy machinery has slowed search-and-rescue efforts.",
      "It can be important for survivors to receive vital medical care before they are removed from the rubble, Barbera said. If not, the buildup of toxins from crushed muscles could make them go into shock after they are rescued.",
      "After the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, a teenager and his 80-year-old grandmother were found alive after nine days trapped in their flattened home. And the year before, a 16-year-old Haitian girl was rescued from earthquake rubble in Port-Au-Prince after 15 days.",
      "The best practices for survival during an earthquake depend on where you are in the world. Building codes in regions with active fault lines are often designed to withstand earthquakes, but that doesn't hold true everywhere.",
      "In many countries, including the United States, the best practices are to drop, seek cover and hang on unless you are close to a building exit. Seek shelter under a heavy table or near sturdy furniture that may yield a survivable pocket if the roof collapses. Cover your face with cloth or a mask to protect from dust and debris.",
      "If you are trapped in the rubble after and earthquake, save your energy and don't overexert. Ration food and water, listen for rescue calls and search for something near you to make noise. If you have a phone with you, conserve its battery and try for help in short spurts each day.",

By then it was already about 11 p.m. Friday at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington. A group of Microsoft workers was ready and waiting for the data.",
      "The AI for Good lab has done this kind of AI-assisted damage assessment before, tracking the flooding that devastated Libya in 2023 or this year's wildfires in Los Angeles. But rather than rely on a standard AI computer vision model that could run any visual data, they had to build a customized version specific to Mandalay.",
      "\u201cThe Earth is too different, the natural disasters are too different and the imagery we get from satellites is just too different to work in every situation,\u201d Lavista Ferres said. For instance, he said, while fires spread in fairly predictable ways, \u201can earthquake touches the whole city\u201d and it can be harder to know in the immediate aftermath where help is needed.",
      "Once the AI analysis was complete, it showed 515 buildings in Mandalay with 80% to 100% damage and another 1,524 with between 20% and 80% damage. That showed the widespread gravity of the disaster, but, just as important, it helps pinpoint specific locations of damage.",
      "\u201cThis is critical information for teams on the ground,\u201d Lavista Ferres said.",

      "Dubbed the wooly devil, the flower with furry leaves, purplish-striped petals and pops of yellow is a new genus and species in the same family as sunflowers and daisies: Asteraceae. It was discovered last year in Big Bend National Park, known for its rugged terrain of desert, canyons and mountains, on the border with Mexico.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn with this species so they\u2019re really just getting started,\u201d said Carolyn Whiting, a Big Bend botanist.",
      "Scientists are hopeful the flowers will bloom again after rain fell on the drought-stricken park last week, giving them the opportunity to learn more including when the plants germinate, Whiting said.",
      "The flower was discovered in March 2024. Park volunteer Deb Manley and a park ranger were hiking in a remote area when they saw a patch of flowers that were smaller than a quarter and close to the ground.",
      "\u201cWe stopped and took some photos and neither one of us had any idea,\u201d Manley said. \u201cI could get it to family but I couldn\u2019t figure out any more than that. So we took photos and moved on, not realizing we had found a new genus.\u201d",

Her post about the flower on iNaturalist, an online platform for nature enthusiasts \u201ccaused a stir,\u201d said Isaac Lichter Marck, a researcher at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.",
      "A. Michael Powell, curator and director of the herbarium at Sul Russ State University in Alpine, said when Manley contacted him about the flower, he immediately thought it was something new.",

      "The discovery of the flower was announced last month.",
      "Lichter Marck said they were able to extract DNA from the flower but that there's still a lot to learn. He said they don\u2019t know yet how it reproduces, or what potential uses it might have. They also need to determine if it\u2019s endangered.",
      "The wooly devil's official name \u2014 Ovicula biradiata \u2014 takes inspiration from its appearance: Ovicula, which means tiny sheep, is a nod to the hairs that cover its leaves; while biradiata, or bi-radial, refers to its two striped petals.",
      "Kelsey Wogan, environmental lab manager at Sul Ross State University, said she\u2019s excited to see if the wooly devil can be found in other places as well and what its range is.",

      "BANGKOK -- Chinese telecoms gear giant Huawei said Monday its net profit fell 28% in 2024 while its revenue surged, as the company invested heavily in advanced technologies.",
      "Huawei Technologies reported 62.6 billion yuan ($8.6 billion) in net profit last year, down from 87 billion yuan the year before. Its revenue jumped 22% to $118.2 billion, with the strongest growth in its consumer goods and automotive-related sales.",
      "The company, based in the southern city of Shenzhen, said the decline in profit was mainly due to two factors, \u201cWe continued to increase our future-oriented investment and there were no gains from the sale of businesses.\u201d",
      "One of China's first global tech brands, Huawei said its spending on research and development amounted to more than a fifth of its revenues, and more than half its workforce, or 113,000 people, are employed in R&D.",
      "Spending on R&D was 179.7 billion yuan (nearly $25 billion).",
      "Constrained by mounting trade tensions, Huawei and other Chinese tech companies are working hard to make up for shrinking access to U.S. and other foreign advanced technology.",
      "Citing national security concerns, the U.S. has banned American companies from doing business with Huawei, cutting off its access to advanced computer chips and software such as Google services for its smartphones. It is not allowed to sell its telecommunications gear to U.S. customers.",
      "The U.S. has also pushed its European allies including Britain and Sweden to ban or restrict Huawei equipment in their phone networks over fears Beijing could use it for cybersnooping or sabotaging critical communications infrastructure \u2014 allegations Huawei has denied repeatedly. Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada have taken similar actions.",
      "Huawei denies that it poses any threat to its customers' national security.",
      "Its consumer unit, which sells smartphones and other devices, reported a 38.3% jump in revenue last year. Automotive services-related sales more than quadrupled. Revenues from Huawei's cloud computing business climbed 8.5% and its digital power unit logged a 24.4% increase in sales.",

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s antitrust watchdog fined Apple 150 million euros ($162 million) on Monday over a privacy feature protecting users from apps snooping on them because its introduction resulted in abuse of competition law.",
      "The French Competition Authority said the aim of Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) requiring iPhone and iPad apps to ask users for permission before tracking them was not in itself open to criticism.",
      "But it ruled that the \u201cway in which it was implemented was neither necessary nor proportionate to Apple\u2019s stated objective of protecting personal data.\u201d",
      "Apple rolled out ATT starting in April 2021 as part of an update to the operating system powering the iPhone and iPad. The feature forces apps to obtain permission before collecting data to target users with personalized ads. While the feature was designed to tighten up privacy, it faced criticism from Big Tech rivals that it would make it harder for smaller apps to survive without charging consumers.",
      "The fine, punishing Apple for abuse of its dominant position in mobile app distribution, covers the period from April 2021 to July 2023. But the amount is a pittance for the iPhone maker, which earned $124 billion in revenue in the final three months of last year.",
      "The watchdog said the feature's rollout resulted in users being barraged by pop-ups from third-party apps requesting their consent. It bemoaned how the proliferation of these consent windows made it \"excessively complex\" for app users to navigate the iOS environment.",
      "It also questioned the system\u2019s neutrality, saying it penalized the smallest publishers, which depend to a large extent on the collection of third-party data to finance their activity.",
      "Apple said in a statement that ATT gives users more privacy control \u201cthrough a required, clear, and easy-to-understand prompt about one thing: tracking.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat prompt is consistent for all developers, including Apple, and we have received strong support for this feature from consumers, privacy advocates, and data protection authorities around the world,\u201d the company said. \"While we are disappointed with today\u2019s decision, the French Competition Authority (FCA) has not required any specific changes to ATT.\u201d",

      "There is plenty of nostalgia at Black Mountain, New Hampshire's oldest ski area",
      "Jackson, N.H. -- A skier since age 4, Thomas Brennick now enjoys regular trips to New Hampshire\u2019s Black Mountain with his two grandchildren.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s back to the old days,\u201d he said from the Summit Double chairlift on a recent sunny Friday. \u201cIt's just good, old-time skiing at its best.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the experience is now propelled by a high-tech system designed to increase efficiency at the state\u2019s oldest ski area. And while small, independent resorts can\u2019t compete on infrastructure or buying power with conglomerates like Vail, which owns nearby Attitash Mountain Resort and seven others in the Northeast alone, at least one entrepreneur is betting technology will be \u201ca really great equalizer.\u201d",
      "That businessman is Erik Mogensen, who bought Black Mountain last year and turned it into a lab for his ski mountain consultancy, Entabeni Systems. The company builds systems that put lift tickets sales, lesson reservations and equipment rentals online while collecting detailed data to inform decisions such as where to make more snow and how much.",
      "\u201cA lot of general managers will go out and look at how many rows of cars are parked, and that\u2019s kind of how they tell how busy they are,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe really want to look at that transactional data down to the deepest level.\u201d",
      "That includes analyzing everything from the most popular time to sell hot dogs in the lodge to how many runs a season pass holder makes per visit.",
      "\u201cThe large operators, they can do a lot of things at scale that we can\u2019t. They can buy 20 snow cats at a time, 10 chairlifts, those types of things. We can\u2019t do that, but we\u2019re really nimble,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe can decide to change the way we groom very quickly, or change the way we open trails, or change our (food and beverage) menu in the middle of a day.\u201d",
      "Mogensen, who says his happiest moments are tied to skiing, started Entabeni Systems in 2015, driven by the desire to keep the sport accessible. In 2023, he bought the company Indy Pass, which allows buyers to ski for two days each at 230 independent ski areas, including Black Mountain. It's an alternative to the Epic and Ikon multi-resort passes offered by the Vail and Alterra conglomerates.",
      "Black Mountain was an early participant in Indy Pass. When Mogensen learned it was in danger of closing, he was reminded of his hometown's long-gone ski area. He bought Black Mountain aiming to ultimately transform it into a cooperative.",
      "Many Indy Pass resorts also are clients of Entabeni Systems, including Utah's Beaver Mountain, which bills itself as the longest continuously-run family owned mountain resort in the U.S.",
      "Kristy Seeholzer, whose husband\u2019s grandfather founded Beaver Mountain, said Entabeni streamlined its ticketing and season pass system. That led to new, lower-priced passes for those willing to forgo skiing during holiday weeks or weekends, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of our season pass holders were self-limiting anyway. They only want to ski weekdays because they don\u2019t want to deal with weekends,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could never have kept track of that manually.\"",
      "Though she is pleased overall, Seeholzer said the software can be challenging and slow.",
      "\u201cThere are some really great programs out there, like on the retail side of things or the sales side of things. And one of the things that was a little frustrating was it felt like we were reinventing the wheel,\u201d she said.",
      "Sam Shirley, 25, grew up skiing in New Hampshire and worked as a ski instructor and ski school director in Maine while attending college. But he said increasing technology has drastically changed the way he skis, pushing him to switch mostly to cross-country.",
      "\u201cAs a customer, it\u2019s made things more complicated,\u201d he said. \"It just becomes an extra hassle.\u201d",
      "Shirley used to enjoy spur-of-the-moment trips around New England, but has been put off by ski areas reserving lower rates for those who buy tickets ahead. He doesn\u2019t like having to provide detailed contact information, sometimes even a photograph, just to get a lift ticket.",
      "It's not just independent ski areas that are focused on technology and data. Many others are using lift tickets and passes embedded with radio frequency identification chips that track skiers' movements.",
      "Vail resorts pings cell phones to better understand how lift lines are forming, which informs staffing decisions, said John Plack, director of communications. Lift wait times have decreased each year for the past three years, with 97% under 10 minutes this year, he said.",
      "\u201cOur company is a wildly data-driven company. We know a lot about our guest set. We know their tastes. We know what they like to ski, we know when they like to ski. And we\u2019re able to use that data to really improve the guest experience,\u201d he said.",
      "That improvement comes at a cost. A one-day lift ticket at Vail's Keystone Resort in Colorado sold for $292 last week. A season pass cost $418, a potentially good deal for diehard skiers, but also a reliable revenue stream guaranteeing Vail a certain amount of income even as ski areas face less snow and shorter winters.",
      "The revenue from such passes, especially the multi-resort Epic Pass, allowed the company to invest $100 million in snowmaking, Plack said.",
      "\u201cBy committing to the season ahead of time, that gives us certainty and allows us to reinvest in our resorts,\" he said.",
      "Mogensen insists bigger isn\u2019t always better, however. Lift tickets at Black Mountain cost $59 to $99 per day and a season's pass is about $450.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t just come skiing to turn left and right. You come skiing because of the way the hot chocolate tastes and the way the fire pit smells and what spring skiing is and what the beer tastes like and who you\u2019re around,\u201d he said. \u201cSkiing doesn\u2019t have to be a luxury good. It can be a community center.\u201d",
      "Brennick, the Black Mountain lift rider who was skiing with his grandchildren, said he has noticed a difference since the ski area was sold.",
      "\u201cI can see the change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're making a lot of snow and it shows.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Marks was offered the choice of resigning or being fired by Kennedy, according to a former FDA official familiar with the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he didn\u2019t have permission to discuss the matter publicly.",
      "Kennedy has a long history of spreading anti-vaccine misinformation, although during his Senate confirmation hearings he seemed to say he would not undermine vaccines. He promised the chair of the Senate health committee that he would not change existing vaccine recommendations.",
      "Since becoming commissioner, Kennedy has vowed to scrutinize the safety of childhood vaccinations, despite decades of evidence they are safe and have saved millions of lives.",
      "Marks oversaw the agency\u2019s rapid review and approval of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments during the pandemic.",
      "Marks is credited with coining the name and concept for \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d the effort under President Donald Trump to rapidly manufacture vaccines while they were still being tested for safety and efficacy. The initiative cut years off the normal development process.",
      "Despite the project\u2019s success, Trump repeatedly lashed out at the FDA for not approving the first COVID shots even sooner. Trump told confidants after his 2020 loss that he would have been re-elected if the vaccine had been available before Election Day.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, criticized what he called the \u201cfiring\u201d of Marks.",
      "\u201cRFK Jr.\u2019s firing of Peter Marks because he wouldn\u2019t bend a knee to his misinformation campaign now allows the fox to guard the hen house,\" Offit said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for America\u2019s children.\u201d",
      "Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said the issues raised in Marks' resignation letter \u201cshould be frightening to anyone committed to the importance of evidence to guide policies and patient decisions.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hope this will intensify the communication across academia, industry and government to bolster the importance of science and evidence,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The resignation follows news Friday that HHS plans to lay off 10,000 workers and shut down entire agencies, including ones that oversee billions of dollars in funds for addiction services and community health centers across the country.",
      "In a post on social media Thursday, Kennedy criticized the department he oversees as an inefficient \u201csprawling bureaucracy.\" He also faulted the department\u2019s 82,000 workers for a decline in Americans\u2019 health.",
      "The resignation is the latest blow to the beleaguered health agency, which has been rocked for weeks by layoffs, retirements and a chaotic return-to-office process that left many staffers without permanent offices, desks or other supplies. Last month, Jim Jones, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods, resigned, citing \u201cthe indiscriminate firing\u201d of nearly 90 staffers in his division, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by the AP.",
      "Marks, who could not be reached for comment, also raised concerns in his letter about \u201cefforts currently being advanced by some on the adverse health effects of vaccination are concerning\u201d as well as the \u201cunprecedented assault on scientific truth that has adversely impacted public health in our nation.\u201d",

      "Policy changes implemented by the White House have contributed to a \"highly uncertain outlook,\" Powell said, making the remarks as stocks plummeted amid an escalating global trade war.",
      "Despite the murky outlook, Powell said Trump's tariffs would likely increase consumer prices.",

      "\"This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "Trump also claimed without evidence that political considerations have played a role in Powell's decision-making on interest-rate policy.",
      "On Friday, Powell declined to directly respond to Trump. Still, Powell strongly rebuked any concern about his political independence.",
      "\"I don't respond to political remarks,\" Powell said, adding that it would be inappropriate for the central bank to comment on U.S. trade policy.",

      "The director of the National Security Agency, Gen. Timothy Haugh, was among the numerous officials far-right activist Laura Loomer urged President Donald Trump to remove during her official Oval Office meeting earlier this week, citing evidence of disloyalties, multiple sources tell ABC News.",
      "In her Oval Office meeting, Loomer presented the president with printed files of research she compiled on various government officials -- not only from the NSA and National Security Council, but also from other federal agencies, including the State Department, sources said. She urged the president to take action against those she claimed were disloyal or were appointed during former President Joe Biden's administration, the sources added.",
      "Haugh, who is the director of the NSA and also heads U.S. Cyber Command, and his civilian deputy Wendy Noble, were both removed from their positions, according to a U.S. official. Their firings came after Loomer's meeting with the president on Wednesday.",
      "Loomer appeared to confirm her involvement in a post on X, writing, \"NSA Director Tim Haugh and his deputy Wendy Noble have been disloyal to President Trump. That is why they have been fired ... Thank you President Trump for being receptive to the vetting materials provided to you and thank you for firing these Biden holdovers.\"",
      "Trump on Thursday acknowledged that Loomer has made recommendations to him and that he sometimes listens, but claimed that she was not involved in the NSC firings following their meeting on Wednesday.",
      "\"So Laura Loomer is a very good patriot. She is a very strong person, and I saw her yesterday for a little while. She makes recommendations of things and people, and sometimes I listen to those recommendations, like I do with everybody. I listen to everybody, and then I make a decision,\" Trump said.",
      "In a separate post Thursday night, Loomer said she reported names of \"disloyal people\" in the NSC to Trump. On Friday, she wrote on X that she planned to release \"more names of individuals who should not be in the Trump administration due to their questionable loyalty & past attacks on President Trump.\"",
      "Asked about these recent X posts from Loomer, the White House referred ABC News to Trump's previous comments about her making recommendations.",
      "Loomer's involvement comes after weeks of both public and private pressure, sources said, as she raised concerns about the administration's vetting process and the inclusion of officials she perceives as disloyal to the president.",
      "Loomer has frequently spread misinformation. In July, she claimed in a social media post, without citing evidence, that President Joe Biden had a medical emergency after landing at Joint Base Andrews.",
      "She had also started unsubstantiated claims about family members of Judge Juan Merchan in Trump's New York hush money case, including that his daughter posted a fake photo of Trump in jail on social media, which the court has denied. It prompted Trump to share Loomer's posts and spread the rumors.",
      "Loomer accompanied Trump to several campaign events last fall -- a move that prompted criticism from some Republicans at the time.",

    "summary": "Researchers who had millions of dollars' worth of grants terminated by the National Institutes of Health are suing the federal government.",
    "story": [
      "At least 900 grants have been terminated, according to one NIH source.",
      "Researchers who had millions of dollars' worth of grants terminated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are suing the federal government in the hopes of stopping any further research cancellations.",
      "The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday evening against the NIH and its director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, as well as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.",
      "Among the plaintiffs are Dr. Brittany Charlton, an associate professor in the department of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who said all of her grants were terminated because they allegedly \"no longer [effectuate] agency priorities,\" according to termination letters.",
      "\"Why am I standing up? I am a scientist, and therefore not a lawyer, but I appreciate that contract law is complex, and yet NIH's contract cancellations set off my alarm bell,\" she told ABC News in a statement.",
      "Co-plaintiffs include the American Public Health Association; Ibis Reproductive Health; and United Auto Workers as well as three other researchers.",
      "Both the NIH and the HHS told ABC News that they don't comment on ongoing litigation.",
      "Over the past several weeks, active research grants related to studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) have been canceled at the NIH because they allegedly do not serve the \"priorities\" of President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "As of late March, more than 900 grants have been terminated, an NIH official with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named, told ABC News.",
      "The terminations come after Trump passed a flurry of executive orders including vowing to \"defend women from gender ideology extremism,\" which has led to new guidance, like that from HHS, which now only recognizes two sexes.",
      "The administration has also issued several executive orders aiming to dismantle DEI initiatives.",
      "In previous termination letters, viewed by ABC News, they state that, \"Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans. Many such studies ignore, rather than seriously examine, biological realities. It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize these research programs.\"",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the grant terminations are a \"reckless and illegal purge to stamp out NIH-funded research that addresses topics and populations that they disfavor.\"",
      "Charlton said she was alarmed by Project 2025 -- a nearly 1,000-page document of policy proposals unveiled by the Heritage Foundation during the 2024 campaign intended to guide the next conservative administration -- which allegedly attacked fields like hers, centering on LGBTQ+ health research, as \"junk gender science,\" she said.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump tried to distance himself from Project 2025, saying he didn't know anything about the proposals.",
      "Five of Charlton's grants were terminated, including a five-year grant, of which Charlton said she and her colleagues were in their fourth year, focused on documenting obstetrical outcomes for lesbian, gay and bisexual women, she said.",
      "Another grant was focused on how to improve the experience of lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals who are trying to form their families, she said.",
      "A third was research looking to understand how laws identified by the team as discriminatory affect mental health among LGBTQ+ teens and potentially lead to depression and suicide, according to Charlton.",
      "Charlton said the cancellations are not only affecting her ability to conduct research but the ability to keep open the LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence -- based at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health -- of which she is the founding director.",
      "\"My current NIH research contracts are worth $15.9 million, of which $5.9 million still needs to be spent to finish our research,\" Charlton said. \"I have essentially no salary now, and I may need to shutter our newly launched LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence, which was a career goal of mine that I finally met when we launched less than a year ago.\"",
      "She went on, \"These grant terminations may end my academic career, and I've already been forced to make really tough decisions like terminating staff, including our newly appointed center's executive director.\"",
      "According to the lawsuit, Dr. Katie Edwards, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Social Work, has had at least six grants terminated worth about $11.9 million, including one studying sexual violence among men who fall under sexual minorities. She can no longer pay several of the roughly 50 staff members who are funded through the research grants, the lawsuit states.",
      "Dr. Peter Lurie, president and CEO of the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest, was a paid consultant and adviser on a grant evaluating the impacts of over-the-counter access to pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce HIV transmission, according to the lawsuit. The grantee institution, Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare, received a termination letter from the NIH in late March, the lawsuit states.",
      "Meanwhile Dr. Nicole Maphis -- a postdoctoral fellow at the University of New Mexico's School of Medicine -- who was studying the link between alcohol use disorder and Alzheimer's disease, applied for a MOSAIC grant, \"intended to help diversify the profession,\" according to the lawsuit. Her proposal was pulled and her current funding ends September 2025.",
      "\"Without additional funding, which the MOSAIC award would have provided, she will lose her job,\" the lawsuit states.",
      "Charlton said she is hopeful the lawsuit results in a preliminary injunction and therefore halts further NIH terminations.",
      "\"I believe these contracts are binding agreements and are constitutionally grounded,\" she said. \"It's been less than 100 days since inauguration, and I'm concerned. Concerned about signs of growing authoritarianism, and yet there is absolutely hope executive orders can't rewrite laws, and I pray courts ensure justice, pursuing truth, including via science, unites us, and it's the only way to ensure a healthier future for all.\"",

      "\"Markets today are way down ... How's it going?\" a reporter asked the president.",
      "\"I think it's going very well,\" Trump responded. \"It was an operation. I like when a patient gets operated on and it's a big thing. I said this would exactly be the way it is.\"",
      "Trump continued to project confidence and said nations to be affected are now trying to see if they can \"make a deal.\"",
      "\"The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom, and the rest of the world wants to see is there any way they can make a deal.\" Trump said. \"They've taken advantage of us for many, many years. For many years we've been at the wrong side of the ball. And I'll tell you what, I think it's going to be unbelievable.\"",
      "Later, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump again said he's willing to make a deal despite White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and others earlier in the day appearing to say the tariffs would not be changed",
      "\u201cThe tariffs give us great power to negotiate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAlways have, I've used them very well in the first administration, as you saw, but now we're taking it to a whole new level, because it's a worldwide situation, and it's very exciting to see.\"",
      "Asked if he were open to deal with these countries calling him, he answered, \"Well, it depends. If somebody said that we're going to give you something that's so phenomenal, as long as they're giving us something, that's good.\"",

      "\"I don't think there's any chance that President Trump is gonna back off his tariffs,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on the network.",
      "World leaders are weighing their response to Trump's historic levies, some of which go into effect on April 5 and others on April 9.",
      "China, which is going to be hit with a whopping 54% tariff rate, urged the U.S. to \"immediately cancel its unilateral tariff measures and properly resolve differences with its trading partners through equal dialogue.\"",
      "Domestically, stocks plunged in early trading on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 3.75%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 5.75% and the S&P 500 tumbled 4.4%.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, before the market selloff, acknowledged that Trump's massive new tariffs will mean a \"big change\" for Americans. Trump, ahead of Wednesday's announcement, had admitted there could be some short-term pain.",
      "\"President Trump is taking this economy in a different direction. He ran on that. He promised it. And now he's delivering. And yes, this is a big change. I'm not going to shy away from it, but we needed a big change,\" Vance told \"Fox & Friends.\"",
      "Leavitt, too, defended the policy as Trump \"delivering on his promise to implement reciprocal tariffs\" during an appearance on CNN.",
      "\"To anyone on Wall Street this morning, I would say trust in President Trump. This is a president who is doubling down on his proven economic formula from his first term,\" she said.",
      "Neither Vance nor Leavitt directly addressed the increased costs economists say U.S. consumers are all but certain to face or how they would help Americans.",
      "\"What I'd ask folks to appreciate here is that we're not going to fix things overnight,\" Vance said. \"We're fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us, but it's not going to happen immediately.\"",
      "Asked about negative business reaction, Lutnick told CNN, \"they're not counting the factories\" that he claimed would be built in the U.S. as a result.",
      "\"Let Donald Trump run the global economy. He knows what he's doing,\" Lutnick said.",
      "Trump on Wednesday said jobs will come \"roaring back.\"",

      "He continued. \"We're giving them approval to also, in many cases, to build the electric facility with it. So, you have electric generation and the plant, and they're big plants. Now, the good news is a lot of money for them, and they can build them fast, but they're still very big plants. I'd always say it would take a year-and-a-half to two years.",

    "summary": "Marco Rubio is visiting NATO's headquarters for a meeting of foreign ministers, putting him on the front lines of the Trump administration's push against U.S. allies.",
    "story": [
      "Disputes over tariffs and Greenland are poised to overshadow the meeting.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is visiting NATO's headquarters in Brussels for a meeting of the alliance's foreign ministers, putting him on the front lines of the Trump administration's push against traditional American allies in Europe.",
      "European leaders were already bracing for a contentious gathering. President Donald Trump's decision to pull back aid from Ukraine amid its efforts to fight off Russia's invasion marked a dramatic break with other allies, while his decision to engage Moscow in direct, one-on-one negotiations has left the continent's diplomats back on their heels.",
      "But on Wednesday, shortly before Rubio was set to depart for Belgium, Trump unveiled sweeping new \"reciprocal\" tariffs -- including a 20% tax on imports from the European Union.",
      "So far, Rubio has declined to address the tariff issue head on, but his Canadian counterpart said the global economic shock made it difficult to focus on the meeting's pressing agenda.",
      "\"Clearly we're passing that message to our American counterparts that it's difficult to have these [NATO] conversations in the context of a trade war,\" Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said in an interview with CNN.",
      "Rubio has also tried to skirt another topic of contention: Trump's stated desire to \"get\" Greenland for the United States by any means necessary.",
      "Rubio met with Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen on the sidelines of the NATO ministerial but didn't respond to reporters' questions asking what he would say about Greenland during the session. The State Department also made no mention of the Danish autonomous territory in its readout of the engagement.",
      "\"Secretary Rubio reaffirmed the strong relationship between the United States and the Kingdom of Denmark,\" State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said. \"They discussed shared priorities including increasing NATO defense spending and burden sharing and addressing the threats to the alliance, including those posed by Russia and China.\"",
      "Rasmussen later said his meeting with Rubio was \"good\" but that while Greenland was not on the agenda \"for many reasons,\" he had still taken the opportunity \"to very strongly object to claims and presidential statements of a vision of acquiring Greenland.\"",
      "It has amounted to a situation in which it's not within the limits of international law,\" he said, calling it \"an attack on Danish sovereignty.\"",
      "\"We have seen these statements from the president, and we can't accept that,\" Rasmussen added. \"And I made it very, very clear.\"",
      "Rubio and Rasmussen's meeting comes just days after Vice President J.D. Vance visited Greenland alongside his wife, Usha Vance, and national security adviser Mike Waltz.",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to headline the trip and spend several days on the world's largest island, taking in Greenlandic cultural sites, but the visit sparked backlash from Greenland's interim government and Danish leaders who noted an invitation was never extended.",
      "In the aftermath, the White House added the vice president to the traveling delegation and whittled down the itinerary, shortening the trip to a one-day stop at a remote American military base in northwestern Greenland.",
      "Rubio has taken a more measured approach in his comments about Greenland than the president, but he still emphasized what he said are the pressing U.S. national security concerns surrounding control of the island.",
      "\"This is not a joke,\" Rubio said in January. \"This is not about acquiring land for the purpose of acquiring land. This is in our national interest, and it needs to be solved.\"",
      "At NATO Headquarters on Thursday, Rubio tried to reassure allies that despite the president's mixed signals, the Trump administration still views the alliance as central to U.S. security.",
      "\"President Trump's made clear he supports NATO. We're going to remain in NATO,\" he said.",
      "Still, Rubio pushed the administration's message that allies need to increase their defense spending -- calling on all of the alliance's members to commit to putting up to 5% of their annual GDP toward it, a sharp uptick from the previous 2% benchmark.",
      "\"We do want to leave here with an understanding that we are on a pathway, a realistic pathway,\" he said. \"That includes the United States that will have to increase its percentage.\"",

    "story": [
      "Susie Wiles, JD Vance and others were also part of the meeting.",
      "The White House has fired a handful of National Security Council staffers following a Wednesday meeting with far-right political activist Laura Loomer, who made recommendations to President Donald Trump about who he should fire, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "Loomer met with Trump Wednesday, shortly before his tariff announcement in the Rose Garden, the sources said. Trump's chief of staff Susie Wiles, Vice President JD Vance and the head of personnel Sergio Gor were involved in the meeting. Rep. Scott Perry was also present, but he was scheduled to meet with Trump about a variety of different topics, the sources added.",
      "Trump told reporters on Air Force One on his way to Florida on Thursday that Loomer had recommended several people for jobs in the administration, but she was not involved in the NSC firings.",
      "\"She makes recommendations of things and people, and sometimes I listen to those recommendations, like I do with everybody,\" Trump said. \"I listen to everybody, and then I make a decision. But I saw her yesterday. She was at the ceremony, and she is -- she'll always have something to say, usually very constructive.\"",
      "Trump said he didn't know how many staffers were let go but did comment on the loyalty of some.",
      "\"Always, we're gonna let go of people. People that we don't like, or people that we don't think that can do the job, or people that may have loyalties to somebody else,\" he said.",
      "NSC spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement that the \"NSC doesn't comment on personnel matters.\"",
      "The New York Times was first to report on Trump's meeting with Loomer.",
      "\"Out of respect for President Trump and the privacy of the Oval Office, I'm going to decline on divulging any details about my Oval Office meeting with President Trump. It was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my research findings, I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of strong vetting, for the sake of protecting the President and our national security,\" Loomer told ABC News in a statement.",
      "Loomer has frequently spread misinformation. In July, she claimed in a social media post, without citing evidence, that President Joe Biden had a medical emergency after landing at Joint Base Andrews.",
      "She had also started unsubstantiated claims about family members of Judge Juan Merchan in Trump's New York hush money case, including that his daughter posted a fake photo of Trump in jail on social media, which the court has denied. It prompted Trump to share Loomer's posts and spread the rumors.",
      "Loomer accompanied Trump to several campaign events last fall -- a move that prompted criticism from some Republicans at the time.",
      "While it's not clear whether any of the recent firings are directly related to national security adviser Mike Waltz and his staff's use of the messaging app, Signal to communicate about sensitive topics, it comes as Waltz has had to privately defend himself and his staff to the president and other senior White House staffers.",
      "The day after the inauguration, the Trump administration purged more than 150 NSC staffers because the new administration wanted to make sure the the goals of the NSC aligned with Trump's agenda. Firing the nonpolitical staffers, who typically serve two-year stints on the council, has left the NSC severely understaffed and lacking subject matter experts from across government.",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 06:43:05 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has set off a firestorm by revoking the visas of international U.S. college students involved in campus protests.",
    "story": [
      "Some students claim they're being targeted for exercising free speech.",
      "The Trump administration has set off a legal and ethical firestorm by targeting international students at U.S. colleges for deportation, including some whom the government alleges participated in pro-Palestinian protests or activities on campuses.",
      "The Trump administration has claimed without presenting evidence that some of those students support the terrorist organization Hamas, while the students say the White House is treading on their constitutional right to free speech and the longstanding tradition of participating in campus demonstrations.",
      "Since President Trump's Jan. 30 executive order to \"combat the explosion of anti-Semitism on our campuses and streets\" in the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, the State Department has revoked around 300 visas so far, many of them held by college students alleged to have participated in pro-Palestinian activities on the nation's campuses, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "\"If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us the reason you are coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus \u2013 we're not going to give you a visa,\" Rubio said, adding, \"Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa.\"",
      "Here's what we know and don't know about some of the more high-profile cases involving foreign students who have had their visas revoked, who have been detained, or who have self-deported after being targeted by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.",
      "Mahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old Columbia University international affairs graduate student of Palestinian descent, was arrested on March 8 when ICE agents appeared at his student apartment building, despite him being a legal permanent U.S. resident in possession of a green card. Khalil is married to an American citizen, who is pregnant with their first child.",
      "The Trump administration accused Khalil, a Palestinian activist, of supporting Hamas and distributing \"pro-Hamas propaganda,\" though it has provided no evidence to support that claim. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed on March 11 that Khalil distributed \"pro-Hamas propaganda fliers with the logo of Hamas,\" but declined to provide details.",
      "Ramzi Kassem, the director of CLEAR, a group representing Khalil, called Leavitt's claim \"nonsense\" and said there is \"no truth to it whatsoever.\"",
      "During a pro-Palestinian student protest at Columbia University last spring, Khalil served as a negotiator when students bargained with school officials over a tent encampment they established on campus. During the days-long demonstration, some protestors also occupied the school's Hamilton Hall and defied orders to disperse, prompting the university to write a letter formally allowing the New York Police Department to enter the campus and break up the protest, during which time they made dozens of arrests. Khalil was not among those arrested, according to the NYPD, who confirmed to ABC News that \"there are no arrests on file\" for Khalil.",
      "\"His one and only goal was to get Columbia University to divest from its complicity with Israeli government crimes in Gaza and the West Bank,\" Kassem said of Khalil's involvement in the protests.",
      "Khalil is being held at an ICE detention facility in Louisiana and has filed a lawsuit challenging the federal government's attempt to deport him. He has not been charged with a crime, although the government alleges he intentionally misrepresented information on his green card application and therefore is inadmissible to the United States.",
      "According to recent court filings, the Trump administration said Khalil failed to disclose when applying for his green card last year that his employment by the Syria Office at the British Embassy in Beirut went \"beyond 2022\" and that he was a \"political affairs officer\" for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNWRA) from June to November 2023.",
      "In arresting Khalil, the government invoked a rarely used provision of immigration law that they said allows the secretary of state to revoke the legal status of people whose presence in the country could have \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\"",
      "In a letter he released from the detention facility in which he's being held, Khalil described himself as a \"political prisoner.\"",
      "\"My arrest was a direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza, which resumed in full force Monday night,\" Khalil wrote in the March 18 letter, referring to the renewed attacks on Gaza after the collapse of the ceasefire.",
      "A federal judge in New Jersey on April 2 retained Khalil's case, rejecting the government\u2019s request to move it to Louisiana or dismiss it altogether. The opinion, unless appealed by the government, would clear the way for the judge to decide the more substantive issues of Khalil's continued confinement.",
      "Khalil is scheduled to appear before an immigration judge for a removal hearing on April 8.",
      "An urban planning doctoral student at Columbia University, Ranjani Srinivasan, a citizen of India who was in the country on an F-1 student visa, used the U.S. Customs and Border Protection home app to self-deport on March 11, according to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "\"Srinivasan was involved in activities supporting Hamas, a terrorist organization,\" Noem said in a March 14 statement, which did not include evidence to support the allegation against Srinivasan.",
      "\"I am not a terrorist sympathizer so I just kind of find it absurd,\" Srinivasan said during a CBC interview March 19. \"I'm a Ph.D. student \u2026 who actually rarely left the office because I was busy working or grading my students' papers.\"",
      "In a March 22 statement, the group Student Workers of Columbia \u2013 of which Srinivasan is a member, the union confirmed in response to an ABC News request for comment \u2013 said Srinivasan was notified on March 6 that her student visa had been revoked and that on March 8, ICE agents went to her Columbia housing apartment seeking entry, allegedly without a warrant, but did not arrest or detain anyone. Srinivasan was subsequently informed by the university's International Students and Scholars Office that she was being disenrolled by the university and ordered to vacate her student housing, according to the Student Workers of Columbia statement.",
      "\"With no housing or visa and a continued stream of threats from ICE to detain her, Ranjani made the difficult decision to leave the country for Canada,\" according to the statement.",
      "Srinivasan has not been charged with a crime. The Student Workers of Columbia has been circulating a petition asking Columbia to re-enroll Srinivasan and for the government to reinstate her visa.",
      "A Palestinian from the West Bank, Leqaa Kordia was arrested on March 13 by the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "According to DHS, Kordia was arrested for allegedly overstaying her expired visa, which the agency said terminated on Jan. 26, 2022.",
      "In a March 14 statement, DHS said that Kordia's student visa was terminated for lack of class attendance. She was previously arrested in April 2024 for her alleged involvement in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia, according to the DHS statement.",
      "\u201cColumbia has no record of this individual being registered as a current or former student at the University,\" a spokesperson for the university said in response to an ABC News request for comment.",
      "\"It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country,\" DHS Secretary Noem said in a statement following Kordia's arrest.",
      "Multiple attempts to determine the current status of Kordia's case and whether she is currently being detained, including repeated ABC News inquiries to ICE and DHS, were not immediately successful.",
      "Yunseo Chung, a junior at Columbia University, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after ICE agents went to her residence on March 13 looking for her, one day after an ICE official signed an administrative arrest warrant for her, according to her lawsuit.",
      "According to her lawsuit, Chung was born in South Korea but is a lawful permanent U.S. resident who has lived in the United States since she was 7 years old.",
      "\"This action challenges the government's shocking overreach in seeking to deport a college student, Plaintiff-Petitioner Yunseo Chung, who is a lawful permanent resident of this country, because of her protected free speech,\" according to Chung's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. \"The government's actions are an unprecedented and unjustifiable assault on First Amendment and other rights, one that cannot stand basic legal scrutiny.\"",
      "The lawsuit contends, \"Simply put, immigration enforcement \u2013 here, immigration detention and threatened deportation \u2013 may not be used as a tool to punish noncitizen speakers who express political views disfavored by the current administration.\"",
      "According to her lawsuit, Chung has participated since 2023 in student protests on the Columbia campus related to Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip. On March 5, Chung was among a group of students arrested by the New York Police Department for holding a sit-in at an academic building at Barnard College, according to her lawsuit. She was given a desk appearance ticket accusing her of obstruction of governmental administration, her lawsuit claims.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a March 25 statement that Chung had engaged in \"concerning conduct\" and cited her prior arrest during a protest at Barnard College, which DHS described as a \"pro-Hamas\" protest.",
      "\"ICE HSI will investigate individuals engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization,\" the DHS statement said.",
      "\"Ms. Chung has felt moved to join efforts to advocate for Palestinian human rights,\" the lawsuit states, under a heading titled Ms. Chung\u2019s Exercise of Free Speech Rights in Support of Palestinians.",
      "\"Ms. Chung has also felt compelled to criticize Columbia for its handling of student protests supporting Palestinian human rights, including the punitive measures imposed on certain students,\" according to the lawsuit.",
      "Chung's lawsuit also states that some opponents of pro-Palestinian protest activities \"frequently mischaracterize\" them as \"inherently supportive of Hamas or terrorism and anti-Semitic.\"",
      "A federal judge in New York issued a temporary restraining order on March 25 blocking federal agents from detaining Chung.",
      "A Ph.D. student at Tufts University in Massachusetts, Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national with a valid F-1 visa, was arrested by ICE agents on March 25 near her home in the Boston suburb of Somerville, Massachusetts.",
      "In a statement to ABC News, a DHS spokesperson said: \"Rumeysa Ozturk is a Turkish national and Tufts University graduate student, granted the privilege to be in this country on a visa. DHS and ICE investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans.\" The DHS statement did not specify the activities in which Ozturk is alleged to have participated.",
      "\"A visa is a privilege not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated,\" the DHS statement further said.",
      "On March 26, 2024, Ozturk, a Fulbright scholar, was one of four Tufts students who wrote an op-ed published in the school student newspaper, The Tufts Daily, asking the university to agree to resolutions passed by the Tufts Community Senate to divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.",
      "\"Credible accusations against Israel include accounts of deliberate starvation and indiscriminate slaughter of Palestinian civilians and plausible genocide,\" the op-ed said, in part. It's unknown whether the editorial played a part in Ozturk's arrest.",
      "\"Rumeysa has not been accused of committing any crime. It appears the only thing she is being targeted for is her right to free speech,\" Mahsa Khanbabai, an attorney representing Ozturk, said in a statement provided to ABC News.",
      "A statement in support of Ozturk, dated April 1 and signed by Tufts President Sunil Kumar, acknowledges the March 26 editorial, and further states that the university \"has no information to support the allegations that [Ozturk] was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention,\" and that it \"has no further information suggesting that she has acted in a manner that would constitute a violation of the University's understanding of the Immigration and Naturalization Act.\"",
      "Ozturk is currently listed in the ICE database as \"in custody\" and appears to be held at an ICE processing center in Basile, Louisiana.",
      "On March 25, a federal judge in Boston ruled that Ozturk cannot be deported until the judge determines whether the court has jurisdiction to decide whether Ozturk was lawfully taken into custody.",
      "Judge Denise Casper said in her ruling that Ozturk \"shall not be removed from the United States until further Order by this Court.\"",
      "Following an April 3 hearing, Judge Casper did not issue a ruling and said she will first decide whether she has jurisdiction before other motions in the lawsuit can be considered.",
      "Alireza Doroudi, an Iranian citizen and a doctoral student studying mechanical engineering at the University of Alabama, was arrested at his home on March 25.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Doroudi\u2019s student visa was revoked and he was subsequently arrested because he \"posed significant national security concerns.\"",
      "But Doroudi's attorney, David Rozas, told ABC News that he has \"not been informed of any allegations concerning significant national security issues.\"",
      "Rozas said Doroudi has \"not been arrested for any crime, nor has he participated in any anti-government protests.\"",
      "Doroudi was initially held in a county jail in Alabama but has since been transferred to ICE's Jena-LaSalle Detention Facility in Louisiana, according to the ICE website.",
      "\"He is legally present in the U.S., pursuing his American dream by working towards his doctorate in mechanical engineering,\" Rozas said. \"He is also in the early stages of applying for an EB-1/Adjustment of Status as a researcher with extraordinary ability.\"",
      "Rozas said Doroudi is studying at the University of Alabama on active I-20/SEVIS status, referring to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.",
      "A Ph.D. student of Africana studies at Cornell University, Momodou Taal filed a federal lawsuit on March 15 seeking to block the enforcement of Trump executive orders that he feared could lead to his deportation.",
      "But six days after filing the lawsuit, the 31-year-old citizen of the U.K. and Gambia was asked to voluntarily surrender to ICE agents, according to his attorneys.",
      "In its court filing, the Department of Justice said Taal's student visa was revoked before he filed his lawsuit but ICE agents had trouble locating him. The revocation is based on Taal's alleged involvement in \u201cdisruptive protests,\u201d disregarding university policies and creating a hostile environment for Jewish students, the government said.",
      "According to court records, Taal was temporarily suspended from Cornell for a second time last fall after a group of pro-Palestinian activists disrupted a campus career fair. He has limited access to the upstate New York campus as he continues his studies remotely, according to his attorneys.",
      "\"If the First Amendment does not protect the right to attend a demonstration, what's left? Not much,\" said Taal's attorney, Eric Lee.",
      "On March 27, a federal judge denied Taal's bid to prevent his deportation and his challenge of two Trump executive orders that have been used to target other pro-Palestinian students.",
      "Taal announced on Monday that he has exited the United States and is \"safe\" in an undisclosed country.",
      "\"Today I took the decision to leave the United States, free and with my head held high,\" Taal said in a social media post.",
      "While his lawyers planned to make another legal argument for a temporary restraining order, Taal wrote in his post: \"Given what we have seen across the United States, I have lost faith that a favorable ruling from the courts would guarantee my personal safety and ability to express my beliefs.\"",
      "\"I have lost faith I could walk the streets without being abducted. Weighing up these options, I took the decision to leave on my own terms,\" Taal's post continued. \"This is of course not the outcome I had wanted going into this, but we are facing a government that has no respect for the judiciary or for the rule of law.\"",
      "A visiting scholar from India and a researcher at Georgetown University, Badar Khan Suri was detained on March 17 outside his Washington, D.C.- area apartment.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security alleged that Suri was \"actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.\" The department also alleged he had close connections to a \"known or suspected terrorist\" who is a senior adviser to Hamas.",
      "Suri, who is married to Mapheze Saleh, a U.S. citizen of Palestinian descent, was sent to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana, according to his attorney.",
      "A lawsuit filed by Suri's attorneys said the Trump administration appeared to be targeting the Georgetown University fellow due to his wife's identity as a Palestinian and her constitutionally protected speech.",
      "\"This was done pursuant to a policy to retaliate against and punish noncitizens like Mr. Suri solely for their family ties to those who may have either expressed criticism of U.S. foreign policy as it relates to Israel,\" attorneys representing Suri said in a complaint.",
      "In a sworn declaration filed March 20 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Mapheze Saleh said that following the Oct. 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel, she \"shared posts on a daily basis\" about subsequent events in Gaza, \"including posts that expressed sorrow for the deaths of Gazan people.\" Because of this, Saleh said, and because her father previously served in the government of Gaza until 2010, \"multiple articles were published about me and my family, and eventually about my husband. A website claimed falsely that my husband and I have 'ties to Hamas.'\"",
      "Nermeen Arastu, one of Suri's attorneys, told ABC News that Suri's detainment happened because \"President Trump wants to silence anyone he suspects to hold a political opinion contrary to his.\"",
      "Suri has not been accused of a crime, his lawyers said.",
      "Georgetown University said Suri was granted a visa to enter the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan.",

      "After a long wait, the Senate is launching action on President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201d\u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d of tax breaks and spending cuts",
      "WASHINGTON -- After a long wait, the Senate is launching action on President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\u201d of tax breaks and spending cuts at a risky moment for the U.S. and global economy.",
      "More than a month after House Republicans surprised Washington by advancing their framework for Trump's $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $2 trillion in spending cuts, Senate Republicans voted Thursday to start working on their version. The largely party-line vote, 52-48, sets the stage for a potential Senate all-nighter Friday spilling into the weekend.",
      "But work on the multitrillion-dollar package is coming as markets at home and abroad are on edge in the aftermath Trump's vast tariffs scheme, complicating an already difficult political and procedural undertaking on what Republicans hope will become their signature domestic policy package.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., opened the chamber Thursday saying they expected to be ready to begin.",
      "Trump says he's on board with the plan and Republicans, in control of Congress, are eager to show the party is making progress toward delivering on their campaign promises. By nightfall, as voting began, one Republican, the libertarian-leaning Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against, as did all Democrats.",
      "Democrats, as the minority party, don't have the votes to stop the GOP plan. But they intend to use the procedural tools available to prolong the process. Democrats argue that Republicans are focusing on tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of the programs and services millions of Americans rely on for help with health care, child care, school lunches and other everyday needs.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re mean, they\u2019re nasty, they\u2019re uncaring,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said about the Republicans. \u201cWe, tonight and tomorrow, are going to show just who they are.\"",
      "Senate Democrats started consuming up to 25 hours of their available debate time, holding the floor into the night and railing against potential GOP cuts to Medicaid, veterans programs, DOGE cuts and the impact of Trump's tariffs.",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Budget committee, repeated a slogan he has been sharing: \u201cFamilies lose and billionaires win.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat,\" he said, \u201cis the Republican plan.\u201d",
      "Fundamental to the Senate package is making sure Trump\u2019s first-term tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of the year, are continued and made a permanent fixture of the tax code. The senators also will consider adding Trump's proposed tax cuts on tipped wages, Social Security income and others.",
      "The Senate package also would bolster border security funds by some $175 billion to carry out Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign, which is running short of cash, and it would add national security funds for the Pentagon \u2014 all priorities the Senate GOP tucked into an earlier version that was panned by House Republicans.",
      "Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the party whip, said that without action tax cuts would expire, becoming a $4 trillion tax hike on Americans. \u201cRepublicans are focused on getting America back on track,\u201d he said.",
      "What's unclear is how it will all be paid for, since Republican deficit hawks typically require spending offsets to help defray the lost tax revenue and avoid piling onto the nation's $36 trillion debt load.",
      "While House Republicans approved their package with $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and up to $2 trillion in spending cuts, the Senate Republicans are taking a different tack.",
      "Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham is making the case that since the existing Trump tax breaks are the current policy, they are not considered new, and do not need to be offset with reductions in spending \u2014 an approach Democrats compare to \u201cgoing nuclear\u201d with the normal rules, particularly if the strategy is put to the test with an unfavorable ruling before the Senate parliamentarian.",
      "Instead, Senate Republicans are considering offsets mostly for any new Trump tax breaks. Raising alarms from the most conservative budget hawks, the senators have set a floor of about $4 billion in budget reductions to health and other programs \u2014 a fraction of the package's expected $4 trillion-plus price tag for tax breaks.",
      "GOP leaders are assuring the deficit hawks within their own ranks that the legislation says the cuts can rise to as much as $2 trillion.",
      "After an expected Friday night vote-a-rama, with dozens of amendments being offered to the package, the senators are planning to stay into Saturday if needed to take a final vote to approve it, sending it to the House for action.",
      "The House and Senate will ultimately need to merge their frameworks into a final product, expected in May, but House Speaker Mike Johnson's intention to have it all wrapped up by Memorial Day could prove optimistic.",
      "The political environment is uncertain, and the public's appetite for steep budget cuts is being tested in real time, with Trump's Department of Government Efficiency headed by billionaire Elon Musk blazing through federal offices, firing thousands of workers and shuttering long-running government mainstays \u2014 from scientific research projects on diseases to educational services for schoolchildren to offices that help with Social Security, tax filing and the weather.",
      "At the same time, the staunchest fiscal conservatives in both the House and Senate, many aligned with the Freedom Caucus, are pushing for even more cuts.",
      "Trump told senators publicly and privately this week he would have their backs, particularly when it comes to standing up for the spending reductions. At a White House announcing the tariffs Wednesday, Trump said the Senate plan had his \u201ccomplete and total support.\u201d",
      "The president's steep tariffs threw the global economy into a tailspin Thursday, with stocks down around the world, the U.S. markets leading the way.",

      "President Donald Trump says his trade policies will never change despite sending the global economy into a tailspin by announce tariffs on foreign imports",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Two days after sending the global economy reeling by announcing tariffs on foreign imports, President Donald Trump insisted his trade policies will never change as he remained ensconced in a bubble of wealth and power in Florida.",
      "He woke up on Friday morning at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, and headed to his nearby golf course a few miles away after writing on social media that \u201cTHIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH.\"",
      "Several supporters stood across the street as Trump, wearing his signature red campaign hat and white polo shirt, glided down a street lined with palm trees. They waved to him and he waved back, part of a ritual that plays out every weekend that he's in town.",
      "The Republican president was not expected to appear publicly, although he's scheduled to attend a candlelit dinner for MAGA Inc., an allied political organization, on Friday evening. He also spent Thursday in Miami at a different one of his golf courses, where he attended a Saudi-funded tournament. He landed in Marine One and was picked up in a golf cart driven by his son, Eric.",
      "Trump has often proved impervious to the kind of scandals or gaffes that would damage another politician, but his decision to spend the weekend at his gilded properties could test Americans' patience at a time when their retirement savings are evaporating along with the stock market. The tariffs are expected to increase prices by thousands of dollars per year and slow economic growth, and there are fears about a potential recession.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that the tariffs were \u201csignificantly larger than expected\u201d and are \u201chighly likely\u201d to cause more inflation \u2014 at least in the short term but possibly in the long term as well.",
      "However, Trump has described his policies as a painful yet necessary step to encourage companies to relocate their operations to the United States, and he spent the morning defending himself on Truth Social, his social media platform, vowing he is sticking with his policies.",
      "Although experts have harshly criticized Trump's tariffs, he's found support on TikTok. He shared a video that said \u201cTrump is crashing the stock market\u201d and \u201che\u2019s doing it on purpose\u201d as part of \u201csecret game he\u2019s playing, and it could make you rich.\u201d",
      "The goal, the video said, is to push the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, something that Trump explicitly called for later in the morning.",
      "\u201cThis would be a PERFECT time\" for Powell to cut interest rates, he wrote. \u201cCUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!\u201d",
      "With foreign leaders scrambling in response to Trump's announcement this week, the president lashed out and looked to cut deals.",
      "He said he spoke with Vietnamese leader To Lam and claimed Vietnam wants to eliminate its tariffs on U.S. goods if it can make a deal with the U.S.",
      "He also criticized China for announcing its own tariffs on U.S. imports.",
      "\u201cCHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED - THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!\u201d he wrote.",
      "Trump also celebrated a new report showing the U.S. added 228,000 jobs in March, beating expectations. Although the numbers were a snapshot of the economy before the tariff announcement, Trump claimed vindication, saying they already show his moves are working. \u201cHANG TOUGH,\" he wrote. \"WE CAN\u2019T LOSE!!!\u201d",

      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Three alleged MS-13 gang members have been federally charged in connection with a killing a decade ago in Florida, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Friday, seeking to highlight the Trump administration's push to prosecute violent gangs.",
      "Bondi joined law enforcement officials in Fort Lauderdale to promote the Justice Department's efforts to go after the gang, which the Republican administration has designated a \u201cforeign terrorist organization\" and has seized on as the threat posed by illegal immigration.",
      "\u201cMore arrests are coming,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cIf you are a gang member living in this country, I\u2019d self-deport right now because we\u2019re coming after you.\u201d",
      "The three alleged gang members are among nine who have been arrested in four killings in South Florida in 2014 and 2015. The three men federally charged last month are accused of participating in the killing of someone who was stabbed about 100 times and then shot, the attorney general said.",
      "Jose Ezequiel Gamez-Maravilla and Wilber Rosendo Navarro-Escobar were arrested in Florida. Hugo Adiel Bermudez-Martinez was arrested in Minnesota. Emails seeking comment were sent to attorneys for the men.",
      "The violent killings in South Florida were carried out using knives or machetes, authorities say. The cases were reopened in 2020 after going cold, and one of the investigations led to a multi-day excavation to recover the body of Joel Canizales-Lara in 2021, after he was reported missing in 2014.",
      "The announcement comes a week after Bondi lauded the arrest of the alleged East Coast leader of the MS-13 gang.",
      "In the past decade, the Justice Department has intensified its focus on MS-13, which originated as a neighborhood street gang in Los Angeles but grew into a transnational gang based in El Salvador. The gang has members in Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico and thousands of members across the U.S. with numerous branches or cliques.",

      "The National Transportation Safety Board issued its final report in the June 2023 crash at an Interstate 95 exit ramp and \u201cfound probable cause\u201d that the driver, who was killed, exited the highway above the posted speed limit and possible fatigue played a role in the incident. There were no other deaths or injuries.",
      "Another factor in the intense blaze that collapsed part of the highway was the driver's failure to secure a manhole cover on the truck, which was transporting about 8,500 gallons (32 kiloliters) of gasoline.",
      "The NTSB's findings come after state officials had said earlier that the driver lost control of the vehicle on the exit ramp. Federal officials had earlier flagged the open manhole cover as an issue as well.",
      "Interstate 95 reopened less than two weeks after the collapse, a quicker-than-expected rebuild to get traffic flowing again on a heavily traveled stretch of the East Coast\u2019s main north-south highway.",
      "Among the \u201clessons learned\u201d the NTSB cited in its report were the importance of mitigating commercial truck driver fatigue and the benefit of electronic stability control, a system designed to prevent rollovers. The truck did not have the system, investigators said, but it could have stopped the rollover even with the truck traveling over the posted speed limit.",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is gearing up for a potential U.S. Senate run while no longer shadowed by a federal corruption investigation that hung over his rising profile in the Republican Party.",
      "That durability would be tested against Republican Sen. John Cornyn should Paxton embark on what would likely be one of the country's most contentious 2026 primary battles.",
      "Paxton, a close ally of President Donald Trump, has hinted at challenging Cornyn for more than a year but has not said when he will make a decision.",

      "Though the date of the decision was not immediately clear, it was made in the final weeks of the President Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, one of the people said.",
      "The accusations were arguably the most serious of multiple legal troubles Paxton has faced since becoming attorney general in 2015, including felony securities fraud charges that hovered over him for nearly a decade before he agreed to pay nearly $300,000 in restitution fees. The attorney general also faced an investigation by the Texas State Bar for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.",
      "Paxton characterized the investigation as a \u201cbogus witch hunt\" in a social media post on X responding to the news Thursday. He also tacked on a fresh barb toward Cornyn.",

      "Paxton declined an interview request through a spokesperson Thursday.",
      "Spokespeople for Cornyn did not immediately respond to phone and email requests seeking comment.",
      "The quiet dismissal underscores Paxton's political resiliency and ascendency among his party's hard-right in recent years while also potentially giving his opponents less fodder for political attacks.",
      "\u201cThere are no more clouds over him,\" said Bill Miller, a longtime Texas lobbyist and friend of Paxton.",
      "Paxton has targeted Cornyn since the senator became one of few prominent Republicans to criticize him.

      "Cornyn, who also served as Texas attorney general, has served in the Senate since 2002 and is a popular member of the GOP conference. But Cornyn lost to South Dakota Sen. John Thune in a close bid to become Senate majority leader. If Paxton enters the race, it will likely be the senator's most competitive primary campaign to date.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A crackdown on foreign students is alarming colleges, who say the Trump administration is using new tactics and vague justifications to push some students out of the country.",
      "College officials worry the new approach will keep foreigners from wanting to study in the U.S.",
      "Students stripped of their entry visas are receiving orders from the Department of Homeland Security to leave the country immediately \u2014 a break from past practice that often permitted them to stay and complete their studies.",
      "Some students have been targeted over pro-Palestinian activism or criminal infractions \u2014 or even traffic violations. Others have been left wondering how they ran afoul of the government.",
      "At Minnesota State University in Mankato, President Edward Inch told the campus Wednesday that visas had been revoked for five international students for unclear reasons.",
      "He said school officials learned about the revocations when they ran a status check in a database of international students after the detention of a Turkish student at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. The State Department said the detention was related to a drunken driving conviction.",
      "\u201cThese are troubling times, and this situation is unlike any we have navigated before,\u201d Inch wrote in a letter to campus.",
      "President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to deport foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian protests, and federal agents started by detaining Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, a green-card-holder and Palestinian activist who was prominent in protests at Columbia last year. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week students are being targeted for involvement in protests along with others tied to \u201cpotential criminal activity.\u201d",
      "In the past two weeks, the government apparently has widened its crackdown. Officials from colleges around the country have discovered international students have had their entry visas revoked and, in many cases, their legal residency status terminated by authorities without notice \u2014 including students at Arizona State, Cornell, North Carolina State, the University of Oregon, the University of Texas and the University of Colorado.",
      "Some of the students are working to leave the country on their own, but students at Tufts and the University of Alabama have been detained by immigration authorities \u2014 in the Tufts case, even before the university knew the student's legal status had changed.",
      "In this new wave of enforcement, school officials say the federal government is quietly deleting foreigners' student records instead of going through colleges, as was done in the past.",
      "Students are being ordered to leave the country with a suddenness that universities have rarely seen, said Miriam Feldblum, president and CEO of the Presidents\u2019 Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration.",
      "In the past, when international students have had entry visas revoked, they generally have been allowed to keep legal residency status. They could stay in the country to study, but would need to renew their visa if they left the U.S. and wanted to return. Now, increasing numbers of students are having their legal status terminated, exposing them to the risk of being arrested.",
      "\u201cNone of this is regular practice,\u201d Feldblum said.",
      "At North Carolina State University, two students from Saudi Arabia left the U.S. after learning their legal status as students was terminated, the university said. N.C. State said it will work with the students to complete their semester from outside the country.",
      "Philip Vasto, who lived with one of the students, said his roommate, in graduate school for engineering management, was apolitical and did not attend protests against the war in Gaza. When the government told his roommate his student status had been terminated, it did not give a reason, Vasto said.",
      "Since returning to Saudi Arabia, Vasto said his former roommate's top concern is getting into another university.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s made his peace with it,\" he said. \"He doesn\u2019t want to allow it to steal his peace any further.\u201d",
      "At the University of Texas at Austin, staff checking a federal database discovered two people on student visas had their permission to be in the U.S. terminated, a person familiar with the situation said. The person declined to be identified for fear of retaliation.",
      "One of the people, from India, had their legal status terminated April 3. The federal system indicated the person had been identified in a criminal records check \u201cand/or has had their visa revoked.\u201d The other person, from Lebanon, had their legal status terminated March 28 due to a criminal records check, according to the federal database.",
      "Both people were graduates remaining in the U.S. on student visas, using an option allowing people to gain professional experience after completing coursework. Both were employed full time and apparently had not violated requirements for pursuing work experience, the person familiar with the situation said.",
      "Some students have had visas revoked by the State Department under an obscure law barring noncitizens whose presence could have \u201cserious adverse foreign policy consequences.\u201d Trump invoked the law in a January order demanding action against campus antisemitism.",
      "But some students targeted in recent weeks have had no clear link to political activism. Some have been ordered to leave over misdemeanor crimes or traffic infractions, Feldblum said. In some cases, students were targeted for infractions that had been previously reported to the government.",
      "Some of the alleged infractions would not have drawn scrutiny in the past and will likely be a test of students' First Amendment rights as cases work their way through court, said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of public affairs at the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, what the administration is doing is really retroactive,\" she said. \"Rather than saying, 'This is going to be the standard that we're applying going forward,' they're going back and vetting students based on past expressions or past behavior.\"",
      "The Association of Public and Land-grant Universities is requesting a meeting with the State Department over the issue. It\u2019s unclear whether more visas are being revoked than usual, but officials fear a chilling effect on international exchange.",
      "Many of the association\u2019s members have recently seen at least one student have their visas revoked, said Bernie Burrola, a vice president at the group. With little information from the government, colleges have been interviewing students or searching social media for a connection to political activism.",
      "\u201cThe universities can\u2019t seem to find anything that seems to be related to Gaza or social media posts or protests,\u201d Burrola said. \u201cSome of these are sponsored students by foreign governments, where they specifically are very hesitant to get involved in protests.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no clear thread indicating which students are being targeted, but some have been from the Middle East and China, he said.",
      "America's universities have long been seen as a top destination for the world's brightest minds \u2014 and they've brought important tuition revenue and research breakthroughs to U.S. colleges. But international students also have other options, said Fanta Aw, CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators.",

      "Other messages followed, often angry and obscene, including one referring to her \u201closer husband\u201d and others that indicated she was being watched.",
      "A few weeks after the initial text, she was found fatally stabbed and beaten in her suburban Denver home.",
      "Opening statements could come as soon as Friday in the trial of the man who prosecutors say actually sent the messages and then killed Krug: her husband.",
      "Daniel Krug, 44, is charged with first-degree murder, stalking and criminal impersonation in his wife's death in Broomfield.",
      "His lawyers, Joseph Morales and Phillip Andrew Geigle, did not respond to a call seeking comment.",
      "Krug was arrested Dec. 16, 2023, two days after his wife was found on the floor of their garage by a police officer. While at his job with the state health department, he had asked police to do a welfare check, saying she failed to respond to his text messages.",
      "Three of the home's surveillance cameras, which Kristil Krug's mother said she installed because of the recent stalking, were not recording when she was found, according to the arrest affidavit. The one in the garage was covered with tape.",
      "Video from cameras at neighboring homes did not show any unknown person entering the home in the hours leading up to her being found, the document said.",
      "Kristil Krug had contacted police about the messages, which she thought came from the former boyfriend. After she was killed, police traced the IP address for the texts to Daniel Krug's workplace, according to the affidavit.",
      "At the time of the killing, the ex-boyfriend was an eight-hour drive away in Utah, where he was living, the affidavit said. He is not a suspect.",
      "Krug's mother told police that her daughter's relationship with her husband was not good, and that she wanted to get divorced and seek full custody of their three children.",
      "Krug, had a degree in biochemical engineering and a fulfilling career in technology and innovation, as well as a passion for the performing arts and modern dance, according to her obituary.",
      "\u201cShe accomplished so much in her short life, and had so much left to contribute before being so savagely removed,\u201d it read. \u201cThe world will miss what she had yet to give us.\u201d",

      "A historic ocean liner will become the world\u2019s largest artificial reef once it reaches its final resting place off Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast. Competing diving businesses are vying for the massive ship to be scuttled closer to them, while one group is suing to stop the ship from being sunk at all.",
      "The SS United States, a nearly 1,000-foot (305-meter) vessel that shattered the trans-Atlantic speed record on its maiden voyage in 1952, is going through a monthslong scouring at the Port of Mobile in Alabama.",
      "Workers will empty and clean all 120 fuel tanks, as well as remove chemicals, wiring, plastic and glass.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nasties on vessels that were built back in the '50s,\" Okaloosa County coastal resource manager Alex Fogg said. \u201cBasically, when it\u2019s ready to be deployed, it will be a steel and aluminum structure.\"",
      "The SS United States is set to join Okaloosa County\u2019s more than 500 artificial reefs, which include a dozen smaller ship wrecks. Officials hope to draw tourists and generate millions of dollars annually for scuba shops, charter fishing boats and hotels, as well as provide habitat for critical fish species and other sea life.",
      "\u201cThe goal here is to be the dive capital of the state of Florida,\u201d Fogg said. \u201cWe\u2019re even trying to surpass the Florida Keys.\u201d",
      "Fogg said they expect to have the SS United States sunk by the end of the year at one of three permitted locations, all just over 20 nautical miles (37 kilometers) from Destin, Florida. All three locations are the same depth, about 180 feet (55 meters) of water to the sand, but the vessel is so tall that the top decks will be about 60 feet (18 meters) from the surface.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s very much within the beginner diver profile, and those deeper depths will be certainly attractive to those technical and advanced divers,\u201d Fogg said.",
      "Bay County officials have agreed to offer $3 million to Okaloosa County to sink the SS United States closer to Panama City Beach.",
      "Visit Panama City Beach President and CEO Dan Rowe said his area has one of the largest dive boat fleets along the northern Gulf Coast. Bay County has a long history of developing technology used in underwater exploration and the U.S. Navy\u2019s dive school is located at Naval Support Activity Panama City.",
      "\u201cDiving is part of our DNA,\u201d Rowe said.",
      "Escambia County officials are offering only $1 million to sink the ship closer to Pensacola, but Visit Pensacola President and CEO Darien Schaefer said the western location is just 12 nautical miles (22 kilometers) away from to the USS Oriskany, another popular dive site sunk in 2006. He said divers would be able to visit both wrecks in a single day.",
      "\u201cWe just think it would be a legendary dive site to have those two wrecks within close proximity,\u201d Schaefer said.",
      "The SS United States arrived in Alabama at the beginning of March following a 12-day tow from Philadelphia\u2019s Delaware River, where it has spent nearly three decades. Okaloosa County was able to take ownership of the vessel after a years-old rent dispute was resolved in October between the conservancy that oversees the ship and its landlord.",
      "Various groups have attempted to restore the SS United States over the years, but all plans were eventually abandoned because of the steep cost. Recently, increased media attention has generated more calls to preserve the ship, and a group called the New York Coalition has even filed a lawsuit in Pensacola federal court asking a judge to halt sinking such a historically significant vessel.",
      "But preventing the SS United States from becoming a reef would only send it to the scrapyard, Fogg said. Also, the county's $10.1 million plan to purchase, move, clean and sink the ship includes $1 million toward a landside museum to promote the ship's history.",
      "\u201cOnce the vessel is deployed as an artificial reef, there are going to be more people visiting it in the first month of it underwater than have visited it in the last 30 years,\" Fogg said.",
      "The SS United States, more than 100 feet (30 meters) longer than the RMS Titanic, was once considered a beacon of American engineering, doubling as a military vessel that could carry thousands of troops. Its maiden voyage broke the trans-Atlantic speed record in both directions when it reached an average speed of 36 knots, or just over 41 mph (66 kph), The Associated Press reported from aboard the ship.",
      "The ship crossed the Atlantic Ocean in three days, 10 hours and 40 minutes, besting the RMS Queen Mary\u2019s time by 10 hours. To this day, the SS United States holds the trans-Atlantic speed record for an ocean liner.",

      "\u201cI am heartbroken to share the tragic news of the death of Fr. Arul Carasala, who was fatally shot earlier today,\" Archbishop Joseph Naumann, of the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas, said in a Facebook post. \"This senseless act of violence has left us grieving the loss of a beloved priest, leader, and friend.\u201d",

They referred calls to County Attorney Brad Lippert, who was traveling and did not immediately return a call or an email from The Associated Press seeking details on the shooting.",
      "The archbishop said in his post that there was no ongoing threat to the community, but that he recognized the \u201cpain and shock\u201d the priest's death had brought to the community of about 2,100 people in northeastern Kansas, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) north of Topeka and about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northwest of Kansas City.",
      "\u201cFr. Carasala was a devoted and zealous pastor who faithfully served our Archdiocese for over twenty years, including as dean of the Nemaha-Marshall region,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHis love for Christ and His Church was evident in how he ministered to his people with great generosity and care. His parishioners, friends, and brother priests will deeply miss him.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- Prosecutors in Atlanta are asking a judge to revoke Young Thug 's probation and send him to prison because of his viral post that sparked an online backlash against the district attorney's office.",
      "The Grammy-winning rapper pleaded guilty in October to gang, drug and gun charges and was released from jail. However, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis said he \u201cengaged in conduct that directly threatens the safety of witnesses and prosecutors, compromises ongoing legal proceedings, and warrants immediate revocation of probation.\u201d",
      "In a court filing on Wednesday, Willis said Young Thug reposted a social media post that included a photo of an investigator in the district attorney's office with a caption that said the investigator is \u201cthe biggest liar in the DA's office.\u201d The post \u201cquickly went viral, amassing over 2 million views, with thousands of comments and retweets.\"",
      "The investigator's home address and that of her parents were posted publicly, and some posts included threats to the investigator and her family, the filing says. One post threatened the assassination of Willis.",
      "\u201cI don't make threats to people I'm a good person,\" Young Thug posted Wednesday night on the social platform X. \"I would never condone anyone threatening anyone or definitely participate in threatening anyone. I'm all about peace and love.\u201d",
      "Brian Steel, an attorney for Young Thug, said in a court filing Thursday that prosecutors' allegations were misleading and that the rapper hadn't done anything to violate his probation.",
      "Young Thug, whose given name is Jeffery Williams, was indicted along with more than two dozen other people in May 2022, accused of violating Georgia's anti-racketeering law. The indictment said the rapper co-founded a violent street gang that committed multiple murders, shootings and carjackings over roughly a decade and promoted its activities in songs and on social media.",
      "A Fulton County Superior Court judge gave him a total sentence of 40 years. The first five years were to be served in prison, but that was commuted to time served. Then he has 15 years on probation. Finally, a \u201cbackloaded\u201d 20 years in prison will be commuted to time served if he complies with all of the conditions of his probation.",
      "If the judge grants the probation revocation, that 20-year prison sentence would take effect.",
      "Prosecutors say the investigator whose photo Young Thug reposted is currently a witness in a \u201cmulti-defendant gang murder\u201d case. The judge explicitly said during a hearing that the investigator was not to be shown on television while testifying, their filing says.",
      "A blogger posted the investigator's photo on social media with the caption, \u201cShe doesn't want to be shown on screen? Well, here she is,\u201d and Young Thug reposted that, prosecutors wrote.",
      "Young Thug's \u201ccontinued association with individuals actively involved in witness intimidation, threats of violence, and obstruction of justice\u201d is a violation of the conditions of his probation, prosecutors wrote.",
      "His lawyer wrote that there's no suggestion the rapper was aware of the judge's order not to show the investigator, and it's not a probation violation to repost an image on social media along with an opinion that the investigator \u201cis untruthful.\u201d",
      "None of the \u201cdirect threats\u201d cited by prosecutors are attributed to Young Thug.",
      "The trial for Young Thug and five others began in November 2023 after it took nearly 10 months to seat a jury. The rapper and three other defendants pleaded guilty in October. A jury in November found the two remaining defendants in the trial not guilty of racketeering, murder and gang-related charges, although one of them was convicted on a gun charge.",
      "Young Thug co-wrote the hit \u201cThis is America\u201d with Childish Gambino, which became the first hip-hop track to win the song of the year Grammy in 2019.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department quietly decided in the final weeks of the Biden administration not to prosecute Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, effectively ending the corruption investigation that cast a long shadow over the political career of a close ally of President Donald Trump, The Associated Press has learned.",
      "The decision not to bring charges \u2014 which has never been publicly reported \u2014 resolved the high-stakes federal probe before Trump's new Justice Department leadership could even take action on an investigation sparked by allegations from Paxton's inner circle that the Texas Republican abused his office to aid a political donor.",
      "The move came almost two years after the Justice Department\u2019s public integrity section in Washington took over the investigation, removing the case from the hands of federal investigators in Texas who had believed there was sufficient evidence for an indictment.",
      "Two people familiar with the matter, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, confirmed the department's decision to decline to prosecute. Though the date of the decision was not immediately clear, it was made in the final weeks of the President Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, one of the people said.",
      "Politically appointed Justice Department leadership was not involved in the decision, which was recommended by a senior career official who had concerns about prosecutors' ability to secure a conviction, according to another person briefed on the matter. Political appointees are not typically involved in public integrity section matters to avoid the appearance of political interference.",
      "One of Paxton\u2019s lawyers, Dan Cogdell, told the AP on Wednesday night that he had not been informed by the Justice Department of any decision in the investigation but noted: \u201cI never thought they had a case they could make.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice declined to comment.",
      "Paxton is weighing a run for the U.S. Senate next year, setting up a potential primary against Republican Sen. John Cornyn, ambitions that reflect his political durability despite spending years under clouds that also included felony securities fraud charges and an investigation by the Texas state bar over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost to Biden.",
      "The federal investigation had been the most serious inquiry still facing Paxton, who settled the securities fraud case and was acquitted of corruption charges in the Texas Senate in 2023 following a historic impeachment. Paxton agreed last year to pay nearly $300,000 in restitution under a deal to end criminal securities fraud charges over accusations that he duped investors in a tech startup near Dallas.",
      "The allegations against Paxton were stunning in part because of who made them.",
      "Eight of his closest aides reported him to the FBI in 2020, accusing him of bribery and abusing his office to help one of his friends and campaign contributors, Nate Paul, who also employed a woman with whom Paxton acknowledged having had an extramarital affair. The same allegations led to Paxton's impeachment on articles of bribery and abuse of public trust, but he was acquitted by the Republican-led Texas Senate, where his wife is a senator but did not cast a vote during the trial.",
      "Paul pleaded guilty in January to a federal charge after he was accused of making false statements to banks to obtain more than $170 million in loans.",
      "\u201cAfter the November election, the DOJ accepted a guilty plea from Nate Paul and is apparently letting Ken Paxton escape justice,\u201d TJ Turner and Tom Nesbitt, attorneys for two of the whistleblowers, said in a statement to the AP. \u201cDOJ clearly let political cowardice impact its decision. The whistleblowers \u2014 all strong conservatives \u2014 did the right thing and continue to stand by their allegations of Paxton\u2019s criminal conduct.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department's public integrity section, which oversees public corruption cases, took over the Paxton investigation in 2023. The Justice Department has never publicly explained its decision to recuse the federal prosecutors in west Texas who had been leading the investigation. The move was pushed for by Paxton\u2019s attorneys.",
      "Paxton said last year that he would not contest whistleblowers' claims in a lawsuit that they were improperly fired for reporting Paxton to the FBI. His push to end the whistleblowers' lawsuit came as he faced the likelihood of having to sit for a deposition and answer questions under oath.",
      "Paxton has become one Trump's most loyal supporters and defenders in recent years, and his name had been floated as a contender to lead the Justice Department under Trump's second term.",
      "Paxton went to court in a show of support last year when Trump stood trial in his New York hush-money case, which ended in a conviction. And he was among several Republican attorneys general who traveled to Washington last month for Trump's campaign-style speech at the Justice Department in which the president vowed retribution for what he described as the \u201clies and abuses that have occurred within these walls.\u201d",
      "There had been investigative activity in the corruption probe as late as last August. Aaron Reitz, who was recently confirmed as Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy, was questioned that month before a grand jury about Paxton's firing of the whistleblowers in 2020, Bloomberg Law reported.",
      "Reitz, who served as a Paxton aide, was asked by members of Congress weighing his Justice Department nomination to detail what he told the grand jury. Reitz declined to answer in a questionnaire sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee in February, stating the federal investigation was ongoing.",
      "\u201cI believe that Attorney General Paxton is innocent and has committed no crimes,\u201d Reitz told the committee.",
      "Grand jury records from 2021 obtained by The Texas Newsroom last year showed that federal authorities were investigating Paxton for several potential crimes, including bribery and witness retaliation. It\u2019s unclear whether the scope or focus of the investigation changed when the public integrity section in Washington took it over.",
      "During Paxton\u2019s impeachment trial, former advisers testified that he pressured them to help the campaign donor, Paul, who was under FBI investigation. The testimony included arguments over who paid for home renovations, whether Paxton used burner phones and how his alleged extramarital affair became a strain on the office. Paxton decried the impeachment effort as a \u201cpolitically motivated sham.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe act of destroying these signs was not just alcohol-lubricated, infantile frat-boy stuff,\u201d said the Rev. William H. Lamar IV, Metropolitan\u2019s pastor.",
      "\u201cThis is a softer version of cross-burning, designed to keep us quiet,\u201d he said.",
      "It was political intimidation, according to Lamar. A judge awarded the church $2.8 million in damages in 2023, condemning the Proud Boys\u2019 \u201chateful and overtly racist conduct.\u201d",
      "In February, after the Proud Boys didn\u2019t pay, the court gave the church use of the group\u2019s name and symbols \u2014 seen on its black-and-yellow gear and laurel wreath logo.",
      "The church can seize money the Proud Boys make through merchandise sales. And the congregation has begun to sell lookalike shirts on its website with lines like \u201cStay Proud, Stay Black.\u201d It plans to offer similar apparel for Pride Month and Juneteenth, with proceeds going to a community justice fund.",
      "Lamar said it\u2019s \u201cour way of leveraging something that was intended for evil.\u201d",
      "Despite the humor and subversion, Lamar sees the lawsuit as part of a long line of civil rights activism that has relied on the courts, from Black women who successfully sued the Ku Klux Klan to lawsuits that pushed desegregation.",
      "\u201cMetropolitan institutionally is doing what Black women and men have always done,\u201d he said, \u201cand that is to use the available means to fight.\u201d",
      "In January, President Trump pardoned members of the Proud Boys who were convicted for their role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Included in that pardon was the group\u2019s former chairman, Enrique Tarrio, who had been serving a 22-year sentence and is a named defendant in the church\u2019s lawsuit.",
      "Two weeks later, when church member Khaleelah Harris heard about the trademark win, her first response was to pray for the safety of Metropolitan, which at one point was paying $20,000 a month for increased security.",
      "\u201cI just hope they don\u2019t touch the church. That was my main concern,\u201d said Harris, who is pursuing ordination within the AME.",
      "\u201cAs overwhelming as this all has been, in a sense, we have no choice,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the legacy of our church.\u201d",
      "Founded in 1838 and part of the nation\u2019s first independent Black denomination, the congregation laid the building\u2019s cornerstone in 1881. AME churches around the country, from Mississippi to Connecticut, paid for its construction as their national cathedral, positioned a half-mile from the White House.",
      "\u201cWashington\u2019s been a very interesting town, because Black people have been able to live lives here that they couldn\u2019t live elsewhere,\u201d Lamar said.

      "Growing up in Macon, Georgia, Lamar first learned about Metropolitan AME from a textbook his mother brought home. Almost 30 years later, he became its pastor.",
      "The decision to sue the Proud Boys was made with a unanimous vote of church leaders, though Wayne Curtis, a Metropolitan member for nearly three decades, is still cautious about the victory, not wanting it to give the Proud Boys more attention. But he said before a Sunday service that \u201cit\u2019s an opportunity to hopefully bring a little more humility to a pretty extreme organization.\u201d",
      "The Proud Boys, though fractured as a movement, resurfaced at Trump\u2019s inauguration. Tarrio, who got five months in jail in part for burning the second church\u2019s banner, suggested on the social platform X after the latest court decision that they change their name to the \u201cAfrican Methodist Episcopal Boys.\u201d His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Even if the Proud Boys change their name, the organization and some members are still indebted to the congregation, whose legal team plans to pursue the money. The Proud Boys have paid $1,500 so far of the judgment, which with interest is at least $3.1 million, according to the church\u2019s attorneys.",
      "\u201cWe will be unrelenting in pursuing justice,\u201d Lamar said. \u201cAnd it is not just for Metropolitan. It is to send a clear signal to anyone who would intimidate any house of worship or any individual of any race, color, creed, or no creed at all.\u201d",

      "Commissioners in a rural New Mexico county say pets are being snatched from front yards and livestock are being killed by endangered Mexican gray wolves, prompting them to consider declaring a state of emergency",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Commissioners in a rural New Mexico county say pets are being snatched from front yards and livestock are being maimed and killed by endangered Mexican gray wolves that seem to have no fear of humans, prompting them to consider declaring a state of emergency.",
      "In the latest flash point over efforts to reintroduce wolves into the western U.S., the commissioners in Catron County are meeting Thursday to consider a resolution that would make available funds to hire more people to investigate the damage reports and help haze the wolves.",
      "\u201cThis is an immediate health and safety hazard to individuals and property,\u201d Catron County commissioners said in a recent news release. \u201cPlease be aware of your surroundings when outdoors at all times. Maintain constant supervision of children and pets. Alert our elderly citizens to take appropriate precautions.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just an issue in rural New Mexico, as officials in parts of Oregon and Northern California say the wolves seem brazen and more livestock is turning up dead. Two California counties have declared emergencies in recent weeks and the sheriff in another recently requested the help of state wildlife officials.",
      "Mexican wolves are the smallest subspecies of gray wolves. Ranchers have been at odds with efforts to reintroduce these more rare gray wolves since the late 1990s when the first captive ones were released into the wild. They have argued that despite meager programs for reimbursing losses, the wolves pose a threat to their own way of life, which is already challenged by prolonged drought and rising prices.",
      "Environmentalists argue that Mexican gray wolves should have a place in the Southwest, often criticizing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for not releasing more captive wolves to ensure genetic diversity among the wild population. They contend there\u2019s no incident in recorded history of a Mexican wolf attacking or injuring a person.",
      "The latest survey of Mexican gray wolves showed there were at least 286 in Arizona and New Mexico, marking the ninth straight year of population growth. The wolf recovery team also reported 99 confirmed livestock kills in 2024, saying that number has been decreasing in recent years. Wildlife managers conducted 290 successful hazing operations last year to scare wolves away from rural homes and livestock.",
      "In the proposed resolution, Catron County states that the culture and customs of residents have been compromised by the wolf reintroduction program. It would request emergency financial aid from the state and asks for the governor to order into service the New Mexico National Guard to support county authorities as needed.",
      "In Oregon, ranchers in Lake County \u2014 home to some of that state\u2019s largest cattle operations \u2014 said they were forced to hire extra workers to patrol their herds around the clock. Some bought night vision goggles to help with the task. That county commission declared a public safety and livestock emergency in February and asked the governor there to help with removing a collared wolf thought to be behind several livestock kills. Wildlife managers ended up killing the wolf after nonlethal efforts failed.",
      "In California, Sierra County declared an emergency on Tuesday, following similar action by Modoc County in mid-March. Neighboring Lassen County also has reported increased wolf activity.",
      "And in Colorado, a group of citizens is gathering petition signatures in hopes of putting the question of wolf reintroductions to voters through a ballot initiative in 2026. Federal wildlife managers in Colorado just recently killed a collared wolf that appeared to have crossed the state line into Wyoming and killed several sheep.",
      "In Montana, lawmakers are considering legislation to extend the wolf hunting season, while state wildlife managers in Idaho allow for limited wolf trapping and snaring as a way to manage the population there.",
      "Gray wolves in the Northern Rockies and beyond have been another source of lawsuits over the years. And those for and against the reintroduction strategy have been waging legal battles with the federal government for decades over the wolves roaming parts of Arizona and New Mexico, with the fate of a management rule and the boundaries of the recovery area pending before a federal appeals court.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government has banned American government personnel in China, as well as family members and contractors with security clearances, from any romantic or sexual relationships with Chinese citizens",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government has banned American government personnel in China, as well as family members and contractors with security clearances, from any romantic or sexual relationships with Chinese citizens",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government has banned American government personnel in China, as well as family members and contractors with security clearances, from any romantic or sexual relationships with Chinese citizens, The Associated Press has learned.",
      "Four people with direct knowledge of the matter told the AP about the policy, which was put into effect by departing U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns in January shortly before he left China. The people would speak only on condition of anonymity to discuss details of a confidential new directive.",
      "Though some U.S. agencies already had strict rules on such relationships, a blanket \u201cnon-fraternization\u201d policy, as it is known, has been unheard of publicly since the Cold War. It\u2019s not uncommon for American diplomats in other countries to date locals and even marry them.",
      "A more limited version of the policy was enacted last summer prohibiting U.S. personnel from \u201cromantic and sexual relations\u201d with Chinese citizens working as guards and other support staff at the U.S. Embassy and five consulates in China. But Burns, the departing ambassador, broadened it to a blanket ban on such relations with any Chinese citizen in China in January, days before President Donald Trump took office. The AP was unable to determine exactly how the policy defined the phrase \u201cromantic or sexual relationship.\"",
      "Two of the people with knowledge of the ban told the AP the new policy was first discussed last summer after members of Congress contacted Burns to express concern that restrictions on such relationships were not stringent enough. The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The new policy covers U.S. missions in mainland China, including the embassy in Beijing and consulates in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang and Wuhan, as well as the American consulate in the semi-autonomous territory of Hong Kong. It does not apply to U.S. personnel stationed outside China.",
      "The only exception to the policy is U.S. personnel with pre-existing relations with Chinese citizens; they can apply for exemptions. If the exemption is denied, they must end the relationship or leave their position, the people said. Anyone who violates the policy will be ordered to leave China immediately.",
      "The policy was communicated verbally and electronically to American personnel in China in January, but has not been publicly announced.",
      "The State Department said it does not comment on internal matters. The National Security Council referred questions to the State Department. Burns, the former ambassador, did not reply to an AP request sent to his email address at The Cohen Group, a consultancy that he rejoined as vice chair in February.",
      "Intelligence services across the world have long used attractive men and women to obtain sensitive information, famously during the Cold War. The State Department and other agencies with offices in China have long had stringent reporting requirements on personal relationships for American personnel stationed there, as well as rivals considered high intelligence threats such as Russia or Cuba.",
      "Declassified State Department documents show that in 1987, the U.S. government barred personnel stationed in the Soviet bloc and China from befriending, dating or having sex with locals after a U.S. Marine in Moscow was seduced by a Soviet spy. Such restrictions were relaxed after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, according to news reports at the time.",
      "In China, a blanket ban on such relations has not been in effect for many years. Until the new ban in January, U.S. personnel in China were required to report any intimate contact with Chinese citizens to their supervisors, but were not explicitly forbidden from sexual or romantic relationships.",
      "U.S. diplomats and intelligence experts say that Beijing continues to aggressively use so-called honeypots to access American secrets. In presentations before being stationed in China, U.S. personnel are briefed on case studies where Chinese intelligence services sent attractive women to seduce American diplomats, and warned that dozens of Chinese state security agents can be assigned to monitor any individual diplomat of interest.",
      "Little is known about the U.S. government\u2019s non-fraternization policies elsewhere, as they are considered classified. It is unknown how restrictive such policies are in other countries.",
      "In recent years, tensions between Washington and Beijing have escalated over trade, technology and geopolitical competition.",
      "Peter Mattis, a former CIA analyst and president of The Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based think tank, said there were at least two publicized cases in which Chinese agents seduced American diplomats stationed in China, though he hasn\u2019t heard of such a case in recent years.",
      "Mattis added that another issue is that Chinese state security doesn\u2019t gather intelligence just through spies, but also by pressing ordinary Chinese people for information, often through threats or intimidation. That, Mattis said, means any Chinese citizen who dates an American diplomat could be vulnerable to coercion.",
      "\u201cThe MSS is willing to leverage any human connection that a target has to collect intelligence,\u201d Mattis said, using an acronym referring to China\u2019s Ministry of State Security. \u201cThis rule change suggests the MSS has gotten a lot more aggressive at trying to access the embassy and U.S. government.\u201d",
      "The Chinese foreign ministry did not comment on the ban, saying in a faxed statement that it was \u201cmore appropriate to ask the U.S. about this question.\u201d",
      "China also has been tightening already strict controls on its personnel overseas, according to Chinese regulations, news reports and four people familiar with China\u2019s bureaucracy who spoke on condition of anonymity so they could discuss a sensitive topic. In recent years, Beijing began strictly enforcing regulations that bar promotions for Chinese civil servants with spouses who acquired foreign citizenship and restrict diplomats from spending an extended period of time in one country, forcing some to return to China.",
      "China\u2019s foreign ministry and many other government bodies bar their officials and staff from sexual or romantic relations with foreign citizens, while members of the Chinese military or police are generally barred from leaving China altogether without express approval from their supervisors.",

      "After President Donald Trump announced a 10% tariff on nearly all UK products, we spoke to businesses from some of Britain's biggest exporters to find out what it could mean for them.",
      "Food and drink: 'We've got fewer orders than normal'",
      "The UK food and drink industry exports a couple of billion pounds worth of goods to the US every year, satisfying Americans's taste for specialist products like smoked salmon, Scotch whisky and artisan cheeses.",
      "Adam Sopher, co-founder and chief executive at Joe & Seph's, the London-based luxury popcorn-maker, says the mere spectre of tariffs had already been affecting the business.",
      "US retailers usually place their orders for Christmas early in the year, but it's had far fewer orders than normal as retailers wait to see what happens.",
      "Joe & Seph's made \u00a38m in sales last year of which 2%-3% came from the US. \"So it is not huge,\" says Mr Sopher. \"But the US is the biggest popcorn market in the world so we had planned that a lot of our growth would come from there.\"",
      "As a consequence, he says, it's now planning to focus on growing its exports to the Middle East and Asia.",
      "However, the 10% tariff was not as bad as he was expecting and US importers aready have to pay a 5.8% tariff on Joe & Seph's goods when they reach American ports.",
      "\"So essentially what's happened is we're going to go from 5.8% to 10% as opposed to zero to 10%,\" says Mr Sopher. It is also lower than the new US tariffs levied on other countries, such as the 20% tax on the European Union.",
      "\"Ironically it could be a good thing,\" he says. \"These retailers who would have sourced from Europe might now say 'actually we'll buy more from the UK.\"",
      "Chemicals: 'We're hoping there is an opportunity'",
      "For something not visible to the naked eye, organic chemicals are a huge US export for the UK, totalling close to \u00a33bn last year.",
      "They are used across a massive range of industries from food to make-up to engines and into agriculture.",
      "Rather than feeling fearful about the US tariff, Robinsons Brothers reckons it may help the West Bromwich-based organic chemicals firm wrestle back American customers from cheaper overseas rivals.",
      "Chief executive Adrian Hanrahan says: \"We supplied a lot more to the US but China and India knocked us out of that because of very low pricing.\"",
      "Under Trump's new regime, China's imports face a 34% tariff while India's products will be taxed at 27%. Robinsons Brothers chemicals are already taxed at 6% when they reach the US",
      "Mr Hanrahan says he is still trying to nail down whether the new 10% US tariff on UK goods means Robinsons Brothers' American customers will be paying an additional 4% or a total 16%.",
      "\"Either way, it is a lot less than China or India will see going into the US,\" he says. \"So I am really hoping and seeing an opportunity for us here in one area.\"",
      "He says that since January, the company has been receiving more enquiries from the US, including two customers Robinsons Brothers lost five years ago \"at great expense\".",
      "At the moment, Robinsons Brothers derives between 1.5% and 2% of total sales - which reached \u00a324m last year - from America.",
      "This \"doesn't seem a lot\" says Mr Hanrahan but they are high margin products.",
      "There are, of course, concerns that rival countries may have to dump products once destined for the US on other markets, such as the UK which, in turn, could drive down domestic prices.",
      "Mr Hanrahan says: \"I am hoping that the UK government is preparing for that and putting something in place to mitigate any form of product dumping in the UK and in the EU.\"",

      "After graduating college Kelsey Krakora worked full time in a steakhouse, bartending and serving meals.",
      "She had dabbled with selling clothes online, but only part-time.",
      "But in 2021 that all changed for Cleveland-based Ms Krakora.",
      "She switched to selling clothes on Whatnot and then Poshmark - online marketplaces where people can also use live video to sell items.",
      "\"My first live show with Poshmark was 27th November 2022. I sold zero things on my first show... but that didn't last long!\"",
      "Now she sells around 100 items per show, worth about $1,000 in sales (\u00a3773).",
      "Her shows are on average three hours long and she does between two and three a week.",
      "\"These events are inclusive, welcoming, you can shop in your PJs, and there's no need to head to the shopping mall,\" says Ms Krakora.",
      "Live shopping has been popular in the Asia-Pacific region for some time, where social networks such as China's Douyin regularly host live shopping streams, but now European and US brands are experimenting with this new way of selling their products.",
      "Live shopping is a close relative to shopping channels like QVC, where viewers are urged to call in and buy the products demonstrated by presenters.",
      "But live shopping acts as a quicker shortcut from buyer to product, especially in the era of one-click purchases, made popular by online retailers such as Amazon.",
      "Also, as younger generations increasingly cut the cord and can't access cable TV, shopping channels don't hold the same relevance as they once did.",
      "It's estimated the live shopping market has reached $32bn, with the most active sectors being fashion, cosmetics and collectibles.",
      "A 2024 survey from digital commerce platform VTEX found that 45% of US consumers have browsed or purchased from live shopping events in the past 12 months.",
      "Guillaume Faure, chief executive of LiveMeUp, which provides live shopping video software, remembers when interest in live shopping surged.",
      "\"When Instagram introduced Reels, and when YouTube launched Shorts, we saw live shopping really take off.\"",
      "He's noticed the popularity of tutorials and how-to videos in live shopping events, such as how hosts can teach shoppers how to apply a certain type of make-up, or arrange a variety of flowers to deliver the most evocative bouquet.",
      "However, some analysts think that live shopping is likely to have a limited appeal.",
      "\"Many companies have tried live shopping but it simply doesn't scale,\" says Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research.",
      "\"Maybe it works in China where they don't have the same kind of store density we have in the US, where it's better for consumers to go and try something on rather than watch a host try on a piece of clothing,\" she adds.",
      "Jonathan Reynolds,  academic director of the Oxford Institute of Retail Management, University of Oxford, also highlights that the Chinese market is different.",
      "\"In China, so-called key opinion leaders (KOLs) like Li Jiaqi, the so-called 'Lipstick King, are well established,\" he says.",
      "\"Li has carefully built his personal brand to demonstrate his expertise and build consumer trust. KOLs are also working within much more sophisticated platform ecosystems,\" Mr Reynolds explains.",
      "Even Ms Krakora admits that not all products work on a live shopping stream.",
      "For example, she prefers to shop for jeans in-person. \"I'm tall, and I have specific cuts of jeans that I wear,\" she says, \"and there are tried-and-true styles and brands I like.\"",
      "Bruce Winder, a retail analyst in Toronto, also says that for some shoppers, the convenience of live shopping might be too attractive.",
      "\"Consumers may get addicted to the show or channel... and some consumers may not be able to stop watching and spending as they get caught up in the moment,\" he adds.",
      "Despite those potential pitfalls, major brands and platforms have jumped on the live shopping bandwagon.",
      "Nordstrom, Kit Kat, Samsung and L'Oreal have sold products during these streams as hosts showcased new or discounted products, and joining Poshmark as the host for these events are Amazon, eBay, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.",
      "\"Live shopping lets shoppers have a conversation with someone who knows the products being sold, and that generates a lot of excitement,\" says Manish Chandra, the chief executive and founder of Poshmark.",
      "\"It also creates a community where other shoppers are in the same show, and it's really a different experience than a traditional shopping trip.\"",
      "For some brands live shopping has been a game-changer.",
      "High-end fragrance brand The House of Amouage partnered with Nordstrom in late 2024 to bring their live shopping events to the US.",
      "Oman-based Amouage was following up on the success they enjoyed in China. In the 140 live streams they hosted with Chinese influencers on the social platforms Douyin and Taobao in 2023, they sold more than 3,000 units.",
      "The firm's chief creative officer Renaud Salmon says it's helping the company learn about what its customers want.",
      "\"In the past, we would have used customer satisfaction surveys,\" says Mr Salmon, \"but with live shopping, we get feedback right away and I bring that back to my team to help refine our products.\"",

      "This is a very real risk.",
      "The tariffs introduced by President Trump amount to the largest such levy to face American consumers in almost a century.",
      "If they do get put in place \u2013 and remain \u2013 there is likely to be a serious dent to the amount bought by Americans, still the world's biggest shoppers, from the rest of the world.",
      "And those who are prepared to fork out for higher prices due to tariffs will have less to spend on other things.",
      "In the event of the retaliation threatened by other countries, American exporters will suffer \u2013 hence the concern that not just the US but the whole global economy, so reliant on trade flows, could slow.",
      "But as you say, the natural inclination is for countries hardest hit \u2013 toymakers from China to apparel manufacturers in Vietnam - to boost sale in other markets.",
      "That might appeal to consumers \u2013 but obviously, could disadvantage businesses in those target markets.",
      "What happens to US products that are made in China?",
      "Mike Heafield, 60, in Preston, asks Senior Technology reporter, Graham Fraser, What happens to products - like the iPhone - that are made in China by US companies?",
      "One eye-catching consequence of the tariffs announcement has been the impact on Apple, with its share price falling 7%.",
      "The US tech giant has large manufacturing bases in some of the countries hit hardest by President Trump's policy - notably China, which faces tariffs of 54%, and Vietnam (46%).",
      "In 2019, when Trump was first in the White House, Apple was given Chinese tariff exemptions. Apple bosses will be hoping to work out a similar deal this time.",
      "The global investment bank Citi said: \"If Apple cannot get exempted this time and assuming Apple gets hit by the accumulative 54% China tariffs and does not pass it through, we estimate about 9% negative impact to the company's total gross margin.\"",
      "In February, Apple committed to invest more than $500bn (\u00a3396bn) in the US over the next four years. At the time, Trump claimed Apple's support for US manufacturing was partially a response to his trade policies, including tariffs.",

      "Paul Miller, in Devon, asks Dharshini David, Deputy Economics editor, about the impact of tariffs on US consumers, and whether the UK could gain from them.",
      "US shoppers could very much be the frontline casualties in this trade war, blighted by higher prices and less choice, regardless of the president's rhetoric.",
      "And that does mean that producers will seek out and take advantage of new markets.",
      "We saw that in the president's first term, when the likes of Vietnam and Malaysia took advantage of the tariffs he imposed on China to increase the amount they sold to America.",
      "Ironically, they consequently are in the firing line now - and so will likely be vying to sell more to the UK \u2013 good for consumers, less so for competing businesses",

      "The tariffs announced by Trump on Wednesday will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US. This means the initial impact of price rises is likely to be on US consumers, if American firms pass on the extra costs.",
      "However, some economists think the tariffs could strengthen the value of the dollar against other currencies. If the pound weakens against the dollar, then UK firms importing goods from the US will face higher costs. This could then lead to higher prices of these goods in UK shops if companies cannot absorb the increased costs themselves.",
      "Also, if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on the extra costs to customers.",
      "However, some economists have suggested prices could also fall as a result of the tariffs.",
      "Swati Dhingra, an economist and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, has suggested that firms which normally send their goods to the US may instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK, potentially leading to a flood of cheaper goods.",

      "Robert and Stephen have mentioned the drop in the value of their pension investments, and the situation will be unsettling for millions of people with any kind of investments.",
      "Experts say that investors have always had to ride economic shocks. Investments, by definition, require a long-term outlook and strategy. So, they are urging people not to panic or make knee-jerk decisions.",

      "Some are referring to a \"Brexit benefit\" because the UK is only subject to 10% tariffs rather than the 20% being slapped on the EU.",
      "Not only will that limit the pain felt by British businesses compared to their European neighbours, but it could present trading opportunities.",
      "UK exporters to America could have a competitive edge, with US importers only facing half the tax by dealing with UK businesses instead of EU businesses.",
      "British firms - and consumers - could also benefit from cheaper goods finding their way here instead of America if the extra costs prove insurmountable.",
      "But, there are concerns about the impact that could have on homegrown industries if cheap products, possibly with lower standards, flood the UK market."

      "The US's formula for the so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" basically just charges a country for having a goods trade surplus with the US, exporting more to America than it imports. Then even if there is no surplus it whacks up the charge at the universal baseline of 10%.",
      "All this reveals two things. The aim of policy is to reduce the US trade deficit to zero. That is a remarkable rerouting of world trade flows and explains the specific punitive focus on Asia.",

      "Explainer: What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them?",
      "US analysis: Trump's tariffs are his biggest gamble yet",
      "For example, the US buys more goods from China than it sells to them - there is a goods deficit of $295bn. The total amount of goods it buys from China is $440bn.",
      "Dividing 295 by 440 gets you to 67% and you divide that by two and round up. Therefore the tariff imposed on China is 34%.",
      "Similarly, when it applied to the EU, the White House's formula resulted in a 20% tariff.",
      "Are the Trump tariffs 'reciprocal'?",
      "Many commentators have pointed out that these tariffs are not reciprocal.",
      "Reciprocal would mean they were based on what countries already charge the US in the form of existing tariffs, plus non-tariff barriers (things like regulations that drive up costs).",
      "But the White House's official methodology document makes clear that they have not calculated this for all the countries on which they have imposed tariffs.",
      "Instead the tariff rate was calculated on the basis that it would eliminate the US's goods trade deficit with each country.",
      "Trump has broken away from the formula in imposing tariffs on countries that buy more goods from the US than they sell to it.",
      "For example the US does not currently run goods trade deficit with the UK. Yet the UK has been hit with a 10% tariff.",
      "In total, more than 100 countries are covered by the new tariff regime.",
      "'Lots of broader impacts'",
      "Trump believes the US is getting a bad deal in global trade. In his view, other countries flood US markets with cheap goods - which hurts US companies and costs jobs. At the same time, these countries are putting up barriers that make US products less competitive abroad.",
      "So by using tariffs to eliminate trade deficits, Trump hopes to revive US manufacturing and protect jobs.",
      "But will this new tariff regime achieve the desired outcome?",
      "BBC Verify has spoken to a number of economists. The overwhelming view is that while the tariffs might reduce the goods deficit between the US and individual countries, they will not reduce the overall deficit between the US and rest of the world.",
      "\"Yes, it will reduce bilateral trade deficits between the US and these countries. But there will obviously be lots of broader impacts that are not captured in the calculation\", says Professor Jonathan Portes of King's College, London.",
      "That's because the US' existing overall deficit is not driven solely by trade barriers, but by how the US economy works.",
      "For one, Americans spend and invest more than they earn and that gap means the US buys more from the world than it sells. So as long as that continues, the US may continue to keep running a deficit despite increasing tariffs with it global trading partners.",
      "Some trade deficits can also exist for a number of legitimate reasons - not just down to tariffs. For example, buying food that is easier or cheaper to produce in other countries' climates.",
      "Thomas Sampson of the London School of Economics said: \"The formula is reverse engineered to rationalise charging tariffs on countries with which the US has a trade deficit. There is no economic rationale for doing this and it will cost the global economy dearly.\"",

    "story": [
      "London Luton Airport said it hoped to almost double annual passenger numbers to 32 million by 2043 after the government approved expansion plans, including a new terminal.",
      "The approval came despite a Planning Inspectorate recommendation that Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander should reject the proposals due to environmental concerns.",
      "Luton Rising, the airport's owner, said the decision could bring \"significant economic, employment and social benefits for our town\".",
      "However, environmental campaigners said \"with climate change worsening, the last thing any of us need is 70,000 more aircraft a year\".",

      "\"This step underlines the government's commitment to unlocking vital infrastructure and backing growth.\"",
      "The expansion decision had been delayed three times, most recently so newly appointed Alexander could have more time to consider the application.",

      "He said this was along with \"additional annual economic activity of up to \u00a31.5bn\".",

      "US President Donald Trump has announced fresh import taxes on goods being imported to America in the latest escalation of the global trade war.",
      "The UK has been hit with a 10% tariff on nearly all of its goods being brought into the US, which Trump says is a retaliation to UK tariffs on American goods, but uncertainty remains over the potential impact on British consumers.",
      "Here's how you and your money could be affected.",
      "1. Prices could go up, but could also go down",
      "The tariffs Trump has just announced will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US.",
      "Clarissa Hahn, economist at Oxford Economics, says this means that the initial impact of price rises will be on US consumers, as American firms are likely to pass on the extra costs to their customers.",
      "However, she adds people in the UK could subsequently be affected by the measures, which come into effect on 5 April.",
      "One way is via the value of the pound and exchange rates, which dictate the cost to  UK businesses importing goods and raw materials from abroad. If import costs go up, these extra costs could be passed on to consumers through higher prices.",
      "Following Trump's speech on Wednesday, exchange rates between the dollar and pound fluctuated. If the value of the dollar strengthens as some economists have predicted, import costs could rise for UK firms importing goods.",
      "Higher prices in the UK could also \"prompt workers to demand higher wages\", which would further raise costs for businesses, according to Ahmet Ihsan Kaya, principal economist, at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.",
      "Ms Hahn adds if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on extra costs to customers.",
      "However, some economists have suggested prices could also initially fall as a result of Trump's decision to impose tariffs.",
      "Swati Dhingra, economist and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, has suggested that firms which normally send their goods to the US, may instead send them to countries such as the UK which don't have such steep tariffs, potentially leading to a flood of cheaper goods in the UK.",
      "\"Tariffs of the proposed magnitude are likely to prompt firms that export to the US to lower their prices to retain demand for their products,\" she suggests.",

      "The countries hit hardest by new US tariffs - Trump's plan at a glance",
      "How were Donald Trump's tariffs calculated?",
      "2. It could affect your job",
      "British companies exporting goods to the US are set to be the hardest hit from the latest measures.",
      "The UK exported almost \u00a360bn worth of goods to the US last year, mainly machinery, cars and pharmaceuticals. Other industries, which are big exporters to the US, include fishing and electronics.",
      "If US demand for UK products dwindles due to the extra charges importers face, this could hit profit margins and ultimately lead to UK job cuts unless British firms find new customers outside the US.",
      "According to the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank, Jaguar Land Rover and the Mini factory in Cowley, Oxford, appear to be the most exposed to US tariffs on cars.",
      "It says more than 25,000 jobs in the UK car manufacturing industry \"could be at risk\" with a 25% tariff coming into effect on Thursday, with one in eight UK-built cars exported to the US.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry is also heavily reliant on trade with the US, says Ms Hahn, of Oxford Economics.",
      "The US makes up 40% of AstraZeneca's sales and 50% of GSK's. Although both British-headquartered firms have manufacturing facilities in America, raw ingredients for life-saving medicines and vaccines travel between the UK, EU and US. Under tariffs the firms could be hit with multiple tax charges as they cross borders to be developed.",
      "There is also the issue of how tariffs work when they collide with pricing caps that both the NHS and other health organisations set for buying drugs in bulk.",
      "3. Interest rates may stay higher for longer",
      "UK interest rates dictate the costs households have to pay to borrow money for things such as mortgages, credit cards and loans. Higher rates also boost returns for savers.",
      "They are currently at 4.5%, but economists are predicting two more rate cuts by the end of the year.",
      "However, the Bank of England highlighted US tariffs as a reason why it avoided cutting rates further last month, saying economic and global trade uncertainty had \"intensified\".",
      "If prices are pushed up for long enough to affect the rate of inflation - this could mean interest rates stay higher for longer.",
      "Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, said it was Bank's job \"to make sure that inflation stays low and stable\" and that would be \"looking very closely\" at the impact of tariffs."

    "summary": "Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs have shaken global trade, but can India turn disruption into opportunity?",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs have shaken global trade, but disruption often creates opportunity.",
      "Starting 9 April, Indian goods will face tariffs of up to 27% (Trump's tariff chart lists India's rate as 26%, but the official order says 27% - a discrepancy seen for other nations too). Before the tariff hike, US rates across trading partners averaged 3.3%, among the lowest globally, compared to India's 17%, according to the White House.",
      "However, with the US imposing even higher tariffs on China (54%), Vietnam (46%), Thailand (36%) and Bangladesh (37%), India \"presents an opportunity\" in textiles, electronics and machinery, according to the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).",
      "High tariffs on Chinese and Bangladeshi exports open space for Indian textile manufacturers to expand in the US market. While Taiwan leads in semiconductors, India can tap into packaging, testing and lower-end chip manufacturing - if it strengthens infrastructure and policy support. Even a partial supply chain shift from Taiwan, driven by 32% tariffs, could work in India's favour.",
      "Live updates: Reaction to Trump's tariffs announcementAt a glance: The countries hit hardest by these plansExplainer: What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them?Analysis: Trump's tariffs are his biggest gamble yet",
      "Live updates: Reaction to Trump's tariffs announcement",
      "At a glance: The countries hit hardest by these plans",
      "Explainer: What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them?",
      "Analysis: Trump's tariffs are his biggest gamble yet",
      "Machinery, automobiles and toys - sectors led by China and Thailand - are ripe for tariff-driven relocation. India can capitalise by attracting investment, scaling production and boosting exports to the US, according to a note by GTRI.",
      "But will India be able to seize the moment?",
      "High tariffs have increased costs for companies dependent on global value chains, hobbling India's ability to compete in international markets. Despite growing exports - primarily driven by services - India runs a significant trade deficit. India's share of global exports is a mere 1.5%. Trump has repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties. With his new tariffs, the fear is that Indian exports will be less competitive.",
      "\"Overall, the US's protectionist tariff regime could act as a catalyst for India to gain from global supply chain realignments,\" says Ajay Srivastava of GTRI.",
      "\"However, to fully leverage these opportunities, India must enhance its ease of doing business, invest in logistics and infrastructure and maintain policy stability. If these conditions are met, India is well-positioned to become a key global manufacturing and export hub in the coming years.\"",
      "That's easier said than done. Biswajit Dhar, a trade expert from the Delhi-based Council for Social Development think tank, points out that countries like Malaysia and Indonesia are possibly better positioned than India.",
      "\"We may regain some lost ground in garments now that Bangladesh faces higher tariffs, but the reality is we've treated garments as a sunset sector and failed to invest. Without building capacity, how can we truly benefit from these tariff shifts?\" says Mr Dhar.",
      "Since February, India has ramped up efforts to win Trump's favour - pledging $25bn in US energy imports, courting Washington as a top defence supplier and exploring F-35 fighter deals. To ease trade tensions, it scrapped the 6% digital ad tax, cut bourbon whiskey tariffs to 100% from 150% and slashed duties on luxury cars and solar cells. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's Starlink nears final approval. The two countries have launched extensive trade talks to narrow the US's $45bn trade deficit with India.",
      "Yet, India did not escape the tariff war.",
      "\"India should be concerned - there was hope that ongoing trade negotiations would shield it from reciprocal tariffs. Facing these tariffs now is a serious setback,\" says Abhijit Das, former head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade.",
      "One upside: pharmaceuticals are exempt from reciprocal tariffs, a relief for India's generic drug makers. India supplies nearly half of all generic medicines in the US, where these lower-cost alternatives account for 90% of prescriptions.",
      "However, exports in key sectors like electronics, engineering goods - automobile parts, industrial machines - and marine products could take a hit. It would be especially troubling for electronics, given the heavy investments through India's flagship \"production-linked incentives\" (PLI) schemes to boost local manufacturing.",
      "\"I'm apprehensive about our exporters' capacity - many are small manufacturers who will struggle to absorb a 27% tariff hike, making them uncompetitive. High logistical costs, rising business expenses and deteriorating trade infrastructure only add to the challenge. We're starting at a major disadvantage,\" says Mr Dhar.",
      "Many see these tariffs as Trump's bargaining chip in trade negotiations with India. The latest US Trade Representative report underscores Washington's frustration with India's trade policies.",
      "Released on Monday, the report flags India's strict import rules on dairy, pork and fish, requiring non-GMO certification without scientific backing. It also criticises India's sluggish approval process for genetically modified products and price caps on stents and implants.",
      "Intellectual property concerns have landed India on the 'Priority Watch List', for which the report cites weak patent protections and a lack of trade secret laws. The report also frets about data localisation mandates and restrictive satellite policies, straining trade ties further. Washington fears India's regulatory approach is increasingly mirroring China's. If these barriers were removed, US exports could rise by at least $5.3bn annually, according to the White House.",
      "\"The timing couldn't be worse - being in the middle of trade negotiations only deepens our disadvantage. This isn't just about market access; it's the whole package,\" says Mr Dhar. Also, gaining an edge over Vietnam or China won't happen overnight - building opportunities and competitive strength takes time."

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has announced and imposed a range of tariffs - or import taxes - on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump declared a national economic emergency and announced tariffs on goods from every country of at least 10%. For countries he has deemed the \"worst offenders\", the rates can go as high as 50%. The 10% tariffs will take effect on 5 April, and the higher ones on 9 April.",
      "Canada and Mexico are currently exempted from these charges - but they, along with China, were already facing tariffs on some products. And the Trump administration has now expanded existing steel and aluminium tariffs to include beer and empty cans, which could hit both countries hard.",
      "On top of that, on Thursday, 25% tariffs on automobiles coming into the US will come into effect. Tariffs on certain car parts are set to start in May or later.",
      "Economists have warned these levies - and those introduced in response by other countries - could push prices up for American consumers.",
      "That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.",
      "So which things could become more expensive?",
      "Cars",
      "The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade.",
      "Most analysts estimate that the auto tariffs will add thousands of dollars to the prices of new cars in the US, which reached a record average of $49,738 in December, according to Cox Automotive. As competition for used cars increases, so could the prices paid for them.",
      "Even for cars made in the US, prices will probably rise.",
      "Many US car companies also have operations in Mexico and Canada, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between them.",
      "Component parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.",
      "The new tariffs on car parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt for now while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties.",
      "Anderson Economic Group has estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by roughly $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle.",
      "Experts say these costs are likely to be passed on to customers, though Trump himself has said he \"couldn't care less\" if that happens as he believes it will encourage Americans to buy American-made cars instead.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Beer, whisky and tequila",
      "Popular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.",
      "Modelo, and many foreign-made beers, will also be affected by the expanded aluminium tariff which will include canned beers starting on 4 April. Most of the beverage in the US - 64.1% - is poured out of cans, according to the Beer Institute.",
      "Meanwhile, representatives from the American, Canadian, and Mexican spirit industries argued in a joint statement that drinks like bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila, and Canadian whisky \"can only be produced in their designated countries\".",
      "So, given they have to be made in those locations, supplies might be affected, leading to price rises.",
      "Trump has also threatened a 200% tariff on alcohol from the EU, which could make Spanish wine, French champagne, or German beer more expensive for Americans, though it is not clear if this will be carried out.",
      "Houses",
      "The US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs.",
      "Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".",
      "However, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.",
      "\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.",
      "Imports from the rest of the world could also be affected.",
      "On 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production.",
      "Findings are due towards the end of 2025.",
      "Maple syrup",
      "Canada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of global production.",
      "The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.",
      "\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" said Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.",
      "\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.",
      "Fuel prices",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil.",
      "According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.",
      "While the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%.",
      "The US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called \"heavier\" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.",
      "\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.",
      "That means if Canada decided to reduce crude oil exports in retaliation against US tariffs, it could push up fuel prices.",

    "story": [
      "Heathrow Airport was warned about the \"resilience\" of its power supply in the days before a fire which shut down the airport for more than a day last month.",
      "Nigel Wicking, chief executive of Heathrow Airline Operators' Committee, a group representing airlines, told MPs on Wednesday that he spoke to Heathrow twice in the week before the closure on 21 March.",
      "He questioned why the airport was closed as long as it was and why it was not more prepared considering its importance.",
      "However, Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye called the fire an \"unlikely event\" and defended the length of the closure, saying he had to make \"very serious safety decisions\".",
      "Mr Woldbye apologised to the more than 300,000 passengers whose journeys were disrupted.",
      "He offered his \"deepest regrets\" adding that the \"situation was unprecedented\". The airport was shutdown after a fire at an electrical substation.",
      "The chaos at Heathrow has raised concerns about the reliability of the major transport hub - and brought into question the UK's energy resilience more broadly.",
      "Power concerns",
      "Speaking to MPs on the transport committee, Mr Wicking said he raised cases of \"theft of wire and cable around some of the power supply\" which he said temporarily took out runway lights, which are critical to passenger safety.",
      "\"I wanted to understand better the overall resilience of the airport.\"",
      "He said he had spoken to the Team Heathrow director on 15 March about his concerns - six days before the fire - and the chief operating officer and chief customer officer on 19 March - two days before the fire.",
      "Mr Woldbye said the airport had to rely on contracts it has with Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks for making the network resilient, and to improve that \"comes at a very high cost\", which would raise costs for airlines, and passengers.",
      "However, Mr Wicking said Heathrow is \"already the most expensive airport in the world\".",
      "\"From an airline perspective, we expect resilience, we expect there to be the capability there and the understanding of when a power supply or an asset is not available, what will you do next, and how quickly will you bring it back?\"",
      "On the day of the shutdown, airlines had to divert 120 aircraft, which is \"not a light decision to be made in any context\", Mr Wicking added.",
      "As a consequence, when Mr Wicking joined a call with NATs, the national air traffic service, at 05:30, \"they'd run out of space within the UK for aircraft to divert\".",
      "\"Aircraft were then going to Europe, and then some were even halfway across Europe and going back to base in India,\" he said. \"So, quite a level of disruption for those passengers, let alone all of the cancellations\".",
      "There were 1,300 cancelled flights, he said.",
      "The airport reopened on the Saturday following the fire.",
      "When asked why it had not reopened sooner, Mr Woldbye said that could have meant passengers got hurt.",
      "He said: \"If we had got this wrong, we might be sitting here today having a very different discussion about why people got injured, and I think it would have been a much more serious discussion.",
      "\"So there is a margin within which our people have to take very serious safety decisions, and that is what they are trained for, that is what they do, and that requires that every single system is up and running, tested and safe.\"",
      "However, Mr Wicking said Terminal 5 could have reopened sooner.",
      "He said: \"In terms of T5, my understanding both from British Airways but also on the day, was that pretty much everything was fine to operate by mid-morning, by 10 o'clock.\"",
      "'Losing power'",
      "After the substation fire began on the Thursday night, Mr Woldbye said Heathrow realised \"during the early hours\" of Friday 21 March that \"we were losing power to the airport\".",
      "\"In our operations centre you would seen all the red lights go, that the systems were powering down,\" he said. \"We had no information as to why.\"",
      "\"We then had a slightly later stage call from the fire department that the substation was on fire,\" he said.",
      "Heathrow is supplied by three substations, but knocking out one caused the airport to shut down.",
      "Mr Woldbye said a third of the airport was powering down and that Terminal 2 was particularly affected, along with certain central systems. He added that it became \"first and foremost a safety situation\".",
      "\"We need to make sure, when a crisis happens, that people are safe,\" he said.",
      "The safest way to proceed was to shut down airport systems, then bring them back on line, he said.",
      "The first priority was to check that no-one been caught in lifts or was hurt.",
      "Safety critical systems such as runway lighting and the control tower \"switched in as they should\", however, he said.",
      "The government has backed plans for Heathrow to build a third runway as part of efforts to boost UK economic growth.",
      "The airport would need double the amount of power for its expansion plans, Mr Woldbye said.",
      "However, Mr Wicking said airlines, which support expansion, nevertheless had concerns that it would cost \u00a340bn to \u00a360bn, and that the costs would ultimately be passed onto passengers in the form of higher fees.",
      "The danger was the expansion could turn into a \"white elephant\", he said."

    "summary": "Gothenburg has to pay a financial penalty if it misses certain annual sustainability goals.",
    "story": [
      "Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.",
      "Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.",
      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",
      "\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"",
      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",
      "Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.",
      "\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.",
      "\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.",
      "\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"",
      "But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.",
      "\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.",
      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",
      "Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.",
      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",
      "By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.",
      "\"If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.",
      "\"It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.\"",
      "Back in Gothenburg, the city's current environmental and social targets run until 2030. Mr Block says that the detailed yearly SLL reporting shows to potential future investors in the city what a difference their money would make.",
      "\"Banks want to give money to sustainable cities, so packaging up our progress in our SLL reporting is how I make the city beautiful for investors,\" he says.",
      "\"I can't change the credit worthiness of the city, but I can change how investors look at our sustainability work, and make it more attractive to them.\"",

      "It is a vertically capable aircraft, or Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, which means it can take off like a helicopter.",
      "It also has two fixed wings that allows it to take off and land from a runway.",
      "The company claims the Axe has a top speed of 100mph, it can carry up to 172kg - approximately the weight of two 13.5st adults - and has a range of 100 miles, about the distance from Oxford to the Isle of Wight.",
      "The team, based near Banbury in Oxfordshire, has taken five years to fine tune the design.",
      "\"Compared to a conventional aircraft it's got eight motors which is very strange,\" says Dr Bill Brooks, Skyfly's chief technical engineer.",
      "\"And it's a tail-first layout called a canard so it's got the tail at the front.  The all up weight is 750kg but 240kg of that are batteries so all the structure is carbon fibre to keep it as light as possible,\" Dr Brooks says.",
      "Safety is an important part of the design too.",
      "'Environmental benefits'",
      "The large wings help it to glide in the event of power failure and there are two motors at the end of each wing so that if one fails the other can compensate.",
      "It is also equipped with an emergency ballistic parachute to bring the aircraft and passengers down safely.",
      "As well as being safer and cleaner than conventional aircraft, Michael Thompson, Skyfly's chief executive, says electric models are significantly quieter too.",
      "\"When you're taking off, you're no longer annoying everyone around you from a noise perspective, so I do think electric propulsion brings not only environmental benefits but from a noise pollution point of view, it's a huge benefit as well,\" he says.",
      "Who is it marketed at?",
      "Other eVTOLs under development include those looking to provide an electric flying-taxi service like Bristol-based Vertical Aerospace (VA) .",
      "VA, as well as Archer and Joby in the US, are designing electric powered aircraft to carry up to four passengers.",
      "Skyfly's Axe, by comparison, is more compact and aimed at the private market.",
      "The do-it-youself kit-plane comes with a price tag of \u00a3250,000.",
      "It is aimed at existing pilots who want to transition away from diesel piston engines.",
      "Jason Pritchard, executive editor of eVTOL Insights, says it is also likely to appeal to flying clubs in order to train new members:",
      "\"The eVTOL aircraft industry is still in its infancy with initial operations a few years away, but it also needs to train large numbers of pilots in the coming years,\" he says.",
      "\"Additionally, the Axe's design can also train pilots with the skills and controls necessary to land an aircraft without power, which is a necessary tool.\"",
      "What about charging infrastructure?",
      "While the Axe can be charged up overnight with a conventional three-pin plug, just like EV cars, electric aircraft will need the charging infrastructure to be scaled up.",
      "Aerovolt, based in West Sussex, has installed rapid chargers at seven UK airports with 40 more in the pipeline.",
      "Its founder, Philip Kingsley-Dobson, says demand is growing.",

      "That came two months after Sainsbury's said it was closing all 61 of its supermarket cafes.",
      "While some see the decline of supermarket cafes as inevitable, shoppers around the country have told BBC News that these cafes give them a cheap, convenient and welcoming place to get a warm meal while catching up with friends.",

      "Morrisons says 344 of its cafes will remain open despite the planned closures but, according to its chief executive Rami Baiti\u00e9h, \"a minority have specific local challenges and in those locations, regrettably, closure and re-allocation of the space is the only sensible option\".",
      "Elsewhere in the country, Ben Hopkins, 32, feels his local Morrisons cafe in Meltham, West Yorkshire, is bustling every time he goes because \"the food is typical of that you'd get in a traditional greasy spoon\".",

      "Last month the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) found \"no criminal offences were committed\" by Mr Whale, but he was still guilty of serious professional misconduct.",
      "The body found Mr Whale told the pupil he loved her, picked her up from school and took her to the cinema, restaurants and theme parks.",
      "The agency's panel found he did not tell the school because he knew it was an \"inappropriate\" relationship and \"would lead to disciplinary proceedings\".",
      "Mr Whale briefly led the PE department at the school, now known as King's Academy Easthampstead Park, the TRA said.",
      "Mr Whale told it that \"the level of maturity I possessed as an individual at this time was clearly not one capable of managing the responsibility of the situation I had been placed in\".",
      "He said that was \"by far and away the greatest driving factor in me leaving [teaching] nearly 20 years ago\" and that he \"will always be genuinely sorry\" for \"the upset, impact and personal detriment\" he caused.",
      "Mr Whale added: \"I am also a very different person from the immature individual that encouraged, facilitated and allowed this situation to occur.\"",

If we take a reasonable approach to things and say things are nuanced, nobody engages. And then we go and say something outrageous and offensive and everyone's into it.\"",

The US is at a record low of 1.62 children per woman, and by the end of the century the UN projects a majority of countries will have a shrinking population. That will have a profound effect on society and our economies. Some people believe we can adapt over time to this new reality, but pronatalists are less sanguine.",

      "So, could this fringe group really gain the ear of some of the most powerful people in the US government? And if so, just how much soft power could they have to influence policy not only around population decline but about wider issues too?",
      "Vance, Musk and the 'Fertilisation President'",
      "Last weekend, a group of roughly 200 pronatalists congregated in Texas for the second Natal Conference, an annual weekend-long event that cost around $1,000 (\u00a3775) to attend.",
      "The conference brings together two strands in pronatalism that come from very different branches of the American right: both conservative Christians and members of the so-called 'tech right,' an ascendant wing that came out of the libertarian, start-up culture of Silicon Valley.",
      "Some are connected to the current US government. Michael Anton was appointed by Trump as the Director of Policy Planning at the State Department. He spoke at last year's conference.",
      "Other speakers at this year's conference included Carl Benjamin, who has links to far-right activist Tommy Robinson, and Charles Cornish-Dale, an influencer who goes by the name Raw Egg Nationalist.",
      "\"It's like an unholy alliance,\" says Catherine Pakaluk, an economist, mother of eight and stepmother of six. She too spoke at the conference but is reluctant to call herself a pronatalist. \"It's a complicated movement and includes people with very different positions,\" she says.",
      "One thing they have in common, however, is that they all want their message to be heard at the highest levels of government.",
      "Some believe they already are being heard. \"[If you ask me] do we have pronatalists in the White House right now who are pushing policy,\" says Malcolm, \"my response to this would be, 'I mean, duh, like Elon and JD Vance'.\"",
      "In President Trump's executive orders to date, there has been little apart from the order on IVF that could be seen as directly pro-family. But pronatalist thinking may be starting to influence policy that is less explicitly about fertility.",
      "In January, the US transportation secretary Sean Duffy circulated a memo instructing his department to \"give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average\" when awarding grants.",
      "Roger Severino, Vice-President of Domestic Policy at right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation, sees the influence of JD Vance in that policy. \"Vance comes at it from a long history of pro-family thinking and policymaking,\" he says.",
      "Vance has often spoken about the need to fix a \"broken culture\" that is tearing the US family apart, by undermining men.",
      "In a recent interview, he said: \"We actually think God made male and female for a purpose and we want you guys to thrive as young men and young women and we're going to help with our public policy to make it possible to do that.\"",
      "This idea has been echoed in pronatalist circles.",
      "\"Vance is a vocal pronatalist,\" says Rachel Cohen, policy correspondent at Vox. \"Trump himself campaigned on implementing a new \"baby boom\" and last week he declared himself the 'fertilisation president'.\"",
      "The pronatalists drafting DIY executive orders",
      "Malcolm says he has already made attempts to influence the White House. He claims to have engaged in \"backroom channelling of influential people, making sure that pronatalism became normal to talk about within the centres of power, and that ended up dripping its way up to administration and core tech culture\".",
      "They are in discussions on pronatalist policy with the Heritage Foundation. Then there is a rather more direct approach they claim to have taken. \"We have submitted draft executive orders to the Trump administration,\" says Simone.",
      "Their proposals include suggestions for how to remove layers of regulation from childcare providers and expanding car seat choice so cars can fit more children.",
      "The couple aren't sure if those are going to translate into anything concrete just yet \u2013 but they believe they have a receptive audience.",
      "Their connection to power is thanks to the so-called tech right, a reactionary movement against liberalism led by some of the most powerful people in Silicon Valley. Those in the tech right include Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel \u2013 who sponsored Vance's Senate race and has invested in fertility technology \u2013 and venture capitalists David Sacks and Marc Andreessen.",
      "Simone Collins was formerly the managing director of an exclusive members' club run by Mr Thiel, and the couple say they ran two other invite-only networking groups for business elites. Their Pronatalist Foundation, founded in 2021, received just under $500,000 (\u00a3387,000) through a fund of the Skype co-founder, Estonian billionaire Jann Tallinn.",
      "\"The tech right bring a lot of energy to the discussion,\" says Roger Severino, Vice-President of Domestic Policy at the Heritage Foundation. \"We've been discussing how we could blend these various strains on the right. We're trying to cohere the movement.\"",
      "Cracks in the pronatalist alliance",
      "There are, however, cracks in the alliance which add to the challenge of trying to make the movement \u201ccoherent\u201d.",
      "Many on the traditional religious right have misgivings about the use of IVF and disagree with embryo screening, while some also oppose gay marriage and parenthood.",
      "\"It's just an odd alliance of people who seem to agree on this one point: that the birth rate is too low. But there are wildly different prescriptions and ideas about what might be done to fix it,\" says Ms Pakaluk.",
      "\"There's a renewed interest in pronatalism and family promotion among American conservatives,\" says Timothy Carney, author of Family Unfriendly, How our Culture Made Raising Kids Much Harder than it Needs to Be. But he adds: \"There will definitely be tensions.\"",
      "One of those most divisive issues in pronatalism are the mention of certain aspects related to genetics among some of its tech right proponents. It's something that has prompted concern, in particular around the ethics of this, on all sides of the political spectrum.",
      "Patrick T Brown, a fellow at the right-leaning American Ethics and Public Policy Centre working on pro-family policy, suggests that the executive order to improve access to IVF could show the influence of the tech-right on policy. But he has his concerns about that influence, particularly around embryo screening. \"Turning children into consumer products is something that I really worry about,\" he says. \"That leads to a troublesome place.\"",
      "Some of those attending the recent conference describe themselves as \"race realists\", and one has published offensive views alleging a link between intelligence and race that, according to many scientists, are plain wrong.",
      "Geneticist Adam Rutherford describes the data used as \"fraudulent and racist, drawn from hopeless sample sizes that wouldn't constitute valid scientific evidence to anyone vaguely interested in truth.",
      "\"These assertions are recapitulations of historical ideas of scientific racism.\"",
      "The associations with extreme views in the movement is one of the reasons some people don't like to call themselves pronatalists. Catherine Pakaluk is one of them. \"I think there probably are some people who are just pure eugenicists or white supremacists,\" she says.",
      "\"I find it disgusting and reprehensible and I have no interest in ever being aligned with people like that.\"",
      "Could controversy translate into soft power?",
      "The question that remains is, where does all of this leave pronatalists - and just how much power do they wield?",
      "According to some onlookers, their impact is already being felt. \"There's definitely strong influence from pronatalists in the Trump White House,\" claims Ms Cohen. \"I think an outstanding question is how this will all overlap with efforts to restrict birth control and contraception, and how this will affect debates around spending like on childcare funding.\"",
      "Mr Carney is more circumspect: \"Vance is very pro-family and very pronatalist, and he wants the government to promote families and to help drive up the birth rate - but JD Vance is not the president. I don't think Donald Trump has firm conviction on this.\"",
      "He also believes there might be resistance to some pro-family policies, pointing out that at least some of the Republicans in control of Congress don't like the idea of family support. \"They think that it's welfare to the undeserving.\"",
      "The attention gleaned by the Collinses, and by the recent conference, is undoubtable. But one expert suggests they are doing little more than stirring up controversy.",
      "\"If you go to Capitol Hill, and talk to members of Congress or governors in states across America, they don't necessarily even recognise the problem,\" argues Mr Brown.",
      "As he puts it, \"the incentives of the internet\" aren't always the incentives of a successful mass movement. \"And what gets attention is provocation and being edgy and crossing the line. That gets clicks, that gets followers.",
      "\"[But] that to me is not how you end up changing the political dynamics.\"",

      "1. Shop around",
      "For some services you can often get a better deal simply by calling the company you are with and saying you are considering leaving.",
      "\"Shop around for better deals, and haggle with your existing provider,\" says Alice Haine, from professional services group Evelyn Partners.",

      "\"Our research shows that switching providers if you're out of contract can slash broadband, pay TV and mobile bills by up to \u00a3235,\" says Emily Seymour, from consumer group Which?",
      "Gas and electricity are often the biggest bills people face and the price cap set by the regulator is rising by 6%, so it is worth finding the best deal for you.",
      "That may include choosing a fixed rate deal, says Ms Seymour. If you charge an electric vehicle or use appliances overnight, look for a deal with a cheaper night tariff.",
      "\"We'd also recommend taking a meter reading as close to 31 March as possible to ensure you're billed the correct amount for your energy usage,\" she says.",
      "2. Cut back",
      "One surefire way to keep your bills down is to reduce what you use.",
      "Taking shorter showers and putting in a showerhead with a slower flow will save money on your water and energy bills.",
      "\"You have to treat water as an expensive resource,\" Ms Haine says.",
      "Getting a water meter fitted may save you money, she adds.",
      "Smart meters for electricity and gas can also help you keep tabs on what is pushing up your energy bills most, the Energy Saving Trust says.",
      "The trust advises draught-proofing your home, including round floorboards, pipework and old extractor fans, and setting the thermostat to the lowest comfortable temperature. For most people, it says, that is between 18\u00b0C and 21\u00b0C.",
      "MoneySavingExpert says you can save money by using the principle: \"heat the human, not the home\". Using hot water bottles and electric blankets should work out cheaper than turning up the radiators.",
      "You can also change the settings on combi or conventional boilers to save money, says Martin Lewis at MoneySavingExpert.",
      "When it comes to transport bills, you can't avoid the vehicle tax rise unless you ditch the car altogether.",
      "But if you are taking the train it is also worth checking whether a railcard will help, points out Ms Seymour.",
      "\"To cut costs on rail fares, we'd recommend booking tickets in advance and splitting fares where possible,\" she says.",
      "3. Get help",
      "If you are struggling to pay your household bills, don't panic, says Richard Lane, chief client officer at the StepChange Debt Charity. He suggests creating a detailed budget that captures all your income and expenditure.",
      "\"This will allow you to get a clear picture of your finances and see how much you have leftover to pay toward any debts or make savings,\" he says.",
      "Then check what support you are entitled to.",
      "Water companies offer lower \"social\" and hardship tariffs for people on very low incomes, so it is worth calling your provider. People claiming benefits can often also get lower tariffs for broadband.",
      "\"These organisations have a regulatory responsibility to treat customers fairly and will be able to offer you tailored support,\" Mr Lane added.",
      "There is the government's Warm Home Discount, for people with high energy costs on a very low income, including Pension Credit. And people on low incomes are also eligible for a reduction in council tax.",
      "Check if you qualify for a free TV licence. If you are over 75 and on Pension Credit or live with someone who is, then you will.",
      "You may also be able to boost your income. Check which benefits you are entitled to on the independent MoneyHelper website, backed by the government, or using benefits calculators run by Policy in Practice and charities Entitledto and Turn2us.",
      "If you are struggling with debt here are some other organisations that may be able to help."

      "A companion album, Autumn Variations, released later the same year, fared even worse.",

    "story": [
      "The director of a new film set in a sweltering London over 24 hours on A-Level results day says that the city he grew up in is now \"inaccessible\" to many Gen Z young adults.",
      "Last Swim, Sasha Nathwani's first feature film, is the story of an ambitious British Iranian teen, Ziba (played by Deba Hekmat), who, along with her group of friends savours a day of total freedom, as well as experiencing tough decisions and heartbreak, before the group go their separate ways after school.",
      "The director tells the BBC that \"the film was developed and made by Millennials, but it's a Gen Z coming of age story\".",
      "He says his interest in making the film was exploring the idea of lost youth and that the script, co-written by producer Helen Simmons, was written at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, although filmed after restrictions ended.",
      "\"It's not a pandemic film,\" he says, \"but it was developed during that time when young people from all over the world were having the seminal years of their lives taken away.",
      "\"When Helen and I were writing it, the world was opening up and closing down, then opening up and closing down again. There was this pressure, and I remember seeing young people in the park, and thinking how must it be for them?",
      "\"They all live with their parents, they've only got one day together, and tomorrow the world's going to close down again.",
      "\"So the question I was trying to pose with the film was, if you had one day to reclaim your youth, what would you do?\"",
      "Nathwani, who's previously directed music videos as well as short films, says that it's his belief things have worsened for the young after Covid-19.",
      "\"I felt that the world was fraught when we were making it, when we were writing it, and now it's going out into the world, there's an argument that things are even worse now,\" he says.",
      "\"When I was 17 or 18, growing up in London, the city didn't feel inaccessible. It felt accessible, and I didn't feel like doors were being closed in my face.",
      "\"Now I don't even know how a young person has a 24-hour period of freedom without breaking the bank.\"",
      "He added: \"We're in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. Not only do things cost so much, but there just aren't opportunities. Education is challenging for lots of different reasons, and some people don't have access because of the exorbitant costs.",
      "\"You see that in the film, as Ziba and her friends are going their separate ways.\"",
      "Anxious about the future",
      "A 2023 study from Oxford University found that the mental health of young people had deteriorated during the UK's three Covid-19 lockdowns, compared with a similar study conducted before the pandemic.",
      "And the latest ONS (Office for National Statistics) figures found that around one in seven 16-24 year olds were not in work, education or training between October-December 2024.",
      "Figures from the King's Trust charity from February 2025 found that most of the 16-25 year olds it had surveyed felt anxious about the future on a daily basis.",
      "Most of the cast members of Last Swim are Gen Z, although Gangs of London actress Narges Rashidi also stars in the story, as Ziba's mother.",
      "Lead star Hekmat, a Kurdish British model and actor, was aged 21 when the film was made.",
      "\"As a generation, there have been things thrown at us, but also taken away,\" she says.",
      "\"That's true of me, but when I look at my brothers, that's when my heart really goes out to the young. My brothers just turned 18 and 20 years old, they were going through adolescence during Covid, there so many changes in their personal and school life anyway, and then for all of that to happen.",
      "\"We're all still regrouping and refiguring ourselves out.\"",
      "'Gen Z friendship'",
      "Filmed in the UK heatwave of 2022, Last Swim takes Ziba and her group of friends through well-known spots of London such as Portobello Road, Hampstead Heath and Primrose Hill by car, bike and train.",
      "Industry publication Screen Daily said the film was \"shot, one suspects, with a touch of guerrilla ingenuity... Last Swim also has a palpably improvised component in the friends' genially pitched running banter.\"",
      "The director agrees that the young cast had freedom to change the script \"to make it as authentic as possible\".",
      "\"I think whenever you tell a story about young characters, you need to give them a certain amount of flexibility,\" Nathwani says.",
      "\"If there was a more natural way of delivering a line in a language that they would more authentically use, we would then write that into the script.",
      "\"And they were very good at challenging me as well. They would challenge me about choices that I and Helen had made on the page if they didn't feel it rang true of their characters.\"",
      "\"This is Gen Z friendship on screen,\" adds Hekmat.",
      "\"Sasha says that his [Millennial] generation is the one of hard knocks and they didn't grow up with the idea that mental health needed to be considered in day to day lives,\" she says.",
      "\"I think a great way of seeing how connected this film is to Gen Z is just the friendship that me and the rest of the gang have together.",
      "\"They're not afraid to ask each other about their feelings and the boys aren't afraid to open up a bit more. I think it's really reflective of our friendships in the way that we are able to speak to each other.\"",
      "As independent cinema tries to seek a greater audience amongst the young post-Covid-19, Nathwani says he hopes his film captures the energy of youth, although tapping into some much harder emotions and decisions.",
      "\"That's the interesting thing about that strange time between school and further education, because the bond that you have with your friends from school will never be closer, tighter than it is during that summer,\" he explains.",
      "\"And the moment that summer ends, those bonds tend to break because people go in different directions. And just in the context of what's happening in the UK, but across the world too, I think that's really challenging for young people, more so than I think we envision.\"",
      "Last Swim is released in UK cinemas on 4 April, 2025."

    "summary": "A painting by the US modern artist Joan Mitchell is \"one of the most important\" Tate has received.",
    "story": [
      "Tate Modern has announced it has received a major gift from a couple of art collectors in the form of a painting by the US modern artist Joan Mitchell.",
      "It was unveiled on Thursday as one of a group of works being donated by the Miami-based philanthropists, Jorge M and Darlene P\u00e9rez.",
      "The six-metre-long triptych, entitled Iva 1973, can now be viewed for free at the London gallery next to Mark Rothko's Seagram Murals.",
      "Tate director Maria Balshaw said the gift was \"one of the most important\" it has received, describing the donation as \"transformational\".",
      "'Accessible to all'",
      "\"To place such a significant and valuable work in public hands is an act of incredible generosity,\" said Balshaw.",
      "\"It is also an endorsement of Tate's ability to share our collection with the broadest possible audience,\" she added. \"And to care for that collection for future generations.\"",
      "Mitchell, who would've been 100 this year, was one of the most celebrated artists of the abstract expressionist movement.",
      "Arts Minister, Sir Chris Bryant said the \"spectacular donation\" of Mitchell's \"masterpiece\", which was originally dedicated to her dog, shows \"the amazing difference one person's generosity can make\".",
      "\"I'm very grateful for this donation and for the work that went into making it possible,\" he said.",
      "\"We are committed to ensuring art is for everyone, everywhere and the generosity of the P\u00e9rez family ensures that great art remains accessible to all, whilst also enriching our national collection.\"",
      "'Female artists play significant role'",
      "Argentine-American businessman Mr P\u00e9rez is best known as the chairman and CEO of The Related Group, a Miami-based real estate company.",
      "He has given or pledged over $100m (\u00a376m) to Miami's public art museum, which was renamed the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami in his honour in 2013.",
      "He also founded a not-for-profit contemporary art space in Miami called El Espacio 23.",
      "Mr P\u00e9rez told BBC News: \"We've been talking to the Tate for a long time, we're great admirers of the Tate.",
      "\"Our hope is always that our art is seen by the highest number of people. The Tate has huge viewership, millions and millions of people coming in.\"",
      "He added the work suited being displayed next to other famous artists. \"This painting, when you see it next to the Rothko's, really resounds,\" he said, \"and it'll be there forever.",
      "\"So when you talk about legacy, we like to think that our names will not be forgotten, and that they will live, not only with the British audience, but also with the international audience that comes to the Tate.",
      "\"We hope it fills a gap in the collection that is very important and maybe the most important art movement in America. It's found its home, we're very pleased with it here.\"",
      "Mrs P\u00e9rez noted female artists \"play a significant role in shaping the cultural landscape\" and that is was therefore \"pivotal that we support and celebrate their contributions.\"",
      "\"We've long admired Joan Mitchell's work and are thrilled to share Iva with the world through Tate Modern.\"",
      "Their gift also includes a multimillion-dollar endowment to support Tate's curatorial research.",
      "Also, a range of works and photographs by artists from across Africa and the African diaspora - including by Yinka Shonibare, El Anatsui and Malick Sidib\u00e9 - will make their way from the P\u00e9rezes to Tate's collection over the coming years.",

    "story": [
      "Drake has been given the green light to access sensitive record company documents in his ongoing defamation case over Kendrick Lamar's song Not Like Us.",
      "The star had asked for copies of Kendrick Lamar's recording contract, as well as information on salaries and bonuses for senior executives at his record label Universal Music Group (UMG).",
      "Drake is accusing the company of defamation by allowing Lamar's song to be published and promoted, claiming it spread the \"false and malicious narrative\" that he is a paedophile.",
      "Universal filed to dismiss the case last month, calling it an \"illogical\" attempt to \"silence\" Lamar's creative expression.",
      "It also asked for a pause in the evidence-gathering process, known as discovery, while that request was considered.",
      "However,  on Wednesday, Judge Jeannette A Vargas, ordered that discovery should continue.",
      "Michael Gottlieb, Drake's lead lawyer, celebrated the decision in a statement to the BBC.",
      "\"Now it's time to see what UMG was so desperately trying to hide,\" he said.",
      "According to a court filing, Drake's team is seeking documents including \"all contracts between UMG and Kendrick Lamar\" and the salaries and incentive plans for senior record label staff, going back to 2020.",
      "UMG had objected to the request, saying that the \"costly and time-consuming\" process of gathering the \"commercially sensitive\" information was an \"undue burden\" when the case could still be dismissed.",
      "A hearing on the motion to dismiss is scheduled for 30 June.",
      "Drake's lawsuit marks the latest chapter in his long-running feud with Lamar.",
      "The pair butted heads on a series of rap tracks last year. In one, Drake accused Lamar of domestic abuse.",
      "Lamar responded with Not Like Us, in which he characterised Drake and his entourage as \"certified paedophiles\" who should \"be registered and placed on neighbourhood watch\".",
      "In court documents, Drake claimed that Universal knew that Lamar's lyrics were false but \"continued to fan the flames\" of the controversy for profit.",
      "The lawsuit also accused Universal of colluding with Spotify to falsely inflate streaming numbers for Not Like Us, a claim that both companies denied.",
      "In response, Universal, which has been Drake's label for more than a decade, said: \"Not only are these claims untrue, but the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist - let alone Drake - is illogical.\"",
      "\"Throughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth 'rap battles' to express his feelings about other artists.\"",
      "In addition, the label claimed that Drake had \"lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated\".",
      "\"He now seeks to weaponise the legal process to silence an artist's creative expression and to seek damages from [Universal] for distributing that artist's music,\" the company concluded.",
      "Not Like Us has become the biggest hit of Kendrick Lamar's career. In the UK, it became his first number one single, shortly after he performed it during the Super Bowl Half Time Show in February.",

    "summary": "The BBC gets hands-on with the hotly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2, launching in June.",
    "story": [
      "After months of speculation, Nintendo has confirmed the successor to its wildly popular Switch console will be released on 5 June, when it will cost \u00a3395.99 to buy in the UK.",
      "But it's not so much the price of the Switch 2 but its games that have been raising eyebrows, with the new Mario Kart World that is being released alongside it coming in at a whopping \u00a374.99 for a physical copy.",
      "Fans will have to wait weeks before seeing what the new console and game are like - and whether they are worth that sort of money - but here's what I found when Nintendo gave me a chance to try them both out.",
      "When I first got my hands on the Switch 2, one thing became very clear to me - like the name suggests, Nintendo wants you to know this is a direct sequel to the Switch.",
      "This isn't like the jump from the Wii to the confusingly named Wii U, swapping motion controllers for a tablet that looked dated even back when the console released.",
      "Instead, the Switch 2 looks and feels just like its predecessor, with buttons in the places you'd expect - and a much larger (and nicer) screen.",
      "What's it like to play?",
      "It's fair to say Mario Kart World makes a fantastic first impression, thanks to the console having more power under the hood.",
      "It looks spectacular compared to previous Switch titles, though we're still talking about cartoony graphics - make no mistake, the console is more powerful but it's no match for the higher spec PlayStation 5, let alone PS5 Pro.",
      "And in my three races the standout feature wasn't the swishy new graphics or the controller, it was a trick that is becoming Nintendo's hallmark: making the new feel familiar.",
      "Despite having never picked up a Switch 2, I stormed my way to consecutive first place finishes, much to the chagrin of those around me.",
      "But it doesn't come cheap.",
      "The digital version of the game costs \u00a366.99, it's another \u00a38 on top of that for a physical copy - or pay an an extra \u00a335 for a version of the Switch 2 with it built-in, something which pushes the console price to \u00a3429.99.",
      "According to industry expert Christopher Dring, these wallet-emptying prices are down to the costs involved in manufacturing - and President Donald Trump's tariff blitz.",
      "\u201cThese cartridges are exclusively made in Japan, which is a country that's just been hit with a 24% tariff from the US Government, and the threat of those tariffs may have impacted Nintendo's pricing decisions globally,\u201d he said.",
      "In the US, Mario Kart World will be priced at $79.99, with the console selling for $449.99 (or $499.99 with Mario Kart bundled in).",
      "Mouse control and Donkey Kong destruction",
      "But there\u2019s more to the Switch 2 than Mario Kart.",
      "Fans will no doubt have been excited to see the hotly anticipated Metroid Prime 4,  the first game in the series in 18 years.",
      "But while they will be familiar with the typical way of playing - moving and aiming with joysticks and shooting with the \"A\" button - there\u2019s a significant new feature too.",
      "At any point in the game you can rotate the controller, put it on a surface and use it like a mouse. Fans of PC games will immediately feel at home with this, and it's a neat bit of engineering to be able to switch up on-the-fly without having to enter any menus.",
      "The optical mouse controls pop up elsewhere too, with PC strategy game Civilization VII a game that massively benefits.",
      "But in both cases, I do wonder how long you can play with the controller like this before the ergonomics become an issue. I have to admit I found myself wondering why I wasn't just playing on my PC with mouse controls and a comfortable resting position.",
      "Still, the fact that this is built in to the hardware means we may see the Switch 2 as the obvious home of future PC ports to home consoles.",
      "And there is another trick up Nintendo\u2019s sleeve - both controllers can be held like this and used as mice, opening up some interesting possibilities. In particular, futuristic wheelchair basketball game Drag x Drive, where both \"mice\" are pushed to mimic moving wheels.",
      "Elsewhere, Donkey Kong Bananza will be the first time the ape mascot has had a 3D platforming game of his own in 25 years, so there was some pressure on Nintendo to deliver a game which justified the wait.",
      "For lack of a better term it\u2019s a destruct-em-up - you can destroy much of the floor and scenery in each level.",
      "But there's that dreaded price news again. A digital copy will cost \u00a358.99, while a physical copy retails at \u00a366.99.",
      "It seems Nintendo has a lot to offer Switch fans - but it will be taking a fair bit from them too.",
      "Rivals and originals",
      "Some other titles I got to see in action were updated versions of Cyberpunk 2077 and Yakuza 0 - both of which big hitters on rival consoles which were deemed too complex to run on the original Switch.",
      "Like the other Switch 2 games, they looked good - and of course they will benefit as the new console, like the original, can play games on the go.",
      "The original Switch created the genre of the hybrid console - one which works on a TV and as a portable system.",
      "But since that launch in 2017, things have changed a bit.",
      "Now, it has a rival in the Steam Deck, a hybrid machine with the power to play most PC games.",
      "Nintendo would say something its rivals don\u2019t have is that long list of exclusive titles.",
      "But there is a bit of a theme here: Nintendo has consciously gone for continuity.",
      "The console is the Switch 2, rather than having a completely new name. Many of those exclusives Nintendo is so proud of are new games in established series, while others are remasters of modern classics.",
      "I had great experiences with these games in the 20 minutes I had with them.",
      "But for fans to get value for those high prices they will want something that holds up over weeks and months of gameplay.",
      "Will the Switch 2's slick nostalgia hit provide that? We'll start to find out in June."

      "\"They're four very different human beings. Perhaps this is a chance to understand them a little more deeply. But together, all four films will tell the story of the greatest band in history.\"",
      "The films will be released \"in proximity\" to each other in April 2028.",
      "The director explained: \"I just felt the story of the band was too huge to fit into a single movie, and that turning it into a TV mini-series just somehow didn't feel right.\"",

      "Paul Mescal, 29, shot to fame in the BBC's Normal People in 2020. He went on to star in acclaimed films Aftersun, for which he was Oscar-nominated, and All of Us Strangers,  and he played the lead in the Gladiator sequel.

The 28-year-old Brit also received a Bafta TV Award nomination for A Murder at the End of the World, and is among the bookmakers' favourites to be the next James Bond.",
      "Barry Keoghan bears perhaps the closest resemblance to his Beatle - drummer Sir Ringo. The Irish actor is the oldest of the acting quartet at 32, and is one of the hottest stars in Hollywood, having been nominated for an Oscar for The Banshees of Inisherin before leading the cast of cult hit Saltburn.",
      "Joseph Quinn played Eddie Munson in the fourth season of Netflix's Stranger Things, was in A Quiet Place: Day One, and appeared alongside Mescal in Gladiator II. Before appearing as guitarist Harrison, the 31-year-old Londoner will be seen as Johnny Storm/Human Torch in The Fantastic Four: First Steps and two Avengers films.",
      "Although several previous movies like Backbeat, Nowhere Boy and I Wanna Hold Your Hand have depicted The Beatles, this is the first time that all four band members and their estates have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film.",
      "Sir Sam called the films the \"first bingeable theatrical experience\", adding: \"Frankly, we need big cinematic events to get people out of the house.\"",
      "On stage, Dickinson, Mescal, Keoghan and Quinn recited from the band's song Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: \"It's wonderful to be here, it's certainly a thrill, you're such a lovely audience, we'd like to take you home with us.\"",
      "They then gave a Beatles-style synchronised bow.",
      "Formed in 1960, the original band transformed youth culture and changed the course of musical history.",
      "Restlessly imaginative and experimental, they had an uncanny ability to communicate sophisticated musical ideas to a mass audience, on albums including Revolver, Sgt Pepper's and The White Album.",
      "Despite splitting in 1970, the quartet remain the biggest-selling band of all time.",
      "Only two members survive. John Lennon was murdered in 1980, while Harrison died of cancer in 2001.",

      "And perhaps his best performance combined his skills as a stage actor with a fine singing voice, to bring to life 1960s-counterculture icon Jim Morrison, in Oliver Stone's film The Doors.",
      "Critic Roger Ebert wrote: \"If there is an award for the most unsung leading man of his generation, Val Kilmer should get it.",

      "He attended Chatsworth High School, in the San Fernando Valley, where future actor Kevin Spacey was among his classmates and where he developed a love of drama.",
      "Kilmer's ambition was to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada), in London, but his application was rejected because, at 17, he was a year below the minimum entry age.",
      "Instead, Kilmer became the then youngest pupil to enrol at the Julliard School, in New York, one of the world's most prestigious drama conservatories.",
      "A gifted student, Kilmer co-wrote and made his stage debut in How It All Began, a play based on the life of a German radical, at the Public Theatre.",
      "But he recalled a tough regime.",
      "\"I had a mean teacher once, who kind of said, 'How dare you think you can act Shakespeare? You don't know how to walk across the room yet,'\u2026 and in a way, that's true,\" Kilmer said.",

      "But in the 1990s, he proved he could carry a major film as a lead actor.",
      "Director Stone had long wanted to make a biopic of The Doors, focusing on the band's singer, who had died of a drugs overdose in Paris in 1971.",
      "A number of actors were considered, including John Travolta and Richard Gere, before Stone chose Kilmer because of his physical resemblance to Morrison and strong singing voice.",

      "And in his 1996 biography of Oliver Stone, James Riordan said the surviving Doors could not tell recordings of Kilmer singing their songs from Morrison's original.",
      "Kilmer also played Elvis Presley in Tony Scott's True Romance, written by Quentin Tarantino, and sickly alcoholic gambler and dentist Doc Holliday in the 1993 film Tombstone - a retelling of the story of Wyatt Earp's gunfight at the OK Corral, which some critics called his finest performance.",
      "In 1995, Kilmer replaced Michael Keaton in the third of a trilogy of Batman films, Batman Forever.",

      "\"We've all fought very hard for copyright laws, and nobody wants to see their work stolen to have somebody else profit from it,\" Mooser says.",
      "Hollywood has begun toying with the new technology. The Oscar-nominated films Emilia Perez and The Brutalist used AI to alter voices. Adrian Brody won the Academy Award for best actor, even with the help of AI to fine tune his accent when he spoke Hungarian in his starring role in The Brutalist. AI has even been used to de-age actors like Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford.",
      "The technology is seemingly everywhere. OpenAI hosted an AI film festival in Los Angeles earlier this month. Marvel directors Joe and Anthony Russo told the Wall Street Journal they plan to invest $400 million to craft AI tools for filmmakers.",
      "But the impacts on how it will alter the future of the entertainment industry remain unclear. Generative AI, for instance, allows computers to learn and solve problems in ways that can seem human \u2013 albeit much faster. And many worry about the technology replacing their jobs as AI is used to generate scripts, animation, locations, voices and human actors.",
      "If you ask OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, which Hollywood jobs are most easily replaced by AI, background actors are top of the list as \"most vulnerable\" with \"A-List actors & directors\" considered safest because \"star power and brand recognition keep top talent irreplaceable\".",
      "At the Moonvalley party, everyone was talking about new AI technology though few wanted to speak with a reporter on record about it. But dozens of powerful people made the trek east to the hip Silver Lake neighbourhood from west Los Angeles, even though it was raining. In LA, that's remarkable.",
      "\"We're here to learn,\" said one executive who spent an hour in traffic getting to the party. \"We're not signing anything or buying anything, but we're interested.\"",
      "Mooser and his co-founder Naeem Talukdar speak passionately about how AI will transform Hollywood and allow filmmakers to create blockbuster style epics on much lower budgets. It could lead to many bad films - but it could also help discover the next Quentin Tarantino or Martin Scorsese, even if they don't have the backing of a big studio.",
      "\"This technology is utterly meaningless without the artist at the centre of it; the technology needs to ultimately be subservient to the artist,\" says Talukdar.",
      "Hollywood's foray into using AI comes as the Trump administration prepares a new AI plan for the United States.",
      "Tech companies say they can't compete with China under existing US copyright laws and that they need unfettered access to art - from Mickey Mouse to Moana to The Matrix - to train their AI models as a matter of national security.",
      "Google and OpenAI want the US government to designate copyrighted art, movies and TV shows as \"fair use\" for them to train AI, arguing that without the exceptions, they will lose the race for dominance to China.",
      "Hollywood filmmakers say tech companies are attempting to undermine the entertainment industry, which they point out supports more than 2.3 million US jobs.",
      "\"We firmly believe that America's global AI leadership must not come at the expense of our essential creative industries,\" a group of more than 400 Hollywood A-listers - led by actress/writer Natasha Lyonne who helped develop Moonvalley - wrote in an open letter to the Trump administration, which has been soliciting public comment for its AI Action Plan.",
      "The letter's signatories included A-List stars like Ben Stiller, Sir Paul McCartney, Cate Blanchett and Lilly Wachowski, who co-created The Matrix, which depicts a dystopian simulated reality where humans are enslaved by intelligent machines.",
      "Many in Hollywood remain terrified of what AI means for their futures.",
      "Outside a Disney Character Voices office earlier this month, dozens of actors picketed against video game companies for refusing to come to an agreement on using AI in video games.",
      "\"Using actual actors is the key to a lot of the drama and enjoyment that people get from video games,\" actor DW McCann said. \"People have lived experiences that AI just can't understand.\"",
      "The actors want a contract that guarantees their voices and likeness will not be used without their consent to train AI models that replace them in the future.",
      "Mooser says AI will allow filmmakers to create amazing art \u2013 if it's done right.  With humans calling the shots, he says, AI could help them create sets and worlds they couldn't easily access or invent \u2013 and to do so much faster than what they could traditionally do with computer graphics and visual effects.",
      "\"We're trying to say, look, technology is going to be in everything. Let's make sure that we try to fight as hard as we can to make sure that it's done in the right way, and that artists aren't run over by big companies.\"",

      "It's been heavily delayed, but A Minecraft Movie is finally here.",
      "The wildly popular video game hits the big screen on Friday and boasts a star-studded cast including Jason Momoa, Jack Black and Jennifer Coolidge.",
      "It tells the story of four misfits who are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld \u2013 the place where all players start in Minecraft.",
      "Minecraft is one of the world's best selling video games, so there\u2019s a lot of pressure to deliver for fans of the blocky world (my 11-year-old nephew is legitimately more excited for this than Christmas).",
      "\"This game has been loved by millions and millions all over the world for years now, and I think this movie is a big deal for a lot of people, because now it's generational,\" Black said.",
      "There's been a long history of game-to-film flops. But others, such as Sonic, were massive hits, so that's what Warner Bros will no doubt be hoping for.",
      "Djo know what I mean?",
      "By Mark Savage, music correspondent",
      "American actor Joe Keery is best known as reformed jock Steve Harrington, one of the main (and most loveable) characters in the sci-fi series Stranger Things.",
      "But he's also got a nifty line in throwback indie-pop, which he performs as Djo. The pseudonym was initially an attempt to avoid the accusations he was trading on his fame. He'd even perform in disguise.",
      "That changed when he had a breakout hit with End of Beginning \u2013 a synth-heavy slice of psychedelia that went viral on TikTok last year, often the soundtrack to videos about what people would do if they won the lottery.",
      "Stranger Things finale filming was 'incredibly emotional'",
      "The attention put a rocket under his music career. While his first two albums were DIY affairs, recorded in a couple of days and self-released, his latest, The Crux, was created in New York's fabled Electric Lady studios.",
      "Released on Friday, it's packed full of off-kilter lyrics and squiggly synth lines that burrow into your brain. The first two singles, Delete Ya and Basic Being Basic have already been radio hits, and the rest of the album pulls on influences as diverse as Electric Light Orchestra, New Order, Cake, Hall & Oates and Bruce Springsteen (coincidentally, all bands that would work perfectly on the Stranger Things soundtrack).",
      "There are a couple of knockouts \u2013 including the crunchy garage rock of Gap Toothed Smile, and the choppy New Wave anthem Link \u2013 but the point of the album is its diversity. Keery envisioned each song as the story of a separate guest at a hotel where everyone is at a spiritual or emotional crossroads.",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Mar 2025 04:40:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The opening night of the star's tour mixes flashes of brilliance with moments that fail to connect.",
    "story": [
      "Usher has kicked off a 10-night residency at London's O2 Arena with a slick, two-hour show that was impressive and frustrating in equal measure.",
      "The US pop star played more than 40 songs, including hits like Yeah, Burn, U Remind Me and OMG, with multiple costume changes and buttery-smooth choreography.",
      "But the show, which comes to the UK after a 62-date run in the US, felt oddly rough around the edges - including a handful of on-stage stumbles and missed musical cues.",
      "The momentum was frequently torpedoed by waffly, overlong video interludes - but Usher's magnetic stage presence just about held the concert together.",
      "Titled \"Past, Present, Future\", the tour is billed as an \"intimate\" look at Usher Raymond IV's 30-year career, as well as \"a glimpse into the future\".",
      "It comes as the star, one of the best-selling artists of the 2000s, is enjoying a career rebirth - following an acclaimed Super Bowl half-time show, and the release of his ninth studio album, Coming Home.",
      "With 10 sold-out shows at the O2, he enters an elite group of artists who've played double-digit residencies at the venue, alongside Queen (10 shows in 2022), Bon Jovi (12 nights in 2010) and Prince (21 nights in 2007).",
      "At its core, Past, Present, Future illustrates the skill with which the 46-year-old has navigated the evolving trends of the music industry.",
      "We see a video clip of him, aged 14, dancing to his debut single, Call Me A Mack, then watch as he transforms into a teenage heartthrob, a confessional balladeer, an EDM party-starter, and an elder statesman of R&B.",
      "He arrives from under the stage in a fog of dry ice and a cone of laser beams, apparently controlling the lights with his bare hands, before dancing to the middle of the arena with the molten fluidity of his idol, Michael Jackson.",
      "Clad in a sparkly raincoat and wide-brimmed Pharrell hat, he races through hits like Coming Home, Hey Daddy and U Make Me Wanna, backed by a funky 10-piece band and a dance team that echoes his every move.",
      "The choreography is a constant highlight. Usher's moves are so effortless that they look unrehearsed, but such ease comes at a cost: Last year, he had to postpone the start of the tour after injuring his neck in practice.",
      "At the O2, that pain seemed a distant memory, as he careened around the U-shaped stage on roller skates, pulling off a flawless moonwalk, and even freeze-framing in a handstand.",
      "He might have fumbled a hat at one point, but it was one of his dancers who came closest to calamity - losing his balance during an elaborate chair routine, sending the chair spinning across the stage.",
      "The band also suffered a mishap, missing Usher's cue to extend the intro to Superstar, and coming in four bars early. Not disastrous, but still unusual for a show on this level.",
      "The hits were punctuated by numerous interludes, narrated by Celeste, a glitch-prone \"computer driven by AI technology to help Mr Raymond tell his story\",  from teen wannabe to global superstar, against a backdrop of infidelity, tabloid infamy, redemption and survival.",
      "The problem was his songs couldn't support the weight of that story. With a few exceptions, Usher mostly sings about lusting after women in the club, and carnal pleasures in the bedroom.",
      "The result was a weirdly disconnected show, where Usher followed a moving video about his absent father with a song about his ex, which he sung while straddling a motorbike.",
      "Priapism was a running theme. Women in the audience were fed with cocktail cherries (\"oh, it's your first time?\" Usher mugged into the camera)  and part of the stage was turned into a strip club, complete with pole dancers, during Bad Girl.",
      "That sort of tongue-in-cheek raunch has been a hallmark of Usher's career, but it felt dated and shallow in a concert that promised an intimate look into his personality.",
      "Perhaps he just wanted us to know that, deep down, he really, really likes sex.",
      "Luckily, the songs still hold up. A trio of quiet storm ballads - Climax, Burn and Confessions Part II - had couples serenading each other, while a trio of women near me took the opportunity to slow dance a security guard who was mopping the floor.",
      "To his credit, Usher sang everything live, with an airy falsetto that's undiminished after 30 years on tour. During U Got It Bad, he held one sustained note for over 10 seconds.",
      "At times, he struggled to hold the audience's attention during the slow jams. The UK has always preferred him in club mode - and it was his three biggest-sellers, Yeah, OMG and DJ Got Us Falling In Love that really set the O2 alight.",
      "Strangely it was one of those empty club anthems, I Am The Party, that ultimately carried the most meaning.",
      "\"Hopefully my [music] has been something to you,\" Usher said over the introduction.",
      "\"Maybe we fell in love together, maybe we had a good time together, but something brought you here. And I just want you to know, I appreciate the connection.\"",
      "\"If I didn't have you to cheer me on, I wouldn't continue to do this.\"",
      "Pop stars say this sort of thing all the time. But as he stood at the O2, drenched in sweat, remembering the father who abandoned him and soaking up the audience's affection, Usher didn't seem to be putting on an act.",
      "By the encore, he'd given up all pretence of being a high-rolling playboy.",
      "Instead, he bounded around the stage, giddily filming the audience on his phone, as they hollered out the chorus to Without You.",
      "If only that performer had shown up earlier."

    "story": [
      "Whether you like the new Snow White film or you hate it, it's hard to escape the debate around its lead actress, Rachel Zegler.",
      "The 23-year-old star has dominated conversation about the film, as people either blame her for its poor reviews or leap to her defence, saying she's being unfairly maligned.",
      "And this debate is not new for Zegler.",
      "Way before Snow White came out, she has been at the centre of the storm, with many criticising her take on the original film and her political views, including those on US President Donald Trump and his voters.",
      "Others defended her, and expressed discomfort at seeing such a young actress suffer a pile-on.",
      "Film critic Kelechi Ehenulo calls Zegler a victim of \"culture wars\", and warns actors from underrepresented backgrounds (Zegler is Latina) often find themselves becoming \"targets for backlash\".",
      "So how did we get to this point \u2013 and where does Zegler go from here?",
      "A blame game",
      "Let's start with the film itself.",
      "Disney's live-action version of the classic fairy tale Snow White was released earlier this month, and has faced a slew of underwhelming reviews (the Observer's Wendy Ide described it as \"toe-curlingly terrible\".) US reviewers have been somewhat more positive \u2013 but despite it topping the North America box office chart, it hasn't made as much money as expected.",
      "On social media, some people have been quick to point their finger at Zegler, arguing she hampered the release.",
      "They include Jonah Platt, the son of Snow White producer Marc Platt. Earlier this week, he took aim at Zegler in a fiery social media post. It has since been deleted, but was screenshotted by multiple outlets including the New York Post.",
      "He said Zegler had \"[dragged] her personal politics\" into the film's promotional campaign, adding: \"Her actions clearly hurt the film's box office.\"",
      "Platt didn't respond to a request for comment from BBC News.",
      "The controversies started much earlier.",
      "Before the film was released, Zegler faced abuse online by people who disagreed with her casting in the role of a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\".",
      "Zegler made headlines after her comments, in 2022, about the original film. \"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also said the original film was \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power\", adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",

      "Disney holds small-scale Snow White premiere amid controversy",
      "Many saw those words as a rebuke against Disney's tradition.",
      "The Daily Mail branded it a \"woke tirade\" and an article this week in Variety said she \"trashed the beloved original Snow White\".",
      "City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford says criticism of the original film \"was never going to work out well. These films are marketed on nostalgia, on making you feel like you did when you saw the original, so to speak of it negatively seemed puzzling\".",
      "Zegler declined to comment on this piece.",
      "But Anna Smith, film critic and host of the Girls On Film podcast, told BBC News that some of the headlines may have be misleading.",
      "\"Zegler pointed out that times and attitudes have changed, and that the new Snow White has been adapted for the current age. This is the case with many remakes and reboots, many of which do not make the headlines with comments about 'woke' culture.\"",
      "Zegler's political views have also sparked a backlash.",
      "Last summer, she thanked fans for their response to the film's trailer in a post on X, adding, \"and always remember, free Palestine\".",
      "According to the Variety article, Marc Platt - mentioned above - flew to New York to speak directly with Zegler after the post.",
      "Neither Zegler nor Platt have responded to a request for a comment on that.",
      "Zegler also stoked controversy with her views after the 2024 US presidential election. Writing on Instagram, she said she hoped \"Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace\".",
      "She later apologised for what she had said.",
      "Some commend her for speaking her mind. Ehenulo says that she is \"not the first and certainly not the last actor to be speaking about politics\".",
      "And Luxford told me she was \"hard-pressed\" to imagine the film's core audience, children under 10, being swayed by her politics.",
      "But film critic Conor Riley said that her comments about Trump didn't \"help the stability of the movie's release\".",
      "He notes that Gal Gadot, who plays Snow White's stepmother, the Evil Queen, has also faced a backlash from some people. Gadot, who is Israeli, has been vocal in her support of the country.",
      "The timing of the film also didn't help, he added.",
      "\"Ultimately, [Zegler] became a lightning rod for controversy, not just due to her own actions, but because Snow White landed at the intersection of Hollywood's creative stagnation, racial politics, international conflict, and America's deep ideological divide,\" he said.",
      "'Targets for backlash'",
      "Some, like Luxford, argue that some of the pile-on comes from \"a place of prejudice\".",
      "\"She's a young Latina woman with political opinions that don't align with certain groups, who are quick to voice their anger,\" she said.",
      "Zegler is far from the first young female actress to find herself facing a toxic backlash. Recently, Stranger Things actor Millie Bobby Brown criticised press articles about her appearance, saying \"this isn't journalism, this is bullying\".",
      "Smith notes that women in positions of prominence are more likely to be targeted in this way.",
      "\"When women in the public eye are criticised, there is often bias at work. Regardless of the topic, the way it's dealt with, talked about and reported will often differ compared to the way men are treated,\" she said.",
      "Ehenulo, for her part, calls on the industry to do more to protect their stars.",
      "\"What irks me is how easy [people of colour] actors become targets for backlash on social media and yet the culture of silence from studios, news outlets and social media platforms says it all,\" she said.",
      "\"That lack of public protection... means the toxicity continues to fester and rise. It's the Wild West out there and I can't see it getting better when this has been normalised to such an extent.\"",
      "We put those claims to Disney, but they declined to comment.",
      "The big roles keep coming for Zegler. She is now signed up to star in Evita in the West End this summer, and on Friday, she made a splash in a different way - reading a CBeebies Bedtime Story.",
      "At the end of the story, Zegler tells young viewers: \"To be a powerful princess you just need to be wonderful, brilliant you!\" For some, this is a message that encapsulates Zegler herself.",
      "\"I don't know if she's going to be doing another Disney film anytime soon,\" says Luxford, \"but she's 23, she's a Golden Globe winner, and she's a very talented actor.\"",

    "summary": "The Liverpool anthem Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? is 20 years old this year.",
    "story": [
      "Ian Prowse was standing in his local pub literally crying into his beer about the end of a relationship when someone came in to tell him one of his songs had just been played on Radio 1.",
      "Told it was \"a song about a train\", Prowse, the former frontman of 1990s band Pele, was perplexed. At the time he had no record deal and the song he knew it must have been, Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? had not been released.",
      "He would then find out that BBC DJ John Peel had got hold of a copy, and had told his listeners that the song \u2013 a poignant love letter to Liverpool, warts and all \u2013 had moved him to tears.",
      "Twenty years on from its release, it has been covered by Irish folk star Christy Moore, championed by Elvis Costello, and has become an anthem for the city - not least for its raw reflections on the Hillsborough disaster of 1989, whose 36th anniversary will be commemorated this month.",
      "Prowse, now 61, had been the frontman of the 1990s band Pele, and was playing with his new outfit Amsterdam when Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? came to him as he sat at home one afternoon.",
      "The inspiration came from the story of William McKenzie, a Victorian merchant who rests in a pyramid-shaped tomb in the graveyard of St Andrew's church in Liverpool, supposedly buried sitting upright clutching a winning hand of cards.",
      "From that germ of inspiration, which gave the song its opening lines, the rest of the verses quickly flowed.",
      "\"I was on the floor at this point,\" he says. \"The music industry had changed with the likes of the X Factor, and if you were over 30 you were essentially dead in the water.",
      "\"I was really struggling, and then John Peel started playing the song and then suddenly we had a record deal again.\"",
      "The song was to receive an even bigger break when Irish folk star Moore came across it after a gig in Manchester, when a CD containing it was posted through the open window of his car by a fan as he left the Bridgewater Hall.",
      "\"By the time we got to London, I was in love with the song,\" says Moore.",
      "\"One of the great privileges of my life has been that I get to sing the songs of people like Ian Prowse.\"",
      "For Elvis Costello, some of the song's charm lies in Prowse's \"acute sense of the history of the city\".",
      "There are references in Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? to the Atlantic slave trade, of which Liverpool was the home; the influx of Irish immigrants fleeing the potato famine of the 1840s and 1850s, and the events of 15 April 1989, reflected in the lyrics \"Yorkshire policemen fold their arms while people try and save their fellow fans\".",
      "Prowse adds: \"For people of my generation. Hillsborough was the central event. I had so many friends who were survivors, I could not write a song that's talking about Liverpool without including that.",

    "summary": "BBC News reports on assisted dying in Canada, where some say it's now easier to choose to die than get support to live",
    "story": [
      "April Hubbard sits on the theatre stage where she plans to die later this year.",
      "She is not terminally ill, but the 39-year-old performance and burlesque artist has been approved for assisted dying under Canada's increasingly liberal laws.",
      "Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing",
      "She is speaking to BBC News from the Bus Stop Theatre, an intimate auditorium with a little under 100 seats, in the eastern city of Halifax, Nova Scotia.",
      "Illuminated by a single spotlight on a stage she has performed on many times before, she tells me she plans to die here \"within months\" of her imminent 40th birthday. She'll be joined by a small group of her family and friends.",
      "April plans to be in a \"big comfy bed\" for what she calls a \"celebratory\" moment when a medical professional will inject a lethal dose into her bloodstream.",
      "\"I want to be surrounded by the people I love and just have everybody hold me in a giant cuddle puddle and get to take my last breath, surrounded by love and support,\" she says.",
      "April was born with spina bifida and was later diagnosed with tumours at the base of her spine which she says have left her in constant, debilitating pain.",
      "She's been taking strong opioid painkillers for more than 20 years and applied for Medical Assistance in Dying (Maid) in March 2023. While she could yet live for decades with her condition, she qualified to end her life early seven months after applying. For those who are terminally ill it is possible to get approval within 24 hours.",
      "\"My suffering and pain are increasing and I don't have the quality of life anymore that makes me happy and fulfilled,\" April says. Every time she moves or breathes, she says it feels like the tissues from the base of her spine \"are being pulled like a rubber band that stretches too far\", and that her lower limbs leave her in agony.",
      "We meet April as, almost 3,000 miles away, MPs are scrutinising proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. They voted in principle in support of those plans in November 2024, but months of detailed scrutiny have followed - and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could possibly become law.",
      "This week, the BBC witnessed a man's death in California, where assisted dying laws are far more similar to those being considered in Westminster.",
      "Critics say Canada is an example of the \"slippery slope\", meaning that once you pass an assisted dying law it will inevitably widen its scope and have fewer safeguards.",
      "Canada now has one of the most liberal systems of assisted dying in the world, similar to that operating in the Netherlands and Belgium. It introduced Maid in 2016, initially for terminally ill adults with a serious and incurable physical illness, which causes intolerable suffering. In 2021, the need to be terminally ill was removed, and in two years' time, the Canadian government plans to open Maid to adults solely with a mental illness and no physical ailment.",
      "Opponents of Maid tell us that death is coming to be seen as a standard treatment option for those with disabilities and complex medical problems.",
      "\"It is easier in Canada to get medical assistance in dying than it is to get government support to live,\" says Andrew Gurza, a disability awareness consultant and friend of April's.",
      "Andrew, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, says he respects April's decision, but tells us: \"If my disability declines and my care needs got higher, I'd still want to be here. To know there's a law that's saying you could easily end your life - it's just really scary.\"",
      "Before she was approved for Maid, April was assessed by two independent physicians who were required to inform her of ways to alleviate her suffering and offer alternative treatments.",
      "\"The safeguards are there,\" she says, when we press her about disabled people who feel threatened by assisted dying, or whether Maid is being used as a shortcut to better quality care. \"If it's not right for you and you're not leading the charge and choosing Maid, you're not going to be able to access it unless it's for the right reasons,\" she adds.",
      "There were 15,343 Maid deaths in 2023, representing around one in 20 of all deaths in Canada - a proportion that has increased dramatically since 2016 and is one of the highest in the world. The average age of recipients was 77.",
      "In all but a handful of cases, the lethal dose was delivered by a doctor or nurse, which is also known as voluntary euthanasia. One doctor we spoke to, Eric Thomas, said he had helped 577 patients to die.",
      "Dr Konia Trouton, president of the Canadian Association of Maid Assessors and Providers, has also helped hundreds of patients to die since the law was introduced.",
      "The procedure is the same each time - she arrives at the home of the person who has been given approval for Maid and asks if they wish to go ahead with it that day. She says the patients always direct the process and then give her the \"heads up and ready to go\".",
      "\"That gives me an honour and a duty and a privilege to be able to help them in those last moments with their family around them, with those who love them around them and to know that they've made that decision thoughtfully, carefully and thoroughly,\" she adds.  If the answer is yes, she opens her medical bag.",
      "Demonstrating to the BBC what happens next, Dr Trouton briefly puts a tourniquet on my arm. She shows me where the needle would be inserted into a vein in the back of my hand to allow an intravenous infusion of lethal drugs.",
      "In her medical bag she also has a stethoscope. \"Strangely, these days I use it more to determine if someone has no heartbeat rather than if they do,\" she tells me.",
      "A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line",
      "Some 96% of Maid provisions are under \"track one\" where death is \"reasonably foreseeable\". Dr Trouton says that means patients are on a \"trajectory toward death\", which might range from someone who has rapidly spreading cancer and only weeks to live or another with Alzheimer's \"who might have five to seven years\".",
      "The other 4% of Maid deaths come under \"track two\". These are adults, like April, who are not dying but have suffering which is intolerable to them from a \"grievous and irremediable medical condition\".",
      "That is in stark contrast to Labour MP Kim Leadbeater's bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, which says patients must be expected to die within six months. The Westminster bill would not allow doctors to give a lethal dose \u2013 rather patients would have to self-administer the drugs, usually by swallowing them.",
      "Death via intravenous infusion normally takes just a few minutes, as the lethal drugs go straight into the bloodstream, whereas swallowing the drugs means patients usually take around an hour or two to die, but can take considerably longer, although they are usually unconscious after a few minutes.",
      "Dr Trouton told me she regarded the Canadian system as quicker and more effective, as do other Maid providers. \"I'm concerned that if some people can't swallow because of their disease process, and if they're not able to take the entire quantity of medication because of breathing difficulties or swallowing difficulties, what will happen?\"",
      "'Canada has fallen off a cliff'",
      "But opponents argue it's being used as a cheaper alternative to providing adequate social or medical support.",
      "One of them is Dr Ramona Coelho, a GP in London, Ontario, whose practice serves many marginalised groups and those struggling to get medical and social support. She's part of a Maid Death Review Committee, alongside Dr Trouton, which examines cases in the province.",
      "Dr Coelho told me that Maid was \"out of control\". \"I wouldn't even call it a slippery slope,\" she says \"Canada has fallen off a cliff.\"",
      "\"When people have suicidal ideations, we used to meet them with counselling and care, and for people with terminal illness and other diseases we could mitigate that suffering and help them have a better life,\" she says. \"Yet now we are seeing that as an appropriate request to die and ending their lives very quickly.\"",
      "While at Dr Coelho's surgery I was introduced to Vicki Whelan, a retired nurse whose mum Sharon Scribner died in April 2023 of lung cancer, aged 81. Vicki told me that in her mum's final days in hospital she was repeatedly offered the option of Maid by medical staff, describing it as like a \"sales pitch\".",
      "The family, who are Catholic, discharged their mother so she could die at home, where Vicki says her mum had a \"beautiful, peaceful death\". \"It makes us think that we can't endure, and we can't suffer a little bit, and that somehow now they've decided that dying needs to be assisted, where we've been dying for years.",
      "\"All of a sudden now we're telling people that this is a better option. This is an easy way out and I think it's just robbing people of hope.\"",
      "'Not a way I want to live'",
      "So is Canada an example of the so-called slippery slope? It's certainly true that the eligibility criteria has broadened dramatically since the law was introduced nine years ago, so for critics the answer would be an emphatic yes and serve as a warning to Britain.",
      "Canada's assisted dying laws were driven by court rulings. Its Supreme Court instructed Parliament that a prohibition on assisted dying breached the country's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The extension of eligibility for those who were not terminally ill was in part a response to another court decision.",
      "In Britain, judges in the most senior courts have repeatedly said any potential change to the law around assisted dying is a matter for Parliament, after the likes of Tony Nicklinson, Diane Pretty and Noel Conway brought cases arguing the blanket ban on assisted suicide breached their human rights.",
      "April knows some people may look at her, a young woman, and wonder why she would die.",
      "\"We're the masters of masking and not letting people see that we're suffering,\" she says. \"But in reality, there's days that I just can't hide it, and there's many days where I can't lift my head off the pillow and I can't eat anymore.",
      "\"It's not a way I want to live for another 10 or 20 or 30 years.\"",

      "What are artificial sweeteners?",
      "Eating too much sugar increases the risk of tooth decay and some long-term health conditions such as type 2 diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease.",
      "Artificial sweeteners were developed as a substitute, providing a sweet taste with few or no calories.",
      "All of the ones used in the UK are approved and have undergone rigorous safety tests.",
      "But some are concerned that they enhance preferences for sweet tastes in children which can be hard to overcome.",
      "Are sweeteners healthier than sugar?",
      "After reviewing the available evidence, SACN says proof that sweeteners are cutting tooth decay is \"poor\", although a reduction in free sugars, alongside \"other positive changes to diet\", is likely to be beneficial to health overall.",
      "It says there may be some value in using sweeteners to help reduce weight gain in the short to medium term, but \"it is not essential and is not the only option.\"",

      "Prof Graham Finlayson, Chair in Psychobiology, University of Leeds, said it was reasonable to be cautious, especially in children, but the evidence wasn't strong enough to dismiss non-sugar sweeteners as a tool for reducing sugar intake.",
      "\"With obesity and diabetes rates rising, knee-jerk policy changes could do more harm than good,\" he warned.",
      "The International Sweeteners Association (ISA) said: \"As part of an overall healthy diet and lifestyle, low/no calorie sweeteners can be used to further public health objectives on sugar intake reduction.",

      "The ONS says girls turning 18 in 2025 are likely to have an average of one child per woman by the age of 35 - unlike their mothers' generation, which had an average of one child per woman by the time they were 31.",
      "They are also projected to have an average of 1.52 children during their lifetimes - down from 1.95 children for their mothers and 2.04 children for their grandmothers.",
      "The new analysis marks the first time the ONS has explored how fertility levels could change in future generations.",
      "It looks at fertility patterns for women born in 1978 alongside patterns for their mothers' generation - assumed to be those born in 1951 - and projections for their daughters' generation - considered to be those born in 2007, who turn 18 this year.",
      "It shows those born in 1978 on average have one child by the time they reach 31. For their mothers' generation, this occurred by the age of 26.",
      "By projecting this trend forwards into the future, the ONS found that women born in 2007 are likely to have an average of one child by the time they are 35.",
      "For girls born in 2025, this is projected to occur by the time they are 36.",
      "Kerry Gadsdon, from the ONS, said the trend may be driven by \"financial pressures and the timing of other life events such as partnership formation and moving into your own home generally happening later\".",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Apr 2025 01:18:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Exclusive data shows how neglect of this common mental health condition costs the UK nearly \u00a310bn a year.",
    "story": [
      "Failing to properly diagnose and treat people with bipolar disorder is wasting billions of pounds a year in the UK, according to new data shared exclusively with the BBC. Experts say many of the estimated million people living with this condition are \"ghosts in the system\", whose lives are being torn apart by poorly managed extreme suicidal lows or manic, erratic highs.",
      "Emma was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in her early 30s, after experiencing a mental health crisis.",
      "When she was 32 weeks pregnant, her grandmother died unexpectedly, sending her into a \"deep low\". \"I felt awful, but the perinatal team wouldn't take me on,\" she says. \"They said my symptoms weren't that serious.\"",
      "When Emma gave birth, the extreme lows of her pregnancy were replaced by an unexpected high. She felt amazing in the days after her baby was born - but she didn't sleep and her behaviour became increasingly erratic.",
      "A few weeks later, her mood flipped again. When her baby was three weeks old, Emma took an overdose.",
      "It took a week in hospital for her liver function to return. But even after that, she was in and out of hospital for a year before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and medicated correctly.",
      "\"If I had the correct care, and been listened to during my pregnancy or even earlier, I could have avoided taking that overdose - 100%,\" she says.",
      "It wasn't Emma's first experience of poor mental health - she'd spent her teens seeing doctors and receiving different antidepressants. No one had ever suggested she might have bipolar disorder.",
      "Experts have told the BBC how most people living with bipolar disorder in the UK are \"undertreated, undiagnosed and left to try and survive in a system that has failed them\".",
      "The majority who, like Emma, are eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder, are incorrectly prescribed antidepressants initially, which may make their symptoms worse rather than better. Experts also say there is a lack of continuity of care from GPs through to psychiatrists.",
      "Their warning comes as data exclusively shared with the BBC suggests the cost of the condition in the UK is now an estimated \u00a39.6bn a year. That equates to more than \u00a3300 per taxpayer.",
      "This breakdown includes NHS costs, such as GP services, psychiatrist appointments and visits to A&E and hospital admissions. It also includes economic costs, such as lost days at work and the need for family and friends to take time off to provide informal care.",
      "But it does not include welfare payments for those out of work, or costs for police services dealing with people in crisis.",
      "'Common, complex and costly'",
      "\"This nearly \u00a310bn figure is actually quite conservative,\" says Prof Judit Simon, from the Medical University of Vienna, who worked with the BBC to generate the number.",
      "\"If this is a government that really wants to try and bring down the welfare bill, then bipolar disorder should be its absolute priority, the target disorder to actually move the dial.\"",
      "The data suggests up to 372,000 people with bipolar disorder are currently out of work, with some claiming benefits in the UK.",
      "For a treatable disease, this number could be slashed if the correct care was on offer, say experts.",
      "Prof Guy Goodwin, emeritus professor of psychiatry at University of Oxford, says: \"If you want to cut the costs of a disease, you need to reduce hospital admissions and emergency care. If you don't focus on cutting hospital admissions then you waste money.\"",
      "According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych), bipolar disorder is a manageable condition.",
      "Dr Trudi Seneviratne, registrar at the RCPsych and a commissioner on the Bipolar Commission, says it is \"completely treatable\" with a combination of medication, talking therapies and lifestyle factors.",
      "\"But there are many, many people who are suffering in silence with lower levels of symptoms because there isn't a good clinical care pathway for them in the UK.\"",
      "She says if care for bipolar disorder was fit for purpose, it would cut \"the cost to society\" as well as reducing \"the human suffering this disease unnecessarily causes\".",
      "It is this sense of waste - with people who could be leading a good life but aren't - that angers experts most, who say it is a neglected diagnosis.",
      "Prof Allan Young, from Imperial College, says: \"Bipolar is common, complex and costly - but it is so often unrecognised.",
      "\"People know it is there but somehow people are just not being cared for correctly.\"",
      "This lack of correct care is what Rosie says resulted in her being arrested at Stansted Airport for jumping the security barriers during a manic episode in her early 20s.",
      "\"I was utterly delusional,\" she says. Following her arrest, Rosie was taken to A&E and locked in a room. She waited there for more than 12 hours while a bed at a specialist mental health unit was found.",
      "Like Emma, Rosie had been dealing with mental health issues since childhood, but it was only after being in crisis that her condition was recognised. This particular period of psychotic mania had been triggered by a relationship breakdown.",
      "She was sectioned and hospitalised for three months, after which she finally began finding a combination of medications that worked for her.",
      "Now 29, Rosie says she still has high and low periods, but adds that she is far more stable and is able to work part time.",
      "\"I was failed,\" she says. \"I'm told my symptoms were a textbook case for bipolar lows and highs \u2013 energetic, grandiose language, erratic \u2013 but no one even considered this diagnosis for me until I was sectioned.\"",
      "Costs could be halved",
      "The Maudsley Hospital, in South London, has an intensive specialist care programme for its sickest, most regularly relapsing bipolar patients. The service aims to try and stop patients hitting crisis point.",
      "Similar to services offered in other European nations, the hospital provides group sessions for patients and their families. The classes help patients to understand when an episode might be starting and then contact the service once they spot early warning signs.",
      "They can then attend an outpatient clinic and adjust medications. The relatively cheap programme has seen re-admission rates to hospital fall by 80% as intervention takes place before a crisis.",
      "Prof Young says costs associated with bipolar disorder could be halved with more specialist care programmes.",
      "\"Undoubtedly, specialist treatment could contribute to getting lots of people back into work. And we know that work is very good for helping people recover from episodes of mental ill health.\"",
      "However, many experts say patients still face a postcode lottery about whether they can see a psychiatrist at all.",
      "Carolyn Chew-Graham, a GP and professor of general practice research at Keele University, says those who are acutely unwell will be picked up quickly by crisis teams but those with \"less florid manic episodes\" can miss out on referral to specialists for diagnosis.",
      "\"There's a high threshold of referral,\" Prof Chew Graham says. \"People really have to be quite unwell before they are seen in specialist services\". She says GPs may be reluctant to refer patients - even if they strongly suspect they have bipolar disorder - for fear they will be rejected.",
      "\"GPs may think I won't even consider bipolar because if I mention it to the patient and then I can't get them seen, I am a bit stuck\".",
      "Prof Young says bipolar patients need long-term specialist care.",
      "\"But that's the frustration here - even though there is strong evidence that specialist care improves the outcomes for the patient, and costs the state less, there are still so few bipolar specialist facilities.",
      "\"It's a tragedy.\"",
      "An NHS spokesperson said bipolar disorder could often take time to diagnose because it affected everyone differently and the symptoms were similar to other mental health conditions.",
      "\"NHS staff are working incredibly hard to get people diagnosed and reduce waiting times for care.",
      "\"Staff are treating a million more people than they were six years ago and are working to transform services alongside this demand \u2013 this includes strengthening community services, trialling new 24/7 open access mental health centres and rolling out mental health crisis lines.\"",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care says it has already announced \u00a326 million to open new mental health crisis centres and it will recruit 8,500 mental health workers to cut waiting times and provide faster treatment.",

    "summary": "Research suggests the synthetic hair used for braiding could be bad for you - but will that stop women using it?",
    "story": [
      "Braids are one of the most popular hairstyles for black women, worn by celebrities and aunties alike - but questions are being raised about its effects on our health.",
      "The process can last up to five hours as stylists deftly part small, evenly-spaced sections of hair, and gradually add in extensions.",
      "Despite the long salon visits, braids have always been closely linked to convenience for me.",
      "Growing up, they were for holidays, as the style meant that instead of fretting over how frizzy my hair would get, I could jump in the pool with no worries.",
      "Braids are still what I turn to now when I want a few months break from all the detangling - or I want to try a new colour without the potential damage of hair dye.",
      "But a new study suggests that the synthetic hair many black women use to achieve this style could be bad for their health.",
      "The US non-profit organisation Consumer Reports tested samples from ten of the most popular brands of synthetic braiding hair, and found that all of them contained carcinogens, and in some cases, lead.",
      "The research made an impact, as my Instagram feed and WhatsApp groups were flooded with links to the study, warning of the alleged risks hidden in our hair.",
      "One of the messages was from my cousin, Rochelle, who does her braids herself every other month.",
      "\"Braids, famously, are called a protective style,\" she later told me.",
      "It's a term typically used to describe several Afro hairstyles, including braids, locs and wigs, that reduce how much your hair is exposed to the elements and cut back on constant styling.",
      "\"The fact that this style is doing everything but protect us - it's actually harming us - is actually quite wild to me.\"",
      "It is the lack of awareness among black women that is most concerning, she adds.",
      "\"People that are eating unhealthy food or smoking, they know that what they're doing could harm their body, whereas if you're putting braids in your hair, you're not thinking that it's harming you.\"",
      "James Rogers, the head of product safety testing at Consumer Reports, says that the results are a cause for concern because women have \"constant contact\" with harmful chemicals if their hair is in braids, often for months at a time.",
      "\"We believe that whenever you're exposed to harmful chemicals, that it's cumulative - it all adds up.\"",
      "But he also emphasised that more research was needed, saying: \"We're hoping that this begins the conversation, not only at the regulatory level, but also amongst our own communities, about sharing accurate information.\"",
      "Here at Jos\u00e9e's Professional Braiding Studio in north London, the study certainly isn't putting clients off.",
      "Jos\u00e9e and her daughters Abigail and Naomi, who work with her in the salon, have seen interest from new customers, especially after they helped to create the wig worn by Elphaba in Wicked, one of highest-grossing movies of 2024.",
      "\"People were shocked by how versatile we can be with our braiding,\" Abigail tells me, adding that her mum received several messages from clients telling them how proud they were.",
      "Jos\u00e9e says that while the findings are \"worrying\", it has been business as usual at the salon.",
      "Some of her customers, however, have been rattled by the research.",
      "It's Kellie-Ann's first time getting her braids done at Jos\u00e9e's salon, but she has been wearing the style since she was a child.",
      "She tells me she felt betrayed after reading the study: \"I think it's awful that companies have been doing this for years to black women and I think we deserve better.\"",
      "She's now seeking out brands free from harmful chemicals and plastic - and says many of her friends are doing the same.",
      "\"A lot of women I've spoken to about it have agreed that biogradable would be better - it's good for the planet as well.\"",
      "Ifeanyi has also worn braids since childhood, and says they are the easiest and most convenient style to handle while she's busy studying at university.",
      "She argues that the study is not alarming, pointing out that people may come into contact with carcinogens every day, in certain processed foods, alcohol and tobacco.",
      "\"Obviously you want be cautious - I just think that it's not necessarily something to completely abandon the style or the hair for.\"",
      "She's concerned that the social media posts she has seen will \"scare people out of wanting to engage\", to the detriment of a critical source of income for black entrepreneurs working in the hair industry.",
      "In 2021 Treasure Tress, a UK-based beauty subscription for black hair, found that black British women spent \u00a3168m a year on hair products. Earlier research by L'Oreal suggested that black women in the UK spend six times more on their hair than white women.",
      "\"I'd like to see more of a commitment to making sure that things are safer for us, rather than telling us that some of our historical, traditional practices as black women are wrong,\" Ifeanyi says.",
      "For some, changing attitudes towards synthetic hair are opening up business opportunities.",
      "Tendai Moyo co-founded Ruka Hair in 2021, which specialises in extensions made from natural hair sourced from South East Asia, as well as biodegradable synthetic hair, made from collagen fibre.",
      "She tells me they have seen a \"huge uptick in demand\", especially in the US, where the study was published.",
      "But she sees this as part of a wider trend, which stretches beyond concerns raised by the new research.",
      "\"We launched in the pandemic, and people were like, 'Oh, but salons are closed', but we were selling out because people don't stop doing their hair.\"",
      "She tells me that black women \"got to experiment\" more with their hair during lockdown and were more willing to try out new products.",
      "One of the biggest draws of traditional synthetic hair brands, however, is their low price, which has made experimenting with different styles and colours affordable for years.",
      "But newer brands tend to have a higher price point - Tendai tells me that Ruka's most popular synthetic hair type costs around 2.5 times more than several high street brands.",
      "Ifeanyi says that, as a student, brands like Ruka are out of reach for her: \"To purchase the hair is equivalent to the amount it would cost you to get the hairstyle done, so you're essentially doubling the price.\"",
      "Tendai defends this by comparing it to choosing between \"fast food and healthy food\".",
      "She adds: \"You can actually reuse our products if you'd like, and therefore you're saving money in that way.\"",
      "Back at Jos\u00e9e's salon, Naomi tells me that braiding is not just an important source of income, but a valued cultural practice that brings her family together.",
      "\"I call myself a braid baby because I've been braiding since I was 6 years old,\" she says, telling me how her family would bond over the skill as her mum proudly looks on.",
      "\"It's an empowering service to offer,\" she adds, saying that it's gratifying to do a job that leaves other women feeling uplifted.",
      "Despite growing concerns about the effect it could have on our health, braiding is a precious heirloom for this family - and for many other black women - passed down from generation to generation.",

    "story": [
      "It's 10am, and in a little over two hours, Wayne Hawkins will be dead.",
      "The sun is shining on the bungalow where the 80-year-old lives in San Diego, California with his wife of more than five decades, Stella.",
      "I knock on the door and meet his children - Emily, 48, and Ashley, 44 - who have spent the last two weeks at their father's side.",
      "Wayne sits in a reclining chair where he spends most of his days. Terminally ill, he is too weak to leave the house.",
      "He has invited BBC News to witness his death under California's assisted dying laws - if MPs in London vote to legalise the practice in England and Wales, it will allow some terminally ill people here to die in a similar way.",
      "Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing",
      "Half an hour after arriving at Wayne's house, I watch him swallow three anti-nausea tablets, designed to minimise the risk of him vomiting the lethal medication he plans to take shortly.",
      "Are you sure this day is your last, I ask him? \"I'm all in,\" he replies. \"I was determined and decided weeks ago - I've had no trepidation since then.\"",
      "His family ask for one last photo, which I take, and you can see at the top of this page. As usual, Stella and Wayne are holding hands.",
      "Shortly after, Dr Donnie Moore arrives. He has got to know the family over the past few weeks, visiting them on several occasions alongside running his own end-of-life clinic. Under California law, he is what is known as the attending physician who must confirm, in addition to a second doctor, that Wayne is eligible for aid in dying.",
      "Dr Moore's role is part physician, part counsellor in this situation, one he has been in for 150 assisted deaths before.",
      "On a top shelf in Wayne's bedroom sits a brown glass bottle containing a fine white powder - a mixture of five drugs, sedatives and painkillers, delivered to the house four weeks before. The dosage of drugs inside is hundreds of times higher than those used in regular healthcare and is \"guaranteed\" to be fatal, Dr Moore explains. Unlike California, the proposed law at Westminster would require a doctor to bring any such medication with them.",
      "When Wayne signals he is ready, the doctor mixes the meds with cherry and pineapple juice to soften the bitter taste - and he hands this pink liquid to Wayne.",
      "No one, not even the doctor, knows how long it will take him to die after taking the lethal drugs. Dr Moore explains to me that, in his experience, death usually occurs between 30 minutes and two hours of ingestion, but on one occasion it took 17 hours.",
      "This is the story of how and why Wayne chose to die. And why others have decided not to follow the same course.",
      "We first met the couple a few weeks earlier, when Wayne explained why he was going ahead with the decision to have an assisted death - a controversial measure in other parts of the world.",
      "\"Some days the pain is almost more than I can handle,\" he said. \"I just don't see any merit to dying slow and painfully, hooked up with stuff - intubation, feeding tubes,\" he told me. \"I want none of it.\"",
      "Wayne said he had watched two relatives die \"miserable\", \"heinous\" deaths from heart failure.",
      "\"I hate hospitals, they are miserable. I will die in the street first.\"",
      "Wayne met Stella in 1969; the couple married four years later. He told us it was something of an arranged marriage, as his mother kept inviting Stella for dinner until eventually the penny dropped that he should take her out.",
      "They lived for many years in Arcata, northern California, surrounded by sweeping forests of redwood trees, where Wayne worked as a landscape architect, while Stella was a primary school teacher. They spent their holidays hiking and camping with their children.",
      "Now Wayne is terminally ill with heart failure, which has already brought him close to death. He has myriad other health issues including prostate cancer, liver failure and sepsis which brings him serious spinal pain.",
      "He is expected to live less than six months, qualifying him for an assisted death in California. His request to die has been approved by two doctors and the lethal medication is self-administered.",
      "It was during our first meeting that he asked the BBC to return to observe his final day, saying he wanted terminally ill adults in the UK to have the same right to an assisted death as him.",
      "\"Britain is pretty good with freedoms and this is just another one,\" he said. \"People should be able to choose the time of their death as long as they meet the rules like six months to live or less.\"",
      "Stella, 78, supports his decision. \"I've known him for over 50 years. He's a very independent man. He's always known what he wants to do and he's always fixed things. That's how he's operating now. If this is his choice, I definitely agree, and I've seen him really suffer with the illness he's got. I don't want that for him.\"",
      "Wayne would also qualify under the proposed new assisted dying law in England and Wales. The measures return to the House of Commons later this month, when all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on changes to the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill.",
      "The proposed legislation, tabled by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, says that anyone who wants to end their life must have the mental capacity to make the choice, that they must be expected to die within six months, and must make two separate declarations - witnessed and signed - about their wish to die. They must satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible.",
      "MPs in Westminster voted in favour of assisted dying in principle last November but remain bitterly divided on the issue. If they ultimately decide to approve the bill, it could become law within the next year and come into practice within the next four years.",
      "A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line",
      "There are also divisions here in California, where assisted dying was introduced in 2016. Michelle and Mike Carter, both 72 and married for 43 years, are each being treated for cancer - Mike has prostate cancer that has spread to his lymph nodes, and Michelle's advanced terminal ovarian cancer has spread throughout much of her body.",
      "\"I held my mother's hand when she passed; I held my father's hand when he passed,\" Michelle told me. \"I believe there's freedom of choice however for me, I choose palliative care\u2026 I have God and I have good medicine.\"",
      "Michelle's physician, palliative care specialist Dr Vincent Nguyen, argued that assisted dying laws in the US state lead to \"silent coercion\" whereby vulnerable people think their only option is to die. \"Instead of ending people's lives, let's put programmes together to care for people,\" he said. \"Let them know that they're loved, they're wanted and they're worthy.\"",
      "He said the law meant that doctors have gone from being seen as healers to killers, while the message from the healthcare system was that \"you are better off dead, because you're expensive and your death is cheaper for us\".",
      "Some disability campaigners say assisted dying makes them feel unsafe. Ingrid Tischer, who has muscular dystrophy and chronic respiratory failure, told me: \"The message that it sends to people with disabilities in California is that you deserve suicide assistance rather than suicide prevention when you voice a desire to end your life.",
      "\"What does that say about who we are as a culture?\"",
      "Critics often say that once assisted dying is legalised, over time the safeguards around such laws get eroded as part of a \"slippery slope\" towards more relaxed criteria. In California, there was initially a mandatory 15-day cooling off period between patients making a first and second request for aid in dying. That has been reduced to 48 hours because many patients were dying during the waiting period. It's thought the approval process envisaged in Westminster would take around a month.",

      "Outside Wayne's house on the morning of his death, a solitary bird begins its loud and elaborate song. \"There's that mockingbird out there,\" Wayne tells Stella, as smiles flicker across their faces.",
      "Wayne hates the bird because it keeps him awake at night, Stella jokes, hand in hand with him to one side of his chair. Emily and Ashley are next to Stella.",
      "Dr Moore, seated on Wayne's other side, hands him the pink liquid which he swallows without hesitation. \"Goodnight,\" he says to his family - a typical touch of humour from a man who told us he was determined to die on his terms. It's 11.47am.",
      "After two minutes, Wayne says he is getting sleepy. Dr Moore asks him to imagine he is walking in a vast sea of flowers with a soft breeze on his skin, which seems appropriate for a patient who has spent much of his life among nature.",
      "After three minutes Wayne enters a deep sleep from which he will never wake. On a few occasions he lifts his head to take a deep breath without opening his eyes, at one point beginning to snore softly.",
      "Dr Moore tells the family this is \"the deepest sleep imaginable\" and reassures Emily there is no chance her dad will wake up and ask, \"did it work?\"",
      "\"Oh that would be just like him,\" Stella says with a laugh.",
      "The family start to reminisce about hiking holidays and driving around in a large van they converted to become a camper. \"Me and dad insulated it and put a bed in the back,\" says Ashley.",
      "On the walls are photos of Emily and Ashley as small children next to huge carved Halloween pumpkins.",
      "Dr Moore is still stroking Wayne's hand and occasionally checking his pulse. For a man who Emily says was \"always walking, always outdoors, always active\", these are the final moments of life's journey, spent surrounded by those who mean most to him.",
      "At 12.22pm Dr Moore says, \"I think he's passed\u2026 He's at peace now.\"",
      "Outside, the mockingbird has fallen silent. \"No more pain,\" says Stella, embracing her children in her arms.",

      "I have been covering medical ethics for the BBC for more than 20 years. In 2006, I was present just outside an apartment in Zurich where Dr Anne Turner, a retired doctor, died with the help of the group Dignitas - but California was the first time I had been an eyewitness to an assisted death.",

      "The inquiry heard evidence of \"egregious hazards\" to children, including serious damp, mould, and mice infestations, and families living in temporary housing for years.",
      "Florence Eshalomi, the Labour MP who leads the committee, told the BBC evidence showing the deaths of 74 children had been linked to temporary housing \"should shock all of us\".",
      "\"That should send alarm bells ringing,\" she said. \"What was most shocking as well was the fact that over 58 of those young children were under the age of one. Where have we gone wrong?\"",
      "Eshalomi said when she was a child, she once lived in temporary accommodation filled with damp.",
      "She said: \"I think about what I went through as a young person and it pains me to think that many years later now as an MP, I see that still happening in the constituency I represent.\"",
      "In its report, the committee set out recommendations, including requiring councils to check housing is safe to be used as temporary accommodation.",
      "Another key recommendation was the proposal to give more powers to the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman, which investigates complaints about the treatment of people placed in temporary housing.",
      "In response to the inquiry, a government spokesperson said the findings were shocking, adding that the government was taking \"urgent action to fix the broken system we inherited, investing nearly \u00a31bn in homelessness services this year to help families trapped in temporary accommodation\".",
      "They said: \"Alongside this, we are developing a long-term strategy to tackle homelessness, driving up housing standards and delivering the biggest boost in social and affordable homes in a generation.\"",
      "In extreme cases, the ombudsman can ask councils to compensate people whose complaints are upheld - and data shared with the BBC shows a marked rise in those payouts.",
      "Last year, the ombudsman upheld 176 complaints against councils and recommended 144 payouts in those cases.",
      "The number of payouts last year - some worth thousands of pounds - was greater than the 121 in 2022-23 and the 73 in 2021-22.",

      "At one stage, she and her children slept overnight in her car when they had nowhere else to go.",
      "\"I think the one thing as a parent, you just put a roof over your children's head,\" Sam said.",
      "\"That for me, is just basic, and I couldn't even do that. I got a good job. I was in full-time employment, and the kids were in school and everything.\"",
      "The ombudsman said the council eventually placed them in unsuitable interim accommodation, which was too far from her children's school and her workplace.",
      "\"It was like 33 miles in total and it took us sort of an hour each way,\" Sam said.",
      "Sam said the council did not take account of her child's need to continue attending the primary school where she received specialist support.",
      "She said the flat itself was \"horrendous\" and claimed neighbours were regularly taking drugs near her front door.",
      "The ombudsman said the council did not respond properly to Sam's reports about delays in getting repairs done in this accommodation and incidents when she was threatened and physically assaulted by neighbours.",
      "Sam and her children were allocated alternative accommodation in September 2022 but she had to wait three months before she could move in.",
      "She accused the council of leaving her \"in such a vulnerable situation that it was just so dangerous\" and said the experience still affects her children to this day.",
      "A council spokesperson said a national housing shortage meant offering homeless residents temporary accommodation they \"would not have chosen for themselves\".",
      "The spokesperson said: \"We accept that mistakes were made in this case and extend our apology to this resident, recognising the continued understandable disquiet this experience has had.",
      "\"It is important to note Bromley Council co-operated fully with the ombudsman's investigation, which was two years ago, and agreed with the proposed remedial action, which has been fully implemented and lessons have been learnt.\"",
      "Cameron Black, a spokesman for the ombudsman, said the payouts recognise \"the gravity of the injustice that's caused to the individuals in these cases\".",
      "He said there was a growing but small number of councils who are resistant to the ombudsman's findings and recommendations.",
      "He said the ombudsman is calling for more powers to monitor whether councils are meeting their legal duties to support homeless people.",

    "story": [
      "London Luton Airport said it hoped to almost double annual passenger numbers to 32 million by 2043 after the government approved expansion plans, including a new terminal.",
      "The approval came despite a Planning Inspectorate recommendation that Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander should reject the proposals due to environmental concerns.",
      "Luton Rising, the airport's owner, said the decision could bring \"significant economic, employment and social benefits for our town\".",
      "However, environmental campaigners said \"with climate change worsening, the last thing any of us need is 70,000 more aircraft a year\".",
      "Luton was the UK's fifth busiest airport last year, with 16.9 million people travelling on 132,000 flights.",
      "The expansion plans involve building a new terminal, new taxiways and increasing capacity in the existing terminal, from its current 18 million passengers a year.",
      "'Vital infrastructure'",
      "A spokesman for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"pleased\" with the decision.",
      "He said: \"Improving our national infrastructure is critical to achieving growth and delivering jobs across the country, and this decision will help us deliver growth as part of our plan for change.",
      "\"This step underlines the government's commitment to unlocking vital infrastructure and backing growth.\"",
      "The expansion decision had been delayed three times, most recently so newly appointed Alexander could have more time to consider the application.",
      "Paul Kehoe, independent chair of Luton Rising, which is owned by Luton Borough Council, said up to 11,000 new jobs would be created.",
      "He said this was along with \"additional annual economic activity of up to \u00a31.5bn\".",
      "The announcement came less than a week after Vauxhall's van-making factory in Luton was closed by parent company Stellantis, putting up to 1,100 jobs at risk.",
      "Meanwhile the airport expansion became the latest to be backed by the government, which has made growth a priority.",
      "Alexander said she was \"minded to approve\" a second runway at Gatwick Airport in February, while Chancellor Rachel Reeves has backed a third runway at Heathrow.",
      "Andrew Lambourne, of campaign group LADACAN, said the government ignored the concerns of local people.",
      "He said many felt the application was \"out-of-keeping\" with the area, adding: \"People living under the flight path are already at risk of health damage from being awoken by night flights, so adding 70% more is inhumane.\"",
      "Countryside charity CPRE added the expansion made \"a mockery\" of the government's \"commitment to reaching net zero by 2030\".",
      "One of the concerns expressed by the examining authority, on behalf of the Planning Inspectorate, was disruption to the \"relative tranquility\" of the Chilterns.",
      "It was understood the expansion plan would mean a plane flying over the area up to once every 15 minutes, compared with once every half an hour currently.",
      "Mr Kehoe, from Luton Rising, said the airport had introduced limits on noise and greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "Marion Geoffroy, managing director of Wizz Air, said she hoped the company, which is the airport's largest operator, could continue to grow.",
      "\"We are absolutely confident, looking at the trends of the last few years, that there will be enough demand for us to put more capacity in Luton airport,\" she said.",
      "But operators will be competing for the new space. Earlier this week, Jet2 began to offer routes for the first time.",
      "Ms Geoffroy insisted \"competition is good\", adding: \"We are delighted the airport can offer more capacity, but we will be competing for sure.\"",
      "King's Walden Parish Council, which covers several villages near the airport, said it was \"hugely disappointed by the decision.\"",
      "It said: \"This development will negatively impact the rural communities of Breachwood Green, Tea Green and permanently destroy landscapes. This is on top of causing increased noise, sound and air pollution.",

      "Premiership rugby union clubs accounted for 57% (\u00a3124m) of the DCMS's total loans of \u00a3218m to sports bodies during the pandemic. Rugby league (\u00a324.2m), horse racing (\u00a321.5m) and tennis (\u00a314.3m) were the next highest beneficiaries, while non-league football clubs received \u00a313.4m.",
      "But with then-Premiership clubs London Irish, Wasps and Worcester all going out of business during the 2022-23 campaign, the taxpayer has been left out of pocket by tens of millions of pounds in unrecovered loans.",
      "\"DCMS insisted that these clubs were financially viable when it awarded the loans, despite public reports at the time to the contrary,\" said the PAC.",
      "Noting that some borrowers had been granted \"repayment holidays\" of up to four years, the PAC said that loans \"should not be extended to provide support for bodies which are financially unviable five years post-pandemic\".",
      "The report recommends that the DCMS \"should demonstrate a tough approach on behalf of taxpayers to managing those borrowers in trouble, including when considering any future additional financial support\".",
      "'Concerning and avoidable'",
      "Last month, government officials defended the loans to professional rugby union clubs.",
      "But with both Newcastle and Exeter both recently seeking investment, they also admitted being increasingly pessimistic over the financial stability of the club game.",
      "The last set of accounts filed by all Premiership clubs in 2022-23 showed that the sides collectively lost \u00a330.5m and have net debts of more than \u00a3300m, amid fears that the finances of elite club are unsustainable.",
      "The most senior DSMS civil servant - permanent secretary Susannah Storey - told the PAC that her department would use \"all financial levers\" to recover the money owed to it.",
      "However in its report, the PAC says that Storey has \"a conflict of interest regarding rugby union\", because her husband Pev Hooper is on the board of Premiership Rugby, and is also a director at CVC Capital Partners - a major investor in the sport.",
      "\"She has properly declared this conflict and recused herself from relevant discussions and decisions, and the department has put in place arrangements involving other staff to handle the conflict\", says the PAC.",
      "\"However, the department is most heavily exposed to rugby union in terms of both the amount of loans it has made and the financial health of the sport. The conflict of interest meant that we could not question the Permanent Secretary directly about the \u00a3124m that the department had loaned to top-tier rugby union clubs and its subsequent management of these loans.\"",
      "It adds that \"this gap in senior oversight and accountability for such a significant amount of public money is concerning and avoidable. It strikes this committee as odd that the department has not taken steps to address this such as by asking another Permanent Secretary to provide scrutiny and assurance\".",
      "The PAC published correspondence it had received from Storey in which she said that \"it is not accurate to state that there is a gap in accountability\" because relevant decision-making had been delegated to colleagues in line with guidelines.",
      "She also said that it was wrong to say the DCMS was \"overly optimistic\" about recouping all the funding because it had made clear that as it expected 14% of borrowers to fail over a 10-year period.",
      "'Inconsistent approach'",
      "The PAC also said the DCMS has shown \"an inconsistent approach to its engagement with professional sports.\"",
      "\"The department says it took a common approach when lending to borrowers in different sports, but, in our view, its subsequent actions display different approaches in practice,\" it said.",
      "\"It has appointed consultants and engaged with the Rugby Football Union, the Premier Rugby League and CVC Capital Partners on the future of rugby union.",
      "\"In contrast, the department was less certain about the extent of engagement by itself and Sport England with professional basketball over proposed structural changes to the game that could put at risk repayment of the last outstanding loans from four of the 11 professional clubs that received loans.",
      "\"When the department did provide us with more information, it was clear to us that it has been less engaged with basketball than with professional rugby union.\""

      "Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has said she will review the role of the Sentencing Council following a \"two-tier\" justice row over its latest guidelines.",
      "Labour and the Conservatives have criticised the council's plan to advise judges in England and Wales to seek extra information before deciding how to punish offenders from certain minority groups.",
      "The guidelines have now been abandoned after ministers tabled an emergency law to override them on Tuesday.",

      "There is already a review of the sentencing system under way, led by former Conservative justice secretary David Gauke and aimed tackling prison overcrowding.",
      "It is not currently clear how the two reviews will interact.",
      "The guidelines were set to advise magistrates and judges to obtain a pre-sentence report - giving further details of an offender's background - before handing out punishment to someone of an ethnic or faith minority, alongside other groups such as young adults, abuse survivors and pregnant women.",
      "Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick first raised concerns about the guidelines earlier this month, saying they were biased \"against straight white men\" and amounted to \"two-tier justice\".",
      "In response, Mahmood said she also opposed a \"two-tier sentencing approach\" and that she \"did not stand for any differential treatment before the law\".",
      "The Sentencing Council had argued the now-suspended guidelines, which had been in development for months, would ensure courts had the \"most comprehensive information available\" to hand out an appropriate sentence.",
      "This, the council said, could address disadvantages faced within the criminal justice system.",
      "Official figures show that offenders from ethnic minorities consistently get longer sentences than white offenders for indictable offences.",
      "'Preferential treatment'",
      "Updating MPs on Tuesday, Mahmood said: \"The proper role of the Sentencing Council and the process for making guidelines of this type must be considered further.",
      "\"I will do so in the coming months. It is right that this question is considered in greater depth,\" she said.",
      "She added that \"should further legislation be required,\" she would propose it as part of the government's planned Sentencing Bill.",
      "\"The Sentencing Council, while only 15 years old, holds an important position within the firmament of our justice system and any changes must be made carefully and with due consideration,\" she told MPs.",
      "Parliament \"must reverse\" the guidelines and reassert \"that no race or religion should receive preferential treatment before the law,\" she said.",
      "Mahmood will also pilot the Sentencing Guidelines (Pre-sentence reports) Bill through Parliament after it was published on Tuesday.",
      "If passed, the bill would prevent future sentencing guidelines about pre-sentence reports \"framed by reference to different personal characteristics of an offender\".",

      "He described the Sentencing Council as an \"activist\" quango, or quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation, whose views were \"completely divergent to the public, to Parliament, and to the government.\"",
      "He called on the government to back his plan require ministerial approval of any future Sentencing Council guidelines.",
      "Veteran Labour MP Dianne Abbott said she was \"astonished\" that Mahmood thought judges could be swayed by \"guidelines in relation to how they sentence black and brown defendants\".",
      "\"Repeated statistical analysis has demonstrated what some of us consider to be unfairness in relation to black and brown people, and the criminal justice system,\" she said.",

      "He told MPs of how he had asked officials and ministers for further details on what he would be required to do on several occasions.",
      "In a phone call on 14 February with a Home Office official, Mr Crowther asked: \"Do you still want me?\"",
      "In response, he said he was told the framework for locally-led inquiries would be drafted by ministers and advisers but his comments would be \"welcome\".",
      "He said the official assured him there would be a follow-up email the following day but this never came.",
      "Mr Crowther said he was now due to have a meeting with the Home Office on Wednesday.",
      "He said he had taken it upon himself to meet the Oldham council leader and last month it was confirmed he would lead the inquiry there.",
      "But Mr Crowther told MPs he was unsure whether the locations of the other locally-led inquiries would be announced by Easter.",
      "A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"The government is committed to doing everything it can to tackle the horrific crime of child sexual abuse.\"",
      "She said the government would be setting out its progress, including on the recommendations of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, next week.",
      "She added: \"We are working with local areas, including Telford, to draw-up a national framework to support further local inquiries and investigations backed by a \u00a35m fund to help strengthen local responses to child sexual exploitation.\"",
      "A separate nationwide review by Baroness Louise Casey, examining the demographics of grooming gangs and their victims, as well as the \"cultural drivers\" behind the issue, was due to be completed by April.",
      "The Home Office said she had made \"significant progress\" and would present her findings to ministers \"in due course\".",

      "The impact of these tariffs on the world economy will be huge.",

      "Or in the overnight stock market falls, especially in Asia.",
      "But the true measure of these changes will be significant changes to long-standing global avenues of trade.",
      "At its heart this is a universal tariff of 10% on nearly all imports into the US for every country, coming in on Friday night. On top of that dozens of \"worst offenders\" will be charged reciprocally for having trade surpluses.",
      "The tariffs on Asian nations are truly remarkable. They will break the business models of thousands of companies, factories, and possibly entire nations.",
      "Some of the supply chains created by the world's biggest companies will be broken instantly. The inevitable impact will surely be to push them towards China.",
      "Is this just a grand negotiation? Well the US administration appears to be claiming the tariff revenue for planned tax cuts. The scope for quick adjustment seems limited. As one White House official said bluntly: \"This is not a negotiation, it's a national emergency\".",
      "The US's formula for the so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" basically just charges a country for having a goods trade surplus with the US, exporting more to America than it imports. Then even if there is no surplus it whacks up the charge at the universal baseline of 10%.",
      "All this reveals two things. The aim of policy is to reduce the US trade deficit to zero. That is a remarkable rerouting of world trade flows and explains the specific punitive focus on Asia.",
      "Secondly it is clearly the case that bilateral negotiations have not made much of a difference, or in fact any difference.",

    "summary": "Wayne Hawkins believes terminally ill people should be able to die when they choose, but others in the state disagree.",
    "story": [
      "It's 10am, and in a little over two hours, Wayne Hawkins will be dead.",
      "The sun is shining on the bungalow where the 80-year-old lives in San Diego, California with his wife of more than five decades, Stella.",
      "I knock on the door and meet his children - Emily, 48, and Ashley, 44 - who have spent the last two weeks at their father's side.",
      "Wayne sits in a reclining chair where he spends most of his days. Terminally ill, he is too weak to leave the house.",
      "He has invited BBC News to witness his death under California's assisted dying laws - if MPs in London vote to legalise the practice in England and Wales, it will allow some terminally ill people here to die in a similar way.",
      "Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing",
      "Half an hour after arriving at Wayne's house, I watch him swallow three anti-nausea tablets, designed to minimise the risk of him vomiting the lethal medication he plans to take shortly.",
      "Are you sure this day is your last, I ask him? \"I'm all in,\" he replies. \"I was determined and decided weeks ago - I've had no trepidation since then.\"",
      "His family ask for one last photo, which I take, and you can see at the top of this page. As usual, Stella and Wayne are holding hands.",
      "Shortly after, Dr Donnie Moore arrives. He has got to know the family over the past few weeks, visiting them on several occasions alongside running his own end-of-life clinic. Under California law, he is what is known as the attending physician who must confirm, in addition to a second doctor, that Wayne is eligible for aid in dying.",
      "Dr Moore's role is part physician, part counsellor in this situation, one he has been in for 150 assisted deaths before.",
      "On a top shelf in Wayne's bedroom sits a brown glass bottle containing a fine white powder - a mixture of five drugs, sedatives and painkillers, delivered to the house four weeks before. The dosage of drugs inside is hundreds of times higher than those used in regular healthcare and is \"guaranteed\" to be fatal, Dr Moore explains. Unlike California, the proposed law at Westminster would require a doctor to bring any such medication with them.",
      "When Wayne signals he is ready, the doctor mixes the meds with cherry and pineapple juice to soften the bitter taste - and he hands this pink liquid to Wayne.",
      "No one, not even the doctor, knows how long it will take him to die after taking the lethal drugs. Dr Moore explains to me that, in his experience, death usually occurs between 30 minutes and two hours of ingestion, but on one occasion it took 17 hours.",
      "This is the story of how and why Wayne chose to die. And why others have decided not to follow the same course.",
      "We first met the couple a few weeks earlier, when Wayne explained why he was going ahead with the decision to have an assisted death - a controversial measure in other parts of the world.",
      "\"Some days the pain is almost more than I can handle,\" he said. \"I just don't see any merit to dying slow and painfully, hooked up with stuff - intubation, feeding tubes,\" he told me. \"I want none of it.\"",
      "Wayne said he had watched two relatives die \"miserable\", \"heinous\" deaths from heart failure.",
      "\"I hate hospitals, they are miserable. I will die in the street first.\"",
      "Wayne met Stella in 1969; the couple married four years later. He told us it was something of an arranged marriage, as his mother kept inviting Stella for dinner until eventually the penny dropped that he should take her out.",
      "They lived for many years in Arcata, northern California, surrounded by sweeping forests of redwood trees, where Wayne worked as a landscape architect, while Stella was a primary school teacher. They spent their holidays hiking and camping with their children.",
      "Now Wayne is terminally ill with heart failure, which has already brought him close to death. He has myriad other health issues including prostate cancer, liver failure and sepsis which brings him serious spinal pain.",
      "He is expected to live less than six months, qualifying him for an assisted death in California. His request to die has been approved by two doctors and the lethal medication is self-administered.",
      "It was during our first meeting that he asked the BBC to return to observe his final day, saying he wanted terminally ill adults in the UK to have the same right to an assisted death as him.",
      "\"Britain is pretty good with freedoms and this is just another one,\" he said. \"People should be able to choose the time of their death as long as they meet the rules like six months to live or less.\"",
      "Stella, 78, supports his decision. \"I've known him for over 50 years. He's a very independent man. He's always known what he wants to do and he's always fixed things. That's how he's operating now. If this is his choice, I definitely agree, and I've seen him really suffer with the illness he's got. I don't want that for him.\"",
      "Wayne would also qualify under the proposed new assisted dying law in England and Wales. The measures return to the House of Commons later this month, when all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on changes to the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill.",
      "The proposed legislation, tabled by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, says that anyone who wants to end their life must have the mental capacity to make the choice, that they must be expected to die within six months, and must make two separate declarations - witnessed and signed - about their wish to die. They must satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible.",
      "MPs in Westminster voted in favour of assisted dying in principle last November but remain bitterly divided on the issue. If they ultimately decide to approve the bill, it could become law within the next year and come into practice within the next four years.",
      "A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line",
      "There are also divisions here in California, where assisted dying was introduced in 2016. Michelle and Mike Carter, both 72 and married for 43 years, are each being treated for cancer - Mike has prostate cancer that has spread to his lymph nodes, and Michelle's advanced terminal ovarian cancer has spread throughout much of her body.",
      "\"I held my mother's hand when she passed; I held my father's hand when he passed,\" Michelle told me. \"I believe there's freedom of choice however for me, I choose palliative care\u2026 I have God and I have good medicine.\"",
      "Michelle's physician, palliative care specialist Dr Vincent Nguyen, argued that assisted dying laws in the US state lead to \"silent coercion\" whereby vulnerable people think their only option is to die. \"Instead of ending people's lives, let's put programmes together to care for people,\" he said. \"Let them know that they're loved, they're wanted and they're worthy.\"",
      "He said the law meant that doctors have gone from being seen as healers to killers, while the message from the healthcare system was that \"you are better off dead, because you're expensive and your death is cheaper for us\".",
      "Some disability campaigners say assisted dying makes them feel unsafe. Ingrid Tischer, who has muscular dystrophy and chronic respiratory failure, told me: \"The message that it sends to people with disabilities in California is that you deserve suicide assistance rather than suicide prevention when you voice a desire to end your life.",
      "\"What does that say about who we are as a culture?\"",
      "Critics often say that once assisted dying is legalised, over time the safeguards around such laws get eroded as part of a \"slippery slope\" towards more relaxed criteria. In California, there was initially a mandatory 15-day cooling off period between patients making a first and second request for aid in dying. That has been reduced to 48 hours because many patients were dying during the waiting period. It's thought the approval process envisaged in Westminster would take around a month.",
      "'Goodbye,' Wayne tells his family",
      "Outside Wayne's house on the morning of his death, a solitary bird begins its loud and elaborate song. \"There's that mockingbird out there,\" Wayne tells Stella, as smiles flicker across their faces.",
      "Wayne hates the bird because it keeps him awake at night, Stella jokes, hand in hand with him to one side of his chair. Emily and Ashley are next to Stella.",
      "Dr Moore, seated on Wayne's other side, hands him the pink liquid which he swallows without hesitation. \"Goodnight,\" he says to his family - a typical touch of humour from a man who told us he was determined to die on his terms. It's 11.47am.",
      "After two minutes, Wayne says he is getting sleepy. Dr Moore asks him to imagine he is walking in a vast sea of flowers with a soft breeze on his skin, which seems appropriate for a patient who has spent much of his life among nature.",
      "After three minutes Wayne enters a deep sleep from which he will never wake. On a few occasions he lifts his head to take a deep breath without opening his eyes, at one point beginning to snore softly.",
      "Dr Moore tells the family this is \"the deepest sleep imaginable\" and reassures Emily there is no chance her dad will wake up and ask, \"did it work?\"",
      "\"Oh that would be just like him,\" Stella says with a laugh.",
      "The family start to reminisce about hiking holidays and driving around in a large van they converted to become a camper. \"Me and dad insulated it and put a bed in the back,\" says Ashley.",
      "On the walls are photos of Emily and Ashley as small children next to huge carved Halloween pumpkins.",
      "Dr Moore is still stroking Wayne's hand and occasionally checking his pulse. For a man who Emily says was \"always walking, always outdoors, always active\", these are the final moments of life's journey, spent surrounded by those who mean most to him.",
      "At 12.22pm Dr Moore says, \"I think he's passed\u2026 He's at peace now.\"",
      "Outside, the mockingbird has fallen silent. \"No more pain,\" says Stella, embracing her children in her arms.",
      "I step outside to give the family some space, and reflect on what we have just seen and filmed.",
      "I have been covering medical ethics for the BBC for more than 20 years. In 2006, I was present just outside an apartment in Zurich where Dr Anne Turner, a retired doctor, died with the help of the group Dignitas - but California was the first time I had been an eyewitness to an assisted death.",
      "This isn't just a story about one man's death in California - it's about what could become a reality here in England and Wales for those who qualify for an assisted death and choose to die this way.",
      "Whether you're for or against the proposed new Westminster law, the death of a loved one is a deeply personal and emotional time for a family. Each death leaves an imprint, as will Wayne's.",

      "It has now reported though, that the likelihood of a Moon impact on 22 December, 2032, has more than doubled from 1.7% to 3.8%. It based the recalculation on information from telescopes including the James Webb Space Telescope.",

    "story": [
      "Male fruit flies that drink alcohol become more attractive to females, according to a new study.",
      "Adding alcohol to males' food increases their release of chemicals that attract females and leads to higher mating success.",
      "Fruit flies, or Drosophila melanogaster, are often found around our food waste bins as they feed on rotting fruit which gradually produces alcohol.",
      "Scientists have been trying to study why they are attracted to alcohol and how it affects them.",
      "Previous research has studied different theories about this attraction, such as the flies were seeking a euphoric state or a substitute for the high of mating among males rejected by females.",
      "Study author Bill Hansson, head of the Department of Evolutionary Neuroethology at the Max Planck Institute, said such research has taken an anthropomorphic view of fly behaviour, whereas this latest study suggests drinking alcohol gives the flies a reproductive advantage.",
      "\"We don't think flies drink alcohol because they are depressed,\" he said.",
      "The fly's attraction both to the carbohydrates and yeast in rotting fruit, as well as to the alcohol, cannot be separated, he added.",
      "In the study, alcohol, and particularly methanol, increased the males' production and release of chemical sex signals, called pheromones, which made them more attractive to females.",
      "Pheromones are released into the air from one individual to influence the behaviour of another animal of the same species.",
      "Males were therefore strongly attracted to alcohol, especially those males which  had never mated.",
      "The new study also showed that the fly's response to smelling alcohol is controlled by three different neural circuits in its brain.",
      "While two are responsible for attracting male flies to small amounts of alcohol, a third ensures that excessive amounts have a deterrent effect.",
      "Because alcohol is toxic, the fly's brain must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of drinking it, and it does this by balancing signals of attraction with aversion.",
      "\"This means that the flies have a control mechanism that allows them to get all the benefits of alcohol consumption without risking alcohol intoxication,\" lead author Ian Keesey, of the University of Nebraska, said.",
      "For their investigations, the researchers combined physiological studies - such as imaging techniques to visualise processes in the fly brain, chemical analyses of environmental odours, and behavioural studies.",

      "The Environment Agency (EA) has launched a comprehensive review into shipments of waste tyres from the UK to India.",
      "Last week, BBC File on 4 Investigates heard that millions of these tyres - sent for recycling - were actually being \"cooked\" in makeshift furnaces, causing serious health problems and environmental damage.",
      "The pressure group Fighting Dirty has threatened legal proceedings against the EA over what it called a \"lack of action\" over the issue of tyre exports.",
      "The EA has asked the group to wait until its own review is complete, and it has also asked File on 4 Investigates to share the evidence from its investigation.",
      "The UK generates about 50 million waste tyres (nearly 700,000 tonnes) every year. According to official figures, about half of these are exported to India, supposedly to be recycled.",
      "But BBC File on 4 Investigates revealed that some 70% of tyres exported to India from the UK and the rest of the world are being sent to makeshift industrial plants, where they are \"cooked\" in order to extract steel, small amounts of oil as well as carbon black - a powder or pellet that can be used in various industries.",
      "Conditions at these plants - many of which are in rural backwaters - can be toxic and harmful to public health, as well as potentially dangerous.",
      "In January, two women and two children were killed in an explosion at a plant in the western state of Maharashtra, where European-sourced tyres were being processed.",
      "A BBC team visited the site and saw soot, dying vegetation and polluted waterways around. Villagers complained of persistent coughs and eye problems.",
      "Following the broadcast, the Department for the Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) told BBC File on 4 Investigates that officials and lawyers within the EA were \"very keen\" to investigate the claims made in the programme, including any potential criminal activity.",

    "story": [
      "Sewage spilled illegally into England's largest lake on a record number of days last year, an analysis of water company data by campaigners suggests.",
      "The analysis, which the BBC had exclusive access to, used United Utilities operational data to establish when the company was discharging sewage into Windermere when it should by law have been treating some of it.",
      "The campaigners from Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (WASP) and Save Windermere identified 140 illegal spill days in 2024, more than in any of the three previous years.",
      "United Utilities told BBC News that the campaigners' findings were \"inaccurate\" and some of the data \"erroneous\".",
      "The company declined to put in writing, despite repeated requests, any specific examples of mistakes or omissions.",
      "Regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency are both currently investigating United Utilities operations.",
      "Sewage dumped illegally in Windermere over 3 years",
      "Government vows to clean up England's largest lake",
      "Water firm behind spills says fixes will take time",
      "Part of the Lake District National Park Unesco World Heritage Site, Windermere is home to more than 14,000 people and its scenery attracts an estimated seven million visitors per year.",
      "But its pristine image is under threat. Regular discharges of sewage into Windermere have been blamed for increasing nutrient levels and turning parts of the lake green \u2013 so called \"algal blooming.\"",
      "The BBC has regularly reported on discharges into Windermere. Last October it was revealed that a single pumping station had illegally spilled more than 140 million litres of raw sewage between 2020 and 2023. In 2023 BBC Panorama said United Utilities was misreporting pollution incidents.",
      "Earlier in March environment secretary Steve Reed called the amount of pollution entering the lake \"a disgrace\" and pledged to clean it up.",
      "Last week the Environment Agency said United Utilities had spilled 77,817 times in 2024, the highest figure of all England's water companies.",
      "Many of the spills will have been legal. All water companies are legally allowed to discharge raw sewage to stop the network getting overwhelmed and this now happens regularly during periods of heavy rain.",
      "But almost all pumping stations and treatment plants operate under an environmental permit which specify that they must process or \"pass forward\" a certain amount of sewage and rainwater before spilling starts.",
      "The campaigners cross-referenced United Utilities datasets showing when an asset was spilling against how much sewage it was treating at the time. The campaigners' analysis \u2013 which has been shared with and scrutinised by the BBC -  found days when illegal spills appear to have occurred at each of six sewage facilities around the lake, which combined to 140 days in 2024. That's more than in any of the previous three years, as the chart below shows.",
      "The longest illegal spill the analysis identified was for 10 days from Hawkshead pumping station, which flows into Windermere via Cunsey Beck.",
      "\"This is an indication that their works have not been maintained properly or they're not being watched over properly,\" says Prof Peter Hammond, a mathematican and retired academic from campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution.",
      "Prof Hammond's analysis of water company data has been cited by regulators and he has been praised in Parliament by water company executives for bringing problems to light they were previously unaware of.",
      "The latest analysis covers four years of data from six sites that discharge sewage into the Lake Windermere catchment.",
      "Comparisons over a longer time period are impossible as United Utilities has only had made full data sets available since 2021.",
      "The regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency have since 2021 been investigating whether the water companies have been treating enough sewage before they start to spill. The EA call it a \"major criminal investigation\" while Ofwat call it \"the largest and most complex Ofwat has ever undertaken\".",
      "Last week Yorkshire Water agreed to a \u00a340m \"enforcement action\" after Ofwat uncovered \"serious failures\" in how it operated its treatment plant and network.",
      "Ofwat declined to comment on the campaigner's findings as their investigation into United Utilities is ongoing.",
      "In response to concerns about United Utilities the Environment Agency last year reviewed all of its environmental permits in the Windermere catchment and says this led directly to the water company tripling its investment plans for the area to \u00a3200m.",
      "\"We are currently carrying out investigations into suspected pollution incidents on the Windermere catchment and are unable to comment on these in detail until they have reached a conclusion,\" an EA spokesperson said when the campaigners' analysis was shared with them.",
      "\"Where we find breaches of environmental permits, we will take the appropriate enforcement action up to and including a criminal prosecution.\"",
      "United Utilities, which provides services to more than seven million people across north-west England, is more than \u00a39bn in debt. Its chief executive Louise Beardmore confirmed to parliament in February that she was last year paid \u00a31.4m including a bonus of \u00a3420,000.",
      "\"The methodology used by the campaigners is different to that used by the Environment Agency for its compliance assessments,\" the water company said in a statement.",
      "\"On top of that, erroneous data has been used, tags and naming conventions in data sets appear to have been misunderstood, and assumptions seem to have been made on whether different types of flow meters have been installed.\"",
      "\"The methodology fails to use other corroborating information from the sites which would prove that spills did not occur. As a result, the numbers quoted are inaccurate.\"",
      "BBC News presented United Utilities with five examples of illegal spills the campaigners' analysis had identified using the company's data and asked for any evidence or explanation as to why they were not illegal. United Utilities repeatedly declined to do so in writing or on camera.",
      "\"What we're seeing is the failure of privatisation. We're seeing a prioritisation of dividend returns over the long-term environmental protection of places like Windermere\" says Matt Staniek from Save Windermere.",
      "\"The bill payer has paid for a service that has never fully been provided, and the illegality demonstrates that for all to see.\"",
      "Over the next five years bills in the United Utilities area will go up by 32% above the rate of inflation. On average that will mean a rise of \u00a386 for the year that starts in April.",
      "Louise Beardmore said the rises will fund the \"largest investment in water and wastewater infrastructure in over 100 years\".",
      "For Windermere that's set to mean nine wastewater treatment works, including two that were included in the campaigners' analysis being upgraded and a reduction in the number of overflows discharging into the lake.",

    "summary": "Gothenburg has to pay a financial penalty if it misses certain annual sustainability goals.",
    "story": [
      "Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.",
      "Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.",
      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",
      "\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"",
      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",
      "Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.",
      "\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.",
      "\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.",
      "\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"",
      "But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.",
      "\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.",
      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",
      "Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.",
      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",
      "By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.",
      "\"If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.",
      "\"It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.\"",
      "Back in Gothenburg, the city's current environmental and social targets run until 2030. Mr Block says that the detailed yearly SLL reporting shows to potential future investors in the city what a difference their money would make.",
      "\"Banks want to give money to sustainable cities, so packaging up our progress in our SLL reporting is how I make the city beautiful for investors,\" he says.",
      "\"I can't change the credit worthiness of the city, but I can change how investors look at our sustainability work, and make it more attractive to them.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0d047810no",
    "published": "Sat, 29 Mar 2025 10:56:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Just Stop Oil says it will disband but does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
    "story": [
      "The climate action group Just Stop Oil has announced it is to disband at the end of April. Its activists have been derided as attention-seeking zealots and vandals and it is loathed by many for its disruptive direct action tactics. It says it has won because its demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy.  So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
      "Hayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January this year.",
      "The 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.",
      "But Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.",
      "As Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside.",
      "They launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.",
      "It was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.",
      "The reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".",
      "\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.",
      "JSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".",
      "The group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.",
      "But it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.",
      "Just Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.",
      "The spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.",
      "And behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.",
      "It became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.",
      "The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.",
      "The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.",
      "The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.",
      "In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.",
      "Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.",
      "JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.",
      "The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"",
      "And the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.",
      "In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"",
      "That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.",
      "\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.",
      "\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.",
      "JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".",
      "That is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.",
      "JSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.",

      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",

      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",

    "published": "Sat, 29 Mar 2025 10:56:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Just Stop Oil says it will disband but does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
    "story": [
      "The climate action group Just Stop Oil has announced it is to disband at the end of April. Its activists have been derided as attention-seeking zealots and vandals and it is loathed by many for its disruptive direct action tactics. It says it has won because its demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy.  So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
      "Hayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January this year.",
      "The 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.",
      "But Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.",
      "As Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside.",
      "They launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.",
      "It was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.",
      "The reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".",
      "\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.",
      "JSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".",
      "The group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.",
      "But it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.",
      "Just Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.",
      "The spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.",
      "And behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.",
      "It became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.",
      "The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.",
      "The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.",
      "The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.",
      "In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.",
      "Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.",
      "JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.",
      "The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"",
      "And the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.",
      "In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"",
      "That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.",
      "\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.",
      "\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.",
      "JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".",
      "That is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.",
      "JSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.",

      "At any point in the game you can rotate the controller, put it on a surface and use it like a mouse. Fans of PC games will immediately feel at home with this, and it's a neat bit of engineering to be able to switch up on-the-fly without having to enter any menus.",
      "The optical mouse controls pop up elsewhere too, with PC strategy game Civilization VII a game that massively benefits.",
      "But in both cases, I do wonder how long you can play with the controller like this before the ergonomics become an issue. I have to admit I found myself wondering why I wasn't just playing on my PC with mouse controls and a comfortable resting position.",
      "Still, the fact that this is built in to the hardware means we may see the Switch 2 as the obvious home of future PC ports to home consoles.",
      "And there is another trick up Nintendo\u2019s sleeve - both controllers can be held like this and used as mice, opening up some interesting possibilities. In particular, futuristic wheelchair basketball game Drag x Drive, where both \"mice\" are pushed to mimic moving wheels.",
      "Elsewhere, Donkey Kong Bananza will be the first time the ape mascot has had a 3D platforming game of his own in 25 years, so there was some pressure on Nintendo to deliver a game which justified the wait.",
      "For lack of a better term it\u2019s a destruct-em-up - you can destroy much of the floor and scenery in each level.",
      "But there's that dreaded price news again. A digital copy will cost \u00a358.99, while a physical copy retails at \u00a366.99.",

      "She expects that the coming months will see continuing attempts to limit the protests, and \"render them invisible\".",
      "That won't be hard given the government's extensive control of the media here.  The huge demonstrations held so far didn't lead the bulletins on state TV and pro-government outlets, and when they were shown the protesters were referred to as terrorists.",

    "story": [
      "South Korea's president has been removed from office after the Constitutional Court voted unanimously to uphold his impeachment.",
      "Yoon Suk Yeol was suspended from duty in December after being impeached by parliament, following his failed attempt to impose martial law.",
      "The ruling on Friday was met with tears of joy and sadness among Yoon's critics and supporters, who had gathered in various parts of Seoul to watch the verdict live.",
      "A snap election to vote for Yoon's replacement must be held by 3 June.",
      "What next for South Korea?",
      "After months of anxiously waiting, South Koreans have some badly needed closure. The country can now start to repair and move forward, the first step being to elect a new leader.",
      "But the crisis Yoon has unleashed is far from over. Although his military takeover only lasted six hours, the political fallout has only intensified with each month that has passed.",
      "The night of 3 December, when Yoon ordered troops to storm parliament, changed something in South Korea's psyche. It reawakened the ghosts of the country's violent, dictatorial past, showing people that martial law was not, as most had assumed, consigned to history.",
      "Many are still upset by what happened that night, and afraid that the threat of martial law could be brandished again by future zealous politicians.",
      "Today's verdict therefore came as a relief to most, who cheered on the streets of Seoul as the verdict was read out. It is a victory for South Korea's democracy, that for a while looked as if it was on dangerous ground.",
      "The Constitutional Court was damning in its criticism of Yoon's authoritarian power grab, as all eight judges voted to remove him from office.",
      "Moon Hyung-bae, acting president of the bench, said Yoon's short-lived military takeover was not justified, and that he had \"[gone] against the people he was supposed to protect\".",
      "He added that the implementation of martial law \"damaged people's basic political rights\" and \"violated the principles of the rule of law and democracy\".",
      "Already, there are serious calls to change South Korea's constitution \u2013 to strengthen its institutions and limit the powers of the president - to guard against this happening again. However, it will take a particularly patriotic future president to sign off on reducing their own authority.",
      "South Korea more polarised than ever",
      "As Yoon leaves office, he leaves behind not just a shaken country, but a divided one. In the aftermath of that shocking December night, South Koreans were mostly united in their disgust for the president and what he had attempted to do.",
      "But Yoon showed no remorse. He dug in, fought his trial at every step, and continued to dangle the same unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that he used to justify his military takeover.",
      "He claimed that the country and his political opposition had been infiltrated by North Korean and Chinese spies, and that these \"anti-state forces\" had rigged past elections.",
      "Gradually more and more people believed him. To them Yoon is now a political martyr \u2013 the victim of an establishment that had been overrun by \"communists\".",
      "His conspiracy theories have firmly taken root, and far-right extremism is flourishing. Thousands protest every week in the centre of Seoul. They were on the streets on Friday, and will be there again Saturday, claiming the country's politicians and judges are corrupt and elections are rigged.",
      "And these are not fringe views.",
      "More than a third of people now say they do not trust the Constitutional Court which delivered Yoon's verdict; more than a quarter do not trust the voting system.",
      "Within this climate of distrust, South Korea must head to the polls. Yoon's successor needs to be chosen in the next 60 days. These days are sure to be fraught and even more divisive. Many may not accept the result that comes.",
      "Yet South Korea urgently needs a new leader who can advocate for the country as a whole, having been without one for months.",
      "It quickly needs to figure out how to deal with President Trump, having started on the backfoot. His 25% tariffs on cars and steel have dealt Seoul, and its ailing economy, an early a blow, but many believe worse is coming; that it is only time until Trump turns his gaze to the Korean peninsula, and when he does he will try to force South Korea to pay more for its defence and cut a deal with Seoul's arch enemy, Kim Jong Un.",
      "Yoon's legal team has accused the court of politicising the ruling.",
      "\"The whole process of this trial itself was not lawful and unfair,\" said one of his lawyers, Yoon Gap-geun.",
      "\"I feel regrettable that this completely is a political decision,\" he said.",
      "But politicians are calling for unity, asking everyone to accept the verdict, so South Korea can start to move on.",
      "Yoon's political party, the PPP, has conceded, but Yoon himself has not. In a statement he apologised to his supporters for his \"shortcomings\" without mentioning the ruling.",
      "\"I am truly sorry and regretful that I could not live up to your expectations,\" he said.",
      "\"It has been a great honor to serve the Republic of Korea. I am deeply grateful to all of you who supported and encouraged me, despite my many shortcomings,\" he said.",
      "He cannot appeal, as the decision was made by South Korea's top court. But, having repeatedly vowed to fight to the end, he could still refuse to go quietly.",
      "The unravelling of Yoon Suk Yeol: South Korea's 'stubborn and hot-tempered' martial law president",
      "Who is Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's impeached president?",
      "How did we get here?",
      "In an unprecedented televised announcement on 3 December, Yoon said he was invoking martial law to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea.",
      "At the time, the embattled leader was in a deadlock over a budget bill, dogged by corruption scandals and several of his cabinet ministers were under investigation.",
      "Less than two hours after Yoon's declaration, 190 lawmakers who gathered, including some from Yoon's party, voted to overturn it.",
      "Yoon was impeached by parliament and suspended from his duties on 14 December.",
      "He is also facing separate charges for insurrection - making him South Korea's first sitting president to be arrested and charged with a crime - which he will be trialed for at a later date. He is now on bail.",
      "Yoon is not the only South Korean politician to have faced impeachment in recent months.",
      "Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was reinstated as the country's interim leader last month - a role he took up when Yoon was suspended - after he himself was impeached over his move to block the appointment of new judges to the constitutional court.",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 00:49:32 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC's Hugo Bachega explores the future for Hezbollah in the wake of Israel's devastating attacks.",
    "story": [
      "Last year, on 17 September, at around 15:30, a pager which a nurse called Adam was given at the start of his shift at a hospital in Lebanon received a message. The devices had been distributed by Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim group, to thousands of its members, including Adam, and he said it was how he and his colleagues expected to be alerted of emergencies or a disaster.",
      "\"The pager started beeping non-stop and, on the screen, it said 'alert',\" Adam, who did not want to use his real name for safety reasons, said. The text appeared to have been sent by the group's leadership. To read it, he had to press two buttons, simultaneously, with both hands. Adam did it many times, but the beeps continued. \"Then suddenly, as I was sitting at my desk,\" he said, \"the pager exploded\".",
      "On his phone, Adam showed me a video of the room, filmed by a colleague minutes after he was rescued. There was a trail of blood on the floor. \"I tried to crawl to the door because I had locked it while I changed my clothes,\" he said. The blast had opened a hole in the wood desk. I noticed a beige-like object. \"That's my finger,\" he said.",
      "Hezbollah is known for being a powerful militia and is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. But in Lebanon, it is also a significant political movement with representation in parliament and a social organisation. Here, being a Hezbollah member does not necessarily mean you are a fighter. In fact, many are not. Adam told me he had never been one. People can work in the group's large array of institutions that include hospitals and emergency services, for example.",
      "Hezbollah had decided to equip members with low-tech pagers for communicating rather than smartphones which it feared could be used by Israel, its arch-enemy, to gather sensitive information about the group. It turned out, though, that the devices which Hezbollah had distributed were part of a years-long elaborate Israeli plan: an explosive compound had been concealed within the pagers, waiting to be activated \u2013 and that is what happened on that day.",
      "In the attack, Adam, who is 38, lost his thumb and two fingers on his left hand, and part of a finger on the other. He was blinded in his right eye, which has been replaced with a glass eye, and has only partial sight in the other. He showed me a picture of him in a hospital bed, taken an hour after the explosion, with his face burned, entirely blooded, covered with bandages. Despite his wounds, Adam remained committed to Hezbollah. I asked him how he felt when he looked at himself like that. \"Very good,\" he said in English. Then, in Arabic, he told me: \"Because we believe that the wounds are a kind of medal from God. Honouring what we go through fighting a righteous cause.\"",
      "But the group is no longer the force it was since being dealt a devastating blow in Israel's bombing campaign and invasion of Lebanon, which followed the pager attacks, and faces serious challenges. At home, there is discontent among some supporters over the lack of funds for reconstruction, while the new government has vowed to disarm the group. In neighbouring Syria, the ouster of Bashar al-Assad's regime has disrupted the route used by Iran, its main supporter, for the supply of weapons and money.",
      "I visited communities in southern Lebanon that were destroyed by Israel's attacks, and saw that support for Hezbollah appeared undimmed. But, in views rarely expressed to media, others who backed it said the war had been a mistake, and even questioned the group's future as a military force.",
      "You can listen to more from Hugo in his radio documentary - Crossing Continents: Hezbollah in trouble - here",
      "Hezbollah, or Party of God, was created in the 1980s in response to Israel's occupation of Lebanon during the Lebanese civil war. To this day, the destruction of Israel remains one of its official goals. Their last war had been in 2006, which was followed by years of relative calm. Violence flared up again in 2023 after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. When Israel started bombarding Gaza, Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel, saying it was acting in support of Palestinians. Israel responded with air strikes on southern Lebanon, and tens of thousands of people were forced to flee on both sides of the border.",
      "The pager attacks were a turning point in what had been, until then, an intensifying but relatively contained conflict. The devices exploded as people were working, shopping or at home. About a dozen people, including two children, were killed, and thousands wounded, many of them maimed. The attack caused anger in Lebanon, because of what was seen as its indiscriminate nature. A day later, walkie-talkies used by the group suddenly exploded too. I was at a funeral of some of the victims of the pagers when there was a loud blast. Hezbollah members, desperate, asked us to turn off our cameras or phones, as no-one knew what else could explode.",
      "In the following weeks, Israel carried out a relentless bombing campaign and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Across the country, around 4,000 people were killed and almost 18,000 others wounded. For Hezbollah, the conflict proved to be catastrophic. The group's top leaders were assassinated, many of its fighters killed and much of its arsenal destroyed. Among the dead was Hassan Nasrallah, who had been the head of Hezbollah for more than 30 years, assassinated in a massive air strike on the group's secret headquarters under apartment blocks in the Dahieh, where Hezbollah is based in Beirut.",
      "At the end of November, battered, the group agreed on a ceasefire that was essentially a surrender.",
      "Southern Lebanon is the heartland of Lebanon's Shia Muslim community, which is the bulk of Hezbollah's support base, and one of the regions of the country where the group has traditionally had a significant presence. I travelled to the border town of Kfar Kila, which had a pre-war population of 15,000 and was one of the first to fall when Israel invaded. Israel's stated war goal was to allow the return of residents to its northern communities, which had been emptied because of Hezbollah's attacks. In Kfar Kila, there was almost nothing left standing, and yellow Hezbollah flags dotted the huge piles of broken concrete and twisted metal.",
      "A 37-year-old woman called Alia had come with her husband and three daughters, aged 18, 14 and 10. The youngest was wearing a badge with a smiley picture of Nasrallah. \"I only knew that this was my house because of the remains of this plant over there, the roses, and this tree,\" Alia told me. From the street, she pointed at what she could identify in the rubble. \"This is the couch. There, the curtains. That was the living room. And that was the bedroom. That's my daughter's bicycle,\" she said. \"There's nothing to recover\".",
      "According to the World Bank, costs related to reconstruction and recovery are estimated at $11bn (\u00a38.5bn) across the country. One of Hezbollah's immediate challenges is to give financial help to people affected by the war, which is crucial to keep supporters on board. Those who lost their houses have received $12,000 to cover for a year's rent. But the group has not promised money to rebuild what was destroyed or to give compensation for destroyed businesses. The limited support is already fuelling discontent. Aila's shop had stock worth $20,000, and she was concerned no-one would cover her losses.",
      "Iran, Hezbollah's backer, is one of the group's main sources of funds, weapons and training. But Lebanon's international allies want to cut off any financial support from Iran, to put even more pressure on Hezbollah, and say there will be no help if the Lebanese government does not act against Hezbollah. With the group weakened militarily, critics see this as a unique opportunity to disarm it.",
      "Alia told me: \"We don't want any aid that comes with conditions about our arms... We won't allow them to take our dignity, our honour, take away our arms just for us to build a house. We'll build it ourselves.\"",
      "It is not surprising that Hezbollah's supporters remain defiant. For many, the group is a fundamental part of their lives, essential in their identities. But Hezbollah's power is seen - and felt - beyond its base. Before the war, its military wing was considered to be stronger than the Lebanese national army. A solid parliamentary bloc means that virtually no major decision has been possible without Hezbollah's consent. Because of Lebanon's fractured political system, the group has representation in the government. In short, Hezbollah has had the ability to paralyse the state, and many times has done so.",
      "But the war has diminished the group's domestic position too. In January, the Lebanese parliament elected a new president, former army chief Joseph Aoun, after a two-year impasse that critics had blamed on Hezbollah. In the past, its MPs and allies would walk out of the chamber when a vote was scheduled. But Hezbollah, severely wounded and with its communities in need of help, felt it could no longer block the process, which was seen as vital to unlock some international support. In his inauguration speech, Aoun promised to make the Lebanese army the sole carrier of weapons in the country. He did not mention Hezbollah, but everyone understood the message.",
      "Ultimately, Hezbollah's future may lie with Iran. One of the reasons for Iran to have a strong Hezbollah in Lebanon was to deter any Israeli attack, especially on its nuclear facilities. This is now gone. Other groups backed by Iran in the region, part of what it calls the Axis of Resistance, have also been significantly weakened, including Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen. And the fall of the Assad regime in Syria has interrupted Iran's land corridor to Lebanon - and Hezbollah. Even if Iran decides to rearm Hezbollah, it will not be easy.",
      "Nasrallah has been succeeded by Naim Qassem, his former deputy, who is not seen as charismatic or influential. From time to time, rumours emerge of internal disagreements. And whispers of dissent among the rank and file are spreading. In southern Lebanon, I met a businessman who did not want to have his name published, fearing that he could become a target on social media. On the wall of his office, he had pictures of Hezbollah's leaders. Now, he was critical of the group.",
      "\"The mistakes have been huge,\" he said. \"Hezbollah decided to engage in a war to support Gaza without proper calculations, without consulting the people or the Lebanese state\". (To date, Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.) He told me a lot of supporters shared his view. \"If Hezbollah don't do a proper reassessment of the situation... they will destroy themselves and harm us along the way. We brought this destruction on ourselves, and we're now suffering\".",
      "As part of the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah agreed to remove its weapons and fighters from southern Lebanon, and a Western diplomatic official told me the group had largely done it. Israel was required to withdraw its troops, but has remained in five positions, saying this is needed for the safety of its border communities. The Israeli military has also carried out air strikes on targets and people it says are linked to Hezbollah. Lebanon says the Israeli permanence in Lebanese territory and its attacks are violations of the deal.",
      "Discussions about Hezbollah's disarmament are likely to be difficult and long. A source familiar with the group told me one of the options was for Hezbollah's arsenal, believed to still include long-range missiles, to be put under the control of the state, while its fighters, estimated to be several thousand, could be integrated into the Lebanese army.",
      "The businessman told me: \"A lot of the families, especially those of wounded and martyred fighters, are totally dependent on Hezbollah. These people won't disengage from Hezbollah immediately\u2026 Without a plan, it would be a recipe for internal conflict. It would drive Lebanese to fight against each other\".",
      "For weeks, I tried to interview a representative from Hezbollah, but no-one was made available.",
      "Adam, the pager casualty, has now returned to his work as a nurse. He no longer does nightshifts, however, as he cannot see well. The explosion also left shrapnel in his head and chest. As he gets tired easily, he needs to take constant breaks to rest. Physiotherapy sessions are helping him adapt to using what is left of his left thumb and middle finger.",
      "Prominent in his living room, is a picture he framed, of himself, with his injured hands, holding a pager. He shared with me another picture, of his maimed hand, only now it also bore a tattooed message which expressed that his wounds were a cheap sacrifice in honour of Nasrallah, the late Hezbollah leader. He, like many, still believes in the group's purpose, and the role it plays.",

      "Since he took power, Israel's military has repeatedly pounded Syrian weapons stores, airfields and other military sites left by the former regime, to avoid them falling into enemy hands, it says.",
      "It has also occupied a demilitarised buffer zone, set up after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and has sent forces onto the Syrian side of a nearby mountain, setting up nine bases across the area.",
      "Israeli troops are also making regular incursions into Syria's south-western provinces, vowing to prevent the presence of any armed groups or government forces there.",
      "Earlier this week, the local government in the southern city of Deraa said nine civilians were killed in an Israeli bombardment, during the deepest incursion there yet by Israeli forces.",
      "Another four people were killed in Israeli shelling near the village of Koya late last month, after local gunmen tried to stop the advance of Israeli forces there.",

      "Many Syrians are disappointed by Israel's response to their new government. They watched for years as Israel targeted the Assad regime, and believed that Assad's fall would bring the chance for a less confrontational relationship with Israel.",
      "Some say that view is now changing.",
      "\"We used to believe that the Israeli army was only targeting Assad's regime forces,\" said Ismail, a restaurant owner in the west of the country.  \"But its continued, incomprehensible bombings are sadly making us think that Israel is an enemy of the Syrian people.\"",

      "But outside powers helped fuel that civil war for more than a decade, and its neighbours are now eyeing the vacuum left by Assad. The risk is growing that Syria will again fall victim to the conflicts of outside powers, played out on Syrian soil."

      "According to CBS, a source familiar with the situation said the Signal incident \"opened the door\" to looking into staff members believed not to be sufficiently aligned with Trump, while Ms Loomer's visit sealed the fate for those who were terminated.",
      "The administration has been looking at outside meetings held by national security staff, reprimanding some for meeting people not believed to be aligned with the president, according to the source.",
      "Aboard Air Force One en route to Miami, Florida, on Thursday, Trump praised Ms Loomer and confirmed he had met with her, calling her a \"great patriot\" and a \"very strong person\".",
      "\"She makes recommendations\u2026 sometimes I listen to those recommendations,\" he said. \"I listen to everybody and then I make a decision.\"",
      "In a phone call with the BBC, Ms Loomer said it would be \"inappropriate\" to divulge details of her meeting with Trump on Wednesday.",

      "She texted a statement that said: \"It was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my research findings.",

    "story": [
      "Hungary is withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC), its government has announced.",
      "A senior official in Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government confirmed this hours after Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who is sought under an ICC arrest warrant, arrived in Hungary for a state visit.",
      "Orban had invited Netanyahu as soon as the warrant was issued last November, saying the ruling would have \"no effect\" in his country.",
      "In November, ICC judges said there were \"reasonable grounds\" that Netanyahu bore \"criminal responsibility\" for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war between Israel and Hamas. Netanyahu has condemned the ICC's decision as \"antisemitic\".",
      "The ICC, a global court, has the authority to prosecute those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.",
      "Hungary is a founding member of the ICC, which counts 125 member states, and will be the first European Union nation to pull out of it. A withdrawal has no impact on ongoing proceedings.",
      "During a joint press conference, Orban asserted that the ICC had become a \"political court\". He added the court's decision to issue a warrant against the Israeli leader \"clearly showed\" this.",
      "Netanyahu meanwhile hailed Hungary's \"bold and principled\" decision to withdraw from the court.",
      "\"It's important for all democracies. It's important to stand up to this corrupt organisation,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "A statement from the Israeli prime minister's office on Thursday said Netanyahu and Orban had spoken with US President Donald Trump about the decision and the \"next steps that can be taken on this issue\".",
      "Earlier Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar thanked Orban on X for his \"clear and strong moral stance alongside Israel\".",
      "\"The so-called International Criminal Court lost its moral authority after trampling the fundamental principles of international law in its zest for harming Israel's right to self-defence,\" Sa'ar added.",
      "Hungary's decision aligns with its broader foreign policy stance under Orban, who has cultivated close ties with Israel and adopted a critical view of international institutions perceived as infringing on national sovereignty.",
      "While Hungary's withdrawal may carry symbolic weight and political implications, it does not significantly alter the ICC's operational capacity or legal framework.",
      "The court has faced similar challenges in the past and continues to function with broad international support.",
      "But Hungary's criticism of the ICC as \"politically biased\" and its decision to withdraw as Netanyahu visits may set a precedent for other nations to question or abandon their commitments to international justice based on political alliances or disagreements with specific rulings.",
      "The US, Russia, China and North Korea are among the nations that are not part of the ICC, and therefore do not recognise its jurisdiction.",
      "Israel is also not part of the treaty, but the ICC ruled in 2021 that it did have jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, because the UN's Secretary General had accepted that Palestinians were a member.",
      "Hungary now needs to send written notification to the UN Secretary General to leave the treaty, with the withdrawal taking effect one year later, according to article 127 of the Rome Statute, which established the ICC.",
      "ICC spokesman Fadi El-Abdullah told the BBC: \"On the visit of Mr Netanyahu, the court has followed its standard procedures, after the issuance of an arrest warrant. The court recalls that Hungary remains under a duty to cooperate with the ICC.\"",
      "Since the warrant was issued, Hungarian authorities should technically arrest Netanyahu and hand him over to the court in the Hague, although member states do not always choose to enforce ICC warrants.",
      "In Europe, some ICC member states said they would arrest the Israeli leader if he set foot in their country, while others, including Germany, announced that Netanyahu would not be detained if he visited.",
      "But Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Thursday Hungary's announcement was \"a bad day for international criminal law\".",
      "\"Europe has clear rules that apply to all EU member states, and that is the Rome Statute. I have made it clear time and again that no one in Europe is above the law and that applies to all areas of law,\" she added.",
      "On the other side of the Atlantic, the US has condemned the ICC's decision to issue warrants for Netanyahu's arrest and he has visited the country since it was issued in November. His visit to Hungary marks Netanyahu's first trip to Europe since then.",
      "Hungarian Defence Minister Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky, greeted Netanyahu on the tarmac of Budapest airport on Wednesday night, welcoming him to the country.",
      "Israel is appealing against the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and strongly rejects the accusations. It both denies the authority of the ICC and the legitimacy of the warrants.",
      "Netanyahu said at the time that it was a \"dark day in the history of humanity\", and that the ICC had become \"the enemy of humanity\".",
      "\"It's an antisemitic step that has one goal - to deter me, to deter us from having our natural right to defend ourselves against enemies who try to destroy us,\" he said.",
      "In the same ruling, ICC judges also issued a warrant against Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, who Israel says is dead. Hamas also rejected the allegations.",
      "The visit comes as Israel announced it was expanding its Gaza offensive and establishing a new military corridor to put pressure on Hamas, as deadly Israeli strikes continued across the Palestinian territory.",
      "The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed some 1,200 people and led to 251 hostages being taken to Gaza. Since then, Israeli military attacks have killed more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza say."

      "The US said it was aware and \"monitoring the situation\".",
      "Andaman and Nicobar Islands' police chief HGS Dhaliwal told news agency AFP that \"an American citizen\" had been presented before the local court and was remanded for three days for \"further interrogation\".",
      "AFP, citing Mr Dhaliwal, said Mr Polyakov blew a whistle off the shore of the island in a bid to attract the attention of the tribe for about an hour.",
      "He then landed for about five minutes, leaving his offerings, collecting samples and recording a video.",
      "The police chief told AFP: \"A review of his GoPro camera footage showed his entry and landing into the restricted North Sentinel Island.\"",
      "It is illegal for foreigners or Indians to travel within 5km (three miles) of the islands in order to protect the people living there.",
      "According to police, Mr Polyakov has visited the region twice before - including using an inflatable kayak in October last year before he was stopped by hotel staff.",
      "On his arrest earlier this week, the man told police he was a \"thrill seeker\", Indian media reported.",
      "Survival International said the Sentinelese have made their wish to avoid outsiders clear over many years and underlined that such visits pose a threat to a community which has no immunity to outside diseases.",
      "Jonathan Mazower, spokesperson for Survival International, told the BBC they feared social media was adding to the list of threats for uncontacted tribal people. Several media reports have linked Mr Polyakov to a YouTube account, which features videos of a recent trip to Afghanistan.",
      "\"As well as all the somewhat more established threats to such peoples - from things like logging and mining in the Amazon where most uncontacted peoples live - there are now an increasing number of... influencers who are trying to do this kind of thing for followers,\" Mr Mazower said.",
      "\"There's a growing social media fascination with this whole idea.\"",
      "Survival International describes the Sentinelese as \"the most isolated Indigenous people in the world\" living on an island around the size of Manhattan.",
      "Mr Mazower told the BBC an estimated 200 people belong to the tribe, before adding it was \"impossible\" to know its true number.",
      "Few details are known about the group, other than they are a hunter-gatherer community who live in small settlements and are \"extremely healthy\", he said.",
      "He added that the incident highlighted why government protections for communities such as the Sentinelese are so important.",
      "The UN's Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention sets out obligations for governments to protect affected people's rights. India's government has an initiative focusing on tribal welfare, but the country has come under criticism in recent years for failing to protect against evictions.",
      "It is not the first time an outsider has attempted to make contact with the Sentinelese.",
      "In November 2018, John Allen Chau, also a US national, was killed by the tribe after visiting the same island.",
      "Local officials said the 27-year-old was a Christian missionary.",
      "Mr Chau was shot with bows and arrows upon landing. Reports at the time suggested he had bribed fishermen to take him to the island.",

    "summary": "Could the National Rally retaliate in parliament by attempting to bring down the fragile coalition government?",
    "story": [
      "Outrage is a precious political currency and France's far right has spent this week attempting, furiously and predictably, to capitalise on the perceived injustice of a court's decision to block its totemic leader, Marine Le Pen, from standing in the 2027 presidential election.",
      "Listen to Andrew read this article",
      "The airwaves have been throbbing with indignation.",
      "\"Be outraged,\" said one of Le Pen's key deputies, on French television, in case anyone was in doubt as to what their reaction should be.",
      "But it remains unclear whether Le Pen's tough sentence will broaden support for her party, the National Rally (RN), or lead to greater fragmentation of the French far right. Either way, it has created a feverish mood among the nation's politicians.",
      "Le Pen and her allies have boldly declared that France's institutions, and democracy itself, have been \"executed\", are \"dead\", or \"violated\". The country's justice system has been turned into a \"political\" hit squad, shamelessly intervening in a nation's right to choose its own leaders. And Marine Le Pen has been widely portrayed, with something close to certainty, as France's president-in-waiting, as the nation's most popular politician, cruelly robbed of her near-inevitable procession towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.",
      "\"The system has released a nuclear bomb, and if it is using such a powerful weapon against us, it is obviously because we are about to win the elections,\" Le Pen fumed at a news conference, comparing herself to the poisoned, imprisoned, and now dead Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny.",
      "As France assesses its latest political tremors, an uneven pushback has begun.",
      "No clear frontrunner for president",
      "Nervous about the impact the judgement may have for the country's frail coalition government, the Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou has admitted to feeling \"troubled\" by Le Pen's sentence and worried about a \"shock\" to public opinion.",
      "But other centrist politicians have taken a firmer line, stressing the need for a clear gap between the justice system and politics.",
      "An early opinion poll appears to show the French public taking a calm line, bursting \u2013 or at least deflating \u2013 the RN's bubble of outrage. The poll, produced within hours of the court's ruling, showed less than a third of the country \u2013 31% - felt the decision to block Le Pen, immediately, from running for public office, was unjust.",
      "Tellingly, that figure was less than the 37% of French people who recently expressed an interest in voting for her as president.",
      "In other words, plenty of people who like her as a politician also think it reasonable that her crimes should disqualify her from running for office.",
      "And remember, French presidential elections are still two years away \u2013 an eternity in the current political climate.",
      "Emmanuel Macron is not entitled to stand for another term and no clear alternative to Le Pen, from the left or centre of French politics, has yet emerged. Le Pen's share of the vote has consistently risen during her previous three failed bids for the top job but it is premature, at best, to consider her a shoo-in for 2027.",
      "Le Pen's crime and punishment",
      "Anyone who followed the court case against her and her party colleagues in an impartial fashion would struggle to conclude that the verdicts in Le Pen's case were unreasonable.",
      "The evidence of a massive and coordinated project to defraud the European Parliament and its associated taxpayers included jaw-droppingly incriminating emails suggesting officials knew exactly what they were doing, and the illegality of their actions.",
      "That the corruption was for the party, not for personal gain, surely changes nothing. Corruption is corruption. Besides, other parties have also been found guilty of similar offences.",
      "Regarding the punishments handed out by the court, here it seems fair to argue that Le Pen and her party made a strategic blunder in their approach to the case.",
      "Had they acknowledged the facts, and their errors, and cooperated in facilitating a swift trial rather than helping to drag the process out for almost a decade, the judges \u2013 as they've now made clear \u2013 might have taken their attitude towards the case into consideration when considering punishments.",
      "\"Neither during the investigation nor at the trial did [Le Pen] show any awareness of the need for probity as an elected official, nor of the ensuing responsibilities,\" wrote the judges in a document explaining, often indignantly, why they'd delivered such a tough sentence.",
      "They berated Le Pen for seeking to delay or avoid justice with \"a defence system that disregards the uncovering of the truth\".",
      "Hypocrisy among the elite",
      "It is worth noting, here, the wider hypocrisy demonstrated by elites across France's political spectrum who have recently been muttering their sympathy for Le Pen. It is nine years since MPs voted to toughen up the laws on corruption, introducing the very sanctions - on immediately banning criminals from public office - that were used by the judges in this case.",
      "That toughening was welcomed by the public as an antidote to a judicial system stymied by an indulgent culture of successive appeals that enabled \u2013 and sometimes still enables - politicians to dodge accountability for decades.",
      "Le Pen is now being gleefully taunted by her critics online with the many past instances in which she has called for stricter laws on corruption.",
      "\"When are we going to learn the lessons and effectively introduce lifelong ineligibility for those who have been convicted of acts committed while in office or during their term of office?\" she asked in 2013.",
      "Reasonable people can reasonably disagree about the court's sentencing decisions in Le Pen's case. But the notion \u2013 enthusiastically endorsed by populist and hard-right politicians across Europe and the US \u2013 that she is a victim of a conspiratorial political plot has clearly not convinced most French people.",
      "At least not yet.",
      "Future of France's far right",
      "So where does this verdict \u2013 clearly a seismic moment in French politics \u2013 leave the National Rally and the wider far-right movement?",
      "The short answer is that no one knows. There are so many variables involved \u2013 from the fate of Le Pen's fast-tracked appeal, to the RN's succession strategy, to the state of France's precarious finances, to the broader political climate and the see-sawing appetite for populism both within France and globally \u2013 that predictions are an even more dubious game than usual.",
      "The most immediate question \u2013 given the slow pace of the legal appeal that Le Pen has vowed to initiate \u2013 is whether the RN will seek prompt revenge in parliament by attempting to bring down the fragile coalition government of Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou.",
      "That could lead to new parliamentary elections this summer and the possibility that the RN could capitalise on its victim status to increase its lead in parliament and perhaps, even, to push the country towards a deadlock in which President Macron might \u2013 yet another \"might\" \u2013 feel obliged to step down.",
      "One person who will now be facing extra scrutiny is Le Pen's almost but not quite anointed successor, 29-year-old Jordan Bardella, who could be drafted in as a replacement presidential candidate if Le Pen's own \"narrow path\" towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e remains blocked on appeal.",
      "If social-media-savvy Bardella's popularity among French youth is any indication of his prospects, he could well sweep to victory in 2027. He has found a way to tap into the frustrations of people angry about falling living standards and concerns about immigration.",
      "But turning youthful support into actual votes is not always straightforward, and other, more experienced and mainstream figures on the right may well be sensing an opportunity too.",
      "The Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau, is widely seen to be emerging as a potential contender. Some even wonder if the provocative television personality, Cyril Hanouna, might become a serious political force on the right of French politics.",
      "Meanwhile, Bardella, like the RN in general, has been on a highly disciplined mission to detoxify the party's once overtly racist and antisemitic brand. In February, for instance, he abandoned plans to speak at America's far-right CPAC event after Donald Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon made a Nazi salute.",
      "But this week's events have revealed that the RN is enthusiastically committed to the distinctly Trump-ian and populist strategy of blaming its misfortunes on a \"swamp\" of unelected officials. Bardella, meanwhile, complained about the recent closure of two right-wing media channels alongside his party's own legal struggles.",
      "\"There is an extremely serious drift today that does not reflect the idea we have of French democracy,\" he said.",
      "It's the sort of language that goes down well with the RN's core constituency, but its broader appeal may be limited in a country that remains, in many ways, deeply attached to its institutions.",
      "To frame it another way, will French voters be more motivated by the belief that Le Pen was unfairly punished, or by concern that the judges involved have since been the victims of death threats and other insults?",
      "As for Marine Le Pen, she has vowed that she will not be sidelined. But her destiny is not entirely in her own hands now. At the age of 56 she has become a familiar figure, fiery at times, but personally approachable, warm and, in political terms, profoundly influential and disciplined. So what next for her?",
      "France has had one Le Pen or other (Marine's father, Jean-Marie ran four times) on their presidential ballot paper since 1988. Always unsuccessfully.",
      "History may well look back on this week as the moment Marine Le Pen's fate was sealed, in one of three ways: as France's first female and first far-right president, swept to power on a tide of outrage. As the four-time loser of a French presidential election, finally denied power by the taint of corruption. Or as someone whose soaring political career was brought to an early and shuddering halt by her own miscalculations over a serious embezzlement scandal.",

    "summary": "Big in Asia, live shopping involves brands putting on live shows to sell direct to shoppers.",
    "story": [
      "After graduating college Kelsey Krakora worked full time in a steakhouse, bartending and serving meals.",
      "She had dabbled with selling clothes online, but only part-time.",
      "But in 2021 that all changed for Cleveland-based Ms Krakora.",
      "She switched to selling clothes on Whatnot and then Poshmark - online marketplaces where people can also use live video to sell items.",
      "\"My first live show with Poshmark was 27th November 2022. I sold zero things on my first show... but that didn't last long!\"",
      "Now she sells around 100 items per show, worth about $1,000 in sales (\u00a3773).",
      "Her shows are on average three hours long and she does between two and three a week.",
      "\"These events are inclusive, welcoming, you can shop in your PJs, and there's no need to head to the shopping mall,\" says Ms Krakora.",
      "Live shopping has been popular in the Asia-Pacific region for some time, where social networks such as China's Douyin regularly host live shopping streams, but now European and US brands are experimenting with this new way of selling their products.",
      "Live shopping is a close relative to shopping channels like QVC, where viewers are urged to call in and buy the products demonstrated by presenters.",
      "But live shopping acts as a quicker shortcut from buyer to product, especially in the era of one-click purchases, made popular by online retailers such as Amazon.",
      "Also, as younger generations increasingly cut the cord and can't access cable TV, shopping channels don't hold the same relevance as they once did.",
      "It's estimated the live shopping market has reached $32bn, with the most active sectors being fashion, cosmetics and collectibles.",
      "A 2024 survey from digital commerce platform VTEX found that 45% of US consumers have browsed or purchased from live shopping events in the past 12 months.",
      "Guillaume Faure, chief executive of LiveMeUp, which provides live shopping video software, remembers when interest in live shopping surged.",
      "\"When Instagram introduced Reels, and when YouTube launched Shorts, we saw live shopping really take off.\"",
      "He's noticed the popularity of tutorials and how-to videos in live shopping events, such as how hosts can teach shoppers how to apply a certain type of make-up, or arrange a variety of flowers to deliver the most evocative bouquet.",
      "However, some analysts think that live shopping is likely to have a limited appeal.",
      "\"Many companies have tried live shopping but it simply doesn't scale,\" says Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research.",
      "\"Maybe it works in China where they don't have the same kind of store density we have in the US, where it's better for consumers to go and try something on rather than watch a host try on a piece of clothing,\" she adds.",
      "Jonathan Reynolds,  academic director of the Oxford Institute of Retail Management, University of Oxford, also highlights that the Chinese market is different.",
      "\"In China, so-called key opinion leaders (KOLs) like Li Jiaqi, the so-called 'Lipstick King, are well established,\" he says.",
      "\"Li has carefully built his personal brand to demonstrate his expertise and build consumer trust. KOLs are also working within much more sophisticated platform ecosystems,\" Mr Reynolds explains.",
      "Even Ms Krakora admits that not all products work on a live shopping stream.",
      "For example, she prefers to shop for jeans in-person. \"I'm tall, and I have specific cuts of jeans that I wear,\" she says, \"and there are tried-and-true styles and brands I like.\"",
      "Bruce Winder, a retail analyst in Toronto, also says that for some shoppers, the convenience of live shopping might be too attractive.",
      "\"Consumers may get addicted to the show or channel... and some consumers may not be able to stop watching and spending as they get caught up in the moment,\" he adds.",
      "Despite those potential pitfalls, major brands and platforms have jumped on the live shopping bandwagon.",
      "Nordstrom, Kit Kat, Samsung and L'Oreal have sold products during these streams as hosts showcased new or discounted products, and joining Poshmark as the host for these events are Amazon, eBay, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.",
      "\"Live shopping lets shoppers have a conversation with someone who knows the products being sold, and that generates a lot of excitement,\" says Manish Chandra, the chief executive and founder of Poshmark.",
      "\"It also creates a community where other shoppers are in the same show, and it's really a different experience than a traditional shopping trip.\"",
      "For some brands live shopping has been a game-changer.",
      "High-end fragrance brand The House of Amouage partnered with Nordstrom in late 2024 to bring their live shopping events to the US.",
      "Oman-based Amouage was following up on the success they enjoyed in China. In the 140 live streams they hosted with Chinese influencers on the social platforms Douyin and Taobao in 2023, they sold more than 3,000 units.",
      "The firm's chief creative officer Renaud Salmon says it's helping the company learn about what its customers want.",
      "\"In the past, we would have used customer satisfaction surveys,\" says Mr Salmon, \"but with live shopping, we get feedback right away and I bring that back to my team to help refine our products.\"",

    "summary": "The EU has enormous economic clout as the biggest single market in the world, but does not want to risk a backlash.",
    "story": [
      "Fundamentally wrong, was how Germany's outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, described the new Trump tariffs.",
      "A unilateral attack - that was the view of Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron called them brutal, unfounded and certain to have a \"massive impact\" on the European economy.",
      "He convened an emergency meeting with representatives of French businesses most affected by the newly announced 20% tariffs on EU goods sold to the US and issued a call to arms to European business \"not to invest in America for some time until we have clarified things\".",
      "\"What message would we send by having major European players investing billions of euros in the American economy at a time when [the US] is hitting us?\" he said.",
      "For France it's wine, champagne and the aeronautical industry, for Germany it's cars, and for Italy it's luxury goods. It's well known these sectors sell well abroad and now risk being clobbered by US import taxes.",
      "Overall, the chemicals, machinery and equipment industries in the EU are seen as the most vulnerable to the tariffs.",
      "But dig a little deeper and there are other EU sectors, reliant on the US market, that could come as a bit of a surprise.",
      "French cognac, generally dismissed as an old person's tipple in Europe, is the booze of choice for many American rappers, playing a prominent role in the music and lifestyle of stars like Jay-Z, 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg. More than 40% of French brandy is exported to the US.",
      "Spain exports a lot of gas turbines to the US, alongside tonnes of olive oil.",
      "Which EU countries are most exposed?",
      "When we look at which EU countries are most exposed to the US in terms of GDP, the picture is also not quite what you might imagine.",
      "Ireland is highly dependent on the US in terms of goods and services. Those exports - a lot linked to the pharmaceutical industry (which is currently exempt from the 20% tariffs, until the US boosts its own production) and also tech - make up a fifth of Ireland's GDP.",
      "Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta are more exposed than the EU average in terms of services exports.",
      "Belgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia are in a similar position when it comes to goods.",
      "Germany has a greater exposure to the US than the other major EU economies, at over 5% of GDP, followed by Italy (about 4%), France (3%) and Spain (just over 2%). These figures were collated in 2024 by CaixaBank research based on Eurostat figures for the previous year.",
      "Will the EU retaliate?",
      "The response to the new US tariffs is being coordinated at EU HQ in Brussels. The European Commission deals with all overarching trade matters for the bloc's members.",
      "Commission President Ursula von der Leyen claims they hold \"a lot of cards\", including the strength to negotiate and the power to push back.",
      "The US economy is mighty. It makes up 25% of global GDP.",
      "But the EU single market of 450 million people (the biggest single market in the world) stands very close in size at 22% of global GDP.",
      "So, yes, the EU can bite - hard - as well as bark when it comes to retaliating against Donald Trump's tariffs. Especially if, as EU figures have suggested, the bloc targets US services like Big Tech, possibly including Apple, Meta, Amazon and even Elon Musk's platform X.",
      "But that risks a new backlash by the Trump administration. And the EU wants to avoid upping the ante.",
      "If you take politics into account, not just economics, the EU has less room for manoeuvre than you might think.",
      "Take energy supplies, the EU has been buying US liquified natural gas (LNG) after it weaned itself off Russian gas following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Tricky to reduce or heavily tax those imports. That would badly impact EU consumers, not only US industry, and it would worsen already dismal relations with the US.",
      "Think of all the recent rows over defence spending and Ukraine. Aside from the economic hell the EU sees and hopes to avoid in the new Trump tariffs, the bloc also really wants to sidestep a trade war with the country that used to be Europe's best friend.",
      "So, the Brussels plan is: threaten heavy retaliation, hope Donald Trump is persuaded to negotiate, then pray he'll stage a U-turn on tariffs.",
      "The EU's trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, says he's speaking to his US counterparts on Friday. It's an opening gambit. The EU is in no rush to retaliate.",
      "What could the EU offer the US in a negotiation?",
      "The Trump administration has ruled out any country negotiating its way out of the new tariffs before they become live this weekend. But after that, what could the EU offer the US president to persuade him to back down?",
      "Trump is incandescent about the EU's massive trade surplus. It sells far more goods than it buys from the US. The surplus for 2024 was around $200bn (\u20ac180bn; $153bn).",
      "It's the other way round when it comes to services - the US sells far more to the EU than the other way round. That is why the EU thinks its main retaliatory leverage against the US would lie in services, like banks and big tech.",
      "To redress the goods imbalance, the EU could offer to buy more LNG from the US, or more military equipment, following its pledge to Washington to do more for its own security.",
      "But that would break a different EU promise - to boost withering European arms industries by trying to buy EU when re-arming EU countries. It is something the US has already objected to, so that's tricky.",
      "Brussels could also cut direct and indirect tariffs on US goods. It could lose quotas on US agricultural produce.",
      "It would be hugely reluctant to comply with another US ask: to water down its much-trumpeted digital regulations, aimed at limiting monopolies and placing restrictions on speech and content in the EU.",
      "How bad can this all get?",
      "How do you price in the possible collapse of the international trading system, EU officials ask.",
      "European firms fret about their markets being flooded by cheap goods from non-EU countries that are also hit by Trump tariffs and seeking to sell elsewhere.",
      "The risk is very real when it comes to China. Trump is slapping more that 50% tariffs on Beijing when you add it all up.",
      "Would the EU have to ratchet up its import duties on Chinese goods to protect itself and could that lead to an unintended trade war with China?",
      "These are anxious and hugely uncertain economic times.",
      "Which is why the European Commission says it also wants to focus on matters it can control - if EU capitals agree - and that is reducing internal barriers within the EU single market.",
      "Those barriers, such as tax regimes, vary from country to country and impact the EU's overall economic growth and competitiveness.",
      "The IMF calculates they're equivalent to a 45% tariff on EU manufacturing; 110% when it comes to services.",
      "That is far higher than the tariffs now imposed on the EU by Donald Trump.",
      "EU countries say they're united in combating those. So far they've been divided over completing their own internal market."

      "This is a very real risk.",
      "The tariffs introduced by President Trump amount to the largest such levy to face American consumers in almost a century.",
      "If they do get put in place \u2013 and remain \u2013 there is likely to be a serious dent to the amount bought by Americans, still the world's biggest shoppers, from the rest of the world.",
      "And those who are prepared to fork out for higher prices due to tariffs will have less to spend on other things.",
      "In the event of the retaliation threatened by other countries, American exporters will suffer \u2013 hence the concern that not just the US but the whole global economy, so reliant on trade flows, could slow.",
      "But as you say, the natural inclination is for countries hardest hit \u2013 toymakers from China to apparel manufacturers in Vietnam - to boost sale in other markets.",
      "That might appeal to consumers \u2013 but obviously, could disadvantage businesses in those target markets.",
      "What happens to US products that are made in China?",
      "Mike Heafield, 60, in Preston, asks Senior Technology reporter, Graham Fraser, What happens to products - like the iPhone - that are made in China by US companies?",
      "One eye-catching consequence of the tariffs announcement has been the impact on Apple, with its share price falling 7%.",
      "The US tech giant has large manufacturing bases in some of the countries hit hardest by President Trump's policy - notably China, which faces tariffs of 54%, and Vietnam (46%).",
      "In 2019, when Trump was first in the White House, Apple was given Chinese tariff exemptions. Apple bosses will be hoping to work out a similar deal this time.",
      "The global investment bank Citi said: \"If Apple cannot get exempted this time and assuming Apple gets hit by the accumulative 54% China tariffs and does not pass it through, we estimate about 9% negative impact to the company's total gross margin.\"",
      "In February, Apple committed to invest more than $500bn (\u00a3396bn) in the US over the next four years. At the time, Trump claimed Apple's support for US manufacturing was partially a response to his trade policies, including tariffs.",
      "How will the tariffs impact US consumers?",
      "Paul Miller, in Devon, asks Dharshini David, Deputy Economics editor, about the impact of tariffs on US consumers, and whether the UK could gain from them.",
      "US shoppers could very much be the frontline casualties in this trade war, blighted by higher prices and less choice, regardless of the president's rhetoric.",
      "And that does mean that producers will seek out and take advantage of new markets.",
      "We saw that in the president's first term, when the likes of Vietnam and Malaysia took advantage of the tariffs he imposed on China to increase the amount they sold to America.",
      "Ironically, they consequently are in the firing line now - and so will likely be vying to sell more to the UK \u2013 good for consumers, less so for competing businesses",
      "Already, many producers are turning their sights beyond established customers \u2013 think whisky makers looking towards Asia. That is likely to intensify.",

      "Jock Scott, from Nuneaton, asks Business reporter Nick Edser if the US tariffs have an effect on the UK's cost of living.",
      "As ever when looking at the implications of the tariffs, there's a lot of uncertainty over this. In some circumstances UK prices could go up, in others they could fall.",
      "The tariffs announced by Trump on Wednesday will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US. This means the initial impact of price rises is likely to be on US consumers, if American firms pass on the extra costs.",
      "However, some economists think the tariffs could strengthen the value of the dollar against other currencies. If the pound weakens against the dollar, then UK firms importing goods from the US will face higher costs. This could then lead to higher prices of these goods in UK shops if companies cannot absorb the increased costs themselves.",
      "Also, if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on the extra costs to customers.",
      "However, some economists have suggested prices could also fall as a result of the tariffs.",
      "Swati Dhingra, an economist and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, has suggested that firms which normally send their goods to the US may instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK, potentially leading to a flood of cheaper goods.",
      "What does this mean for my pension?",
      "Robert Jones, from Cardiff, asks Kevin Peachey, Cost of living correspondent, about the impact of tariffs on our pension investments.",
      "There is little doubt Trump's announcement on tariffs has led to immediate moves in share prices and are also likely to have a longer-term economic impact.",
      "Robert and Stephen have mentioned the drop in the value of their pension investments, and the situation will be unsettling for millions of people with any kind of investments.",
      "Experts say that investors have always had to ride economic shocks. Investments, by definition, require a long-term outlook and strategy. So, they are urging people not to panic or make knee-jerk decisions.",
      "That said, for those about to draw on investments, it may be more worrying, albeit that most pension savings are moved into safer holdings like cash or bonds as people approach retirement age. The state pension is unaffected.",

      "Paul Naldrett from Windsor asks Business correspondent Marc Ashdown if the UK's position outside of the European Union is actually an opportunity as the EU is given 20% tariffs.",
      "Some are referring to a \"Brexit benefit\" because the UK is only subject to 10% tariffs rather than the 20% being slapped on the EU.",
      "Not only will that limit the pain felt by British businesses compared to their European neighbours, but it could present trading opportunities.",
      "UK exporters to America could have a competitive edge, with US importers only facing half the tax by dealing with UK businesses instead of EU businesses.",
      "British firms - and consumers - could also benefit from cheaper goods finding their way here instead of America if the extra costs prove insurmountable.",
      "But, there are concerns about the impact that could have on homegrown industries if cheap products, possibly with lower standards, flood the UK market."

      "What were the calculations?",
      "When Trump presented a giant cardboard chart detailing the tariffs in the White House Rose Garden it was initially assumed that the charges were based on a combination of existing tariffs and other trade barriers (like regulations).",
      "But later, the White House published what might look like a complicated mathematical formula.",
      "But if you unpick the formula above it boils down to simple maths: take the trade deficit for the US in goods with a particular country, divide that by the total goods imports from that country and then divide that number by two.",
      "A trade deficit occurs when a country buys (imports) more physical products from other countries than it sells (exports) to them.",

      "Global reaction: How five big economies see new Trump tariffs",
      "UK: What this means for you and your money",
      "Explainer: What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them?",
      "US analysis: Trump's tariffs are his biggest gamble yet",
      "For example, the US buys more goods from China than it sells to them - there is a goods deficit of $295bn. The total amount of goods it buys from China is $440bn.",
      "Dividing 295 by 440 gets you to 67% and you divide that by two and round up. Therefore the tariff imposed on China is 34%.",
      "Similarly, when it applied to the EU, the White House's formula resulted in a 20% tariff.",
      "Are the Trump tariffs 'reciprocal'?",
      "Many commentators have pointed out that these tariffs are not reciprocal.",
      "Reciprocal would mean they were based on what countries already charge the US in the form of existing tariffs, plus non-tariff barriers (things like regulations that drive up costs).",
      "But the White House's official methodology document makes clear that they have not calculated this for all the countries on which they have imposed tariffs.",
      "Instead the tariff rate was calculated on the basis that it would eliminate the US's goods trade deficit with each country.",
      "Trump has broken away from the formula in imposing tariffs on countries that buy more goods from the US than they sell to it.",
      "For example the US does not currently run goods trade deficit with the UK. Yet the UK has been hit with a 10% tariff.",
      "In total, more than 100 countries are covered by the new tariff regime.",
      "'Lots of broader impacts'",
      "Trump believes the US is getting a bad deal in global trade. In his view, other countries flood US markets with cheap goods - which hurts US companies and costs jobs. At the same time, these countries are putting up barriers that make US products less competitive abroad.",
      "So by using tariffs to eliminate trade deficits, Trump hopes to revive US manufacturing and protect jobs.",
      "But will this new tariff regime achieve the desired outcome?",
      "BBC Verify has spoken to a number of economists. The overwhelming view is that while the tariffs might reduce the goods deficit between the US and individual countries, they will not reduce the overall deficit between the US and rest of the world.",
      "\"Yes, it will reduce bilateral trade deficits between the US and these countries. But there will obviously be lots of broader impacts that are not captured in the calculation\", says Professor Jonathan Portes of King's College, London.",
      "That's because the US' existing overall deficit is not driven solely by trade barriers, but by how the US economy works.",
      "For one, Americans spend and invest more than they earn and that gap means the US buys more from the world than it sells. So as long as that continues, the US may continue to keep running a deficit despite increasing tariffs with it global trading partners.",
      "Some trade deficits can also exist for a number of legitimate reasons - not just down to tariffs. For example, buying food that is easier or cheaper to produce in other countries' climates.",
      "Thomas Sampson of the London School of Economics said: \"The formula is reverse engineered to rationalise charging tariffs on countries with which the US has a trade deficit. There is no economic rationale for doing this and it will cost the global economy dearly.\"",

    "summary": "There were five Asian nations in the 10 countries and territories hit with the highest tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "As US President Donald Trump laid out tariffs on virtually every one of America's trading partners on Wednesday, he had strong words for Beijing.",
      "\"I have great respect for President Xi [Jinping] of China, great respect for China, but they were taking tremendous advantage of us,\" Trump said during his roughly hour-long address.",
      "Holding up a chart listing countries and territories that he said had put up trade barriers to US goods, Trump said: \"If you look at that... China, first row, 67%. That's tariffs charged to the USA, including currency manipulation and trade barriers.\"",
      "\"We are going to be charging [them] a discounted reciprocal tariff of 34%,\" he added. \"In other words, they charge us, we charge them, we charge them less. So how can anybody be upset?\"",
      "But China's Commerce Ministry immediately called the move \"a typical act of unilateral bullying\" and pledged to take \"resolute countermeasures to safeguard its rights and interests\".",
      "And state news agency Xinhua accused Trump of \"turning trade into an over simplistic tit-for-tat game\".",
      "Experts believe Beijing has good reason to be upset.",
      "For one, the latest announcement is an add on to existing tariffs of 20% on Chinese goods.",
      "Secondly, by imposing heavy tariffs on other South East Asian countries including Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos, it has 'slammed the door shut' on how China rejigged its supply chains to get around the tariffs imposed on Beijing during Trump's first term.",
      "There were five Asian nations in the 10 countries and territories hit with the highest tariffs.",
      "The taxes are adding up for China",
      "Trump has imposed new tariffs on Chinese imports since returning to the White House in January, ratcheting up levies to 20%.",
      "In less than a week, these tariffs will jump to 54%, apart from on products like cars, steel and aluminium, which will be subjected to lower tariffs.",
      "Beijing has also been on the receiving end of other Trump trade salvos.",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, the President signed an executive order to end a provision for low-value parcels from China.",
      "This had allowed Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu to ship packages with a retail value of under $800 (\u00a3617) to the US, without taxes and inspections.",
      "Close to 1.4 billion shipments entered the US under the provision in the last financial year, according to customs data.",
      "The removal of the exemption could force some Chinese firms to pass the extra cost on to customers, making their goods less competitive in the US.",
      "When taken together, this is a worrying picture for Beijing, said Deborah Elms from the Hinrich Foundation consultancy.",
      "\"I don't think the new tariffs are necessarily aimed at China. But when the United States stacks tariffs on top of each other, specifically towards China, the numbers become eye-watering quite quickly.\"",
      "\"China and the Chinese will have to retaliate. They are not going to be able to sit back and watch this,\" she said.",
      "Supply chain hit",
      "Trump also imposed heavy tariffs, ranging from 46% to 49%, on Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.",
      "This represents \"a full-frontal assault on Beijing's extended supply chain,\" said Stephen Innes from investment firm SPI Asset Management.",
      "\"Vietnam... and others in the periphery are collateral damage in what is shaping up to be the most aggressive realignment of US trade policy in a generation,\" he added. \"This isn't tit-for-tat - it's strategic containment via tariff warfare.\"",
      "Laos and Cambodia, which are among the poorest countries in the region, are heavily dependant on Chinese investment in supply chain infrastructure. The high tariff rates are expected to hit both countries hard.",
      "China is Vietnam's largest trading partner. It was one of the key beneficiaries of US-China tensions during Trump's first term.",
      "In 2018, Trump hit China with tariffs, causing some businesses to rethink where they made their products. Some chose to shift manufacturing to Vietnam.",
      "This has led to an increase of exports from Vietnam to the US, with Chinese companies that have moved production there contributing to that figure.",
      "\"Vietnam was clearly targeted [by Trump] due to its role as a conduit for China's circumvention of previous tariffs\", former US trade negotiator Stephen Olson told the BBC.",
      "While the US remains Vietnam's biggest export market, China is its largest supplier of goods, accounting for more than a third of imports, according to the latest official data.",
      "Chinese firms were also behind nearly one in every three new investments in Vietnam last year.",
      "Pushan Dutt, a professor at the INSEAD business school, said the new taxes on South East Asia will be \"prohibitive\" for China.",
      "\"China has a problem with demand and in the last Trump administration their firms had nimbly reacted to tariffs by rejigging supply chains and moving them to [South East Asian nations]. This door has been slammed shut,\" he added.",
      "But Trump's taxes on the region will also impact US companies that manufacture goods in South East Asia.",
      "For instance, American businesses including technology giants Apple and Intel, and sportswear giant Nike have large factories in Vietnam.",
      "A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam found that most US manufacturers there expect to lay off staff if tariffs are imposed.",
      "'Tough choices' ahead",
      "There is the question of what China can do to respond to the new tariffs, given it only has days before they are due to take effect.",
      "Mr Olson said he expects Beijing to have a \"forceful\" response with tariffs and other measures making it more difficult for US companies to operate in China.",
      "With the Chinese economy already facing challenges, Beijing faces \"tough choices\" in the days ahead, said Professor Dutt.",
      "\"Exporting to other regions threatens de-industrialisation in these destinations - and political leaders there are unlikely to accept this. That means China has to finally unleash domestic demand and the Chinese household,\" he added.",
      "The tariffs could also push China to try and build alliances with other Asian nations who have been on the receiving end of the tariffs.",
      "Wang Huiyao, a former China Communist Party member who works with the Center for China and Globalisation think tank, called on Asian countries to \"work together to go through this difficult time and fight protectionism\".",
      "\"In the end, the US could be losing all the influence and isolate itself,\" he added.",
      "Some discussions are already underway. China, South Korea and Japan recently held their first economic talks in five years.",
      "They agreed to speed up talks for free trade agreement - which was first proposed over a decade ago.",
      "The new tariffs could give them added incentive to do so.",
      "However, Beijing could face some short-term pain while talks with Washington take its course.",
      "\"Ultimately, the US and China are headed for a negotiating table where they'll try to reach some type of a grand bargain on a wide range of issues,\" Mr Olson said.",
      "\"That won't necessarily happen soon and I expect things to get worse before they get better,\" he added."

    "story": [
      "Warning: This article contains details and images that some readers may find distressing",
      "Driving into Mandalay, the massive scale of the destruction from last Friday's earthquake revealed itself bit by bit.",
      "In nearly every street we turned into, especially in the northern and central parts of the city, at least one building had completely collapsed, reduced to a pile of rubble. Some streets had multiple structures which had come down.",
      "Almost every building we saw had cracks running through at least one of its walls, unsafe to step into. At the main city hospital they're having to treat patients outdoors.",
      "Myanmar's military government has said it's not allowing foreign journalists into the country after the quake, so we went in undercover. We had to operate carefully, because the country is riddled with informers and secret police who spy on their own people for the ruling military junta.",
      "What we witnessed was a people who had very little help coming their way in the face of this massive disaster.",
      "\"I have hope that he's alive, even if it's a small chance,\" said Nan Sin Hein, 41, who's been waiting on the street opposite a collapsed five-storey building, day and night for five days.",
      "Her 21 year-old-son Sai Han Pha is a construction worker, renovating the interiors of the building, which used to be a hotel and was being turned into an office space.",
      "\"If they can rescue him today, there's a chance he'll survive,\" she says.",
      "When the 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck, the bottom of the building sank into the ground, its top lurching at an angle over the street, looking like it could tip over at any minute.",
      "Sai Han Pha and four other workers were trapped inside.",
      "When we visited, rescue efforts had not even begun at the building and there was no sign they would start soon. There just isn't enough help available on the ground - and the reason for that is the political situation in the country.",
      "Even before the earthquake Myanmar was in turmoil - locked in a civil war that has displaced an estimated 3.5 million people. Its military has continued operations against armed insurgent groups despite the disaster.",
      "This means that security forces are too stretched to put their full might behind relief and rescue operations. Except in some key locations, we didn't see them in large numbers in Mandalay.",
      "The military junta has put out a rare appeal for international aid, but its uneasy relations with many foreign countries, including the UK and the US, has meant that while these countries have pledged aid, help in the form of manpower on the ground is currently only from countries like India, China and Russia, among a few others.",
      "And so far those rescue efforts appear to be focused on structures where masses of people are feared trapped \u2013 the high-rise Sky Villa condominium complex which was home to hundreds of people, and U Hla Thein Buddhist academy where scores of monks were taking an examination when the earthquake struck.",
      "Neeraj Singh, who is leading the Indian disaster response team working at the Buddhist academy, said the structure had collapsed like a \"pancake\" - one layer on top of another.",
      "\"It's the most difficult collapse pattern and the chances of finding survivors are very low. But we are still hopeful and trying our best,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Working under the sweltering sun, in nearly 40C, rescuers use metal drills and cutters to break the concrete slabs into smaller pieces. It's slow and extremely demanding work. When a crane lifts up the concrete pieces, the stench of decaying bodies, already quite strong, becomes overwhelming.",
      "The rescuers spot four to five bodies, but it still takes a couple of hours to pull the first one out.",
      "Sitting on mats under a makeshift tent in the compound of the academy are families of the students. Their faces are weary and despondent. As soon as they hear a body has been recovered, they crowd around the ambulance it is placed in.",
      "Myanmar earthquake: What we know",
      "Others gather around a rescuer who shows them a photo of the body on his mobile phone.",
      "Agonising moments pass as the families try to see if the dead man is a loved one.",
      "But the body is so disfigured, the task is impossible. It is sent to a morgue where forensic tests will have to be conducted to confirm the identity.",
      "Among the families is the father of 29-year-old U Thuzana. He has no hope that his son survived. \"Knowing my son ended up like this, I'm inconsolable, I'm filled with grief,\" U Hla Aung said, his face crumpling into a sob.",
      "Many of Mandalay's historical sites have also suffered significant damage, including the Mandalay Palace and the Maha Muni Pagoda, but we could not get in to see the extent of the damage.",
      "Access to everything - collapse sites, victims and their families - was not easy because of the oppressive environment created by the military junta, with people often fearful of speaking to journalists.",
      "Close to the pagoda, we saw Buddhist funeral rituals being held on the street outside a destroyed house. It was the home of U Hla Aung Khaing and his wife Daw Mamarhtay, both in their sixties.",
      "\"I lived with them but was out when the earthquake struck. That's why I survived. Both my parents are gone in a single moment,\" their son told us.",
      "Their bodies were extricated not by trained rescuers, but by locals who used rudimentary equipment. It took two days to pull out the couple, who were found with their arms around each other.",
      "Myanmar's military government says 2,886 people have died so far, but so many collapse sites have still not even been reached by the authorities, that that count is unlikely to be accurate. We may never find out what the real death toll of the earthquake was.",
      "Parks and open spaces in Mandalay have turned into makeshift camps, as have the banks of the moat that runs around the palace. All over the city we saw people laying out mats and mattresses outside their homes as evening approached, preferring to sleep outdoors.",
      "Mandalay is a city living in terror, and with good reason. Nearly every night since Friday there have been big aftershocks. We woke up to an aftershock of magnitude 5 in the middle of the night.",
      "But tens of thousands are sleeping outdoors because they have no home to return to.",
      "\"I don't know what to think anymore. My heart still trembles when I think of that moment when the earthquake struck,\" said Daw Khin Saw Myint, 72, who we met while she was waiting in a queue for water, with her little granddaughter by her side. \"We ran out, but my house is gone. I'm living under a tree. Come and see.\"",
      "She works as a washerwoman and says her son suffers from a disability which doesn't allow him to work.",
      "\"Where will I live now? I am in so much trouble. I'm living next to a rubbish dump. Some people have given me rice and a few clothes. We ran out in these clothes we are wearing.",
      "\"We don't have anyone to rescue us. Please help us,\" she said, tears rolling down her cheeks.",
      "Another elderly woman chimes in, eyes tearing up, \"No one has distributed food yet today. So we haven't eaten.\"",
      "Most of the vehicles we saw pulling up to distribute supplies were small vans with limited stocks - donations from individuals or small local organisations. It's nowhere near enough for the number of people in need, leading to a scramble to grab whatever relief is available.",
      "Parts of Mandalay's main hospital are also damaged, and so in an already difficult situation, rows and rows of beds are laid out in the hospital compound for patients.",
      "Shwe Gy Thun Phyo, 14, has suffered from a brain injury, and has bloodshot eyes. She's conscious but unresponsive. Her father tries to make her as comfortable as possible.",
      "There were very few doctors and nurses around to cope with the demand for treatment, which means families are stepping in to do what medical staff should.",
      "Zar Zar has a distended belly because of a serious abdominal injury. Her daughter sits behind her, holding her up, and fans her, to give her some relief from the heat.",
      "We couldn't spend a lot of time at the hospital for fear of being apprehended by the police or military.",
      "As the window to find survivors of the earthquake narrows, increasingly those being brought into the hospital are the dead.",
      "Nan Sin Hein, who is waiting outside the collapsed building where her son was trapped, was initially stoical, but she now looks like she is preparing to face what seems like the most likely outcome.",
      "\"I'm heartbroken. My son loved me and his little sisters. He struggled to support us,\" she says.",
      "\"I am just hoping to see my son's face, even if he is dead. I want to see his body. I want them to do everything they can to find his body.\""

      "In previous natural disasters, such as Cyclone Mocha in 2023 and Typhoon Yagi in 2024, which left hundreds dead, the military obstructed relief efforts in resistance-held areas by refusing to release supplies from customs, authorise travel for aid workers or relax restrictions on lifesaving assistance.",
      "\"It's a worrying trend that happens in times of crisis, like the earthquake,\" Mr Quinley said. \"The junta is blocking any aid to what they see as groups that are aligned with the broader resistance.\"",
      "James Rodehaver, head of the Myanmar team at the Office for the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, further suggested that the junta deprives Myanmar's population of aid as a form of punishment.",
      "\"They do that because the local population, by and large, does not support them, so by depriving them of humanitarian aid, they are both punishing them but also cutting off their ability to support themselves and be resilient,\" he told the BBC.",
      "There are already signs the junta may be repeating this tactic in Sagaing.",
      "Although central Myanmar, which includes the cities of Sagaing and Mandalay, is nominally run by the junta - meaning aid can only be delivered to the area with their co-operation - large parts of the broader Sagaing and Mandalay regions are considered resistance strongholds.",
      "The likelihood that the junta might tactically deprive these areas of aid has prompted outcry from hundreds of human rights and civil society organisations, who have urged the international community to ensure relief efforts get to where they're most needed, and aren't channelled through the military government.",
      "One such statement, signed by 265 civil society organisations and released on Sunday, notes that most of the worst-hit areas are under the effective control and administration of pro-democracy resistance groups.",
      "\"Myanmar's history provides stark warnings about the dangers of channelling aid through the military junta,\" it reads.",
      "In Sagaing, the impact of aid shortfalls can already be seen in troubling ways, according to relief agencies.",
      "They speak of shortages of food, water and fuel, while trucks carrying aid are stranded at military checkpoints around the city. Hundreds of residents, suddenly homeless, are sleeping outside on the street. Rescue volunteers who were forced to dig through the rubble with their bare hands have run out of body bags for those they couldn't save.",
      "Other community members seeking to respond to the earthquake are being forced to get authorisation from junta authorities by submitting lists of volunteers and items to be donated, local media reported.",
      "This tactic \u2013 of bombarding responders with lengthy bureaucratic checklists and processes \u2013 is routinely deployed by the junta to restrict the activities of international aid organisations in Myanmar, humanitarian sources told the BBC.",
      "According to a registration law imposed in 2023, such organisations must attain a registration certificate, and often sign a memorandum of understanding with relevant government ministries, to legally operate inside the country.",
      "One source, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said aid groups are often required to remove certain activities, areas or townships from their proposals, with no room for negotiation. Areas where the junta doesn't have oversight or control over the aid work are typically those that are disallowed, they added.",
      "Aid agencies have found ways to navigate the junta's restriction, however: a lot of humanitarian assistance in Myanmar happens underground, via local groups that can bypass checkpoints and distribute aid without attracting the attention of the authorities.",
      "Many financial transactions in humanitarian aid also happen outside of Myanmar's banking system, so that actors can avoid scrutiny and potential investigation from the country's central bank, a source told the BBC. In some cases, humanitarian organisations open bank accounts in Thailand so that they can privately receive aid funds, then carry the money over the border into Myanmar in cash.",
      "Such covert methods take time, however, and could lead to potentially fatal delays of days or weeks.",
      "Some aid workers are hopeful that, given the scale of Friday's earthquake and the international appeal for assistance by Min Aung Hlaing, it may be easier to overcome barriers and provide aid more efficiently.",
      "\"In the past we have faced some challenges,\" said Louise Gorton, an emergency specialist based in Unicef's East Asia and Pacific Regional Office.",
      "\"The scale of this emergency, though, is significantly higher\u2026 I think there will be pressure on the regime to ensure unfettered and unimpeded humanitarian access - and we'll continue to repeat the same need and find ways, sometimes low-key ways, to deliver aid.\"",
      "Another aid worker, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that while it's too early to tell whether the junta will truly \"open all ways for foreign aid\", their team is prepared to navigate the complex humanitarian situation to deliver assistance.",
      "\"It's certainly a concern that they [the military] may direct the aid in specific places, and not based on need.\"",
      "\"But as humanitarian actors [our organisation] works under a humanitarian mandate, and will be very focused on getting aid to the places it needs to go - to the hardest-hit areas, regardless of who controls them.\"",
      "Early indications suggest that, despite Min Aung Hlaing's plea to the international community, the embattled junta leader is unlikely to prioritise the unfettered flow of humanitarian aid.",
      "Shortly after the earthquake, military jets launched a series of airstrikes on affected areas, killing more than 50 civilians, according to the National Unity Consultative Council (NUCC).",
      "Then, on Tuesday, Min Aung Hlaing rejected ceasefire proposals that were put forward by resistance groups in a bid to facilitate aid. Military operations would continue as \"necessary protective measures\", he said.",
      "The junta changed its mind a day later, agreeing to a 20-day ceasefire to help relief efforts. But it remains to be seen whether the pause in hostilities will hold. The military stressed it would \"respond accordingly\" if rebels launched attacks.",
      "For many onlookers, this seeming contradiction - of asking for aid with one hand while conducting military strikes with the other - chimes with Min Aung Hlaing's history of duplicity.",
      "John Quinley, from Fortify Rights, noted that the junta leader has \"lied on numerous occasions\" - and suggested that the recent appeal for foreign aid is more likely an appeal for international recognition.",
      "Against that backdrop, Mr Quinley added, it's critical to ensure earthquake relief gets to where it is most needed.",
      "\"I think as a human rights group we need to monitor: OK, [Min Aung Hlaing] allows aid in - but is it actually reaching people in need? Or is he weaponising the aid? Is he blocking the aid from getting to communities in need?\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not hopeful when it comes to taking what Min Aung Hlaing says with any hint of truth.\"",

    "story": [
      "Twenty-three more women have come forward to the police with allegations against serial rapist Zhenhao Zou - a Chinese PhD student found guilty in London last month of drugging and raping 10 women across two continents.",
      "Police said at the conclusion of his trial they had video evidence, filmed by Zou himself, of potentially 50 more victims - and they have been trying to trace these women. Detectives now say, however, that they believe Zou's \"offending group is far greater\".",
      "Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual violence",
      "Read this story in Chinese",
      "Two women who have contacted police in the past month with new allegations have also spoken to the BBC World Service. One said Zou raped her in his hometown in China, after spiking her drink which left her conscious but unable to speak or move. The other said Zou drugged her too - in London - and that she had woken up to find him filming himself sexually assaulting her.",
      "We have also spoken to two women whose testimony helped convict Zou - who will be sentenced in June. \"If I had spoken up earlier, maybe there wouldn't have been so many victims after me,\" one of them told us.",
      "She and the other women say they struggle with the guilt of now knowing that Zou has assaulted so many women.",
      "Two bottles on the table",
      "One of the women making new allegations, who we are calling Alice, told the BBC that Zou had assaulted her in London in 2021, but that she had only felt able to go to police after his trial last month. \"I didn't know that was something you could report,\" the Chinese national told us.",
      "She says she first met Zou while out clubbing in London with other Chinese-student friends. The group had all added one another on WeChat, a popular social messaging app.",
      "Not long afterwards, a mutual friend invited Alice to have drinks at Zou's upmarket student accommodation in Bloomsbury.",
      "There were two bottles of spirits on the table, she says, both already opened and half-empty. She began to share drinks from one of the bottles with her friend - but says Zou only drank from the other one.",
      "Alice says her friend normally tolerated alcohol well, but this time became drunk very quickly and appeared to fall asleep on the floor. The alcohol kicked in suddenly for Alice too, she says.",
      "\"Normally when you drink too much, you feel good for a while. But that night I just felt extremely dizzy and sleepy right away.\"",
      "Zou persuaded her it wouldn't be safe to take a taxi home in the state she was in, she told us, and asked her to take a nap in his bedroom. She says she agreed, knowing her friend was also still in the apartment.",
      "The next thing she says she remembers is waking up to Zou removing her trousers.",
      "\"I stopped him right away,\" she says - explaining how she then noticed a torchlight from a mobile phone above her head, and realised, to her horror, that he was filming her.",
      "Alice describes trying to leave his bedroom but being aggressively \"yanked back from the doorway\". Zou used such strong force to try to keep her in the bedroom, she says, that she \"had to cling on to the door frame with both hands\".",
      "It was only when she threatened to scream for help, that he let go - she told us - with Zou then telling her not to make \"a big deal\" of things, or to go to the police.",
      "Zou contacted Alice the next day on WeChat, she says, but he made no mention of the previous night. He asked her to dinner but she says she ignored him and they were never in touch again.",
      "Alice confided in a few close friends, but took things no further.",
      "\"I thought that, first, you needed evidence. And second, something substantial had to have happened before you could call the police.\"",
      "Alice says the next time she saw Zou's face was nearly four years later in the media - after he was charged by police.",
      "It is challenging for foreign nationals to report sexual crimes in the UK, says Sarah Yeh, a trustee at Southeast and East Asian Women's Association in London.",
      "\"It would be daunting for anyone [from] overseas to be traumatised by rape and then have to navigate the British legal system and the NHS, or even access the services provided for victims,\" she told us.",
      "They might not understand their rights or what resources are available to them - she says - as well as being concerned about repercussions, negative impacts on their studies, shame brought on themselves and their families, and potential legal challenges.",
      "About a year after Alice says she was assaulted, she discovered that one of her male friends in London also knew Zou, but had cut all contact because he found out Zou had been spiking women's drinks.",
      "The friend - who the BBC is calling Jie - told us he \"wasn't surprised at all\" when he heard Zou had been convicted.",
      "\"A lot of friends at the time probably knew [what Zou was doing]. I reckon some of our female friends knew too.\"",
      "Jie told us he accidentally drank from someone else's glass at a party in 2022, and then became \"unwell\" and \"very sleepy\". Zou then told him he had spiked the drink - says Jie - and had meant for a woman at the party to drink it.",
      "Jie says Zou later showed him a small bag of drugs and asked if he wanted to \"collaborate with him\". He says he took from this that Zou wanted his help finding girls whose drinks he could spike. Jie says he refused.",
      "The BBC asked Jie why he had initially continued to see Zou and why he didn't go to the police. Jie told us they both had lots of mutual friends so it was difficult not to socialise together. He says he did warn his friends about Zou, telling them not to hang out with him \"because he was drugging people\".",
      "Jie doesn't like thinking about those memories, he says, and that is why he hasn't gone to the police - adding that he had believed the women's testimonies were enough to convict Zou.",
      "Eventually, Jie says, he did cut all ties with him.",
      "Another young woman who has been in touch with police in London and China since Zou's trial is \"Rachel\". She says she was drugged and raped by him in 2022 in his hometown of Dongguan - in Guangdong province.",
      "Rachel told the BBC she had gone on a date with Zou, having met him online. She thought they were going to a bar, she says, but ended up at his home - a large villa which Zou had described as one of his family's many properties.",
      "With his back turned to her, she says Zou mixed her a green-coloured cocktail. They then started a drinking game, she says, and she experienced a \"wave of dizziness\". Rachel has told UK police that Zou took her up to a bedroom, where she became unable to speak or move her body, and then raped her.",
      "She thought about calling the police the next day, but decided against it. She feared it would be very difficult to prove non-consent. \"It's hard for me to prove the fact that I was willing to go to his place for drinks and that was not a signal that I was consenting to sex,\" she told us.",
      "She added that Dongguan is a small place and there was always a risk that people she knew - her parents, relatives and colleagues - would find out and think she was \"indiscreet\".",
      "Details of help and support with sexual violence are available at BBC Action Line",
      "Details of help and support with sexual violence are available at BBC Action Line",
      "We have seen Rachel's statement to UK police. She wants her story to be heard now, she says, to encourage more victims to come forward - and because she would like to see Zou prosecuted in China as well as the UK.",
      "Cdr Kevin Southworth - who leads public protection at the Metropolitan Police - told the BBC officers were still working their way through the 23 potential new cases and that some of the people were \"definitely not identical\" to those featured in Zou's seized secret footage or from the charge cases so far.",
      "\"It speaks to the fact that his offending group is actually far greater than we had realised,\" he says.",

      "'He wears a Rolex submariner watch'",
      "The BBC has also spoken to the only two victims who police were able to identify ahead of Zou's trial - both are Chinese nationals who had been studying in London. The women got to know each other on social media after one of them, who we are calling Beth, posted about her experience.",
      "Beth was raped by Zou in 2023 and had tried to report the crime to the Metropolitan Police soon afterwards. But then she decided not to pursue things because she felt unsure of UK law and had been left feeling discouraged after her initial interaction with the police, which included a poor translation of her 999 call.",
      "\"Back then I didn't know [Zou's name]. I didn't know his address, I could only give general information,\" she says.",
      "In frustration, Beth posted a warning on social media about what had happened to her. Another Chinese student, \"Clara\", says she \"immediately\" knew this was the same man who had drugged and raped her after a night out in London's Chinatown, two years before.",
      "Every detail in Beth's post pointed to the same man, says Clara: \"He has a Guangdong accent, he looks honest and he wears a Rolex submariner watch.\"",
      "The women began to speak online and Beth encouraged Clara to report what had happened to her to the police.",
      "Months later, police contacted Beth to say they were re-investigating the case. Clara had come forward.",
      "On Zou's seized devices, police had also found a video featuring Beth.",
      "The Met has since expressed regret over how it initially handled her allegations.",
      "\"We want to avoid situations where victims feel like they're maybe not being taken seriously, or heaven forbid, being disbelieved,\" says Cdr Southworth. Additional training is now being rolled out to all front line officers, he says.",
      "Clara describes a positive experience with British police. She says she didn't want to fly to London for the trial, in case her parents found out, so the Met sent two officers to China to support her as she gave evidence by video instead.",
      "The officers were assisted by the Chinese authorities, who have been working collaboratively with the Met and are \"very supportive\", says Cdr Southworth.",
      "\"I hope that can give some encouragement to victim-survivors, wherever they are in the world, that you are safe to come forward.\"",
      "In addition to his time in London, Zou also studied in Belfast between 2017 and 2019 - police do not know if his campaign of drug rape had already begun while he was there.",
      "Beth - who gave her evidence in court in London - says it was only afterwards that she realised that she and Clara were the only two women to have helped convict Zou.",
      "\"I thought for a long time that I wasn't an important part of the case against Zou,\" she says.",

      "Maybe Marine Le Pen was naive in not predicting this outcome. It certainly appears as if her National Rally party was singularly unprepared for it.",
      "So as they met in an emergency session after the verdict, party leaders were in a dilemma.",
      "Do they continue as if there is still a chance Marine Le Pen will run in 2027?",
      "In theory there is still a (small) possibility.  She has launched an appeal. The appeal could be accelerated and take place at the end of this year or early 2026. A verdict would follow in the spring.",
      "A different decision at the appeal hearing could lessen the period of ineligibility, or remove it altogether \u2013 in which case she could still run.  But the chances must be regarded as slim.",
      "Or, should they proceed with plan B \u2013 that is to say, with naming party president Jordan Bardella as de facto the man who will run in Marine Le Pen's place?",
      "That might be a more realistic assessment of what lies ahead. But to turn to Bardella too quickly would be unseemly.  And anyway, not everyone in the party is a fan.",
      "By the evening the choice had been made: in a TV appearance Marine Le Pen came out fighting, saying she had no plans to retreat from the political scene.",
      "Denouncing what she called a \"political\" decision by the judge and a \"violation of the state of law\", she called for a swift appeal trial, so that her name could be cleared \u2013 or at least the ineligibility lifted \u2013 in time for the 2027 vote.",
      "\"There are millions of French people who believe in me. For 30 years I have been fighting against injustice. It is what I shall continue to do right to the end,\" she said.",
      "Fighting words \u2013 but in reality the future looks very unclear. And there are many unanswered questions.",
      "What, for example, will the effect of the court decision be on the RN vote?",
      "In the short term we can expect an outcry, and a boost to the party's support.  Why? Because what has happened fits so neatly into the RN narrative that the populist right is a victim of the \"system\".",
      "No-one likely to vote for the RN seriously holds it against Marine Le Pen for illegally financing her party using EU parliament funds.  They all know that practically every French political party has resorted to similar underhand methods in the past.",
      "By the same token,  her \"draconian\" punishment \u2013 being banned from standing for the presidency \u2013 will be interpreted as a badge of honour: proof that she alone is standing up to the powers-that-be.",
      "Longer term, though, the boost may not be so powerful.  The truth is that Marine Le Pen is a huge asset to the RN.  This battle-hardened, sentimental, cat-loving,  tough-talking,  long-suffering woman is held in affection by her supporters, who feel they know her personally.",
      "Jordan Bardella is a popular figure too, but at just 29 it is hard to see him filling her shoes. If Marine Le Pen is indeed unable to run in 2027, the RN loses much of its appeal.",
      "What is certain is that many would-be candidates on the non-RN right \u2013 Laurent Wauquiez, Bruno Retailleau for example \u2013 would see in a Bardella candidacy a big opportunity for themselves.",
      "The other unknown is vengeance.",
      "Marine Le Pen remains a member of the National Assembly, where she leads a bloc of 125 \u2013 the parliament's biggest.  Till now she had been benign towards the beleaguered prime minister Francois Bayrou, who struggles on despite having no majority.",
      "Those days may be over.",
      "Why should we do anyone any favours now, they will be saying at RN HQ. Why not bring the house down?",

    "story": [
      "Nintendo has announced a June 5 launch date for its latest gaming console, the Switch 2, which will introduce interactive chat and screenshare functions to connect gamers. Pre-orders in the U.S., however, will not start April 9 as expected \"in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,\" Nintendo said, promising to update timing soon.",
      "At its 60-minute Nintendo Direct presentation, the company revealed a more vibrant display on the Switch 2, a larger screen and several games that will launch with the console.",
      "Central to its updated system is a new \"C\" button on its Joy-Con controller, which will launch a new \"GameChat\" feature that allows you to \"communicate with friends and family while playing a game\" and lets you share your game screen with other players. A built-in microphone will also allow you to chat with other gamers. The \"GameChat\" feature requires a subscription to Nintendo's Switch online service.",
      "\"When you think about some of the biggest titles on (the Nintendo Switch), it's like Mario Kart, Super Mario Jamboree, even though that's quite a new title, has cracked the top 10 of most play games on the console. So, it does make a lot of sense that the sort of headline feature is geared primarily towards that sort of use,\" said Hannah Cowton-Barnes, a London-based video game industry expert for Tech Advisor.",
      "Perhaps the most contemporary function yet for the Switch 2 is the ability to use the Joy-Con controllers like a computer mouse. The developer displayed multiple ways to use the new function in games, such as angling a club in a golf game.",
      "The new portable console features a 7.9 inch LCD screen that displays in 1080p. Nintendo also revealed in the live stream that, when docked, the system will be able to support 4K resolution for compatible games.",
      "Wednesday's presentation started off with an extended look at \"Mario Kart World\" \u2014 the console's launch bundle game \u2014 which adds a bit of flair to the series with in-game characters doing tailwhips, flips, rail grinds and other tricks.",
      "The developer also unveiled a new James Bond game, dubbed \"Project 007,\" revisiting a classic Nintendo 64 console hit revered by many first-person shooter fans.",
      "Nintendo also announced two more Switch 2 exclusives featuring its marquee characters. \"Donkey Kong Bananza,\" a 3D adventure with the big ape punching his way through a huge underground world, arrives July 17. \"Kirby Air Riders,\" a racing game from the director of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, is due later in the year.",
      "Third-party exclusives likely to create some buzz include Koei-Tecmo's \"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,\" a hack-and-slash prequel to \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,\" coming this winter. From Software's \"The Duskbloods,\" a baroque multiplayer title from the creators of Elden Ring, is scheduled for 2026.",
      "Miss the GameCube? Nintendo said Switch Online subscribers will be able to access a limited selection of GameCube titles such as \"The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\" and \"F-Zero GX.\"",
      "The new console will be backwards compatible \u2014 able to play physical and digital Switch games \u2014 but users will need to purchase a microSD express memory card for the Switch 2. The presentation revealed that normal SD cards will not be compatible with the system. However, data from the original Switch can be transferred to the new console using a transfer feature.",
      "The original Switch, released in 2017, is \"one of the most popular game consoles of all time,\" Scott Stein, editor-at-large at CNET,\u00a0told CBS News Boston in January.",
      "It became popular in part because of its unique design. Resembling a tablet, the device has detachable pieces on each side that can be used to control game play. It also allows users to continuing playing a game on a television screen when docked on a charging station, a first-of-its-kind feature at the time.",
      "But the original has aged, leading to some of the excitement for the new version, Stein said.",
      "\"There's a lot of stuff it does well but there's a lot of stuff that people I think want it to do better for playing games they can play elsewhere,\" he said, noting the ability to take it on the go differentiates it from other gaming consoles.",
      "How much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?",
      "Nintendo will retail the Switch 2 for $449.99 at launch, which is significantly higher than the original Switch's $299 price tag. A separate bundle that includes the new \"Mario Kart World\" game will also be available for $499.99.",
      "Gene Park, a Washington Post reporter covering video games and gaming culture, told CBS News the console is \"a little pricey, but it is a more powerful system.\"",
      "He noted that the \"Mario Kart World\" game itself is priced at $80.",
      "\"It's a little eyebrow-raising. It's really the first Nintendo game to broach $80, and there's a lot of talk about video games becoming $100 right now,\" Park said.",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have hit the video game console industry at a fragile moment, said Joost van Dreunen, author of \"One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.",
      "\"At the beginning of a new hardware cycle, all of a sudden we're looking at this price hike,\" said van Dreunen, a games industry researcher. \"I had originally predicted that the Switch 2 would be $400. Now it's announced that it's $450. That $50 difference is a Trump tax.\"",
      "The tariffs, he said, impact games hardware because console devices are manufactured and shipped from China and that region at large.",
      "The early stages of a hardware life cycle are already very low margin, or usually a loss for hardware manufacturers, van Dreunen said. Those manufacturers typically eat the margin in order to get the devices out to stores.",
      "\"But with an increased tariff, that means that margin is probably even worse than it historically is. But their hands are kind of tied. They can't not progress. They can't not launch a new hardware generation. So for the consumer base, people are just going to pay more.\"",
      "The Consumer Technology Association also predicted President Trump's tariffs would drive up prices of video game consoles, and retailers like Best Buy have warned they may have to raise prices due to the tariffs.",
      "Nintendo plans to host \"Switch 2 Experience\" events in several countries, where gamers can get a hands-on experience with the new system. Those events are planned for cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris beginning this month.",

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "The smoldering intensity of actor Val Kilmer (Dec. 31, 1959-April 1, 2025) radiated off movie screens with his memorable turns as brooding artists, obsessive criminals, doomed lawmen, and a fighter jock nicknamed Iceman. He starred in such films as \"Top Gun,\" \"Heat,\" \"Tombstone\" and \"The Doors.\"",
      "While attending New York City's Juilliard School (he was admitted at age 17), Kilmer co-wrote and appeared in the play \"How It All Began.\" In 1983 he starred on Broadway in the play \"Slab Boys,\" opposite Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn. He made his movie debut in the 1984 spoof \"Top Secret!\" (from the creators of \"Airplane!\"), followed by \"Real Genius.\"",
      "One of his most memorable characters, that of pilot Tom Kazansky in 1986's \"Top Gun,\" almost didn't happen. Kilmer wrote in his 2020 memoir, \"I'm Your Huckleberry,\" that he initially turned down the role: \"I didn't want the part. I didn't care about the film. The story didn't interest me.\" Script changes led to his signing up.",
      "As a charismatic leading man, Kilmer commanded the screen playing Doc Holliday in the western \"Tombstone,\" a demolition expert in the bank heist film \"Heat,\" and rock idol Jim Morrison in \"The Doors.\" \u00a0Other films included \"Willow,\" \"Thunderheart,\" \"True Romance,\" \"The Ghost and the Darkness,\" \"The Saint,\" \"Alexander,\" \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,\" \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu,\" \"Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans,\" \"Joe the King,\" \"Spartan,\" \"Twixt,\" and \"Wonderland.\"",
      "Kilmer wrote, directed and starred in a one-man stage show in which he played humorist Mark Twain, titled \"Citizen Twain.\" He also published two books of poetry. Following treatments for cancer, Kilmer repeated the role of Iceman in the 2022 sequel, \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"",
      "A low point may have been when he donned the Batman costume to star in the 1995 film \"Batman Forever.\" He explained in the documentary \"Val\" that the suit constricted his performance: \"It was frustrating until I realized that my role in the film was just to show up and stand where I was told to.\"",
      "Kilmer's reputation for being difficult on set would dog him (John Frankenheimer, who replaced the fired director of \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" told Entertainment Weekly that there were two things he would never do: \"Climb Mount Everest, and work with Val Kilmer again\"). But he was also praised by fellow actors for his immersion into his characters.",
      "In a tribute to Kilmer, actress Jennifer Tilly recalled\u00a0the audition process for Oliver Stone's \"The Doors\": \"It was kind of a cattle call. They paired together potential Jims with potential Pamelas. And they were running behind so we were spilling out of the casting office, sitting on the porch, the lawn, and the driveway. All of a sudden, a sixties convertible came screeching up, blaring Doors Music at top volume. And a guy jumped out and strode inside: He had wild hair and he was barefoot, shirtless, and wearing nothing but a pair of tight leather pants. We all looked at each other like\u2026 Who is this guy? We were more than a little shook by the sheer audacity of his entrance. Well of course it was Val Kilmer and from that minute on, nobody else stood a chance.\""

      "Val Kilmer died from pneumonia. He had recovered after a 2014 throat cancer diagnosis that required two tracheotomies.",
      "The New York Times was first to report on Kilmer's death.",
      "A unique talent, Kilmer was praised as an acting chameleon who took on varied and challenging roles, and the results were often memorable. Beginning with \"Top Gun\" alongside Tom Cruise in 1986, he turned in one iconic performance after another \u2014 able to transition effortlessly between leading man and supporting roles.",
      "There was his turn as Jim Morrison in the 1991 Oliver Stone classic \"The Doors,\" and as the quick-witted Doc Holliday in the 1993 Western \"Tombstone.\" He followed that up in 1995 as Batman in \"Batman Forever\" and played a bank robber in Michael Mann's 1995 crime thriller \"Heat.\"",
      "His last major film credit was in 2022's \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" in which he reprised his role as Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky.",
      "Toward the end of \"Val,\" the 2021 documentary on his career, Kilmer said, \"I have behaved poorly. I have behaved bravely. I have behaved bizarrely to some. I deny none of this and have no regrets because I have lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed. And I am blessed.\"",
      "Kilmer, who attended the prestigious Juilliard School, experienced the ups and downs of fame more dramatically than most. His break came in 1984's spy spoof \"Top Secret!\" followed by the comedy \"Real Genius\" in 1985. Kilmer would later show his comedy chops again in films including \"MacGruber\" and \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.\"",
      "His movie career hit its zenith in the early 1990s as he made a name for himself as a dashing leading man, starring alongside Kurt Russell and Bill Paxton in \"Tombstone,\" as Elvis' ghost in \"True Romance\" and as a bank-robbing demolition expert in Mann's film \"Heat\" with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.",
      "The actor - who took part in the Method branch of Suzuki arts training - threw himself into parts. For his role in \"Tombstone,\" he filled his bed with ice for the final scene to mimic the feeling of dying from tuberculosis. To play Morrison, he wore leather pants all the time, asked castmates and crew to only refer to him as Jim Morrison and blasted The Doors for a year.",
      "That intensity also gave Kilmer a reputation that he was difficult to work with, something he grudgingly agreed with later in life, but always defending himself by emphasizing art over commerce.",
      "\"In an unflinching attempt to empower directors, actors and other collaborators to honor the truth and essence of each project, an attempt to breathe Suzukian life into a myriad of Hollywood moments, I had been deemed difficult and alienated the head of every major studio,\" he wrote in his memoir, \"I'm Your Huckleberry.\"",
      "One of his more iconic roles - as hotshot pilot Kazansky opposite Cruise - almost didn't happen. Kilmer was courted by director Tony Scott for \"Top Gun\" but initially balked. \"I didn't want the part. I didn't care about the film. The story didn't interest me,\" he wrote in his memoir. He agreed after being promised that his role would improve from the initial script.",
      "Kilmer vs. the Batman costume",
      "One career nadir when he played Batman in Joel Schumacher's goofy, garish \"Batman Forever\" with Nicole Kidman and opposite Chris O'Donnell's Robin - before George Clooney took up the mantle for 1997's \"Batman & Robin\" and after Michael Keaton played the Dark Knight in 1989's \"Batman\" and 1992's \"Batman Returns.\"",
      "Janet Maslin in The New York Times said Kilmer was \"hamstrung by the straight-man aspects of the role,\" while Roger Ebert deadpanned that he was a \"completely acceptable\" substitute for Keaton. Kilmer, who was one and done as Batman, blamed much of his performance on the suit.",
      "\"When you're in it, you can barely move and people have to help you stand up and sit down,\" Kilmer said in \"Val.\" \"You also can't hear anything and after a while people stop talking to you, it's very isolating. It was a struggle for me to get a performance past the suit, and it was frustrating until I realized that my role in the film was just to show up and stand where I was told to.\"",
      "His next projects were the film version of the 1960s TV series \"The Saint\" - fussily putting on wigs, accents and glasses - and \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" with Marlon Brando, which became one of the decade's most infamously cursed productions.",
      "David Gregory's 2014 documentary \"Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau,\" described a cursed set that included a hurricane, Kilmer bullying director Richard Stanley, the firing of Stanley via fax (who sneaked back on set as an extra with a mask on) and extensive rewrites by Kilmer and Brando. The older actor told the younger at one point: \"'It's a job now, Val. A lark. We'll get through it.' I was as sad as I've ever been on a set,\" Kilmer wrote in his memoir.",
      "In 1996, Entertainment Weekly ran a cover story about Kilmer titled \u2033The Man Hollywood Loves to Hate.\u2033 The directors Schumacher and John Frankenheimer, who finished \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" said he was difficult. Frankenheimer said there were two things he would never do: \u2033Climb Mount Everest and work with Val Kilmer again.\u2033",
      "Other artists came to his defense, like D. J. Caruso, who directed Kilmer in \u2033The Salton Sea\u2033 and said the actor simply liked to talk out scenes and enjoyed having a director's attention.",
      "\u2033Val needs to immerse himself in a character. I think what happened with directors like Frankenheimer and Schumacher is that Val would ask a lot of questions, and a guy like Schumacher would say, 'You're Batman! Just go do it,'\u2033 Caruso told The New York Times in 2002.",
      "After \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" the movies were smaller, like David Mamet human-trafficking thriller \"Spartan\"; \u2033Joe the King\u2033 in 1999, in which he played a paunchy, abusive alcoholic; and playing the doomed '70s porn star John Holmes in 2003's \"Wonderland.\" He also threw himself into his one-man stage show \"Citizen Twain,\" in which he played Mark Twain.",
      "\"I enjoy the depth and soul the piece has that Twain had for his fellow man and America,\" he told Variety in 2018. \"And the comedy that's always so close to the surface, and how valuable his genius is for us today. Still, we battle racism and greed. The same country, it's greatness and it's tragedy.\"",
      "Kilmer's early years",
      "Kilmer spent his formative years in the Chatsworth neighborhood of Los Angeles. He attended Chatsworth High School alongside future Oscar winner Kevin Spacey and future Emmy winner Mare Winningham. At 17, he was the youngest drama student ever admitted at the Juilliard School in 1981.",
      "Shortly after he left for Juilliard, his younger brother, 15-year-old Wesley, suffered an epileptic seizure in the family's Jacuzzi and died on the way to the hospital. Wesley was an aspiring filmmaker when he died.",
      "\u2033I miss him and miss his things. I have his art up. I like to think about what he would have created. I'm still inspired by him,\u2033 Kilmer told the Times.",
      "While still at Juilliard, Kilmer co-wrote and appeared in the play \"How It All Began\" and later turned down a role in Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Outsiders\" for the Broadway play, \"Slab Boys,\" alongside Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn.",
      "Kilmer published two books of poetry (including \"My Edens After Burns\") and was nominated for a Grammy in 2012 for spoken word album for \"The Mark of Zorro.\" He was also a visual artist and a lifelong Christian Scientist.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump is taking center stage at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. \"We are going to make a lot of changes,\" he said earlier this month, \"including the seats, the decor, pretty much everything. It needs a lot of work.\"",
      "He's directing many of those changes as the new chairman of the board. Out are all of President Joe Biden's appointees, replaced with Trump allies.",
      "The Trump White House says an overhaul is needed because the marquee arts center is, in their words, \"woke \u2026 and broke.\"",
      "Last month, Deborah Rutter was fired as president of the Kennedy Center after serving for more than a decade. Asked whether the arts institution is broke, Rutter replied, \"The Kennedy Center has the most complicated financial model, and that is true of every nonprofit arts organization.\"",
      "It has a budget of $268 million, with $43 million coming from the federal government. In 2023, the Kennedy Center had a $6 million surplus, even though it is not supposed to be a money-making enterprise. \"We're a nonprofit organization,\" Rutter said. \"It's not intended to make money.\"",
      "Its budget comes mostly from donations. Billionaire businessman and former chairman David Rubenstein has given more than $100 million. He, too, was fired last month. Rutter said, \"To have us both leaving at the same time does cause me some worry, because of the sense of understanding of structure, decision-making, how we go about interpreting our mission, all of those kinds of things.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was founded in 1971 as a national cultural center and memorial to President John F. Kennedy. Its annual honors ceremony, which airs on CBS, features the best in music, theater and dance.",
      "But now, conservatives charge the center is \"too liberal,\" highlighting three drag events last year, including a \"Broadway Drag Brunch.\"",
      "Asked whether it was a mistake to host drag shows, Rutter replied, \"I don't think so. I believe that everybody in America has the opportunity to be seen, and to be seen at your national cultural center.\"",
      "She pointed out that the shows Trump referred to in a social media post (\"THIS WILL STOP,\" he promised) represented just three of the 2,000 performances that took place at the Kennedy Center last year.",
      "Asked why the focus was on three drag shows, Rutter replied, \"I can't actually imagine. Drag has been around for centuries. Shakespeare performed in drag, the original Shakespeare.\"",
      "President Trump boycotted the Kennedy Center Honors during his first term, after criticism from honorees like Norman Lear. So, what does the new chairman have planned now? In audio obtained by \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" he suggests a new host \u2013 himself:",
      "\"The king of ratings, right? Whether we like it or not, the king of ratings! So, if I was the host of the Honors, and we'll go slightly more conservative, if you don't mind, with some of the people\u2026\"",
      "So, what kind of people does President Trump want to honor? Paolo Zampolli, a longtime friend of the president who has been on the board since 2020, said, \"There were mentioned a list of people, I remember the name of Pavarotti. I remember the name of Andrea Bocelli. They wanted to do something about Elvis Presley.\"",
      "Zampolli has suggested changes to make the Kennedy Center \"better\": \"We're on the Potomac River. We could have a little marina where in the weekend boats can come, and nice cafes, nice location where they can spend the weekend there and make it like a destination. Other things that I suggested is branch franchises around the world.\"",
      "Another idea? Sending art to the International Space Station. \"My idea was to have, not Michelangelo, not Picasso, but you know, living contemporary artists to create very small pieces of art,\" Zampolli said, \"One that can be displayed inside the ISS. One can be thrown in LEO, low orbit, that can circulate in the orbit. And one can be auctioned on the ground of the Kennedy Center, because they need to raise money.\"",
      "Some artists (including those who are LGBTQ) have expressed the belief that they won't be welcome at the Kennedy Center. But Zampolli said, \"I don't think the president have anything against these kind of people. I don't understand what is things 'inclusion' or this 'woke.' The Kennedy Center is accessible for everybody, and has to represent the agenda of America.\"",
      "Not everyone agrees. One thing you won't see at the Center is the musical \"Hamilton.\" Producers cancelled shows after President Trump became chairman. The president's response? \"I never liked 'Hamilton' very much. I never liked it.\"",

Let's say I get in an artist that has different views than the president. Do they feel safe being themselves? Do they feel safe saying what they believe? They're not political shows, but you can express what you'd like to.\"",
      "And is that no longer the case? \"Well, I suspect it's no longer the case,\" Folds said. \"There is an instinct, an authoritarian instinct, that is true in all authoritarian times in history: Take control of the culture, take control of the arts early on.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Mar 2025 12:06:41 -0400",
    "summary": "To young Brandi Carlile, a girl coming of age and struggling with her own sexuality, Elton John was a flicker of hope in a confusing world. Today, the two music superstars are friends and collaborators, recording an album together, \"Who Believes in Angels?\"",
    "story": [
      "Sir Elton John has millions of fans all over the world, but few of them as devoted as a young girl who first heard his music more than 30 years ago.",
      "In 1992, Brandi Marie Carlile was a kid living in a single-wide trailer in rural Washington State, and to her, Elton John was everything. Young Brandi collected everything about him she could get her hands on \u2013 records, photos, even an Elton John book she borrowed from a library 33 years ago, and kept(!). \"The date is still on here. Boulevard Park Library, May 10, 1992. It's all time stamped. And they're gonna have to come and get it!\"",
      "Little Brandi is now music superstar Brandi Carlile, but to a young girl coming of age and struggling with her own sexuality, Elton John was a flicker of hope in a confusing world. She loved him, and said so in writing, covering an entire page front to back with \"I love Elton John.\" \"It's insane,\" she said. \"I look at it now. I just can't believe what happened in my life to get me to where I am now. It's such a strange thing. It makes you wonder, it just makes you wonder. I do love Elton John!\"",
      "As a kid, she never dreamed she'd get to actually meet him one day, but sometimes dreams have a funny way of coming true. Now they're not only friends, but collaborators. It started a few years back when Carlile wrote to John out of the blue, and asked him to play piano on her new record.\u00a0 Long story short, he said yes, and they grew to be the best of friends \u2013 appearing together, performing together, even vacationing together with their families.",
      "And now, they're about to release an album they made together, recorded at Sunset Sound in Hollywood. It's Brandi Carlile's eighth studio album, and Elton John's 33rd.",
      "So, why did they decide to do an entire album together? John said, \"She's someone I wanted to work with for so long because I know how great she is. I know how her voice is, and I knew what she's capable of, and I wanted to push her more. And I wanted her to push me more. So, I wanted to make a record that was full of energy and great songs. And it turned out really brilliantly.\"",
      "There were cameras in the studio to capture all the highs, and a few of the lows. \"I didn't even think of them being there,\" John said.",
      "\"Yeah, I never saw one,\" Carlile said.",
      "It got tense at times (John admits, \"I haven't really seen the footage, but a lotta people say it's really, really very moving. And all of my behavior is not so moving!\"), but for Brandi, it was still the greatest show on Earth. \"It really felt like I was watching Mozart or, like, one of the great composers,\" she said. \"Stream of consciousness through their entire body, create music in a way that I've never seen. And I was so close. I had a front-row seat.\"",
      "John called it \"one of the greatest musical experiences of my life.\"",
      "Elton John and Brandi Carlile perform \"Swing For The Fences\":",
      "The fact that John got through the recording process at all is remarkable. For the past year, he's been fighting a severe eye infection that's left him nearly blind. But he says that, all things considered, he's doing all right. \"Medically, I'm fit as I've ever been,\" he said. \"I have checkups every month. But the eyesight thing is a bit of a bind, because I haven't been able to watch anything for about seven months. I haven't been able to read. I haven't been able to watch television or anything.",
      "\"But you know what? I've come to the conclusion that if we can't find a solution to it, and this is what it's like for the rest of my life, then I'm okay,\" he said. \"I can still play the piano. I can still sing, which is a gift. My life's fantastic. It's still the greatest gift that anyone could have.\"",
      "These days, John, who turned 78 this past week, is counting his blessings. But the final track on the album really struck a nerve: \"When This Old World Is Done With Me,\" co-written by longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin.",
      "He got very emotional in the studio while recording it: \"Well, I started singing, and I thought the verse was really beautiful. But then I had no idea what was coming. And when I got to the chorus, I realized what was coming, and I just broke down. And I sobbed, and I sobbed, and I sobbed, because it's about my death, basically. And when you get to my age, and a certain age, you think about mortality, because I wanna spend so much time with my children and David and my friends, that you want every single moment to count. And so, this was a song about I don't want to die. I wanna be with my children. I wanna be with David forever. And so, it really got to me.\"",
      "David is husband David Furnish. The two were married in 2014. They have two sons, Zachary and Elijah.",
      "Dad might be a global superstar, but there's no doubt where his heart is. Asked what he is most proud of, John replied, \"Yeah, my kids. My husband. That's it. All I want on my gravestone is, 'He was a great dad.' Nothing to do with music. 'He was a great dad.' That's all I care about.\"",
      "Their new album will be released this week, and for Carlile, it's still a little hard to believe: \"Yeah, it's so weird. Is it not? It's brilliant. Like, it's a wonderful thing. I hope everybody can take some hope and beauty and mysticism from the fact that this has happened. If it could happen to 11-year-old single-wide mobile home Brandi Carlile, it could really happen to anyone.\"",
      "Turns out these two friends don't just lean on each other; they push each other to new heights. The title track of their album is \"Who Believes In Angels?\" But maybe Elton John and Brandi Carlile are angels for each other.",
      "Elton John and Brandi Carlile perform \"Who Believes In Angels?\":",
      "John said, \"God, it was a challenge. But that's what life's all about. If you don't have a challenge at 76, then never give up. Never coast. There are so many artists that coast that don't make new songs. They just go around and play their hits, like I did. I didn't wanna do it with this record. I wanted a new start. I want a fresh start.",

    "published": "Thu, 03 Apr 2025 21:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Multiple FDA labs were cut amid Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs this week.",
    "story": [
      "Some of the Food and Drug Administration's efforts to support testing for the ongoing bird flu outbreak have been disrupted due to steep layoffs at the agency, multiple officials told CBS News Thursday, in the latest fallout from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s cuts to the nation's federal health agencies.",
      "In one example, a planned FDA exercise with a network of veterinary testing labs around the country to ensure they are able to detect the virus in milk has been suspended, due to the elimination of the agency's food safety lab in Illinois, two federal health officials said.",
      "Officials had planned the exercise for 40 laboratories across the FDA-backed Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, as well as additional government-backed and private labs, which are using different methods to test for the virus.",
      "\"Unfortunately, significant Reductions In Force (RIF), including a key quality assurance officer, at FDA's Human Food Program Moffett Center has caused immediate and significant impact on the Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network,\" read an email sent Thursday to members of the laboratory network, obtained by CBS News.",
      "News of the disruption to the FDA exercise was first reported by Reuters.",
      "The effort \"would have been critical to ensure confidence in the laboratory methods for food safety and animal health,\" the email read.",
      "Labs are testing milk both to detect the virus in sick cattle as well as for food safety purposes, an official said.",
      "The department has laid off some 10,000 workers under a plan drawn up by Kennedy and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting task force. The FDA lost around 3,500 full-time employees due to the layoffs, including staff supporting the agency's food and drug safety inspectors.",
      "\"This overhaul is about realigning HHS with its core mission: to stop the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again. Despite spending $1.9 trillion in annual costs, Americans are getting sicker every year, and we must shift course,\" an HHS official said in a statement.",
      "The official said that HHS layoffs \"focused personnel cuts on redundant or unnecessary administrative positions.\"",
      "\"HHS also reduced its regional footprint by moving out of the highest cost cities, shuttering offices in Boston, Chicago, NYC, San Francisco, and Seattle,\" the statement said.",
      "Other federal labs have been gutted due to Kennedy's cuts, including U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention labs investigating STD and hepatitis outbreaks.",
      "Another disrupted bird flu effort was at the FDA's San Francisco-area food safety testing lab, two officials said.",
      "That lab is responsible for food safety testing for both humans and animals, officials said. One official said the lab had been setting up to begin testing pet food for bird flu, as part of the agency's regulatory response to outbreaks.",
      "Now the lab has been closed, with staff also completely eliminated as part of Kennedy's cuts on Tuesday. It is unclear whether the agency's remaining labs will be able to fill the gap.",
      "Several multistate recalls of pet food for bird flu contamination have been announced by health authorities in recent months, after cats and other animals were sickened. The virus has been especially lethal to pet cats.",
      "In the final days of the Biden administration, the FDA's veterinary center called on pet food manufacturers to take additional steps to ensure their products were free of the virus.",
      "Through the center, the FDA has oversight over the safety of drugs and food given to animals, including pets.",

    "story": [
      "Senior Food and Drug Administration leaders are planning for cutbacks to the number of routine food and drug inspections conducted by the agency, multiple officials say, due to steep layoffs this week in support staff.",
      "Around 170 workers were cut from the FDA's Office of Inspections and Investigations, according to two federal health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services has said layoffs ordered\u00a0by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with some 10,000 workers let go from the department, would not directly cut FDA's inspections staff. But in meetings among federal health officials, the agency's remaining leaders have grappled with how to deal with major delays and disruptions caused by the loss of administrative and management staff who had supported the agency's inspectors, according to two FDA officials.",
      "\"These administrative functions are being streamlined as part of HHS' transformation initiative to make the agency more efficient and responsive. FDA inspectors were not impacted and this critical work will continue,\" an HHS spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The inspections and investigations office will now need to work with FDA's drug, device and food centers to reprioritize their workload for the rest of the year, one official said. That will mean trimming routine \"surveillance inspections\" for more urgent tasks, the official said, like inspections of firms where the agency has been alerted to a safety risk or follow-up visits to ensure that drugmakers or food producers have fixed previous violations.",
      "One of the biggest immediate impacts on the agency's inspectors stems from the elimination of the office's travel operations division, one official said. The team's work ranged from booking flights to coordinating with the State Department to secure translators needed for inspections of drugmakers and food producers abroad.",
      "\"As of yesterday, all front-line investigators will now be spending significant time processing their own travel and related administrative requirements, rather than spending that time in firms ensuring the American consumer is protected,\" one FDA official told CBS News.",
      "A pilot program of unannounced foreign inspections has also been paused due to the cuts, an official said, because of the loss of staff that had been tasked with quickly securing translators around the world.",
      "The FDA has long struggled to meet its own inspection goals, which was worsened by a backlog created during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a January report by the Government Accountability Office, the FDA was facing a swelling list of food safety inspections that were on track to miss deadlines mandated by Congress, as they struggled to hire and retain qualified inspectors.",
      "While current inspections are still taking place, multiple FDA officials said that cuts are likely to worsen delays caused by other challenges introduced by the Trump administration's efforts to cut spending in recent months.",
      "As one example, multiple officials said that field operations have been hampered by a new government-wide $1 limit on spending cards. Any spending above that limit requires a cumbersome approval process.",
      "Inspectors had already been asked to plan their inspections a month in advance due to the delays caused by the spending limit, one official said.",

      "\"For most types of FOIA requests there is no staff,\" the FDA official said.",
      "Many FOIA staff at the National Institutes of Health were also let go, one official said, but not all. No explanation was given for why some were cut while others remain on the job, the official said, in an apparent violation of the federal government's procedures for prioritizing for some employees based on their military and federal service.",
      "The goal of the cuts is to create a central place to handle FOIA requests for the entire department, an HHS official said, making it easier for the public to submit their requests.",
      "While no final decisions have been made on what exactly the new FOIA process will look like at HHS, the official said, their goal is to continue the work started by the now-cut staff.",

      "The S&P 500 fell 237 points, or 4.4%, to 5,159 as of 10:56 a.m. EST. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 1,475 points, or 3.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 4.6%.",
      "The indexes' free-fall Thursday was their biggest one-day drop since 2020, with more than $2 trillion in investor wealth erased from the S&P 500. The Dow and S&P 500 each sank more than 4% yesterday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged nearly 6%.",
      "Drops of this magnitude aren't unheard of on Wall Street, but they're rare. Over the last 25 years, the S&P 500 has fallen 4% in a single day 38 times, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for brokerage firm LPL Financial.",
      "Overseas markets also slid Friday. In overnight trading in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 dropped 2.8%, while South Korea's Kospi sank 0.9%. In European trading, Germany's DAX lost 2%, France's CAC 40 in Paris dipped 1.6% and Britain's FTSE 100 shed 1.7%.",
      "U.S. growth downgraded",
      "Economists have downgraded their outlook for U.S. economic growth this year as Mr. Trump has piled tariffs on a growing list of countries, warning that the levies are likely to boost inflation. That, in turn, could reduce consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.",
      "Import taxes are largely borne by businesses, which typically pass along part or much of those added costs to consumers. As a result, Americans could face higher prices for electronics, household appliances, cars, clothing, furniture and food such as coffee and chocolate, according to economists.",
      "\"Looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters,\" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech Friday in Arlington, Va.",
      "According to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research firm, the Trump administration's tariffs could cost U.S. households more than $1,900 this year.",
      "David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, thinks U.S. trade officials will eventually lower tariff rates as they negotiate with their counterparts abroad. But that process will take time, and the investment bank doesn't expect a speedy reversal in tariffs. As a result, UBS economists have lowered their forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to less than 1%.",
      "China strikes back",
      "Investors are also nervously watching as the barrage of U.S. tariffs prompts retaliation from key trading partners. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014 materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose trade sanctions on 27 additional U.S. companies.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "In better news for financial markets, U.S. employers added 228,000 jobs in March, far exceeding analyst forecasts. The nation's unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, versus 4.1% in February.",
      "Yet while job growth was robust last month, the government's latest hiring numbers don't reflect the impact of the Trump administration's trade policies on the economy.",

      "Nintendo has announced a June 5 launch date for its latest gaming console, the Switch 2, which will introduce interactive chat and screenshare functions to connect gamers. Pre-orders in the U.S., however, will not start April 9 as expected \"in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,\" Nintendo said, promising to update timing soon.",
      "At its 60-minute Nintendo Direct presentation, the company revealed a more vibrant display on the Switch 2, a larger screen and several games that will launch with the console.",
      "Central to its updated system is a new \"C\" button on its Joy-Con controller, which will launch a new \"GameChat\" feature that allows you to \"communicate with friends and family while playing a game\" and lets you share your game screen with other players. A built-in microphone will also allow you to chat with other gamers. The \"GameChat\" feature requires a subscription to Nintendo's Switch online service.",
      "\"When you think about some of the biggest titles on (the Nintendo Switch), it's like Mario Kart, Super Mario Jamboree, even though that's quite a new title, has cracked the top 10 of most play games on the console. So, it does make a lot of sense that the sort of headline feature is geared primarily towards that sort of use,\" said Hannah Cowton-Barnes, a London-based video game industry expert for Tech Advisor.",
      "Perhaps the most contemporary function yet for the Switch 2 is the ability to use the Joy-Con controllers like a computer mouse. The developer displayed multiple ways to use the new function in games, such as angling a club in a golf game.",
      "The new portable console features a 7.9 inch LCD screen that displays in 1080p. Nintendo also revealed in the live stream that, when docked, the system will be able to support 4K resolution for compatible games.",
      "Wednesday's presentation started off with an extended look at \"Mario Kart World\" \u2014 the console's launch bundle game \u2014 which adds a bit of flair to the series with in-game characters doing tailwhips, flips, rail grinds and other tricks.",
      "The developer also unveiled a new James Bond game, dubbed \"Project 007,\" revisiting a classic Nintendo 64 console hit revered by many first-person shooter fans.",
      "Nintendo also announced two more Switch 2 exclusives featuring its marquee characters. \"Donkey Kong Bananza,\" a 3D adventure with the big ape punching his way through a huge underground world, arrives July 17. \"Kirby Air Riders,\" a racing game from the director of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, is due later in the year.",
      "Third-party exclusives likely to create some buzz include Koei-Tecmo's \"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,\" a hack-and-slash prequel to \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,\" coming this winter. From Software's \"The Duskbloods,\" a baroque multiplayer title from the creators of Elden Ring, is scheduled for 2026.",
      "Miss the GameCube? Nintendo said Switch Online subscribers will be able to access a limited selection of GameCube titles such as \"The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\" and \"F-Zero GX.\"",
      "The new console will be backwards compatible \u2014 able to play physical and digital Switch games \u2014 but users will need to purchase a microSD express memory card for the Switch 2. The presentation revealed that normal SD cards will not be compatible with the system. However, data from the original Switch can be transferred to the new console using a transfer feature.",
      "The original Switch, released in 2017, is \"one of the most popular game consoles of all time,\" Scott Stein, editor-at-large at CNET,\u00a0told CBS News Boston in January.",
      "It became popular in part because of its unique design. Resembling a tablet, the device has detachable pieces on each side that can be used to control game play. It also allows users to continuing playing a game on a television screen when docked on a charging station, a first-of-its-kind feature at the time.",
      "But the original has aged, leading to some of the excitement for the new version, Stein said.",
      "\"There's a lot of stuff it does well but there's a lot of stuff that people I think want it to do better for playing games they can play elsewhere,\" he said, noting the ability to take it on the go differentiates it from other gaming consoles.",
      "How much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?",
      "Nintendo will retail the Switch 2 for $449.99 at launch, which is significantly higher than the original Switch's $299 price tag. A separate bundle that includes the new \"Mario Kart World\" game will also be available for $499.99.",
      "Gene Park, a Washington Post reporter covering video games and gaming culture, told CBS News the console is \"a little pricey, but it is a more powerful system.\"",
      "He noted that the \"Mario Kart World\" game itself is priced at $80.",
      "\"It's a little eyebrow-raising. It's really the first Nintendo game to broach $80, and there's a lot of talk about video games becoming $100 right now,\" Park said.",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have hit the video game console industry at a fragile moment, said Joost van Dreunen, author of \"One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.",
      "\"At the beginning of a new hardware cycle, all of a sudden we're looking at this price hike,\" said van Dreunen, a games industry researcher. \"I had originally predicted that the Switch 2 would be $400. Now it's announced that it's $450. That $50 difference is a Trump tax.\"",
      "The tariffs, he said, impact games hardware because console devices are manufactured and shipped from China and that region at large.",
      "The early stages of a hardware life cycle are already very low margin, or usually a loss for hardware manufacturers, van Dreunen said. Those manufacturers typically eat the margin in order to get the devices out to stores.",
      "\"But with an increased tariff, that means that margin is probably even worse than it historically is. But their hands are kind of tied. They can't not progress. They can't not launch a new hardware generation. So for the consumer base, people are just going to pay more.\"",
      "The Consumer Technology Association also predicted President Trump's tariffs would drive up prices of video game consoles, and retailers like Best Buy have warned they may have to raise prices due to the tariffs.",
      "Nintendo plans to host \"Switch 2 Experience\" events in several countries, where gamers can get a hands-on experience with the new system. Those events are planned for cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris beginning this month.",

    "summary": "President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on about 90 countries, including China and the European Union. Here's the list.",
    "story": [
      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations will face only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries will be charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports will face the baseline rate of 10%, while China will face a 34% tariff.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his\u00a0Wednesday remarks.",
      "Asian nations will face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic. On top of China's 34% reciprocal tariff, imports from that nation will also face previously announced 20% tariffs, bringing that nation's total rate to more than 60%, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Full list of Trump's reciprocal tariffs by country",
      "When will these tariffs go into effect?",
      "The reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries likely to retaliate against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "For now, other countries are taking a more measured approach in their response. European Union trade chief Maros Sefcovic is scheduled to meet with U.S. officials on Friday after Mr. Trump hit the 27-nation bloc with a 20% tariff.",

Economists have questioned the methodology, and many foreign governments have complained the levies are unfair and misrepresent their trade imbalances with the U.S.",

That hemorrhaging of stock values continued in Asian and European markets Friday as China announced its retaliation \u2014 becoming the first country to do so since Mr. Trump made his announcement at the White House on Wednesday.",

      "\"Investor psychology has been destroyed, and dip buyers are nowhere to be seen,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a research note. \"All the efforts to spin recent events positively are increasingly falling flat.\"",
      "Highlighting the extent of the losses: Nearly every major industrial sector suffered declines, with tech players, banks, retailers, apparel makers and airlines among the hardest hit. Best Buy shares sank roughly 18%, United Airlines fell 16% and Nike slid 16%, while even AI powerhouse Nvidia saw its stock drop nearly 8%.",
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. trading partners and increased levies on dozens of countries that charge higher taxes on American exports. Mr. Trump has said the goal is to make global commerce more fair, spur companies to expand in the U.S. and generate federal revenue.",
      "Experts warn that sharply ramping up tariffs on imports, coupled with any retaliatory measures from other nations, could drive up inflation, dampen spending by consumers and businesses, and hurt economic growth.",
      "\"Market uncertainty is likely to remain elevated in the weeks ahead, as investors consider likely downgrades to consensus U.S. economic and earnings growth forecasts, the risk of a tit-for-tat escalation in tariffs and the potential scope for tariffs announced to be negotiated down,\" Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to investors.",
      "Appearing on CNN Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt expressed confidence that the Trump administration's economic policies would pay off. Commenting on global financial markets sliding overnight, she said, \"To anyone on Wall Street this morning, I would say trust in President Trump.\"",
      "Souring sentiment",
      "Financial markets surged after Mr. Trump was re-elected in November, with Wall Street counting on lower taxes and deregulation to fuel corporate profits. Other investors bet on the Trump administration threatening tariffs mostly as a way to pressure other countries into making concessions on trade, rather than a full-fledged push to change the terms of global commerce.",
      "But after hitting all-time highs in February, stocks have turned tail as the White House makes clear it wasn't bluffing. Indeed, investors have been left stunned by the speed and scale of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "In contrast to his first term, when he implemented levies on roughly $380 billion worth of goods over four years, Mr. Trump has imposed more than $3 trillion in tariffs in the less than three months since his return to power, according to the Economic Policy institute, a left-leaning think tank.",
      "\"Markets may actually be underreacting, especially if these rates turn out to be final, given the potential knock-on effects to global consumption and trade,\" said Sean Sun, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment management.",
      "Including its Thursday dive, the S&P 500 is now down 8.2% this year, the Dow has sunk 4.7% and the Nasdaq has tumbled 14.3%.",
      "Despite the angst on Wall Street, economists note that the U.S. continues to grow, and most still put relatively low odds on a recession. Hiring around the U.S. also remains healthy, with the nation's unemployment rate hovering around 4%.",
      "For borrowers, meanwhile, further signs the economy is at risk of stalling could encourage the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark interest rate. The central bank last cut rates in December of 2024, but has kept them steady since then as policy makers seek to douse inflation.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon has told the White House it is interested in buying TikTok ahead of a key deadline by which its parent company, China-based ByteDance, must either sell the popular social media app or face a ban in the U.S., CBS News has learned, according to two people familiar with discussions.",
      "Amazon has submitted a bid for the app, the\u00a0New York Times reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter. Another plan under consideration is for a new entity backed by U.S. companies like BlackRock and Oracle to lease TikTok's algorithm from ByteDance, according to a source familiar with the situation.",
      "Both Amazon and TikTok declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the New York Times reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Air Force One over the weekend, Mr. Trump addressed the matter of TikTok's sale, saying, \"We have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.\"",
      "He added that he'd \"like to see TikTok remain alive.\"",
      "The U.S. government has said TikTok poses a threat to national security because its vast trove of customer data, including browsing patterns, locations and biometric information, could end up in the hands of the Chinese authorities.",
      "Ahead of the initial divestiture deadline, ByteDance earlier this year briefly shut down TikTok in the U.S. Mr. Trump quickly paused the ban and the service was restored.",
      "The ban does not target TikTok's U.S. users. But the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, signed into law in 2024 under former President Biden, would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores and web-hosting services to distribute or service TikTok.",

      "The automaker is also temporarily pausing production at its Toluca (Mexico) Assembly Plant for April. The plant will idle production on April 7.",
      "As a result of the pause, 900 workers at the company's Warren Stamping and Sterling Stamping plants in Michigan, as well as its Indiana Transmission Plant, Kokomo Transmission Plant and Kokomo Casting Plant, are being laid off.",
      "In a letter sent to employees Thursday morning, Antonio Filosa, Stellantis' Chief Operating Officer for the Americas, said the automaker is continuing to assess the impacts of tariffs on its operations.",
      "\"We are continuing to assess the medium- and long-term effects of these tariffs on our operations, but also have decided to take some immediate actions, including temporarily pausing production at some of our Canadian and Mexican assembly plants. Those actions will impact some employees at several of our U.S. powertrain and stamping facilities that support those operations,\" Filosa said.",
      "Filosa says Stellantis acknowledges that \"the current environment creates uncertainty. Be assured that we are very engaged with all of our key stakeholders, including top government leaders, unions, suppliers and dealers in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, as we work to manage and adapt to these changes. We are focused on taking responsible actions that are in the best interests of our customers, our business partners and you, our employees \u2013 wherever you work.\"",
      "In response to the layoffs, UAW President Shawn Fain said, \"Stellantis continues to play games with workers' lives. As we've shown time and again, they've got the money, the capacity, the product, and the workforce to employ thousands more UAW members in Michigan, Indiana, and beyond. These layoffs are a completely unnecessary choice that the company is making. It's more of the same, and everything that's wrong with our broken trade system. Companies like Stellantis use workers as collateral damage to pay the price for management's poor decisions, and it's unacceptable.\"",

    "story": [
      "Inflation-weary Americans may soon find they're paying more for a host of products after President Trump announced two new types of tariffs on April 2, a day he termed \"Liberation Day\" because he believes the measures will erase trade imbalances between the U.S. and other nations.",
      "While Mr. Trump characterizes tariffs as paid by other nations, they are in fact paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart or Amazon. Because the tariffs create higher costs for those businesses, they typically pass on all or some of the tariffs to consumers through price hikes.",
      "The new tariffs introduced by Mr. Trump on Wednesday include a 10% universal tariff, as well as so-called reciprocal tariffs on more than 60 countries that are trade partners with the U.S. The tariffs will be additive, meaning that imports will face both the universal tariff of 10% plus the specific reciprocal import levies targeting each nation.",
      "During his announcement, Mr. Trump's said the tariffs will would eventually lower prices for Americans, an issue on which voters say they want him to focus. But economists are predicting instead that consumers and businesses will likely encounter higher inflation, with price hikes on everything from food imports like coffee and chocolate to iPhones and other electronics manufactured outside the U.S.",
      "\"For all of President Trump's talk of a new 'golden age,' this huge tax increase will inevitably result in higher prices for American families, lower growth and business investment, and diminished exports and manufacturing output as the country's factories face retaliation abroad and costlier inputs (roughly half of all imports) at home,\" said Scott Lincicome and Colin Grabow, trade experts at the Cato Institute, in an email.",
      "They added, \"With today's announcement, U.S. tariffs will approach levels not seen since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which incited a global trade war and deepened the Great Depression.\"",
      "The Trump administration said there are some exclusions to the tariffs, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals, although it added that these products might be subject to tariffs at a later time.",
      "Which products will become more expensive with tariffs?",
      "Because of the 10% universal tariff on imports, any imported good is likely to become more expensive in the coming weeks and months as American companies digest the import duties and adjust their prices in response.",
      "For instance, after Mr. Trump added tariffs to imported washing machines during his first term, the median price of an appliance jumped more than 11%, adding about $86 to the cost of a new unit,\u00a0according\u00a0to University of Chicago researchers.",
      "Electronics like iPhones and TVs",
      "Among the nations targeted by Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs are China, Taiwan and South Korea, who are top exporters of electronics to the U.S., from Apple iPhones to television sets.",
      "The Trump administration plans to hit China with a reciprocal tariff of 34%, which means that products manufactured there and imported into the U.S. could see higher prices soon after the levies go into effect on April 9.",
      "Almost all iPhones are still manufactured in China, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, although Apple has shifted some of its iPhone fabrication to India. However, the Trump administration will also be adding a 26% reciprocal tariff to Indian imports, it said on Wednesday.",
      "\"Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China and the question will be around exceptions/exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations/factories/plants in the U.S.,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in an April 2 research note.",
      "Automobiles",
      "In addition to Mr. Trump's previously announced 25% tariff on auto imports, which go into effect today, imported autos will also face the 10% universal tariffs. Some U.S.-made vehicles include parts imported from other countries, which will face new tariffs and increase the purchase price of those cars, experts said.",
      "Ultimately, American consumers could end up paying an additional $2,500 to $5,000 for the lowest-cost American cars, and up to $20,000 for some imported models, according to an April 2 estimate from Anderson Economic Group.",
      "Clothing and shoes",
      "The bulk of apparel and shoes sold in U.S. stores like Walmart and Target is manufactured outside the U.S., with China, Vietnam and Bangladesh among the biggest exporters.",

      "Wine and spirits",
      "Italian and French wines and Scottish whisky are also likely to rise in price, as European Union imports will face a reciprocal tariff of 20% while United Kingdom-made products will face a 10% import duty.",

      "Amoroso, whose company owns direct-to-consumer wine retailers, added, \"While it's better than 200%, a 20% tariff still compounds through the supply chain and could lead to a 40% or more cost increase for consumers.\"",

      "Chocolate is another major Latin American import, given that the U.S. climate is by and large unsuited to growing cocoa beans.

      "The president, who signed an executive order to impose the tariffs, insisted the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of are \"over.\" The reciprocal tariffs, Mr. Trump said, will amount to roughly half the tariff rate those countries impose on U.S. exports, or less. Countries that will see tariffs higher than 10% include the European Union, China and Israel.",
      "Senior administration officials said the 10% worldwide tariffs take effect April 5 at 12:01 a.m., and the higher reciprocal tariffs go into effect on April 9 at 12:01 a.m.",
      "\"In short, chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life,\" the president said in a White House Rose Garden announcement. \"And for these reasons, starting tomorrow, the United States will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations.\"",
      "\"For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating, and because we are being very kind, we're a kind people, very kind,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You're not so kind when you're ripped off\u2026 We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.\"",
      "As he spoke, the president proudly held up a chart showing the new tariff rates the U.S. will begin to impose on allies, foes and everyone in between,",
      "Countries that will see \"discounted reciprocal rates,\" according to a sheet handed out by the White House, include China at a rate of 34%, on top of the tariffs the U.S. already imposes on China; 20% on goods from the European Union; 32% on Taiwan; 25% on South Korea and 17% on Israel.",
      "Canada and Mexico are not subject to these tariffs for now, senior administration officials said, but tariffs the president has already imposed, citing fentanyl and migration issues, persist.",

      "\"It's our declaration of economic independence,\" the president said in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Trump labeled Wednesday \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "The president lamented that the U.S. imports phones and other electronics, as well as pharmaceuticals, saying that if there's a war, the U.S. would struggle. He said his moves Wednesday are also standing up for U.S. farmers and ranchers who have been \"brutalized\" by other countries, specifically blasting Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump said the Americans \"subsidize\" a lot of other countries, calling out the European Union, China, South Korea and Australia for their trade practices.",
      "\"They've taken so much of our wealth away from us,\" Mr. Trump said of other countries.",
      "The president said he expects complaints from \"globalists,\" \"outsourcers,\" \"special interests,\" and \"fake news\" in the days ahead, but insisted those groups have been wrong about trade before.",
      "\"In the first term, they said tariffs would crash the economy,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Instead, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.\"",
      "In the audience for the president's announcement were rank-and-file steelworkers and auto workers, House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as most of Mr. Trump's Cabinet, including Vice President JD Vance.",
      "What new tariffs did Trump announce today?",
      "The president says his plan will place a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on all countries, with reciprocal tariffs on many trading partners that have their own tariffs placed on the U.S. The 25% tariffs the president previously announced on foreign cars and foreign auto parts are set to go into effect at midnight.",
      "A White House official said the reciprocal tariffs are additive, meaning they will be imposed in addition to any previous tariffs already in place, unless a specific good is exempt under Section 232 of the Tariffs Act, which carries a flat 25% rate on certain things like steel and aluminum.",
      "Here are some of the tariff rates that Mr. Trump announced:",

      "Countries that will see only the baseline 10% tariff rates include: Guatemala, Honduras, Argentina, El Salvador, Ecuador, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Australia and the United Kingdom.",
      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday that tariffs are one tool to get companies to bring jobs back to the U.S.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and- and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here,\" Fain said. \"And, you know, invest in the American workers. The American working class people have been left behind for decades, and they're sick of it.\"",
      "What are tariffs, exactly?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S.\u00a0The most common type of tariffs are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value\"), which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of a product. The 25% auto tariffs are these types of tariffs.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, and \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold.",
      "What do financial experts say about tariffs?",
      "Economists and taxpayer advocacy groups have their doubts, and are warning tariffs could upset economic growth and will almost surely contribute to higher prices for American consumers. Some automakers have already announced higher car prices, after the president announced tariffs on foreign cars and parts.",
      "More than a dozen leaders at think tanks and taxpayer advocacy groups, including at the National Taxpayers Union, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, on Tuesday sent a joint letter to congressional leaders and the commerce and treasury secretaries, urging them to consider how tariffs on steel, lumber, energy, pharmaceutical and medical supplies and cars and car parts will increase prices.",
      "\"We encourage you to consider whether tariffs may, in many cases, undermine President Trump's broader long-term economic goals by increasing the cost of goods subject to tariffs,\" they wrote. \"We are especially concerned about tariffs on inputs needed by U.S. manufacturers that make it harder to compete with finished goods made abroad and tariffs that increase the price of necessities like food and housing.\"",
      "Alex Jacquez, who worked on the Biden White House National Economic Council, said that although it's hard to know the exact impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs without knowing all the details, CEOs are telling investors and shareholders they will be hiking prices.",
      "\"What the major retailers and companies who may be affected by tariffs are planning to do and they're planning out in public here is pass these costs along to consumers as much as they possibly can,\" Jacquez, now the chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "Colin Grabow, associate director at the libertarian Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, wrote in a USA Today op-ed that \"tariffs are a costly and inefficient tax usually borne by the importing country's customers.\"",
      "\"Americans may have voted for lower prices in November, but under the guise of tariff reciprocity, the Trump administration is set to deliver something very different,\" Grabow wrote.",
      "A reporter on Tuesday asked Leavitt if the president is thinking about seniors on fixed income who are stressed about the recent swings in the stock market, swings partly attributed to the president's tariff announcements. Stocks have struggled as Wall Street braces for the next round of tariffs.",
      "\"Well certainly, they are legitimate concerns and the president takes those concerns very seriously,\" Leavitt said. \"And he's addressing them every single day. And tomorrow's announcement is to protect future generations of the senior citizens you mentioned. It's for their kids and their grandkids, to ensure that there are jobs here in the United States of America for their children to live the American dream, just like they presumably did.\"",
      "And the president told NBC News he \"couldn't care less\" if his tariffs lead to automakers raising their prices.",
      "\"I couldn't care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars,\" he told NBC.",

      "A 10% universal import duty on all goods brought into the U.S.",
      "So-called reciprocal tariffs that will be applied to imports from 90 nations.",
      "Mr. Trump, who announced the tariffs in the White House's Rose Garden on Wednesday afternoon, said his plans reflect \"one of the most important days in American history; it's our declaration of economic independence.\" Even so, economists say the tariffs will boost prices on many products purchased by American consumers, at a time when inflation still remains elevated.",
      "An overview of Mr. Trump's new \"Liberation Day\" tariffs",
      "The first tariff will be a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S.",
      "The second tariff, reciprocal tariffs, will be applied to imports from 60 countries and are aimed at equalizing the trade imbalances between the U.S. and those nations. Mr. Trump said that reciprocal tariffs \"means they do it to us, and we do it to them.\"",
      "He added, \"It can't get any simpler than that.\"",
      "One example provided by Mr. Trump is that the U.S. charges a 2.5% tariff on automobile imports, while adding that the European Union charges a 10% tariff on American car exports to EU nations.",
      "\"Such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base,\" he added.",
      "What is a reciprocal tariff?",
      "At the moment, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges on German vehicle imports.",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would apply the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries place on American exports on a product-by-product basis. By charging countries only 50% of what they charge U.S. products, Mr. Trump said he is imposing \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump said that the reciprocal tariffs will also include calculations to cover non-monetary trade barriers, such as when nations devalue their currencies to help boost demand for their products from other nations.",
      "When do the tariffs go into effect?",
      "The baseline 10% tariff will go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5, while the reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9.",
      "Why is Trump imposing these new tariffs?",
      "During his announcement, Mr. Trump said the goal was to revitalize the industrial and manufacturing base of the U.S., promising that doing so will \"make America wealthy again.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the tariffs will help convince foreign businesses to relocate their factories to the U.S. The president also promised that the tariffs would lead to lower prices for Americans, although most economists are projecting that Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to boost inflation and lead to higher costs for the typical U.S. household.",
      "For instance, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index \u2014 an inflation measure closely tracked by the Federal Reserve \u2014 could rise 0.5 percentage points to 3.5% by year end, according to a March 30 Goldman Sachs report. The core PCE rose 2.8% in February on an annual basis, reflecting a slight increase from the prior month.",
      "That estimate is based on Mr. Trump's previously announced tariffs, including his 25% import duty on\u00a0auto imports, as well as Goldman's expectation for reciprocal tariffs that would average about 15%.",

      "A core element of the protectionist trade policies President Trump\u00a0announced on Wednesday \u2014 a planned import tax blitz he has referred to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 are so-called reciprocal tariffs.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his Wednesday news conference, touting such levies as a way to boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products.",
      "But some economists say that tit-for-tat tariffs with key trading partners could be hard to structure, while also roiling global commerce and driving up costs\u00a0for U.S. consumers and businesses. Here's what to know about reciprocal tariffs.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would impose the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports on a product-by-product basis. For example, if a country imposed a 6% levy on American-made shoes, Mr. Trump would tax that nation's footwear at the same rate.",
      "Currently, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges for German vehicle imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal means that if a country has higher tariffs than we do on certain products, we would raise it to that level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That would be administratively complex given the tens of thousands of codes that determine the tariff rates on a variety of products.",
      "\"Setting up reciprocal tariffs across every product category with every trade partner would be completely infeasible with our administrative capacity,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Other experts suggest the goal is less about driving companies to shift their production to the U.S. or generating federal revenue than about pressuring other nations to strike trade deals that the Trump administration is comfortable with.",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs the same as country-based tariffs?",
      "Rather than impose perfectly reciprocal tariffs, the White House announced country-specific tariff rates calibrated to the their trade imbalance with the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said his administration will impose reciprocal tariffs at roughly half the rate of duties charged by other nations. The White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers.",
      "For example, the U.S. will match China's 67% rate with a 34% tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "\"They will probably come up with a blended rate that is not reciprocal by product, but is reciprocal by saying their tariffs are 10% higher than ours on average, so we'll be imposing 10% tariff across-the-board on all goods,\" said Jacquez, who formerly worked as an economic policy analyst in the Biden administration.",
      "That approach could result in the U.S. taxing other nations' products at vastly different rate than they do ours.",
      "\"It will hit a lot of products very differently in a proximate way, because it would be balanced by country but not by import or export,\" Jacquez said. \"That is where complications will arise, and you could see a scenario in which countries retaliate against us.\"",
      "Who are the \"Dirty 15\"?",
      "Trump administration officials have singled out a group of nations they dubbed the \"Dirty 15,\"\u00a0 a reference to the 15% of countries expected to be hit hardest by the new reciprocal tariffs given their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Those nations account for \"a huge amount of our trading volume,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 18, without naming the trade partners. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also told Fox News that the White House is targeting 10 to 15 nations with the biggest trade surplus with the U.S. Like Bessent, he also refrained from naming those nations.",
      "Simon MacAdam, deputy chief global economist with Capital Economics, thinks likely targets include leading U.S. trading partners such as China, the European Union and Vietnam.

      "More certain is that reciprocal tariffs would mean added costs for U.S. businesses, experts say, which in turn would likely raise consumer prices\u00a0as companies look to protect their profit margins.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on a business bringing a product into the country. When they receive it at a port of entry, whether it be an airport or seaport, they have to pay the duty to have it admitted into the country,\" Chris Barrett, a professor at Cornell SC Johnson School of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've just added a cost on for the business, and those costs get passed on, at least to some degree, to consumers.\"",
      "How much prices could rise remains unclear. Meanwhile, prices could fall if Mr. Trump later lowers or removes reciprocal tariffs following trade negotiations.",

    "summary": "Experts estimate far lower figures in tariffs revenue, warning that President Trump's tariffs could drive up prices for American consumers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has argued that some of the tariffs he's imposing this week could help the government raise over $1 trillion in the next year or so, helping to reduce the national debt and even potentially offset some income taxes.",
      "But economists are skeptical that these tariffs can bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods when prices go up.",
      "Tariffs are often charged as a percentage of the price that importers pay foreign sellers. They aren't paid by foreign nations, but by U.S. companies who often pass the cost to American consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"You're going to see billions of dollars, even trillions of dollars coming into our country very soon in the form of tariffs,\" the president said last week.",
      "While economic analyses indicate Mr. Trump's tariffs could meaningfully increase annual tariff revenue, the president's trillion-dollar estimates are significantly higher than those provided by think tanks and even some of his own officials.",
      "How much Trump's new auto tariffs could generate",
      "In a recent news conference, White House staff secretary Will Sharf estimated that Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could raise \"roughly $100 billion in new revenue.\" At the same news conference, Mr. Trump claimed moments later \"anywhere from $600 billion to $1 trillion will be taken in over the relatively short-term period, meaning a year from now.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request to clarify the source of the discrepancy.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan think tank, has estimated that the auto tariffs could raise roughly $600 billion to $650 billion over a period of 10 years \u2014 not in a single year, as Mr. Trump suggested.",
      "\"On an annual basis on average that's $60 to 65 billion. We're not even close to trillions,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab also found that motor vehicle prices could rise by 13.5% on average for Americans, or an additional cost of $6,400 for an average new car.",
      "How much Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China could generate",
      "The same researchers found Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, which are slated to go into effect this week, along with the additional 20% tax on Chinese imports that the president has already put in place, could generate roughly $150 billion annually, or up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years. They also found the average household could lose $1,600 to $2,000 each year in inflation-adjusted disposable income as a result of higher prices.",
      "Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs previously made higher estimates that Trump's increased tariffs on these countries could generate roughly $300 billion in new income per year.",
      "Either would be a meaningful increase over the $88 billion in customs duties collected at ports of entry in 2024.",
      "However, economists argue there's a ceiling to tariff revenue that remains below $1 trillion per year.",
      "The U.S. imported about $3.3 trillion in foreign goods last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Peterson Institute of International Economics estimated that even if Mr. Trump were to apply a 50% tariff to foreign imports from every country \u2014 which exceeds his stated plans \u2014 it would generate at most about $780 billion annually.",
      "\"If you make something 50% more expensive, you don't expect people to buy the same amount,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",
      "Could tariff revenue replace income taxes?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of using his tariff agenda to offset or even replace income taxes.",
      "\"Under the American first economic model, as tariffs on other countries go up, taxes on American workers and businesses will come down,\" Trump said in a speech to the House GOP in January.",
      "Income taxes generate over $2 trillion per year, according to the Department of the Treasury. Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all imports, the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute.",
      "\"The problem is it can't raise anywhere near the amount of revenue you'd need to scuttle the income tax. And that's the really, I think, ironclad point,\" said Scott Lincicome, a vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian think tank.",
      "Historians on U.S. trade note that tariffs have not been viewed as a primary way to raise revenue since income taxes were introduced in 1913.",
      "In 2024, tariff collections on imports represented just 1.7% of the more than $4.9 trillion in total federal revenue. And according to the Congressional Research Service, tariffs have not accounted for much more than 2% of federal revenue in the last 70 years.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:06:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's what to know about tariffs ahead of President Trump's plans to announce new import duties on April 2.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to impose a round of fresh tariffs on April 2, a day President Trump has dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" The announcement is viewed by economists as the culmination of his \"America First Trade Policy,\" an\u00a0executive order he signed on his first day in office aimed at revitalizing U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to his April 2 tariff announcement as \"the big one,\" suggesting that the plans may be more far reaching than the import levies he's already unleashed on goods from other nations, such as his March 26 declaration of 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S.",
      "\"For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!\" Trump said about his April 2 plans in a post\u00a0earlier this month on Truth Social.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump will announce his administration's plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, at an event in the White House Rose Garden, the White House said. He deems the levies necessary to erase trade imbalances with nations that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from America. But the addition of broad-based tariffs to a host of imports is likely to heat up a global trade war that could, at least in the short term, boost prices for U.S. consumers and juice inflation.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and research shows that that majority gets passed along to consumers,\" Colin Grabow, associate director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Ultimately, the Trump administration's goal is to increase prices on imports to the point where it's economically favorable for companies to relocate their manufacturing to the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"If prices don't go up, it doesn't deter imports, and therefore there is no reason to set up shop in the U.S.,\" Grabow explained. \"Part of the logic is premised on prices going up, otherwise they are not going to accomplish their goal.\"",
      "Economists say that Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including the uncertainty surrounding it, could drag down U.S. GDP by depressing financial markets and consumer sentiment.",
      "\"The main channel from trade policy uncertainty to GDP is via business investment. Under higher trade policy uncertainty, future revenue streams of an investment become more uncertain, raising the option value of delaying investment decisions until the situation is clearer,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "What tariffs will Trump announce April 2?",
      "Mr. Trump teased his April 2 announcement last week when he announced his new 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts. \"That's Liberation Day, that's gonna be on the 2nd, and that's gonna be reciprocal, and I think people will be impressed,\" the president said.",
      "Reciprocal tariffs are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations, as well as compensate for other trade barriers, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan public policy think tank. According to a White House memo from Feb. 13, the U.S. faces additional trade barriers aside from tariffs such as regulatory requirements that can make it more difficult for American exports to reach other nations.",
      "While the size and scope of the reciprocal tariffs that Mr. Trump plans to announce are still unknown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously said the administration's reciprocal tariffs would target countries with the biggest trade surpluses, as well as those which have imposed the highest tariffs plus non-tariff trade barriers on U.S. goods.",
      "Multiple nations run large annual trade surpluses with the U.S., including Germany, Ireland and Italy in the European Union, as well as Vietnam, Japan and Taiwan. The U.S. also has a large trade deficit with China, although Mr. Trump has already imposed new tariffs on that nation.",
      "\"It'll be in many cases less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades ... I think we're trying to keep it somewhat conservative,\" Mr. Trump said on March 26.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he'll introduce a reciprocal tariff policy on \"all countries,\" which he said would be \"very lenient.\"",
      "On Sunday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that there are 15 countries \"that we have massive, massive trade deficits with,\" but that Mr. Trump will ultimately decided how many countries will be subject to new tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Hassett also promoted tariffs as an effective tool for reshoring manufacturing to the U.S., saying \"it's going to be a boom,\" referring to auto manufacturing in particular.",
      "Meanwhile, additional tariffs are also slated to go into effect on April 2, with Mr. Trump's one-month delay on 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports set to expire that day. The 25% auto tariff announced by the president on March 26 is also scheduled to take effect on April 2.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Reciprocal tariffs enacted by the U.S. would match foreign nations' levies and other trade policies on American goods.",
      "A reciprocal tariff policy would include calculating a country-specific number that the Trump administration deems representative of all trade barriers. But import restrictions other than tariffs, such as regulatory requirements, could be hard to quantify, economists say.",
      "\"There are a lot of intangibles, like testing regulations for different products in countries, or perceived openness to business with American companies,\" Simon Macadam, deputy chief global economist at Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These are things you can't easily put a number on.\"",
      "Because of this complexity, some experts expect Trump's reciprocal tariffs could be more limited in scope, and might not be truly \"reciprocal\" because they may not exactly match other countries' levies.",
      "\"We shouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff is rolled back, or not as sweeping as maybe originally talked about, because logistically, from a practical perspective, running the calculations and coming up with a number is extremely time consuming,\" Grabow of the Cato Institute said.",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the first Trump administration, agreed that a truly reciprocal tariff policy would be \"very complicated to get to work.\"",
      "\"If you were literally going to be reciprocal, you would put the same tariff on a product that comes into the U.S. as that country charges on products from the U.S.,\" he said. \"But the problem is you'd be charging a different tariff on the same item from different countries.\"",
      "That would create loopholes for exporters to ship products through lower-tariffed countries to the U.S., Ross added. \"It would make it easy for people to game the system,\" he said.",
      "What does Trump want to achieve?",
      "Through his \"Fair and Reciprocal Plan\" on trade, Mr. Trump is aiming to bring about three outcomes: Boost U.S. manufacturing jobs; close the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit; and gain leverage over U.S. trade partners.",
      "But experts say that trade barriers such as tariffs may not be enough to revitalize U.S. manufacturing jobs, which have fallen sharply over the last few decades. Fewer than 13 million people are employed in manufacturing today, down from a peak of 19.6 million in 1979,\u00a0according to federal data.",
      "\"To a large extent, and particularly in low- and medium-tech industries, the economics of production will not be significantly altered by a 10-20% tariff,\" Macadam said. \"When labor costs in hubs like Mexico are one-fifth of what they are in the U.S., in order to induce companies to seriously relocate a lot of production back to the U.S. a 20% tariff isn't going to cut it.\"",
      "There's also the unknown of how long any new tariffs announced by Mr. Trump will remain in place. Such uncertainty could deter American or foreign businesses from investing heavily in re-shoring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"Even if for some companies it gets to the point where it seems to make financial sense to move back to the U.S., there's the question of, 'Are these tariffs actually going to last a long time?'\" Macadam said. \"If you think the tariff is going to be there forever, then yeah, absolutely relocate. But if it's reversed or rates are lowered, then it would have been silly to relocate.\"",
      "What will tariffs mean for consumers?",
      "Consumers typically pay the price for tariffs, as companies have said they plan on passing off much of the costs to their customers.",
      "As a result, a round of fresh tariffs could boost inflation, economists say. According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, if the effective tariff rate on imports into the U.S. rises from their 2024 level of 2.5% to 10% in April, which is what Oxford Economics expects, prices in aggregate would rise by half a percentage point.",
      "\"Inflation was on trend to fall \u2014 now we expect it to rise,\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 10:07:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Tesla is seeing softer demand for its electric vehicles amid protests over Elon Musk's government role at DOGE.",
    "story": [
      "Tesla said its delivery of vehicles in the first three months of 2025 fell nearly 13% as demand for the automaker's electric cars continued to weaken, with deliveries falling well short of analysts' expectations.",
      "The company said on Wednesday that it shipped 336,681 vehicles in the first quarter, down from the 386,810 in the year ago period. The latest deliveries fell short of expectations that the EV maker had likely shipped about 350,000 vehicles during the period, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in an April 2 research note.",
      "The decline comes amid protests held at Tesla dealerships both in the U.S. and Europe over CEO Elon Musk's work with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Under Musk's leadership, DOGE has pushed the Trump administration to shutter\u00a0federal agencies, slashing tens of thousands of jobs, as he seeks to cut government spending.",
      "\"[T]his delivery number was a disaster for the bulls with continuous negativity around the TSLA brand,\" Ives said in his note. \"We are not going to look at these numbers with rose-colored glasses ... they were a disaster on every metric.\"",
      "Ives, who said earlier said he had expected Tesla to report it had delivered as many as 360,000 vehicles during the first quarter, added that he believes Musk \"needs to stop this political firestorm and balance being CEO of Tesla with DOGE.\"",
      "Shares of Tesla slumped $12.77, or 4.8%, to $255.69 in early trading. The stock has plunged about 44% since hitting a high of $479 per share in December, when the stock soared on expectations that Musk's advisory role with the Trump administration would help the business through lower regulations and other benefits.",
      "Tesla's problems extend beyond the backlash over Musk's work with DOGE, however. The company's aging lineup is failing to attract buyers, although the automaker is expected to roll out a new lower-cost model later this year.",
      "In the meantime, some EV buyers are choosing to buy vehicles from rival automakers, with competitors from BMW to Toyota now offering a range of electric, hybrid or plug-in hybrid options. To some extent, Tesla's woes predate Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, with the company's revenue slipping 1%\u00a0last year, partly due to sluggish sales in the first six months of 2024.",
      "Still, the slump in 2025's first-quarter deliveries points to the backlash that some consumers are voicing over Musk's role in the Trump administration, Ives noted, adding that the more political the billionaire becomes, \"the more the brand suffers.\"",
      "\"Musk needs to get his act together or else unfortunately darker times are ahead for Tesla,\" Ives said in his April 2 research note.",

    "story": [
      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations will face only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries will be charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports will face the baseline rate of 10%, while China will face a 34% tariff.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his\u00a0Wednesday remarks.",
      "Asian nations will face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic. On top of China's 34% reciprocal tariff, imports from that nation will also face previously announced 20% tariffs, bringing that nation's total rate to more than 60%, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "The reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries likely to retaliate against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "For now, other countries are taking a more measured approach in their response. European Union trade chief Maros Sefcovic is scheduled to meet with U.S. officials on Friday after Mr. Trump hit the 27-nation bloc with a 20% tariff.",

      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams will skip the Democratic primary and run for reelection as an independent, he announced Thursday.",
      "The news came a day after\u00a0his federal corruption case was dismissed\u00a0by a judge.",
      "Adams confirmed his 2025 campaign in a six-minute video\u00a0posted on social media.",
      "\"Although I am still a Democrat, I am announcing that I will forgo the Democratic primary for mayor and appeal directly to all New Yorkers as an independent candidate in the general election,\" Adams said, adding, \"There isn't a liberal or conservative way to fix New York, but there is a right way and a wrong way and true leaders just know the right path [if] they have the guts to take it.\"",
      "Adams will bypass the crowded Democratic primary, which includes former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.",
      "There is precedent to win as an independent",
      "Mayors have run and won as independents in New York City. In 1965, John Lindsay got reelected as an independent after losing the Republican primary, and Michael Bloomberg won a third term as an independent after running as both a Republican and a Democrat.",
      "Adams said he knows he has work to do to regain the public's trust.",
      "\"I know that the accusations leveled against me may have shaken your confidence in me, and that you may rightly have questions about my conduct. And let me be clear: Although the charges against me were false, I trusted people I should not have, and I regret that, but the issues I face are nothing compared to yours -- rising costs, public safety concerns, deep concerns about the future,\" Adams said.",
      "\"This is a complete circus\"",
      "A poll released last week showed Adams was trailing Cuomo, state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and City Comptroller Brad Lander among Democratic primary voters. It gave him a slight edge over former Comptroller Scott Stringer, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, state Sen. Jessica Ramos, former Assemblyman Michael Blake and activist Whitney Tilson.",
      "Adams' decision perplexed some of the candidates in the Democratic primary.",
      "\"If you're reading the news this morning, you're watching television [and] you're scratching your head and saying, 'What the hell is going on,' you are not alone. I'm asking myself the same question. This is a complete circus,\" Myrie said.",
      "\"He's going to lose whatever election he runs in. If he runs in the Democratic primary, he'd lose there. If he runs in the general election, he'd lose there. He can't face accountability from the New Yorkers that he sold out,\" Lander said.",
      "\"The people voted for this man as a Democrat and he made it very clear he doesn't care about us anymore, and so, it's incredibly disappointing, but it's not surprising,\" Blake added.",
      "\"Eric Adams hasn't been a Democrat for a very long time,\" Stringer said.",
      "\"It's ironic to hear the mayor describe himself as an independent when his record has shown him anything but that,\" Mamdani said.",
      "Cuomo took the high road.",
      "\"They call it democracy. Mayor Adams can run as an independent if he chooses. He can run in the Democratic primary if he chooses. That's up to Mayor Adams,\" Cuomo said.",
      "Perhaps the happiest about the mayor's switch is Republican frontrunner Curtis Sliwa.",
      "\"There's no doubt that Eric Adams being an independent helps me,\" he said.",
      "When asked Thursday, the mayor brushed that theory off.",
      "\"He had no chance to win the Democratic primary\"",
      "Political experts say Adams made a smart choice because he avoids the slings and arrows that were sure to come his way in the Democratic primary and can use the power of incumbency to make his case directly to the people.",
      "\"It's a tough needle to thread. It is not going to be easy, but you have campaigns in threes. He has a record to run on. He now has a future to plan. He gets to pick the issues he wants to run on and make it the third one. It's not going to be easy, but he had no chance to win the Democratic primary,\" political consultant O'Brien Murray said.",
      "With Adams out of the primary, Murray says Cuomo is expected to become the focus of attacks by the other candidates. If Cuomo navigates that storm successfully, it will set up a possible showdown between him and Adams in November's general election.",
      "Though Adams' poll numbers are low, Murray said running as an independent gives the mayor a better shot at keeping his job.",
      "\"The Democratic primary is about 80 days away, early voting and so forth. You have 80 days to remake your image and get the message out there after distractions of the court case. Now, you've got over 200 days to go between now and November. You also have to get away from the clutter of a very crowded field in a Democratic primary,\" Murray said.",
      "Adams supporters say he will bounce back",
      "The mayor certainly has his supporters.",
      "\"Regardless of what party he's affiliated with, he's got a very good chance of coming ahead,\" said Ishmael Sanchez of the Bronx.",
      "\"There's a lot of damage that has been done. It's a shame because he's the second African-American mayor and he was set up, but he will bounce back,\" Bishop Erick Salgado said.",
      "The mayor later said in an interview on Fox that he has to rebuild trust among a voter base that may be \"fatigued\" by the political process.",
      "\"We're all fatigued. We're fatigued about affordability in our city. We're fatigued about the concerns of raising healthy children. We're all fatigued with that fatigue. We're going to turn it into the fighting spirit of New York,\" Adams said.",
      "Judge dismisses Adams' federal corruption case",
      "Judge Dale Ho on Wednesday agreed to the\u00a0U.S. Department of Justice's request to drop charges\u00a0against Adams. The judge dismissed the case with prejudice, which means the charges cannot be brought again at a later time.",
      "\"The case against Eric Adams should have never been brought in the first place\u2014and finally today that case is gone forever. From Day 1, the mayor has maintained his innocence and now justice for Eric Adams and New Yorkers has prevailed,\"\u00a0Adams' attorney Alex Spiro said.",
      "Adams was charged in 2024 with abusing his power for almost a decade. A\u00a057-page indictment\u00a0accused him of receiving undisclosed gifts -- including luxury travel -- worth more than $100,000 in return for political favors. He allegedly solicited illegal campaign donations from wealthy foreigners and corporations, including a Turkish government official.",
      "In arguing for the case to be dismissed, DOJ prosecutors said it would have interfered with Adams' 2025 mayoral campaign and hinder his ability to cooperate with the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. The initial request to drop the charges noted it was not based on \"the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based.\"",

    "story": [
      "Amazon has told the White House it is interested in buying TikTok ahead of a key deadline by which its parent company, China-based ByteDance, must either sell the popular social media app or face a ban in the U.S., CBS News has learned, according to two people familiar with discussions.",
      "Amazon has submitted a bid for the app, the\u00a0New York Times reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter. Another plan under consideration is for a new entity backed by U.S. companies like BlackRock and Oracle to lease TikTok's algorithm from ByteDance, according to a source familiar with the situation.",
      "Both Amazon and TikTok declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the New York Times reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Air Force One over the weekend, Mr. Trump addressed the matter of TikTok's sale, saying, \"We have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.\"",
      "He added that he'd \"like to see TikTok remain alive.\"",
      "The U.S. government has said TikTok poses a threat to national security because its vast trove of customer data, including browsing patterns, locations and biometric information, could end up in the hands of the Chinese authorities.",
      "Ahead of the initial divestiture deadline, ByteDance earlier this year briefly shut down TikTok in the U.S. Mr. Trump quickly paused the ban and the service was restored.",
      "The ban does not target TikTok's U.S. users. But the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, signed into law in 2024 under former President Biden, would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores and web-hosting services to distribute or service TikTok.",

    "summary": "ICE agents took Turkish Ph.D. student Rumeysa Ozturk into custody near Tufts, revoked her visa and moved her to a detention center in Louisiana last week.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Boston considered Thursday a case involving a Tufts University Ph.D. student taken into custody in Massachusetts and moved by Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities to Louisiana last week.",
      "The government claimed in a filing Tuesday that Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student and Fulbright Scholar, had already been removed from Massachusetts before a judge issued an order for her to stay in the state, which prosecutors said strips the district court in Massachusetts of jurisdiction to hear the case.",
      "The Justice Department said in its filing that Ozturk had already been transferred to an ICE detention center in Basile, Louisiana.",
      "Attorneys for Ozturk had filed a habeas petition to block her removal from Massachusetts, as well as from the United States, and U.S. District Judge Denise Casper issued a new order several days after Ozturk was detained barring her removal from the U.S. to allow her to resolve the jurisdictional questions.",
      "Casper probed Ozturk's lawyers and the Justice Department about whether the habeas petition was filed in the appropriate venue, the court in Massachusetts, or whether the case should be transferred to Louisiana, where Ozturk is now being held. The student's lawyers are seeking an order that requires immigration officials to return Ozturk to Massachusetts and immediately release her while proceedings continue.",
      "She did not issue a decision on whether Ozturk's case should be moved, instead saying she was \"inclined to wrestle\" with the question.",
      "An attorney for the student argued that her whereabouts remained unknown to her lawyers in the hours after her arrest, and said not even the government's lawyers knew where she was, a situation Ozturk's attorney said it \"quite unusual.\"",
      "She accused immigration officials of ignoring the initial order preventing Ozturk's immediate removal out of Massachusetts and for failing to disclose her location to her lawyers.",
      "\"Here, we have a situation where it's the government that is forum shopping, that is whisking away a petitioner to its forum of choice and doing everything in its power to ensure that a habeas petition cannot be filed,\" the lawyer said.",
      "An acting Homeland Security Department official filed a sworn statement saying Ozturk was arrested on March 25 in Somerville, Massachusetts, where Tufts is located, and then moved to Lebanon, New Hampshire, then to St. Albans, Vermont, overnight. She was again moved at 4 a.m. on March 26 to Burlington, Vermont, before she was finally transferred to the ICE detention center in Basile. The court's order blocking her removal from Massachusetts was issued while Ozturk was in Vermont, and Ozturk's lawyers said her case could also be transferred there.",
      "A Justice Department lawyer sought to draw a distinction between Ozturk's lawyers not knowing where their client was, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement not being forthcoming about her location. He asked the court to dismiss Ozturk's petition outright or remove the case to Louisiana.",
      "\"ICE was still in the process of transferring her through Vermont at the time that the petition was filed,\" he said.",
      "The Justice Department said the decision to move Ozturk to Louisiana was made before she was taken into custody because there is no detention center in Massachusetts for a female detainee.",
      "Ozturk, who's in the U.S. on a student visa, was detained on her way to a Ramadan Iftar dinner on March 25. Surveillance footage showed six plainclothes ICE agents who appeared to be wearing masks stopping Ozturk on the street and taking her into custody.",
      "She's one of several students at American universities whose visas were revoked after they expressed support for Palestinians during the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Ozturk's attorneys argue her detention violates her constitutional rights to free speech and due process, and have asked for her immediate return to Massachusetts and for her to be freed from government custody.",
      "On Wednesday, Tufts president Sunil Kumar submitted a declaration defending Ozturk and supporting her motion regarding her release and return to Massachusetts. Kumar said the university \"has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention.\"",
      "He said that on March 26, the university received a notice stating that Ozturk was a \"'non-immigrant status violator'\" and citing the Immigration and Naturalization Act, it said \"the United States believed that her presence in the country would result in 'potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.'\"",
      "Ozturk was one of four students at Tufts University who co-authored an op-ed in the Tufts Daily college paper in March 2024 urging the university to \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide\" and \"divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.\" There is no mention of Hamas in the article. Kumar said the op-ed was consistent with the university's free speech policies and there were \"opinions that were shared just as strongly\" on other sides of the issue.",
      "\"The University has no further information suggesting that she has acted in a manner that would constitute a violation of the University's understanding of the Immigration and Naturalization Act,\" Kumar wrote. He asked that Ozturk \"receive the due process rights to which she is entitled,\" so she can return to Tufts to finish her studies and her degree.",
      "At the time of Ozturk's detention, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said Ozturk \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas,\" but did not provide details about her alleged activities. The government's filing Tuesday also contained no details about alleged ties to Hamas.",
      "The Justice Department's argument regarding jurisdiction \u2014 that the habeas petition arguments should be held where the person is being detained \u2014 has been used by the government in other court cases involving the Trump administration's deportation efforts, including in the case of former Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil and in the cases of five Venezuelan men who sued to block their deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has touted the administration's cancellation of more than 300 student visas so far and said that student visas are meant to encourage studying and getting degrees, \"not to become a social activist\" and \"tear up our university campuses.\"",

    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk will continue to be a \"friend and an adviser\" to President Trump after he formally leaves government, Vice President JD Vance said Thursday on Fox News.",
      "On Air Force One on Thursday, Mr. Trump told reporters Musk can stay \"as long as he'd like.\" Asked if he would potentially appoint Musk to another post, Mr. Trump said he would, but added that Musk has a \"number of companies to run.\" Mr. Trump said there's a point when \"Elon's gotta have to leave.\" Asked when that might be, the president said he thinks a \"few months.\"",
      "The White House says Musk isn't officially in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), although he has been heavily involved and the president and Vance speak of Musk and DOGE in tandem. By law, Musk, designated a special government employee, may only formally work for the government for 130 days, or a little over four months. That time would run out in late May or early June. Vance said Musk was told that the administration needed him to cut government and make it more efficient, a task Musk was told would take about six months.",
      "\"And that's what Elon signed up for,\" Vance said in an interview with Fox News' Lawrence Jones. \"But of course, he's going to continue to be an adviser. And by the way, the work of DOGE is not even close to done. The work of Elon is not even close to done.\"",
      "Vance touted the work Vance and DOGE have done, including unearthing grants the White House deems wasteful or fraudulent.",
      "\"And yeah, that work's gonna continue after Elon leaves, but fundamentally, Elon is going to remain a friend and an adviser of both me and the president, and he's done a lot of good things,\" Vance said. \"People don't realize how vast and uncontrolled the bureaucracy was. We've started to chip away at it but there's a lot of work to do. It's not going to happen all in six months, it's going to take a long and committed effort.\"",
      "Vance's comments come after Politico reported that the president has told his inner circle and members of his Cabinet that Musk still be stepping back in the coming weeks form his current role, a story Vance and Musk called \"fake news.\"",
      "As a special government employee, Musk's financial disclosure report is not public, and he is exempt from some ethics and conflict-of-interest rules that apply to permanent government employees. It's not clear what the White House would do if Musk, whom the White House says it not being paid, remains longer than 130 days.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Backlash to President Trump's tariffs cropped up throughout Capitol Hill on Thursday, as Democrats, and some Republicans, expressed concern about the sweeping levies on foreign imports \u2014 while putting forward a handful of possible methods to counter them.",
      "On Wednesday, the president announced a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of countries that charge higher taxes on American exports. And after what Mr. Trump described as \"Liberation Day,\" investors appeared spooked, with members of Congress unclear on the path forward.",
      "The response from some lawmakers was swift. Sens. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat and Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, introduced bipartisan legislation Thursday aimed at reasserting Congress' role over trade policy. The measure, known as the Trade Review Act of 2025, would require the president to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or raising tariffs. The president would have to include an explanation and analysis of the potential impact, while lawmakers would have the ability to end the levy with a joint resolution.",
      "Grassley said in a statement that Congress has for too long \"delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,\" while Cantwell argued that the same check and balance that prevents the president from unilaterally declaring war should exist \"as it relates to protecting our commerce activities.\"",
      "\"Congress in the War Powers Act decided to reclaim its authority because they thought a president had overreached,\" Cantwell said on the Senate floor. \"Sen. Grassley and I are trying to do the same thing today by introducing the Trade Review Act of 2025.\"",
      "Meanwhile in the House, Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat who serves as the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Wednesday in response to the new tariffs that he plans to introduce a resolution to force a vote on \"ending the made up national emergency Trump is using to justify these taxes,\" effectively blocking them.",
      "\"Republicans can't keep ducking this \u2014 it's time they show whether they support the economic pain Trump is inflicting on their constituents,\" Meeks said in a post on X.",
      "The move would force a vote on the House floor within 15 days. And as the GOP wrestles with how to respond to the tariffs, a Democratic committee aide told CBS News they're looking to make the effort to pass Meeks' resolution a bipartisan one. But the resolution would ultimately require the president's signature or a veto-proof majority, making it a gambit unlikely to succeed.",
      "The efforts come after the Senate approved a resolution Wednesday aimed at blocking the president's Canada tariffs, as a handful of Republicans bucked their party leader to support the measure. The bill would have to be approved by the House, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged Speaker Mike Johnson to call the House back into session to take up the measure on Thursday, saying, \"Donald Trump is using tariffs in the dumbest way imaginable.\"",
      "But after House Republicans last month included in a\u00a0bill to keep the government funded\u00a0a provision that widely blocks members from forcing a vote on the Canada and Mexico tariffs amid a similar push by Meeks, it appears unlikely that the resolution would receive a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "Whether any of the moves can make it through both chambers and have an impact on the tariffs or trade situation more broadly remains to be seen. The legislative efforts to counter the tariffs come as congressional Republicans have appeared to struggle with how to respond, though few have appeared willing to strongly rebuke the move so far.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Thursday that he's concerned about the markets following the tariffs announcement. Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who was among the four Republicans who voted with Democrats to block the tariffs on Wednesday, told reporters, \"There is more pro-trade sentiment in the Republican caucus than was evidenced by the vote yesterday,\" adding that he expects after the market response Thursday, \"A lot of people are going to be reconsidering the wisdom of this.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Thursday morning that he was waiting to see how things shake out, noting that the market response was \"not unexpected.\"",
      "\"It's a big policy change, bold policy change, and I think it's going to take some time to determine what the ultimate impacts are going to be,\" Thune said. \"Right now, we're all kind of waiting and seeing and seeing how the administration reacts and what the ultimate permanent policy might look like.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to be U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., is touting his recent legal work for U.S. Capitol riot defendants in the questionnaire he submitted to the senators ahead of a confirmation vote.",
      "Trump has named Ed Martin to the unique U.S. attorney post, which oversaw the historic prosecutions of more than 1,500 defendants accused of storming the U.S. Capitol \u2013\u00a0 the largest federal criminal prosecution in U.S. history. Even before his confirmation vote, Martin's nomination and his reframing of the U.S. Capitol riot has upended an office that is among the largest and most powerful of all federal prosecutor offices in the nation.",
      "Martin has been serving as the District's top prosecutor in an acting capacity since Inauguration Day. He has said he shares President Trump's view of the Capitol attack as a \"day of love,\" and he has already fired some of the prosecutors who handled Jan. 6 cases.",
      "In his 27-page submission to the Senate on behalf of his nomination, a copy of which was obtained by CBS News, Martin highlights his litigation experience by pointing to two Jan. 6 cases in which he served as defense lawyer.",
      "Martin refers to the U.S. Capitol siege as \"the events of January 6, 2021 at the United States Capitol.\"",
      "He flags his work as \"instrumental\" in the defense of alleged Missouri Proud Boys member William Chrestman, who was convicted for confronting police, brandishing an ax and yelling vulgar threats at officers. Chrestman was sentenced to 55 months incarceration. Those convicted of crimes related to Jan. 6 were later pardoned by President Trump.",
      "Martin also wrote that he handled the case of Jan. 6 rioter Joseph Padilla.",
      "\"Mr. Padilla was alleged to have had a physical confrontation with police officers and forced his way into the Tunnel at the Capitol,\" he wrote, adding that he provided legal counsel to Padilla, who was sentenced to more than six years in prison.",
      "The Justice Department's allegations against Padilla in the criminal case were more specific. Prosecutors said in court documents that Padilla \"repeatedly pushed against the bike racks on the Lower West Terrace, forced his way into the Tunnel, and threw a flag pole into the Tunnel, striking an officer in the helmet.\" Padilla was later pardoned by Mr. Trump.",
      "The Justice Department ordered Martin to fire prosecutors involved in the Jan. 6 cases days after he took over as interim leader of the office, according to a memo reviewed by CBS News in January.",
      "He had been a \"Stop the Steal\" advocate and denied that Joe Biden won the presidency in 2020.",
      "Martin's questionnaire to the Senate said he has no experience in court cases that were \"tried to verdict, judgment or final decision (rather than settled)\" as sole or chief counsel.",
      "Although the Senate Judiciary Committee does not typically require U.S. attorney nominees to testify in a confirmation hearing, Senate Democrats have demanded that Martin do so.",
      "Ranking member Sen. Dick Durbin said in a statement that Martin merits the \"heightened scrutiny\" of a hearing because of his \"attacks on federal prosecutors\" and association with \"individuals who pose a threat to our nation.\" Durbin also pointed out Martin's association with alleged Nazi sympathizer Timothy Hale, who was convicted for his role in the assault on the Capitol. Durbin noted that Martin presented Hale with an award for being an \"extraordinary man, an extraordinary leader.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff placed an indefinite hold on Martin's nomination earlier this week, accusing him of undermining the independence of the D.C. U.S. attorney's office and abusing it.",
      "The California senator said Martin has been \"openly threatening and intimidating political opponents, dismissing charges against his own clients, firing public servants for their roles in legitimate investigations and using his office as a cudgel to chill dissent and free speech.\"",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking member in the House Judiciary Committee, issued a statement on Thursday calling Martin Mr. Trump's \"personal enforcer,\" and saying Martin's \"record of political extremism and subservience to Trump speaks for itself.\"",
      "\"In a stunning violation of the law and ethics rules, Martin used his public office in his first week to dismiss charges against a January 6 defendant whom he was still representing,\" Raskin said.",
      "The top prosecutor in D.C. is one of the nation's most powerful and influential U.S. attorneys, in part because it prosecutes cases involving Congress and the federal agencies. Unlike the other U.S. attorneys, the D.C. U.S. attorney has a dual role as both the top federal and local prosecutor in the District and has the largest staff of any of the other offices.",
      "Martin's questionnaire also includes a series of YouTube links to campaign speeches and videos he made when he ran for Congress in Missouri.",
      "As an example of his published legal writings, Martin provided a link to a subscriber-only newsletter substack, which touts itself as a source where \"we're naming names and shedding light on the demons, devils, and depravity attempting to destroy our country from within and without.\"",

    "story": [
      "In a move that could upend American foreign relations across the globe, President Trump announced Wednesday that he is imposing what he calls \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. engages with in trade. From April 5, all imports to the U.S. will be subject to a baseline tariff of 10%. Then, beginning April 9, about 90 countries that the Trump administration says currently impose unfair barriers on imported U.S. goods will be hit by additional \"reciprocal\" taxes.",
      "Some of the Asian nations from which the U.S. has long imported vast quantities of consumer goods will be subjected to the highest tariffs, including a 34% blanket levy on imports from China, which quickly vowed to impose unspecified \"countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests.\"",
      "A number of nations, including Britain, Brazil and Egypt, were hit with the lowest, base-rate 10% tariffs.",
      "Economists have warned that across-the-board tariffs could impact lower-income Americans' finances the most and increase the likelihood of a recession.",
      "The response from other world leaders to Mr. Trump's announcement has almost universally included critique \u2014 or outright condemnation \u2014 of the American leader's overt pressure tactics, but it has also shown a recognition of the importance other countries place on trade relations with the world's largest economy.",
      "Below is a look at the criticism \u2014 and the desire to salvage economic relations with Washington \u2014 emanating from capital cities across the globe.",
      "China",
      "A White House official told CBS News that the tariffs announced Wednesday by Mr. Trump will be additive, meaning the 34% \"retaliatory tariffs\" will be on top of 20% levies imposed by Washington earlier this year.",
      "\"China firmly opposes this and will take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,\" China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement. \"There are no winners in trade wars, and there is no way out for protectionism. China urges the U.S. to immediately lift unilateral tariffs and properly resolve differences with its trading partners through dialogue on an equal footing.\"",
      "\"Protectionism has no exit ramp,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Thursday, urging Washington to drop the new taxes on Chinese imports. \"What the U.S. needs to do now is correct its wrong practices and resolve economic and trade differences with other countries \u2014 including China \u2014 through fair, respectful and reciprocal consultations.\"",
      "Beijing did not indicate what countermeasures it might take but in separate remarks, Ministry of Commerce spokesman He Yadong said \"the trade and economic departments of China and the United States have been maintaining communication,\" and he added that Asia's largest economy remained \"willing to engage with the United States on important issues in bilateral trade.\"",
      "The European Union",
      "Overall, the 27-nation European Union bloc is one of the United States' biggest trade partners and, as a collective entity, has come under some of Mr. Trump's most vociferous criticism for what he considers an unfair imbalance in economic relations.",
      "The EU will be hit next week with a blanket 20% \"reciprocal tariff\" on its exports to the U.S., Mr. Trump announced Wednesday.",
      "\"I know that many of you feel let down by our oldest ally,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a video statement. While she was unequivocal in predicting that Mr. Trump's tactics would negatively impact the entire world, she signaled that the EU would at least wait to see if a new trade deal can be reached before imposing additional retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "\"President Trump's announcement of universal tariffs on the whole world, including the EU, is a major blow to the world economy,\" she said. \"Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism. The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe.\"",
      "Von der Leyen said the EU was \"already finalizing a first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel, and we are now preparing for further countermeasures, to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail.\"",
      "The reaction to Mr. Trump's announcement from individual EU member states was, in some cases, more pointed.",
      "In Germany, the bloc's biggest single largest economy and a major exporter of vehicles to the U.S., in particular, Economy Minister Robert Habeck predicted a U-turn by the American president \u2014 if the EU is able to maintain a united front and push back against the tariffs with measures of its own.",
      "\"That is what I see, that Donald Trump buckles under pressure, corrects his announcements under pressure, but the logical consequence is that he must also feel the pressure, and this pressure must now be exerted from Germany, from Europe,\" Habeck said, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Germany's leader, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, called Mr. Trump's tariffs \"fundamentally wrong\" and \"an attack on a trade system that has created prosperity all round the world \u2014 itself an American achievement.\"",
      "\"The EU has the strongest internal market in the world with 450 million consumers, which gives us the strength to hold talks with the U.S. government to avert a trade war,\" he said. \"We want cooperation, not confrontation, and will defend our interests. Europe will respond united, strong and proportionately to this decision.\"",
      "Giorgia Meloni, Italy's right-wing prime minister and a Trump ally who visited him at Mar-a-Lago in January, called the 20% tariff on EU imports \"wrong\" and a move \"that does not suit any party.\"",
      "\"We will do everything we can to work a deal with the United States, aiming to prevent a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global actors,\" Meloni said. \"In any case, as always, we will act in the interests of Italy and its economy, even by comparing ourselves with other European partners.\"",
      "Ireland's Prime Minister Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, in a post on social media, called the U.S. tariffs on the EU \"deeply regrettable,\" adding: \"I strongly believe that tariffs benefit no one. My priority, and that of the government, is to protect Irish jobs and the Irish economy.\"",
      "The United Kingdom",
      "The U.K. pulled out of the EU almost a decade ago, and while the advantages and disadvantages of that \"Brexit\" remain hotly debated, it will see the U.K. dodge the higher 20% tariffs imposed on its European neighbors. But even the baseline 10% levy announced by Mr. Trump on Wednesday was met with disappointment in London and with a clear desire to keep the storied \"special relationship\" on track.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer huddled early Thursday with the top executives from some of Britain's biggest businesses, eager to voice his support for their enterprises and also to draw on their economic acumen as he pushes for a new trade deal with the U.S., with the hope of getting all tariffs lifted.",
      "\"Clearly, there will be an economic impact from the decisions the U.S. has taken both here and globally,\" Starmer told the business leaders. \"But I want to be crystal clear: We are prepared.",
      "\"Nobody wins in a trade war. That is not in our national interest, and we have a fair and balanced trade relationship with the U.S.,\" Starmer argued, adding that \"negotiations on an economic prosperity deal \u2014 one that strengthens our existing trading relationship [with the U.S.] \u2014 they continue, and we will fight for the best deal for Britain.\"",
      "\"Today marks a new stage in our preparations,\" said Starmer. \"We have a range of levers at our disposal, and we will continue our work with businesses across the country to understand their assessment of these options. As I say, our intention remains to secure a deal. But nothing is off the table.\"",
      "Japan",
      "\"We had been requesting that the U.S. government review its unilateral tariff measures at various levels and we are extremely disappointed and regret that such measures have been implemented nonetheless,\" Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Thursday as his nation woke up to the news of a new 24% levy being imposed by the White House \u2014 which was taking a toll on the Nikkei stock market.",
      "\"We will continue to strongly urge the U.S. to review its measures,\" Ishiba said, according to Reuters.",
      "Japanese Trade Minister Yoji Muto, asked if Tokyo would retaliate with its own new trade barriers to U.S. imports, said the government would \"need to decide what is best for Japan, and most effective, in a careful but bold and speedy manner.\"",
      "Brazil",
      "\"The Brazilian government is evaluating all possible actions to ensure reciprocity in bilateral trade, including resorting to the World Trade Organization, in defense of legitimate national interests,\" the Brazilian government said in a statement Thursday, according to Reuters.",
      "The statement came just after Brazil's Congress approved a bill that would give President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva a legal framework to respond to international tariffs, including with countermeasures such as retaliatory tariffs.",
      "The government statement said Brazil remained open to negotiations with the U.S., and it rejected the White House's characterization of the 10% levy as \"reciprocal,\" saying that assessment does not \"reflect reality.\"",
      "Lula said previously that Mr. Trump's decision to impose tariffs on America's trading partners risked damaging the U.S. economy, and he said Brazil would lodge a formal complaint with the WTO over a separate levy on Brazilian steel exports.",
      "\"It will raise the prices of goods and could lead to [U.S.] inflation that he hasn't yet realized,\" Lula said, according to Reuters. \"Protectionism doesn't help any country in the world.\"",
      "Vietnam",
      "Vietnam was among the nations hardest hit by Mr. Trump's tariff salvo on Wednesday, with the U.S. leader announcing 46% tariffs on exports from the Asian manufacturing hub. Its exports to the U.S. have flourished for years under the so-called China+1 strategy, which has seen Chinese manufacturers get around existing U.S. tariffs on their country by moving some production to other, less-heavily tariffed nations in the region.",
      "Vietnamese officials did not immediately signal any plan to impose retaliatory measures.",
      "As the nation's benchmark stock index appeared on course for its biggest single-day drop in four years and its currency hit an all-time low, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh declared a new task force dedicated to addressing the rapidly changing economic situation after holding a cabinet meeting early Thursday.",
      "Cambodia",
      "The French news agency AFP spoke Thursday with Penn Sovicheat, a spokesman for Cambodia's commerce ministry, who blasted the Trump administration's imposition of a 49% levy on the country's exports as \"not reasonable.\"",
      "The White House says Cambodia is among the nations, like Vietnam and Laos, that have developed their own economies by inviting Chinese investment under the China+1 strategy, enabling Chinese manufacturers to skirt existing U.S. trade barriers. According to Sovicheat, Cambodia exported about $10 billion worth of goods to the U.S. in 2024, largely clothing.",
      "\"China has turned Cambodia into the most important transshipment hub that Communist China uses to evade our tariffs,\" a White House official told reporters this week.",
      "Sovicheat acknowledged that American imports to Cambodia, which he said amounted to around $264 million worth of goods last year, were taxed at an average of 29.4%, but the White House figures Mr. Trump unveiled Wednesday claim the Asian nation has tariffs and other trade barriers in place on U.S. goods amounting to 97%.",
      "\"The 49% tariffs is not a good image for Cambodian industry or our investment attraction,\" Sovicheat told AFP, adding that the government was hoping to negotiate a trade agreement with the Trump administration through existing entities such as the ASEAN trade bloc or the World Trade Organization.",
      "Cambodian Commerce Minister Cham Nimul said in remarks aired by state TV that U.S. consumers would feel the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs on his country before Cambodians, according to the AFP.",
      "\"The increase in tariffs means that the U.S. people who make the purchase orders of Cambodian products are the first people to be impacted, and next will be Cambodia and business people,\" she was quoted as saying.",
      "Australia",
      "Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Thursday that Mr. Trump's 10% tariffs were \"not unexpected, but let me be clear, they are totally unwarranted.\"",
      "\"This is not the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, who, in addition to his frustration, appeared perplexed by the fact that the White House tariffs singled out some of his country's tiny, far-flung territories, including a group of islands that are home to lots of penguins, but no people.",
      "Norfolk Island is an inhabited Australian territory, but only by about 2,000 people, and Albanese called it \"a bit strange\" that it had been singled out by the White House and hit with an even greater tariff of 29%, nearly three times higher than the Australian mainland.",
      "The uninhabited Heard Island and McDonald Islands were subject to the same 10% levy as mainland Australia, meanwhile, despite them rarely seeing human footprints due to \"the extreme isolation\" and the \"persistently severe weather and sea conditions\" in the sub-Antarctic area.",

      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams' historic federal corruption case has been dropped.",
      "Judge Dale Ho has agreed to the\u00a0U.S. Department of Justice's request to drop the charges\u00a0against Adams, but he did so \"with prejudice.\" That means Adams cannot be re-tried on the same charges at a later time - a stipulation the Justice Department sought in its initial request to dismiss the case.",
      "The decision to formally drop the case comes after Judge Ho appointed Paul Clement as a \"friend of the court\"\u00a0to present arguments over the DOJ's request. The\u00a0initial hearing on the request\u00a0did not include anyone who opposed the move. In his filing to the court,\u00a0Clement argued the case should be dropped with prejudice to prevent the appearance that Adams remains under political pressure.",

      "Timeline: The corruption case against NYC Mayor Eric Adams",
      "The outcome appears to put an end to the legal jeopardy that Adams had been in ever since he was\u00a0indicted\u00a0last September on five counts of bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations.",
      "\"The case against Eric Adams should have never been brought in the first place\u2014and finally today that case is gone forever. From Day 1, the mayor has maintained his innocence and now justice for Eric Adams and New Yorkers has prevailed,\" Adams' attorney Alex Spiro said.",
      "\"This case was an example of political weaponization and a waste of resources. We are focused on arresting and prosecuting terrorists while returning the Department of Justice to its core mission of keeping Americans safe,\" the Department of Justice said in a statement.",
      "In the DOJ request to drop the case, prosecutors said having it hang over Adams\u00a0interfered with his 2025 mayoral campaign and his ability\u00a0to cooperate with the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration.",
      "The initial request to drop the charges made note that the decision was not based on \"the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based.\"",
      "That triggered concerns that Adams could not effectively govern the city because\u00a0he would be beholden to the Trump administration, as long as the possibility of the charges returning remained in place.",
      "Adams and his attorneys have vehemently denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Mayor Adams responds to charges being dropped",
      "Adams spoke at Gracie Mansion\u00a0after the case against him was dropped.",
      "\"As I've said all along, this case should have never been brought and I did nothing wrong,\" Adams said. \"I am now happy that our city can finally close the book and focus solely on the future of our great city. I want to thank New Yorkers who stood by my side, who prayed for me, who supported me from day one and stuck with me while we focused on the work at hand.\"",
      "He offered an apology to New Yorkers.",
      "\"I also want to apologize to New Yorkers for having to go through this with me, a baseless case that should have never been brought in the first place,\" Adams said.",
      "Adams said New Yorkers are his \"north star\" and he thinks about them every day.",
      "\"I'm a New Yorker, and this is the greatest city on the globe, and it's a privilege being your mayor, something I did not take for granted one day, and I'm going to continue to serve you,\" Adams said. \"As I have repeatedly said, I have always been solely beholden to the people of this city. No special interests, no political opponents, but just everyday New Yorkers. Just you, and I'm going to continue to do that. So today we turn the page, we move forward together.\"",
      "Before he went back into Gracie Mansion, Adams held up a copy of \"Government Gangsters,\" a book by FBI Director Kash Patel.",
      "\"Read it and understand how we can never allow this to happen to another innocent American,\" Adams said.",
      "More on the judge's ruling",
      "Judge Ho's decision includes words Adams' opponents are sure to focus in on: \"Everything here smacks of a bargain, dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions.\"",
      "In his ruling to dismiss the case with prejudice, Judge Ho took issue with the Department of Justice's request to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning he could've faced trial on the same charges again at a later time.",
      "Judge Ho summarized the DOJ's reasoning to drop the case as based on three things: It's tainted with impropriety, detrimental to national security and immigration enforcement, and was a weak case to begin with.",
      "\"There  may or may not be good reasons to drop this prosecution. But the reasons articulated by DOJ, if  taken at face value, are inconsistent with a decision to leave the charges in the Indictment hanging  like the proverbial Sword of Damocles over the Mayor,\" Judge Ho wrote. \"And there are many reasons to be troubled by DOJ's proffered rationales\u2014further supporting dismissal with prejudice.\"",
      "Judge Ho also addressed why he couldn't continue to pursue the case after the DOJ moved to dismiss it.",
      "\"Some will undoubtedly find today's decision unsatisfying, wondering why, if DOJ's ostensible reasons for dropping this case are so troubling, the Court does not simply deny the  Motion to Dismiss altogether. But, as explained above, the Court cannot order DOJ to continue  the prosecution, and it is aware of no authority (outside of the criminal contempt context) that  would empower it, as some have urged, to appoint an independent prosecutor,\" Judge Ho wrote. \"Therefore, any  decision by this Court to deny the Government's Motion to Dismiss would be futile at best, because  DOJ could\u2014and, by all indications, unequivocally would\u2014simply refuse to prosecute the case,  inevitably resulting in a dismissal after seventy days for violating the Mayor's right to a speedy  trial. That route would simply postpone finality in this case to a date uncomfortably close to the  June 24 mayoral primary. The public interest would not be served by such an outcome.\"",
      "\"To be clear, the Court again emphasizes that it does not express any opinion as to the merits  of the case or whether the prosecution of Mayor Adams 'should' move forward,\" Judge Ho added.",
      "Read the judge's order in full",

      "\"Legally speaking, he is innocent until proven guilty, and he will never be proven guilty - that is an unequivocal, it is rare when we can rarely say things that definitively - but he will never face legal consequences for the allegations that were against him in this case,\" Hofstra Law Professor James Sample said.",
      "Impact on the mayor's race",
      "The timing of the decision to drop the case was critical for Adams, who faced a Thursday deadline to file petitions to run for mayor in New York City's Democratic primary. He later announced he will run as an independent candidate.",
      "The decision means Adams is now free to run without the threat of going to jail, or facing a politically damaging trial.",
      "CBS News New York has learned that Adams is immediately jumping into the political fray, and he plans to participate in a mayoral candidates forum sponsored by the National Action Network Thursday.",
      "\"He looks forward to engaging with fellow candidates and community leaders to discuss the future of our great city,\" a spokesman said.",
      "Since there's no possibility of the charges against him resurfacing, Adams can also say he is not beholden to President Trump or his administration, since they can no longer bring the same case against him. Adams has repeatedly said that, and just Tuesday night, New York City joined a suit against the Trump administration to challenge cuts that would cost New York City $100 million in CDC funding.",
      "\"When federal policies directly impact our city, we have been, and will continue to be, the first and loudest to advocate for New Yorkers. These funds are crucial in protecting public health, and the reversal will have serious consequences for communities across the five boroughs,\" Adams said in his statement Tuesday night.",
      "Even before Adams officially learned that his case had been dropped, Adams made it clear at a National Action Network event Wednesday that suggestions he was \"under the finger\" of President Trump were, in his mind, false.",
      "\"I do not know who you think I'm under the finger of,\" Adams said Wednesday morning. \"But I'm on the finger of Eric Adams, the mayor of the city of New York, and I'm going to continue to do so.\"",
      "Adams also made an argument voters can expect to hear if he seeks another term.",
      "\"I'm the same person that made sure we put $17 billion in the [minority and women-owned businesses] in this city, that invested in foster care children, that built more housing in year one and year two of our administration than in the history of this city,\" Adams said.",
      "Adams has previously told CBS News New York's Marcia Kramer to expect twists and turns in the upcoming mayoral election.",
      "Adams' opposition speaks out",
      "The mayor's detractors were also speaking out.",
      "\"Either way, I think there was tremendous damage that was done to this city because of an Adams administration, so the quickest we can get away from this administration, I think the better for the city,\" Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said.",
      "\"It's absolutely disgusting. You have a man that broke the law. We want to remind people that it wasn't just about flight upgrades. This was a man who illegally held a campaign donor scheme, and the fact that the judge unfortunately bowed to Trump is appalling,\" mayoral candidate Michael Blake said.",
      "\"The ruling does not change the facts: Eric Adams works for Donald Trump, not New Yorkers,\" mayoral candidate and city Comptroller Brad Lander said.",
      "\"Eric Adams has sold out New Yorkers and put himself above the public at every chance he could. Even the judge in the case agrees: this slimy deal reeks of a quid pro quo with the Trump administration. In exchange for his freedom, Adams has looked the other way while the federal government detains and disappears New Yorkers, steals money from our city, and wages war on working people. Adams should resign in disgrace,\" mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani said.",
      "Move to drop charges sparked resignations",
      "The DOJ memo seeking to drop the charges set off a spate of resignations that started in City Hall, at the very heart of Adams' inner circle, and reached all the way to the U.S. attorney's office. At issue was then-Acting U.S. Attorney of the Southern District of New York Danielle Sassoon's allegation that the request to dismiss the case amounted to a quid pro quo, namely Adams' cooperation on President Trump's immigration enforcement in exchange for his charges being dropped. Sassoon resigned, rather than drop the charges, as did several other people in the U.S. attorney's office.",
      "The mayor and his attorney pushed back strenuously against the notion of a quid pro quo.",
      "\"The idea that there was a quid pro quo is a total lie. We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us,\" Adams' attorney \u00a0Alex Spiro said.",
      "Allegations that Adams had been compromised by the Trump administration and was operating, essentially, under its thumb led\u00a0four New York City deputy mayors to resign\u00a0and spurred numerous calls for Adams to step down. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has the power to remove Adams from office, then met with key leaders to discuss his future. She ultimately acted to limit Adams' powers in a bid to restore trust in government, but said she wouldn't remove him.",
      "What Adams has been accused of",
      "Last September, federal prosecutors alleged Adams had been abusing his power for almost a decade. They said he solicited illegal campaign donations from wealthy foreigners and corporations, including a Turkish government official.",
      "In the\u00a057-page indictment, Adams was accused of receiving gifts he didn't disclose, including luxury travel, worth more than $100,000, in return for political favors.",
      "\"These upgrades and freebies were not part of some frequent flyer or loyalty program available to the general public. As we allege, this was a multi-year scheme to buy favor with a single New York City politician on the rise,\" then-U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District Damian Williams\u00a0said as he announced the indictment.",
      "Prosecutors accused Adams of pressuring FDNY officials to approve the Turkish consulate building in Manhattan, despite fire safety concerns.",
      "The Adams campaign was also accused of using \"straw donors\" for illicit contributions, enabling it to tap into $10 million in matching funds.",
      "\"These are bright red lines, and we allege that the mayor crossed them again and again for years,\" Williams said.",
      "Before the DOJ stepped in, prosecutors appeared to be ramping up their case, claiming they had uncovered\u00a0\"additional criminal conduct.\"",
      "Adams associates also under investigation",
      "The historic indictment came amid\u00a0multiple investigations into Adams' campaign, as well as other administration officials.",
      "Numerous top members of the Adams administration resigned before the indictment was announced, including former\u00a0NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban\u00a0and\u00a0his twin brother, James Caban. Former\u00a0Schools Chancellor David Banks\u00a0and his wife, former\u00a0Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright, and his brother, former\u00a0Deputy Mayor Philip Banks III, were also investigated.",
      "Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a longtime Adams advisor, pleaded not guilty to bribery, money laundering and conspiracy\u00a0in a case involving her son and two real estate developers. The mayor's former liaison for the Muslim community, Mohamed Bahi, was also\u00a0charged with conspiracy for his role in collecting illegal donations\u00a0for Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign and\u00a0has agreed to plead guilty, according to court documents.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans unveiled a budget resolution on Wednesday, as the GOP seeks to move forward with the budget plan that will enable them to implement President Trump's agenda later this week.",
      "The Senate Budget committee released the 70-page budget resolution on Wednesday, which would serve as a blueprint, directing congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview. The plan is a key step toward implementing the president's priorities on border security, defense, energy and taxes. It aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, along with authorizing $1.5 trillion in additional tax cuts, while raising the debt ceiling by as much as $5 trillion.",
      "The blueprint is a compromise resolution that comes after a key meeting between Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson and top tax leaders last week. Though House and Senate Republicans had previously forged ahead with their own budget blueprints in recent weeks, the two chambers must adopt the same budget plan to continue on in the reconciliation process \u2014 a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance legislation in the Senate.",
      "\"It is now time for the Senate to move forward with this budget resolution in order to further advance our shared Republican agenda in Congress,\" Thune said in a statement as the resolution was released.",
      "Thune said the budget resolution will \"pave the way for a generational investment in border security and national defense and unleash American energy dominance,\" while demonstrating a commitment to \"reducing the size and scope of the federal government by cutting waste, fraud, and abuse.\"",
      "The Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for a number of committees, at just a few billion dollars, while it calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over a 10-year period in the House. The Senate is expected to find far more than the floor outlined in the resolution, but the figures are aimed at giving them flexibility moving forward.",
      "The Senate majority leader outlined to reporters earlier Wednesday that he plans to file the resolution on the floor after its release, which would start a clock of up to 50 hours of debate and set up a late week vote-a-rama, where senators are allowed to introduce an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to vote through the night. The timeline could set the House on a path to adopt the changes to the budget resolution next week, delivering a key win for President Trump and congressional Republicans before lawmakers leave town for Easter recess.",
      "The budget resolution's release comes as the majority leader and Senate Budget Committee Republicans met with Mr. Trump earlier Wednesday at the White House, where Thune said committee members aired their views with the president.",
      "In a post to his Truth Social platform Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump endorsed the budget deal, saying it \"gives us the tools that we need to get our shared priorities done, including certain PERMANENT Tax Cuts, Spending Cuts, Energy, Historic Investments in Defense, Border, and much more.\"",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters after the meeting that the members made the point that their priorities are to extend the Trump tax cuts, to further refine the tax code to encourage growth and extend the debt limit while reducing spending. And he noted that the meeting allayed some of the concerns of budget hawks.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said after the meeting that feels \"a lot more comfortable\" with the budget resolution, saying \"there's just a real commitment to returning the federal budget to a reasonable pre-pandemic baseline.\"",
      "The development also comes as Senate Republicans opted to proceed without the Senate parliamentarian's sign off, arguing in recent days that they don't need the parliamentarian's permission to move ahead with the current policy baseline, an accounting approach that would make it appear that extending the current tax policy would cost nothing.",
      "In order to approve legislation using the reconciliation maneuver, lawmakers must first approve a budget resolution and direct committees to craft bills reconciling spending with the new budget goals. The final product can only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit, and any new spending must be paid for. The Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package, confirming that the provisions have direct budgetary consequences, if an item is challenged.",
      "Kennedy reiterated the widely held GOP position Wednesday that \"we don't need the parliamentarian's permission,\" arguing that the Budget Committee chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, has the authority to make that decision on the current policy baseline. He projected that Senate Democrats will challenge it, but \"they'll lose.\"",
      "Graham said in a statement upon the resolution's release that \"I have determined that current policy will be the budget baseline regarding taxation.\"",
      "\"This will allow the tax cuts to be permanent \u2013 which will tremendously boost the economy,\" he added.",

      "The president, who signed an executive order to impose the tariffs, insisted the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of are \"over.\" The reciprocal tariffs, Mr. Trump said, will amount to roughly half the tariff rate those countries impose on U.S. exports, or less. Countries that will see tariffs higher than 10% include the European Union, China and Israel.",
      "Senior administration officials said the 10% worldwide tariffs take effect April 5 at 12:01 a.m., and the higher reciprocal tariffs go into effect on April 9 at 12:01 a.m.",
      "\"In short, chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life,\" the president said in a White House Rose Garden announcement. \"And for these reasons, starting tomorrow, the United States will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations.\"",
      "\"For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating, and because we are being very kind, we're a kind people, very kind,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You're not so kind when you're ripped off\u2026 We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.\"",

      "Canada and Mexico are not subject to these tariffs for now, senior administration officials said, but tariffs the president has already imposed, citing fentanyl and migration issues, persist.",

      "\"It's our declaration of economic independence,\" the president said in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Trump labeled Wednesday \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "The president lamented that the U.S. imports phones and other electronics, as well as pharmaceuticals, saying that if there's a war, the U.S. would struggle. He said his moves Wednesday are also standing up for U.S. farmers and ranchers who have been \"brutalized\" by other countries, specifically blasting Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump said the Americans \"subsidize\" a lot of other countries, calling out the European Union, China, South Korea and Australia for their trade practices.",
      "\"They've taken so much of our wealth away from us,\" Mr. Trump said of other countries.",
      "The president said he expects complaints from \"globalists,\" \"outsourcers,\" \"special interests,\" and \"fake news\" in the days ahead, but insisted those groups have been wrong about trade before.",
      "\"In the first term, they said tariffs would crash the economy,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Instead, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.\"",
      "In the audience for the president's announcement were rank-and-file steelworkers and auto workers, House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as most of Mr. Trump's Cabinet, including Vice President JD Vance.",
      "What new tariffs did Trump announce today?",
      "The president says his plan will place a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on all countries, with reciprocal tariffs on many trading partners that have their own tariffs placed on the U.S. The 25% tariffs the president previously announced on foreign cars and foreign auto parts are set to go into effect at midnight.",
      "A White House official said the reciprocal tariffs are additive, meaning they will be imposed in addition to any previous tariffs already in place, unless a specific good is exempt under Section 232 of the Tariffs Act, which carries a flat 25% rate on certain things like steel and aluminum.",

The American working class people have been left behind for decades, and they're sick of it.\"",
      "What are tariffs, exactly?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S.\u00a0The most common type of tariffs are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value\"), which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of a product. The 25% auto tariffs are these types of tariffs.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, and \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold.",
      "What do financial experts say about tariffs?",
      "Economists and taxpayer advocacy groups have their doubts, and are warning tariffs could upset economic growth and will almost surely contribute to higher prices for American consumers. Some automakers have already announced higher car prices, after the president announced tariffs on foreign cars and parts.",
      "More than a dozen leaders at think tanks and taxpayer advocacy groups, including at the National Taxpayers Union, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, on Tuesday sent a joint letter to congressional leaders and the commerce and treasury secretaries, urging them to consider how tariffs on steel, lumber, energy, pharmaceutical and medical supplies and cars and car parts will increase prices.",
      "\"We encourage you to consider whether tariffs may, in many cases, undermine President Trump's broader long-term economic goals by increasing the cost of goods subject to tariffs,\" they wrote. \"We are especially concerned about tariffs on inputs needed by U.S. manufacturers that make it harder to compete with finished goods made abroad and tariffs that increase the price of necessities like food and housing.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 21:18:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Around 170 staff were cut from the FDA's Office of Inspections and Investigations this week as part of wider cuts at U.S. health agencies.",
    "story": [
      "Senior Food and Drug Administration leaders are planning for cutbacks to the number of routine food and drug inspections conducted by the agency, multiple officials say, due to steep layoffs this week in support staff.",
      "Around 170 workers were cut from the FDA's Office of Inspections and Investigations, according to two federal health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services has said layoffs ordered\u00a0by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with some 10,000 workers let go from the department, would not directly cut FDA's inspections staff. But in meetings among federal health officials, the agency's remaining leaders have grappled with how to deal with major delays and disruptions caused by the loss of administrative and management staff who had supported the agency's inspectors, according to two FDA officials.",
      "\"These administrative functions are being streamlined as part of HHS' transformation initiative to make the agency more efficient and responsive. FDA inspectors were not impacted and this critical work will continue,\" an HHS spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The inspections and investigations office will now need to work with FDA's drug, device and food centers to reprioritize their workload for the rest of the year, one official said. That will mean trimming routine \"surveillance inspections\" for more urgent tasks, the official said, like inspections of firms where the agency has been alerted to a safety risk or follow-up visits to ensure that drugmakers or food producers have fixed previous violations.",
      "One of the biggest immediate impacts on the agency's inspectors stems from the elimination of the office's travel operations division, one official said. The team's work ranged from booking flights to coordinating with the State Department to secure translators needed for inspections of drugmakers and food producers abroad.",
      "\"As of yesterday, all front-line investigators will now be spending significant time processing their own travel and related administrative requirements, rather than spending that time in firms ensuring the American consumer is protected,\" one FDA official told CBS News.",
      "A pilot program of unannounced foreign inspections has also been paused due to the cuts, an official said, because of the loss of staff that had been tasked with quickly securing translators around the world.",
      "The FDA has long struggled to meet its own inspection goals, which was worsened by a backlog created during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a January report by the Government Accountability Office, the FDA was facing a swelling list of food safety inspections that were on track to miss deadlines mandated by Congress, as they struggled to hire and retain qualified inspectors.",
      "While current inspections are still taking place, multiple FDA officials said that cuts are likely to worsen delays caused by other challenges introduced by the Trump administration's efforts to cut spending in recent months.",
      "As one example, multiple officials said that field operations have been hampered by a new government-wide $1 limit on spending cards. Any spending above that limit requires a cumbersome approval process.",
      "Inspectors had already been asked to plan their inspections a month in advance due to the delays caused by the spending limit, one official said.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate approved a measure Wednesday aimed at blocking the Canada tariffs, as a handful of Republicans bucked President Trump.",
      "In a 51 to 48 vote, four Republicans joined all Democrats in favor of the measure. But the House is unlikely to take up the resolution, making the vote largely a symbolic one.",
      "Joining Democrats in support of the measure were Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and former GOP leader Mitch McConnell,\u00a0along with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who co-sponsored the legislation.",
      "The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, would terminate the national emergency that the president is using to impose the tariffs, effectively blocking the sweeping levies on foreign imports. Kaine forced the vote under the National Emergencies Act, bypassing Senate Republican leadership.",
      "The president first threatened the tariffs on Canada and Mexico in January, touting a need to enhance border security and stop the flow of fentanyl over the nation's borders, before they were twice delayed. In a major White House announcement Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he was imposing what he termed \"reciprocal tariffs\" on about 60 nations, but exempted Canada and Mexico.",
      "Canada and Mexico are, however, facing tariffs under separate policies targeting aluminum and steel, which took effect in February, as well as vehicle imports, which are set to take effect Thursday. Speaking on Fox News Wednesday evening, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that goods from Mexico and Canada that are currently covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement would remain exempt from tariffs for now.",
      "Kaine, who called the tariffs \"attacks on everyday people,\" said ahead of the vote that the president has justified the imposition of these tariffs on \"a made up emergency.\" He argued that while fentanyl is a \"real emergency,\" it's not from Canada, while warning that the Canadian tariffs will tax groceries and food products, building supplies, fertilizers, along with materials that produce ships and submarines and implicate U.S. national security.",
      "With 47 Democrats and independents in the chamber, the resolution required the support of at least four Republicans for approval. Mr. Trump put pressure on the GOP leading up to the vote, urging that \"Republicans in the Senate MUST vote to keep the National Emergency in place, so we can finish the job, and end the scourge.\"",
      "\"Don't let the Democrats have a Victory,\" the president said in a post on Truth Social Tuesday. \"It would be devastating for the Republican Party and, far more importantly, for the United States.\"",
      "Ahead of the vote, the president called out the Republican senators who supported the measure, saying in a post in the wee hours Wednesday that \"Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Rand Paul, also of Kentucky, will hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change.\"",
      "\"The Senate Bill is just a ploy of the Dems to show and expose the weakness of certain Republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the House will never approve,\" Mr. Trump continued, asking the senators' constituents to reach out to them.",
      "\"They have been extremely difficult to deal with and, unbelievably disloyal to hardworking Majority Leader John Thune, and the Republican Party itself,\" the president added.",
      "Thune criticized the measure ahead of the vote, warning that it could threaten efforts to stop fentanyl from entering the country.",
      "\"We would be wrong to view this as solely a southern border problem,\" Thune said, arguing that cartels will expand fentanyl smuggling operations at the northern border if it's not addressed.",
      "The majority leader pledged that Republicans intend to keep a promise to \"end the lawlessness at our borders.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged Republicans to join Democrats in supporting the resolution, calling the tariffs a \"tax increase on American families, plain and simple.\"",
      "\"Every single Senate Republican should support Tim's resolution, and support American families,\" Schumer said.",
      "The New York Democrat cited Mr. Trump's urging of the GOP to oppose the measure, claiming that the president is \"very worried\" about the resolution.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. citizen wife of a 29-year-old man who the Trump administration has admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador said she fears for his safety in the infamous mega-prison where he's being held, maintaining that her husband is \"an amazing father\" and \"not a criminal.\"",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador on March 15 and imprisoned inside that country's maximum-security prison known as CECOT, as part of a series of U.S. deportation flights that have ignited a high-stakes legal battle in American courts.",
      "The Trump administration has acknowledged in federal court that his deportation was an \"administrative error,\" since an immigration judge in 2019 had granted him legal protection from being sent to El Salvador. But it has rejected requests to bring back Abrego Garcia, saying the U.S. no longer has custody over him. It is also accusing him of being part of MS-13, a transnational criminal gang. Abrego Garcia's lawyers have said in court documents that their client has no criminal record, a finding the government has not contested.",
      "During an exclusive interview with CBS News, Jennifer, Abrego Garcia's wife, said she confirmed her husband had been deported from the U.S. and imprisoned at the CECOT prison after identifying him in a photo posted by the Salvadoran government.",
      "\"When I saw it, I immediately broke down 'cause I knew it was him,\" she said. \"I was scared for his life.\"",
      "Jennifer, who requested that her surname be withheld, said she was \"very scared\" about Abrego Garcia's transfer to CECOT because it houses some of El Salvador's most dangerous gang members. After all, she said, the reason a U.S. immigration judge in 2019 granted him a reprieve from deportation was because of concerns that he could be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador.",
      "\"I've seen news of that prison,\" she said. \"I know they take criminals there. And my husband's not a criminal.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. in 2011, when he was 16. According to court documents, he entered the country illegally, without being inspected by immigration officials.",
      "In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after an encounter with local police outside of a Maryland Home Depot. Abrego Garcia's attorneys said he went there looking for work. He remained in ICE detention for months, while an immigration judge reviewed his case.",
      "Court documents show an immigration judge initially denied Abrego Garcia's release on bond, partially due to information submitted by the government that it said tied him to MS-13. The judge's bond denial, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board, mentioned information from an informant who the government deemed to be credible.",
      "But Abrego Garcia was ultimately released from ICE custody after another immigration judge granted him \"withholding of removal,\" a legal classification that bars officials from deporting individuals who prove they are more likely than not to face persecution in their home country. In his order, the judge said Abrego Garcia could be targeted by gangs if sent to El Salvador.",
      "Jennifer said her husband attended regular check-ins with ICE after he was released. He became their family's main breadwinner, she added, and helped her raise their 5-year-old disabled son, as well as two children from a previous relationship. He worked five days a week as a sheet metal worker while also attending college classes, she said.",
      "On March 12, however, Abrego Garcia was again arrested by ICE. Jennifer said he was driving with their 5-year-old son with disabilities when he was stopped. She said she rushed to the location and was told by ICE officials that her husband's status had \"changed\" and that he would be fingerprinted and detained.",
      "Over the next few days, Jennifer said her husband was transferred to different immigration detention centers, including ones in Louisiana and Texas. During their last phone call, Jennifer said Abrego Garcia told her that he was going to be deported to El Salvador and imprisoned at CECOT.",
      "Jennifer said she couldn't believe it. She told her husband there was no reason for the U.S. to send him to a foreign prison. He said that if she didn't receive another call from him, it would be because he had been deported.",
      "\"He never called,\" Jennifer said. \"I waited and waited. He never made that call.\"",
      "Jennifer said she has not heard from her husband since that call and has not found a way to communicate with him. She's now suing the government as part of a lawsuit before the federal district court in Maryland that is demanding that the U.S. government take steps to bring Abrego Garcia back to the country.",
      "While it has conceded it mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia, the Trump administration has defended the merits of his deportation and has told the federal court in Maryland it opposes his return to the U.S.",
      "The Justice Department has argued\u00a0that federal courts lack the authority to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, since he's now being held by the Salvadoran government and no longer in U.S. custody. Even if they did have the power to order his return, the Justice Department said in a filing, there has been \"no showing that El Salvador is even inclined to consider a request to release a detainee at the United States' request.\"",
      "Trump administration officials, including White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, have described Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 \"leader\" who is implicated in human trafficking. Officials have yet to disclose concrete evidence that supports those claims.",
      "Jennifer strongly refuted the White House's accusations, saying she would know if her husband was a gang member. Court documents indicate Abrego Garcia has traffic violations, but no criminal charges or convictions, in the U.S.",
      "\"He's not a criminal,\" Jennifer said. \"My husband is an amazing person. An amazing father.\"",

    "story": [

      "A 10% universal import duty on all goods brought into the U.S.",
      "So-called reciprocal tariffs that will be applied to imports from 90 nations.",
      "Mr. Trump, who announced the tariffs in the White House's Rose Garden on Wednesday afternoon, said his plans reflect \"one of the most important days in American history; it's our declaration of economic independence.\" Even so, economists say the tariffs will boost prices on many products purchased by American consumers, at a time when inflation still remains elevated.",
      "An overview of Mr. Trump's new \"Liberation Day\" tariffs",
      "The first tariff will be a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S.",
      "The second tariff, reciprocal tariffs, will be applied to imports from 60 countries and are aimed at equalizing the trade imbalances between the U.S. and those nations. Mr. Trump said that reciprocal tariffs \"means they do it to us, and we do it to them.\"",
      "He added, \"It can't get any simpler than that.\"",
      "One example provided by Mr. Trump is that the U.S. charges a 2.5% tariff on automobile imports, while adding that the European Union charges a 10% tariff on American car exports to EU nations.",
      "\"Such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base,\" he added.",
      "What is a reciprocal tariff?",
      "At the moment, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges on German vehicle imports.",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would apply the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries place on American exports on a product-by-product basis. By charging countries only 50% of what they charge U.S. products, Mr. Trump said he is imposing \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump said that the reciprocal tariffs will also include calculations to cover non-monetary trade barriers, such as when nations devalue their currencies to help boost demand for their products from other nations.",
      "When do the tariffs go into effect?",
      "The baseline 10% tariff will go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5, while the reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9.",
      "Why is Trump imposing these new tariffs?",
      "During his announcement, Mr. Trump said the goal was to revitalize the industrial and manufacturing base of the U.S., promising that doing so will \"make America wealthy again.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the tariffs will help convince foreign businesses to relocate their factories to the U.S. The president also promised that the tariffs would lead to lower prices for Americans, although most economists are projecting that Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to boost inflation and lead to higher costs for the typical U.S. household.",
      "For instance, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index \u2014 an inflation measure closely tracked by the Federal Reserve \u2014 could rise 0.5 percentage points to 3.5% by year end, according to a March 30 Goldman Sachs report. The core PCE rose 2.8% in February on an annual basis, reflecting a slight increase from the prior month.",
      "That estimate is based on Mr. Trump's previously announced tariffs, including his 25% import duty on\u00a0auto imports, as well as Goldman's expectation for reciprocal tariffs that would average about 15%.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration's crackdown on students who participated in pro-Palestinian activities has raised questions about the First Amendment rights of visa and green card holders amid the shocking detentions of a number of students at Tufts, Columbia and other universities in recent weeks.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited a provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act that authorizes the nation's top diplomat to revoke the visas of foreign national students on the grounds that their presence or activities have \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S.",
      "The federal government is not required to lay out proof beyond that explanation, legal experts told CBS News, setting up a legal showdown over foreign nationals' free speech rights in the U.S.",
      "\"There's a tension between everyone's First Amendment rights to free speech and the immigration statute's broad provisions giving the secretary of state broad latitude to declare someone deportable simply because he thinks that the student may have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences. And the courts will have to figure out where the appropriate line should be drawn,\" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired immigration law professor at Cornell University.",
      "Rubio said Thursday the State Department has canceled more than 300 visas and that they're \"primarily\" student visas. Several high-profile cases are related to students who led or participated in pro-Palestinian activities and disruptive protests, which the administration has equated to activity supporting Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group.",
      "He also told reporters that if the administration is compelled to provide evidence in court, it will, but said \"judges don't issue student visas. There's no right to a student visa.\"",
      "\"We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses. And if we've given you a visa, and then you decide to do that, we're going to take it away,\" Rubio said at a news conference in Guyana.",
      "In targeting students, the Trump administration is enforcing the statute differently than past administrations, according to immigration lawyer Jonathan Grode.",
      "\"This administration hasn't changed the law,\" Grode said. \"They're just telling the referees to call the game differently. They're saying, be stricter, use all the tools you have available to effectuate this behavior. That's the big difference. That's why it feels so jarring.\"",
      "\"With the Trump administration, they're pushing this to such a degree that it's creating concern, hysteria, reaction, litigation,\" he added.",
      "A visa revocation does not automatically result in a person's deportation, which is handled by the Department of Homeland Security and requires due process. Several of the students are sitting in detention facilities as the government seeks to deport them.",
      "Rubio's remarks came in response to a question about Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Fulbright scholar and Turkish national who was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents wearing masks and in plain clothes in Massachusetts on Tuesday, March 25.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson alleged Wednesday that Ozturk had \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas,\" but did not provide details about her alleged activities. Ozturk's friends have said she is being punished for co-authoring an opinion piece in the Tufts Daily campus newspaper in 2024, where she called on the school to divest from Israel and \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide\" but never mentioned Hamas.",
      "Tufts University said in a statement April 2 that the op-ed was consistent with the university's policy on freedom of expression, and that it has \"no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention.\"",
      "\"The University has seen an outpouring of support for Ms. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk over the last week from Tufts students, faculty and staff. These individuals have described Ms. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk as a valued member of the community, dedicated to her academic pursuits and committed to her colleagues,\" Tufts said.",
      "The case followed another high-profile detention earlier this month of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University grad student who had been active in pro-Palestinian protests on campus last year. Khalil, who was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria, has a green card, or legal permanent residency, and his wife is an American citizen. Immigration authorities initially told Khalil that they were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, but when they were informed that he had a green card, the agent said they were revoking that according to his attorney.",
      "Green cards, however, cannot be rescinded as simply as visas. The government suggested in a court filing earlier this week that it could move to revoke his status for allegedly omitting information on his immigration forms, including his involvement with the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, and a group known as Columbia University Apartheid Divest.",
      "But at the core of the U.S. government's detention and aimed deportation of Khalil is a rarely used section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that subjects noncitizens to possible deportation if their presence and activities are deemed threatening to the foreign policy interests of the U.S.",
      "This same law was used to detain Georgetown University researcher Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national who was taken into custody by masked agents March 17 in Virginia. The government cited his alleged \"close connections\" to a Hamas official as justification for revoking the visa, saying he was \"actively spreading Hamas propaganda.\"",
      "The government using that law is also trying to deport Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Columbia University student and legal permanent resident who has been involved in pro-Palestinian protests. Chung came to the U.S. from South Korea with her family when she was 7.",
      "Yale-Loehr recalled two other cases where similar powers were invoked in deportation proceedings. In 1987, it was used in a case involving eight people who either held valid student visas or were lawful permanent residents for their pro-Palestinian activism. The deportation case dragged on for 20 years and ended with a judge calling the government's actions \"an embarrassment to the rule of law.\" In the 1990s, the government tried to deport a former Mexican official who was in the U.S. on a visa and faced charges in his home country. The then secretary of state said his deportation was necessary for foreign policy matters.",
      "Attorneys in the recent cases have accused the Trump administration of using immigration enforcement to suppress speech it disagrees with.",
      "Grode said the crackdown could have a chilling effect on the First Amendment. The Trump administration, which ran on a free speech platform, is \"creeping in on attacking some of the very fundamental principles that make America America,\" he said. Still, noncitizens having First Amendment rights \"doesn't negate the ability of the government to revoke their visa,\" he added.",
      "Yale-Loehr expects it will take years for these cases to be settled, predicting that \"it's going to be a mess.\"",
      "\"If there's over 300 students who had their visas revoked, there's going to be a lot of cases challenging it,\" he said. \"I suspect that the litigation will take years to unravel before a court and get a definitive ruling on the extent to which foreign nationals have First Amendment rights.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/factcheck-trump-tariffs-revenue/",
    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 16:02:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Experts estimate far lower figures in tariffs revenue, warning that President Trump's tariffs could drive up prices for American consumers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has argued that some of the tariffs he's imposing this week could help the government raise over $1 trillion in the next year or so, helping to reduce the national debt and even potentially offset some income taxes.",
      "But economists are skeptical that these tariffs can bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods when prices go up.",
      "Tariffs are often charged as a percentage of the price that importers pay foreign sellers. They aren't paid by foreign nations, but by U.S. companies who often pass the cost to American consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"You're going to see billions of dollars, even trillions of dollars coming into our country very soon in the form of tariffs,\" the president said last week.",
      "While economic analyses indicate Mr. Trump's tariffs could meaningfully increase annual tariff revenue, the president's trillion-dollar estimates are significantly higher than those provided by think tanks and even some of his own officials.",
      "How much Trump's new auto tariffs could generate",
      "In a recent news conference, White House staff secretary Will Sharf estimated that Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could raise \"roughly $100 billion in new revenue.\" At the same news conference, Mr. Trump claimed moments later \"anywhere from $600 billion to $1 trillion will be taken in over the relatively short-term period, meaning a year from now.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request to clarify the source of the discrepancy.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan think tank, has estimated that the auto tariffs could raise roughly $600 billion to $650 billion over a period of 10 years \u2014 not in a single year, as Mr. Trump suggested.",
      "\"On an annual basis on average that's $60 to 65 billion. We're not even close to trillions,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab also found that motor vehicle prices could rise by 13.5% on average for Americans, or an additional cost of $6,400 for an average new car.",
      "How much Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China could generate",
      "The same researchers found Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, which are slated to go into effect this week, along with the additional 20% tax on Chinese imports that the president has already put in place, could generate roughly $150 billion annually, or up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years. They also found the average household could lose $1,600 to $2,000 each year in inflation-adjusted disposable income as a result of higher prices.",
      "Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs previously made higher estimates that Trump's increased tariffs on these countries could generate roughly $300 billion in new income per year.",
      "Either would be a meaningful increase over the $88 billion in customs duties collected at ports of entry in 2024.",
      "However, economists argue there's a ceiling to tariff revenue that remains below $1 trillion per year.",
      "The U.S. imported about $3.3 trillion in foreign goods last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Peterson Institute of International Economics estimated that even if Mr. Trump were to apply a 50% tariff to foreign imports from every country \u2014 which exceeds his stated plans \u2014 it would generate at most about $780 billion annually.",
      "\"If you make something 50% more expensive, you don't expect people to buy the same amount,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",
      "Could tariff revenue replace income taxes?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of using his tariff agenda to offset or even replace income taxes.",
      "\"Under the American first economic model, as tariffs on other countries go up, taxes on American workers and businesses will come down,\" Trump said in a speech to the House GOP in January.",
      "Income taxes generate over $2 trillion per year, according to the Department of the Treasury. Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all imports, the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute.",
      "\"The problem is it can't raise anywhere near the amount of revenue you'd need to scuttle the income tax. And that's the really, I think, ironclad point,\" said Scott Lincicome, a vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian think tank.",
      "Historians on U.S. trade note that tariffs have not been viewed as a primary way to raise revenue since income taxes were introduced in 1913.",
      "In 2024, tariff collections on imports represented just 1.7% of the more than $4.9 trillion in total federal revenue. And according to the Congressional Research Service, tariffs have not accounted for much more than 2% of federal revenue in the last 70 years.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/takeaways-wisconsin-florida-elections/",
    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:57:12 -0400",
    "summary": "Here are the takeaways from a liberal's victory in Wisconsin and GOP wins in Florida races to succeed Mike Waltz and Matt Gaetz in Tuesday's elections.",
    "story": [
      "A closely watched election for a state supreme court judgeship in Wisconsin gave Democrats a boost Tuesday night, while two special elections in Florida delivered two seats to House Speaker Mike Johnson's perilously thin GOP majority. Though off-year and special elections attract a much smaller share of voters than presidential elections, the outcomes in both states held insights for Democrats and Republicans for the months ahead. Here are some of the takeaways:",
      "Wisconsin State Supreme Court race",
      "A setback for Trump and Musk",
      "Despite heavy financial backing from Elon Musk and groups tied to him \u2014 over $20 million \u2014 and an endorsement by President Trump, conservative candidate Brad Schimel lost by a 10-point margin to Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate in the race. Musk's infusion of millions failed to sway Wisconsin voters in this statewide judicial race, marking a notable political defeat in a battleground state that Trump narrowly flipped in 2024.",
      "Crawford ran primarily against Musk's involvement in the state \u2014 and national Democrats could convert this win into an early game plan heading into the gubernatorial races later this year, and the 2026 midterms.",
      "Record-breaking spending of over $90 million",
      "The race became the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history, with total spending exceeding $90 million and by some projections, reaching $100 million. This unprecedented influx of money \u2014 fueled by big-dollar donors on both sides of the race including Elon Musk, George Soros, JB Pritzker and others, underscores the growing nationalization and politicization of state judicial races and raises questions about the influence of outside interests on local races.",
      "In the battle of the billionaire donors waged in this judicial race, there was no bigger loser than Musk, who donated $3 million to the state GOP and groups associated with him spent more than $20 million. The efforts of the world's richest man also galvanized Democratic voters in Wisconsin to cast their ballot for Crawford according to Wisconsin Democrats.",
      "What Tuesday could mean for Musk's future political spending",
      "It will be worth watching how much the outcome impacts the way Musk invests his financial and political capital between now and the 2026 midterms, given the loss he sustained in the Wisconsin race.",
      "With Musk's help, Republicans won the White House and Senate in the 2024 election, while also maintaining control of the House. In the 2026 midterms, however, the GOP faces challenges in its quest to hold onto and build on its narrow House majority. The interest in Tuesday's race not just from voters, but also major Democratic donors, suggests a large influx of cash is likely to be invested in both sides at a time when the president's party is at risk of heavy losses amid pushback by voters.",
      "High voter engagement",
      "Turnout was exceptionally high for a spring election and a judicial race, potentially surpassing 2.4 million voters, far exceeding the 2023 state supreme court race, according to CBS News estimates. This surge, coupled with Crawford's strong performance in key areas like Dane County, indicates a strong mobilization among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, driven by concern about the policies of the new Trump administration and opposition to Musk's involvement.",
      "It also suggests broader interest from the Wisconsin electorate about judicial independence on issues like abortion rights and congressional redistricting.",
      "Liberal majority on Wisconsin State Supreme Court retained",
      "Crawford's victory ensured that the Wisconsin Supreme Court maintained its 4-3 liberal majority. This outcome preserves the ideological balance of the state's highest court that has been in place since 2023.\u00a0 This has already led to significant rulings favoring progressive priorities, such as striking down Republican-drawn legislative maps and addressing voting rights issues.",
      "A boost for Democrats",
      "In speaking with national Democrats after the Wisconsin election results, they say that the win has boosted Democrats nationally as they contend with intraparty squabbling on the direction of the party going into the 2026 midterms. With the Badger State race as a referendum on Musk and Trump policies, the outcome of Tuesday's election could also serve as a cautionary tale for Republicans as they prepare for the 2025 gubernatorial races and 2026. To many they saw it as a referendum on voter enthusiasm.",
      "Trump touts voter ID win",
      "Despite Schimel's loss, President Trump posted on social media to highlight one win for conservatives: Wisconsin voters approved a measure to enshrine the state's voter ID requirement in the state constitution. The law, which already mandates showing a photo ID at the polls, now holds the added weight of a constitutional amendment.",
      "Florida special congressional elections",
      "Republican victories with narrower margins",
      "Republicans Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine won the 1st and 6th Districts in Florida Tuesday, respectively, maintaining GOP control of the deep-red seats vacated by Matt Gaetz and Michael Waltz. Their victories came with dramatically reduced margins compared to the 2024 general election a few months ago, however. Patronis defeated Gay Valimonti 57-42%, a 15-point margin, and Fine also won his race against Democrat Josh Weil with a 57-42% victory, a sharp drop from Waltz's 33-point victory in November.",
      "Democratic over-performance in fundraising",
      "Democrats outperformed expectations in two deep-red Florida districts on Tuesday, fueled by massive fundraising hauls that far surpassed their Republican opponents. Weil raised more than $9 million, while Valimont brought in roughly $6 million \u2014 numbers that helped make the races far more competitive than anticipated. Republicans held both seats, but with notably closer margins, underscoring the GOP's entrenched advantage in these Trump strongholds.",
      "Still, the Democratic contenders notched a symbolic victory when Valimont carried Escambia County \u2014 a longtime GOP stronghold in presidential elections \u2014 a rare blue dot in the ruby-red district.",
      "Trump's influence tested but intact",
      "Both Patronis and Fine benefited from Mr. Trump's endorsements and late campaign efforts, including tele-town halls and Truth Social posts, which helped secure their wins. Yet the closer-than-expected races, despite the president's personal involvement and his own overwhelming victories in these districts\u00a0 \u2014 68% in the 1st District and 65% in the 6th \u2014 hint at potential political vulnerabilities in his influence early in his second term, especially when Mr. Trump is not on the ballot. The results bolstered the GOP's slim House majority, now 220-213, but the tighter margins signal that Mr. Trump's sway may not be as absolute in off-cycle elections.",
      "Special elections for House remain a challenge for the opposing party",
      "Tuesday's results in Florida line up with CBS News' political unit's analysis this week that since Mr. Trump was first elected president in 2017, a seat has flipped in House special elections less than 15% of the time.",
      "Hunter Woodall\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:20:42 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has signed a string of executive orders in recent weeks targeting some of the nation's most prominent law firms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's string of executive orders in recent weeks that target major law firms mark the latest front in his effort to settle long-held scores with political opponents. But the broadside has been met with alarm about the damage the punishments could do to the viability of the firms and, crucially, the threat they pose to the rule of law.",
      "The executive orders signed by Mr. Trump have so far targeted four law firms: Perkins Coie, Paul Weiss, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, and Jenner & Block. But the directive targeting Paul Weiss was rescinded after it and Mr. Trump reached an agreement under which the firm agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services for causes that the administration supports, among other assurances.",
      "A fifth firm, Covington & Burling, was the subject of a directive that targeted the security clearance of a lawyer who assisted former special counsel Jack Smith, who oversaw the two prosecutions of Mr. Trump that were dropped\u00a0after he was elected to a second term.",
      "Amid the president's targeting of some of the nation's most prominent firms, a split has begun to emerge among the legal community between those subject to punishment by Mr. Trump and a growing number that are entering into deals with the president.",
      "Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, entered into a preemptive deal with the president to provide more than $100 million in free legal work, along with other commitments, he announced last week. Then, on Tuesday, Mr. Trump\u00a0announced\u00a0an agreement with Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, where former second gentleman Doug Emhoff is a partner, in which the firm would offer at least $100 million in pro bono services. The firm also represented former\u00a0Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss in their lawsuit against Trump ally Rudy Giuliani.",
      "On Wednesday, the president said on social media that the firm Milbank LLP committed to performing at least $100 million in free legal work during the Trump administration and after on initiatives backed by the president and firm, and also made a series of other commitments.",
      "The executive orders are among the more than 100 that Mr. Trump has issued since returning to the White House for a second term, and they come amid a broader campaign of retribution against his critics that includes revoking security clearances and protective details.",
      "But legal scholars warn that the restrictions aimed at the law firms strike at the rule of law and the nation's adversarial system of justice.",
      "\"These orders do more than just take revenge against particular lawyers who have crossed Donald Trump,\" said Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. \"They are meant to send the message that it is dangerous to oppose him in court, that you are apt to suffer not just yourself, but also law firms that you're associated with will suffer sweeping penalties that can threaten their very ability to go on existing.\"",
      "The orders rolled out by Mr. Trump in the past few weeks target the firms for their legal work, as well as the lawyers who were on their payrolls \u2014 even if they're not anymore.",
      "In the case of Perkins Coie, the president's directive attacks the firm for representing Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "For WilmerHale and Jenner & Block, the orders seek to punish the firms because they hired lawyers who worked on the Justice Department's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election during Mr. Trump's first term. At WilmerHale, that includes Robert Mueller, the former special counsel who led that probe, and two lawyers who worked on his team, Aaron Zebley and James Quarles. Mueller and Quarles no longer work at WilmerHale. At Jenner & Block, the president attacked the firm for employing Andrew Weissmann, who also worked on Mueller's probe. He left Jenner & Block in 2021.",
      "Jenner & Block, WilmerHale and Perkins Coie are also involved in legal challenges to Mr. Trump's second-term policies, including his effort to withhold federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to young people under the age of 19, his firing of eight inspectors general and directive to prohibit transgender people from serving in the military.",
      "\"These firms are at the vanguard of fighting the Trump administration on a whole host of issues,\" said David Lat, a lawyer-turned-writer who authors a newsletter on legal affairs. \"So, if Donald Trump can force or frighten law firms into not taking cases against his administration, that will allow the administration to become more powerful.\"",
      "Lat likened the executive orders to a boxing match where one fighter is trying to chop the arms off of their opponent.",
      "\"In America, our legal system rests on the idea that you are entitled to a lawyer, and these executive orders are deterring law firms and lawyers from taking certain cases,\" he said. \"The other issue is they are a threat to the rule of law, and they are a threat to the adversarial system that powers our justice system.\"",
      "Mr. Trump justified the orders as furthering his administration's commitment to addressing the \"significant risks\" associated with \"Big Law firms,\" which he claims \"engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests.\"",
      "The president's orders specifically require any government contractors to disclose any business they have with the firms and also direct agency heads to cancel any contracts with the targets of the orders. Agencies also must reassess contracts with the firms or companies that do business with them to ensure funding decisions align \"with the interests of the citizens of the United States\" and administration priorities.",
      "Finally, Mr. Trump's executive actions calls on his administration to restrict access to federal buildings for employees of Perkins Coie, WilmerHale and Jenner & Block.",
      "The three firms have all filed federal lawsuits challenging the orders as violations of the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.",
      "\"This lawsuit is absolutely critical to vindicating the First Amendment, our adversarial system of justice, and the rule of law,\" Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush and has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court, said in a statement. Clement is representing WilmerHale in its challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "Three different judges assigned to each of the cases \u2014 appointed by two different presidents \u2014 have agreed to temporarily block portions of the orders while proceedings move forward. While the cases may end with a decision from the Supreme Court months from now that invalidates the directives as unconstitutional, the fallout has been swift.",
      "Thomas Perrelli, firm chair and a partner at Jenner & Block, said in a declaration last week that one client was notified by the Justice Department that they could not bring their lawyers from the firm to a department meeting set for April 3. That client, Perrelli wrote, would've had to attend the meeting without their outside representation or hire new counsel. A federal district court blocked enforcement of the portion of Mr. Trump's order restricting Jenner & Block employees' access to federal buildings and the requirements for government contractors.",
      "He also wrote that 40% of the firm's revenue last year came from clients who are government contractors or subcontractors, and warned that if the firm lost that business, \"it would be a serious threat to the firm's financial health.\"",
      "Bruce Berman, general counsel at WilmerHale, wrote in his own declaration that at least 21 of the firm's 25 largest clients in 2024 \u2014 which accounted for 30% of its revenue, or nearly $500 million \u2014 have federal contracts. He noted that WilmerHale attorneys are set to meet with Justice Department lawyers over videoconference this week, but said at the time of his filing that it was uncertain whether they would refuse to meet with them.",
      "At Perkins Coie, David Burman, a partner at the firm, told a federal court in a filing that several clients terminated or said they were considering ending their legal engagements because of the restrictions imposed by Mr. Trump's order. Burman said that a major government contractor that had been a client for more than 35 years withdrew its work from Perkins Coie in light of the order, and four other clients rescinded its work from the firm early last month because they needed to engage with federal agencies.",
      "\"The orders don't have to go into effect for them to strike fear in the hearts of lawyers across the country,\" Lat said, adding that while law firms are wealthy, they can also be fragile.",
      "For many so-called \"Big Law\" firms, their work involves serving not only individuals, but also large corporations that seek help with patent or trademark applications, mergers and acquisitions or energy transactions \u2014 areas that land before a federal regulatory agency.",
      "But a swift departure of those clients means firms are at risk of losing sizable chunks of business at once, which could also force their lawyers to leave if their practice area involves significant government involvement.",
      "\"These firms can face a run of clients against them the same way the banks can face a run of depositors trying to take out their money at once,\" Olson said. \"This can quickly turn into a downward spiral.\"",
      "The potential damage to their business \u2014 and the ripple effect that would have on employees \u2014 may be why some law firms have remained on the sidelines and chosen not to speak out against Mr. Trump's sanctions. Olson acknowledged there are many reasons why other firms may want to stay out of the president's sight line for fear of retaliation.",
      "But he said that an \"age-old part of being a free republic\" is protecting the independence of the court and the legal profession so they don't become instruments of the person in power.",
      "\"Sometimes the times call for courage,\" Olson said. \"Are you recognizing that this is one of those times that the ordinary calculations aren't good enough, the calculations that would do against many ordinary sorts of danger? This is an extraordinary danger. Maybe it calls for extraordinary courage.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump is considering announcing the creation of what he calls the \"External Revenue Service\" on Wednesday as the White House launches his new trade agenda and collects tariff revenues from around the globe, according to sources familiar with the planning.",
      "Mr. Trump is also aiming to again alter Washington's trade relationship with Beijing, and will likely charge tariffs on low-value merchandise shipped from China to individual U.S. consumers.",
      "Details of Mr. Trump's final decision were unclear as of Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Mr. Trump has considered attaching a fee of $25 on low-value packages from China, one of the sources told CBS News. White House spokespeople didn't answer requests for comment. It wasn't clear what levy the president chose.",
      "Currently, a U.S. loophole allows duty-free shipments of Chinese goods worth less than $800.",
      "It has enabled Chinese e-commerce companies such as Shein and Temu to skirt import fees. The practice has undercut other retailers, including American firms, that must pay those fees when buying product in bulk. The so-called de minimis exemption is limited to one shipment per person per day.",
      "The changes, if adopted, would put a pinch on the online shopping habits of American consumers seeking clothing, household products and other goods from China at ultra low prices.",
      "The president is scheduled to hold an event in the Rose Garden at 4 p.m. to herald his tariffs strategy.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously described his idea for the External Revenue Service \u2013 meant to be a play on the unpopular domestic tax collection agency \u2013 as an arm of government \"to collect tariffs, duties, and all revenue that come from foreign sources.\"",
      "In February, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump's goal was \"very simple.\" It was to \"abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the outsiders pay,\" he said on \"Jesse Watters Primetime\" on Fox News.",
      "The practicalities of fully replacing the income tax with tariff revenue, a drastic economic overhaul, would be complex. Abolishing the IRS would require an act of Congress.",
      "Collecting tariffs on goods at ports of entry is currently the responsibility of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Whether the new External Revenue Service would fully assume those duties is unclear, and its establishment could undercut Mr. Trump's promise of shrinking the federal bureaucracy.",
      "The staggering volume of packages from direct-to-consumer Chinese retailers shipped under the de minimis exemption have raised concerns about fentanyl, and other illicit drugs, and counterfeit goods slipping past U.S. screeners.",
      "The Trump administration targeted cheap products from Chinese retailers a couple months ago, but reversed course amid problems and confusion.",
      "Tariffs on the merchandise shipments that took effect on Feb. 4 were partially rolled back on Feb. 7 after packages piled up at ports of entry. The U.S. Postal Service temporarily paused all small-value deliveries from China and Taiwan as it tried to figure out how to collect the duties.",
      "The White House has invited steel and autoworkers to Wednesday's tariffs announcement, as well as most of Mr. Trump's cabinet, officials told CBS News. Several members of Congress were also on the guest list, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Sens. Bill Hagerty and Bernie Moreno.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-carolinas-attempt-to-strip-planned-parenthood-of-medicaid-funding-faces-supreme-court/",
    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 13:50:36 -0400",
    "summary": "South Carolina in 2018 moved to terminate a Planned Parenthood affiliate's participation in its state Medicaid program.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court weighed Wednesday a yearslong court fight over South Carolina's attempt to boot Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program and whether beneficiaries can sue to enforce their ability to see their preferred health care provider.",
      "South Carolina moved to withhold Medicaid funds from a Planned Parenthood affiliate in 2018, four years before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and left the issue of abortion policy to the states. But since that then, the landscape for abortion care has shifted drastically, with a\u00a0dozen states\u00a0enacting near-total bans on abortion and another four states, including South Carolina, outlawing the procedure after six weeks gestation.",
      "While Planned Parenthood provides abortion services outside of Medicaid as allowed under state laws, anti-abortion rights groups and lawmakers at the state and federal levels have long been working to keep public health dollars away from the group. Its clinics also offer contraception, pregnancy testing, gender-affirming care and screenings for cancer and conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure.",
      "The question in the case is a technical one: whether Medicaid beneficiaries can sue to enforce a provision of the Medicaid Act that allows them to seek care from the qualified and willing provider of their choosing. But if South Carolina prevails in the dispute, it could pave the way for more states to defund Planned Parenthood through their state Medicaid plans.",
      "The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, appeared divided over whether Medicaid recipients can sue under a federal civil rights law to enforce the provision, known as the any-qualified provider requirement.",
      "\"We need something that's out of the ordinary that signals to the federal court, this is not just something that the state must do, this is something that allows the individual to go into court and get enforcement,\" Justice Samuel Alito said of a statute's language.",
      "But Justice Elena Kagan warned that if the Supreme Court were to accept South Carolina's argument that a statute must include words such as right, privilege or entitlement in order to allow an individual to file a suit to enforce it, it is \"changing the rules midstream.\"",
      "Nicole Saharsky, who argued on behalf of Planned Parenthood, told the justices that South Carolina is trying to disqualify a provider from its Medicaid program for reasons that are unrelated to its medical qualifications. It has been established that the state violated Medicaid patients' ability to choose their own doctor, \"the only question is whether she can do something about it,\" she said.",
      "\"Congress expected that an individual would be able to sue in the rare instance when a state is keeping a needy patient away from a qualified and willing provider,\" Saharsky said. \"If the individual can't sue, this provision will be meaningless.\"",
      "The legal battle over Planned Parenthood's funding in South Carolina began in July 2018, when Gov. Henry McMaster issued an executive order directing the state's health department to deem abortion providers unqualified to provide family-planning services under Medicaid and terminate enrollment agreements.",
      "Federal law prohibits Medicaid from paying for abortions except in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother. But the state argued that because money is fungible, giving Medicaid dollars to abortion providers frees up other money to provide the procedure.",
      "The South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services notified Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, which has clinics in Charleston and Columbia, that its provider agreements were being cancelled because it was no longer qualified to provide services to Medicaid recipients.",
      "Planned Parenthood South Atlantic offers prenatal and postpartum services, as well as cancer screenings, physical exams and screenings for health conditions and cancer. But the state says that there are more than 140 other federally qualified health clinics and pregnancy centers across South Carolina who accept Medicaid and can provide services to low-income patients.",
      "Nearly 20% of South Carolina residents are insured through Medicaid, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, and 25% of its residents live in medically underserved areas.",
      "After Planned Parenthood was disqualified from participating in South Carolina's Medicaid program, Julie Edwards, a patient who received health services from the Planned Parenthood affiliate, and the organization filed a lawsuit challenging the state's termination decision.",
      "Edwards alleged in her lawsuit that the state's cancellation of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic's agreement violated her right to choose her provider under the Medicaid Act and asked a federal district court to issue an order allowing her and other patients to continue receiving care from Planned Parenthood.",
      "The district court sided with Edwards, finding that Medicaid patients can sue to obtain health care services from their preferred qualified and willing provider. The court also held that South Carolina likely violated the any-qualified provider requirement by terminating Planned Parenthood's participation in the state Medicaid program without cause.",
      "A federal appeals court on numerous different occasions concluded that Edwards' had a right to sue and blocked South Carolina from excluding Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program. The Supreme Court agreed in December to take up South Carolina's appeal.",
      "Defenders of South Carolina's move have argued that states are better suited to decide where to spend the Medicaid dollars they receive from the federal government, which they said leads to better treatment for low-income patients and their families.",
      "\"You've got roughly 200 publicly funded health care clinics in South Carolina that provide a broad range of high-quality health care services, including family-planning services,\" said John Bursch, a lawyer with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group. Bursch is arguing on behalf of South Carolina at the Supreme Court.",
      "He continued, \"South Carolina is entitled to decide that there are better options, and that's exactly what it's done.\"",
      "Bursch told the justices during oral arguments that Congress knows how to write legislation that clearly grants a private right that can be enforced through the courts, as it has done so in other statutes. But the provision at issue in the case involving Planned Parenthood doesn't use the word \"right\" or similar words like \"privilege\" or \"entitlement.\"",
      "\"If there is any ambiguity in this context, the state has to win because it's not put on notice of when it might be sued,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, putting states on clear notice requires explicit rights-creating language.\"",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that the goal is to provide clear guidance for courts to follow.",
      "\"I'm not allergic to magic words because magic words, if they represent the principle, will provide the clarity that will avoid the litigation that is a huge waste of resources for states, courts, providers, beneficiaries and Congress,\" he said.",
      "Several states have taken steps to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funding, including Texas, Mississippi, Missouri and Arkansas. Two federal appeals courts, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, ruled that Medicaid patients do not have a right to sue over the state's decision to exclude Planned Parenthood from states' Medicaid programs.",
      "But several other appeals courts have blocked state efforts to cut off the organization from Medicaid dollars. If the Supreme Court rules for South Carolina, it would clear the way for more states to exclude Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs.",
      "\"The reason why they would do that is pretty simple,\" Bursch said. \"Many Americans don't want their tax dollars propping up the abortion industry, especially when those dollars can be better spent on real health care.\"",
      "But Saharsky said that Congress' goal when writing the law was to stop states from excluding Medicaid providers from their programs arbitrarily, which she said South Carolina is doing with its effort to stop Planned Parenthood from receiving public health dollars. While Saharsky noted that a state would receive significant deference if it disqualified a provider from its Medicaid program because of questions of medical competence, she said that is not what is at issue in this case.",
      "\"It is only that there is something Planned Parenthood is doing outside of Medicaid that the state wants to disqualify it from the program,\" she said.",
      "Kagan warned that if states were allowed to provide their own justifications for terminating Medicaid provider agreements without the potential for recourse by patients, it would pave the way for states to \"split up the world by providers.\"",
      "\"That does not seem what this statute is all about, is allowing states to do that and then giving individuals no ability to come back and say, 'that's wrong. I'm entitled to see my provider of choice regardless of what they think about contraception or abortion or gender-transition treatment,'\" she said.",
      "Before the arguments, Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy at the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights research organization, said at stake in the case is the ability of Medicaid beneficiaries to get the health care they need from the provider they know and trust.",
      "\"A loss in this case not only means that Medicaid patients in South Carolina would be unable to access Planned Parenthood, the ripple effect of that could mean that Medicaid patients across the country and particularly in states that might be inclined to want to restrict Medicaid recipients' ability to get care, it could affect all of those folks, and it fundamentally affects their ability to access really needed reproductive health care services that Planned Parenthood provides,\" she said.",
      "Friedrich-Karnik also said that a win for South Carolina would encourage the Trump administration to urge states to kick Planned Parenthood off state Medicaid plans.",
      "\"It emboldens the federal government, and it emboldens state governments who would like to restrict people's access in this way to do so,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration is backing South Carolina in the case and warned that a decision affirming the lower courts would invite a flood of litigation as beneficiaries seek to enforce other provisions of the Medicaid law and other statutes.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned what would flow from a ruling that allowed Medicaid recipients to bring lawsuits to enforce the any-provider provision.",
      "\"We're here because of Planned Parenthood not being a qualified provider in South Carolina, but would this open the floodgates of people bringing\" lawsuits because they can't see the provider of their choice, she asked Kyle Hawkins, counselor to the solicitor general, who argued for the federal government.",
      "Separately, Project 2025, the policy blueprint overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation, calls on the Department of Health and Human Services to limit Planned Parenthood's funding through Medicaid in part by issuing guidance reemphasizing that states can strip the group of its public dollars in state plans.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June.",

    "story": [
      "A wealthy Chinese-born bitcoin entrepreneur, a Norwegian cinematographer, a German robotics expert and an Australian adventurer blasted off atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket Monday, kicking off the first crewed flight over the North and South poles.",
      "Using a first stage booster making its sixth fight \u2014  another first for a Crew Dragon \u2014 liftoff from historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center came on time at 9:46 p.m. EDT.",
      "Lighting up the night sky, the Falcon 9 initially climbed straight up and then arced over onto a due south trajectory along Florida's east coast before soaring out over the Gulf on a course carrying it above Cuba and Panama toward a polar orbit.",
      "After dropping off the first stage for a successful droneship landing, the rocket's upper stage shut down 10 minutes after liftoff and the Crew Dragon was released to fly on its own. It is expected to fly over the North and South Poles 55 times between Monday night and splashdown Friday in the Pacific Ocean.",
      "\"On behalf of the SpaceX team, we're honored to deliver you safely to your polar orbit,\" radioed Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's former director of space operations and now a senior manager at SpaceX. \"Enjoy the views of the poles, send us some pictures. Our hearts and our minds will be flying with you ... Have a great flight.\"",
      "Who are the private adventurers on the Fram2 mission?",
      "Chun Wang, a Chinese-born citizen of Malta who lives mostly in the extreme north of Norway, paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount to charter the Crew Dragon \"Resilience\" for a trip in polar orbit. The deal marks SpaceX's third privately funded civilian space tourism flight.",
      "\"My own journey has been shaped by lifelong curiosity and a fascination with pushing boundaries,\" Chun (pronounced choon) told reporters Friday. \"As a kid, I used to stare at a blank white space at the bottom of a world map and wonder what's out there.",
      "\"Curiosity eventually took me across the continent and to the southern most tip of Earth in 2021, and also the North Pole in 2023, and now, soon, into space.\" The flight, he added, \"isn't just about going to space. It's about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge ... and we hope our mission will further inspire later people to do the same.\"",
      "Chun named the mission after the 19th century sailing ship Fram \u2014 \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic pioneers to the polar regions in the 1800s. A small piece of Fram's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"Pretty wild to see the Fram adventurers sailing to the poles once again, over 130 years from (the original ship's) christening,\" SpaceX's launch director radioed the crew. \"This time, though, with Starlink. Cheers.\"",
      "A veteran world traveler, Chun offered the Crew Dragon's three other seats to a trio of explorers he met during a recent polar trip. Jannicke Mikkelsen, a Norwegian cinematographer, is the designated vehicle commander, joined by German roboticist Rabea Rogge as the mission pilot.",
      "The fourth member of the crew is Australian Eric Philips, a professional polar tour guide, adventurer and veteran of some 30 trips to the North and South poles. He is serving as the crew's medical officer.",
      "Some might view the crew as seasoned adventurers and now, space tourists. In an interview with CBS News, Mikkelsen made it clear the crew is well qualified, but she said \"space tourists\" doesn't reflect the extensive training required by SpaceX.",
      "\"I wish it was tourism,\" she said. \"But our education has lasted well over a year, so I have never studied so hard for a three-and-a-half-day expedition in my life.\"",
      "History of private space flights",
      "Chun said he was inspired to book the mission by the example set by entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, the billionaire who chartered SpaceX's first two fully commercial missions, and fellow billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, who flew to the International Space Station aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "\"I owe my inspiration to Jared,\" Chun posted on X. \"If it weren't for @yousuckMZ and @rookisaacman taking the first step, I would have never had the courage to book an entire spaceship and bring along three people I had only met once before. I also copied many good practices from his previous missions \u2014 hope he doesn't mind.\"",
      "Isaacman, who owns and flies a Russian fighter jet, is the Trump administration's nominee to serve as NASA's next administrator.",
      "Unlike Isaacman, no one on the Fram2 mission is a licensed pilot. While Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one crew member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "SpaceX says Fram2 will help refine training procedures aimed at opening up spaceflight to more and more non-professionals.",
      "\"As a roboticist, I'm so hyped about Dragon being an autonomous vehicle which really, I think, shows you how much times are changing in the space sector,\" Rogge said. \"We are really at a crucial point in time where the spacecraft does so many of the tasks itself.",
      "\"I think that really spearheads the accessibility to space, right? Because the dream is (to) have many people in space if we want to live and work there as a civilization.\"",
      "She added, \"right now I think the stereotype of an astronaut is that, you know, super, super, super human, medically perfect. But we should really flip this question and be like, OK, how do we design living and working in space for everyone?\"",
      "Plans for orbiting around the poles",
      "The crew plans to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew is equipped with four iPad Minis, two iPhone Pro Max cellphones, three laptop computers, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Also on board: a Starlink laser terminal mounted in the Crew Dragon's lower trunk section that will give the crew, in theory, data relay speeds of up to 100 gigabytes per second or better.",
      "To reach the planned orbit around the poles, one tilted 90 degrees to Earth's equator, the flight plan called for the Falcon 9 to follow a due-south trajectory carrying the crew above southern Florida, Cuba and Panama on the way to space. The 273-mile-high orbit will allow 55 passes above the poles between launch and splashdown.",
      "Jon Edwards, a SpaceX vice president who oversee Falcon 9 flight operations, said the Crew Dragon's flight software was modified to ensure the vehicle passes safely over populated areas, guiding the rocket as needed to keep the capsule or other components well away from any populated areas in an emergency.",
      "\"We're going to fly out of 39A in Florida and go pretty much straight south,\" Edwards said. \"In fact, the flight path is going to go over Florida. If you were in Miami and you looked straight up, you know, at the right time. would see the rocket and the crew flying right overhead.",
      "\"What we call the instantaneous impact points, which is where, if we cut power, it would land, that will stay offshore, so it's totally safe to do this. But it will be flying over Florida and over Cuba and Panama and just to the west of Peru and Ecuador.\"",
      "NASA and the U.S. Space Force routinely launch military satellites and science probes into polar orbits from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, where rockets can fly due south over the Pacific Ocean without passing over populated areas.",
      "But the maximum inclination for orbital payloads launched from the East Coast has traditionally been limited to avoid flying over areas where debris from a catastrophic failure might fall. In recent years, SpaceX has launched satellites into polar or near-polar orbits from Cape Canaveral, but no piloted flights.",
      "While NASA and the Air Force once planned to launch space shuttles into polar orbit from Vandenberg, the military space program changed priorities in the wake of the 1986 Challenge disaster and those plans were shelved six months before the initial flight.",
      "The polar orbit will provide spectacular views for the Fram2 crew that Mikkelsen plans to document, from the ice caps to shimmering auroras. The public is invited to share the experience, photographing auroras at the same time Fram2 is capturing the view from space.",
      "\"We have reached out to 2.2 million auroral citizen scientists,\" she said. \"And anyone can join, where you go outside if there is aurora where you live and you note where you live and you ... take a photo of the aurora at the same time as we and Fram2 fly over.",
      "\"Local observatories are also activating their instruments so that we get this incredible data bank during our mission of the aurora from Earth and from space at the same time so we can understand ... what the phenomena can bring to humankind and specifically to satellite technology.\"",

      "\"Curiosity eventually took me across the continent and to the southern most tip of Earth in 2021, and also the North Pole in 2023, and now, soon, into space.\" The flight, he added, \"isn't just about going to space. It's about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge ... and we hope our mission will further inspire later people to do the same.\"",
      "Chun named the mission after the 19th century sailing ship Fram \u2014 \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic pioneers to the polar regions in the 1800s. A small piece of Fram's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"Pretty wild to see the Fram adventurers sailing to the poles once again, over 130 years from (the original ship's) christening,\" SpaceX's launch director radioed the crew. \"This time, though, with Starlink. Cheers.\"",
      "A veteran world traveler, Chun offered the Crew Dragon's three other seats to a trio of explorers he met during a recent polar trip. Jannicke Mikkelsen, a Norwegian cinematographer, is the designated vehicle commander, joined by German roboticist Rabea Rogge as the mission pilot.",
      "The fourth member of the crew is Australian Eric Philips, a professional polar tour guide, adventurer and veteran of some 30 trips to the North and South poles. He is serving as the crew's medical officer.",
      "Some might view the crew as seasoned adventurers and now, space tourists. In an interview with CBS News, Mikkelsen made it clear the crew is well qualified, but she said \"space tourists\" doesn't reflect the extensive training required by SpaceX.",
      "\"I wish it was tourism,\" she said. \"But our education has lasted well over a year, so I have never studied so hard for a three-and-a-half-day expedition in my life.\"",
      "History of private space flights",
      "Chun said he was inspired to book the mission by the example set by entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, the billionaire who chartered SpaceX's first two fully commercial missions, and fellow billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, who flew to the International Space Station aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "\"I owe my inspiration to Jared,\" Chun posted on X. \"If it weren't for @yousuckMZ and @rookisaacman taking the first step, I would have never had the courage to book an entire spaceship and bring along three people I had only met once before. I also copied many good practices from his previous missions \u2014 hope he doesn't mind.\"",
      "Isaacman, who owns and flies a Russian fighter jet, is the Trump administration's nominee to serve as NASA's next administrator.",
      "Unlike Isaacman, no one on the Fram2 mission is a licensed pilot. While Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one crew member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "SpaceX says Fram2 will help refine training procedures aimed at opening up spaceflight to more and more non-professionals.",
      "\"As a roboticist, I'm so hyped about Dragon being an autonomous vehicle which really, I think, shows you how much times are changing in the space sector,\" Rogge said. \"We are really at a crucial point in time where the spacecraft does so many of the tasks itself.",
      "\"I think that really spearheads the accessibility to space, right? Because the dream is (to) have many people in space if we want to live and work there as a civilization.\"",
      "She added, \"right now I think the stereotype of an astronaut is that, you know, super, super, super human, medically perfect. But we should really flip this question and be like, OK, how do we design living and working in space for everyone?\"",
      "Plans for orbiting around the poles",
      "The crew plans to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew is equipped with four iPad Minis, two iPhone Pro Max cellphones, three laptop computers, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Also on board: a Starlink laser terminal mounted in the Crew Dragon's lower trunk section that will give the crew, in theory, data relay speeds of up to 100 gigabytes per second or better.",
      "To reach the planned orbit around the poles, one tilted 90 degrees to Earth's equator, the flight plan called for the Falcon 9 to follow a due-south trajectory carrying the crew above southern Florida, Cuba and Panama on the way to space. The 273-mile-high orbit will allow 55 passes above the poles between launch and splashdown.",
      "Jon Edwards, a SpaceX vice president who oversee Falcon 9 flight operations, said the Crew Dragon's flight software was modified to ensure the vehicle passes safely over populated areas, guiding the rocket as needed to keep the capsule or other components well away from any populated areas in an emergency.",
      "\"We're going to fly out of 39A in Florida and go pretty much straight south,\" Edwards said. \"In fact, the flight path is going to go over Florida. If you were in Miami and you looked straight up, you know, at the right time. would see the rocket and the crew flying right overhead.",
      "\"What we call the instantaneous impact points, which is where, if we cut power, it would land, that will stay offshore, so it's totally safe to do this. But it will be flying over Florida and over Cuba and Panama and just to the west of Peru and Ecuador.\"",
      "NASA and the U.S. Space Force routinely launch military satellites and science probes into polar orbits from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, where rockets can fly due south over the Pacific Ocean without passing over populated areas.",
      "But the maximum inclination for orbital payloads launched from the East Coast has traditionally been limited to avoid flying over areas where debris from a catastrophic failure might fall. In recent years, SpaceX has launched satellites into polar or near-polar orbits from Cape Canaveral, but no piloted flights.",
      "While NASA and the Air Force once planned to launch space shuttles into polar orbit from Vandenberg, the military space program changed priorities in the wake of the 1986 Challenge disaster and those plans were shelved six months before the initial flight.",
      "The polar orbit will provide spectacular views for the Fram2 crew that Mikkelsen plans to document, from the ice caps to shimmering auroras. The public is invited to share the experience, photographing auroras at the same time Fram2 is capturing the view from space.",
      "\"We have reached out to 2.2 million auroral citizen scientists,\" she said. \"And anyone can join, where you go outside if there is aurora where you live and you note where you live and you ... take a photo of the aurora at the same time as we and Fram2 fly over.",
      "\"Local observatories are also activating their instruments so that we get this incredible data bank during our mission of the aurora from Earth and from space at the same time so we can understand ... what the phenomena can bring to humankind and specifically to satellite technology.\"",
      "Chun said the Fram2 mission is expected to last three days and 14 hours from launch to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stuck-astronauts-speak-out-after-return/",
    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 20:30:56 -0400",
    "summary": "NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, who were stuck in space for more than nine months, took questions after returning to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, speaking out at a news conference for the first time since returning to Earth after an extended 286-day stay in space, said Monday they did not blame Boeing for the spacecraft problems that effectively stranded them aboard the International Space Station.",
      "In fact, asked if he would fly again aboard the Starliner, Wilmore said, \"Yes, because we're going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. We're going to fix them. We're going to make it work. Boeing is completely committed. NASA is completely committed, and with that, I'd get on in a heartbeat.\"",
      "Added Williams: \"I would agree. The spacecraft is really capable. There were a couple things that need to be fixed ... and folks are actively working on that, but it is a great spacecraft, and it has a lot of capability that other spacecraft don't have. To see that thing successful and to be part of that program is an honor.\"",
      "Asked if he blamed Boeing for the propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems that ultimately led NASA to bring the Starliner down without its crew, extending their stay aboard the space station from eight days to more than nine-and-a-half months, Wilmore said, \"That is a question that I cannot answer in a couple of comments. But I'll start with me.\"",
      "\"There were questions that I, as the commander of the spacecraft, that I should have asked, and I did not. At the time, I didn't know I needed to. And maybe you could call that hindsight, but I'll start and point the finger and I'll blame me. I could have asked some questions and the answers to those questions could have turned the tide.",
      "\"So blame, I don't like that term, but certainly there's responsibility throughout all the programs and certainly you can start with me. Responsibility with Boeing? Yes. Responsibility with NASA? Yes. All the way up and down the chain. We all are responsible. We all own this.\"",
      "Their repeatedly extended mission generated enormous attention in the wake of problems with Starliner, NASA's decision three months after launch to keep them in orbit until this year, and comments from President Trump claiming the astronauts had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "Williams denied feeling \"abandoned\" or \"stuck\" during an interview with CBS News in February, saying she was \"honored ... to be here and a part of the team\" doing \"world-class science.\" They said much of the same Monday. But they avoided answering questions about the political aspects of the mission.",
      "Wilmore and Williams returned to Earth on March 18, accompanied by two outgoing station fliers who were wrapping up their own six-month stay aboard the lab. The Starliner astronauts, like all returning station fliers, began physical therapy back at the Johnson Space Center to help them readjust to gravity.",
      "They both looked fit and were in obviously good spirits talking with reporters Monday. In fact, Williams said she went for a 3-mile run on Sunday.",
      "How long were the astronauts stuck in space?",
      "By the time they splashed down off Florida's Gulf Coast, Wilmore and Williams had spent 286 days in space.",
      "While the extended mission was much longer than originally planned, it ranks sixth on the list of longest flights by U.S. astronauts.",
      "The record is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, whose planned six-month stay aboard the space station was extended to just over a full year \u2014 371 days \u2014 because of coolant leaks in the Russian Soyuz that carried him to orbit. He came back to Earth aboard a replacement Soyuz in September 2023.",
      "Even though his record remains unbroken, problems with the Boeing Starliner that carried Wilmore and Williams to space triggered extensive coverage in the United States that far exceeded the coverage of Rubio's even longer mission.",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck in space so long?",
      "Three years after the space shuttle's retirement in 2011, NASA awarded multibillion-dollar contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to build ferry ships to carry astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX has now launched 11 piloted Crew Dragon flights for NASA and five purely commercial missions. A sixth commercial launch is currently scheduled for Monday night.",
      "But Boeing ran into multiple problems with its Starliner that required two unpiloted test flights before Wilmore, who is 62, and Williams, 59, both former military test pilots, were finally cleared to launch last June 5 on the spacecraft's first piloted mission after engineers decided a small helium leak in the ship's propulsion pressurization system would not get worse.",
      "The astronauts successfully docked with the space station the next day, but the Starliner experienced additional helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "While the flight originally was expected to last about eight days, NASA and Boeing carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine what caused the problems and whether the spacecraft could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could, in fact, safely come home in the Starliner.",
      "But NASA managers eventually ruled out that option and decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year when they could hitch a ride home aboard a Crew Dragon. That spacecraft was launched last September with just two crew members on board, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner, meanwhile, successfully returned to Earth earlier in September, kicking off hands-on troubleshooting and ongoing work to prepare for the eventual resumption of flights.",
      "Wilmore, Williams, Crew 9 Dragon commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov originally planned to return to Earth in February. But the Crew 10 Dragon needed to carry their replacements to the station ran into problems of its own and the flight was delayed to the end of March.",
      "Those problems, and the threat of additional delays, prompted NASA to switch the Crew 10 fliers to a different Crew Dragon, eventually moving its launch up to March 12, paving the way for Crew 9 to head home.",

      "Amazon has told the White House it is interested in buying TikTok ahead of a key deadline by which its parent company, China-based ByteDance, must either sell the popular social media app or face a ban in the U.S., CBS News has learned, according to two people familiar with discussions.",
      "Amazon has submitted a bid for the app, the\u00a0New York Times reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter. Another plan under consideration is for a new entity backed by U.S. companies like BlackRock and Oracle to lease TikTok's algorithm from ByteDance, according to a source familiar with the situation.",
      "Both Amazon and TikTok declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the New York Times reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Air Force One over the weekend, Mr. Trump addressed the matter of TikTok's sale, saying, \"We have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.\"",

Pre-orders in the U.S., however, will not start April 9 as expected \"in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,\" Nintendo said, promising to update timing soon.",
      "At its 60-minute Nintendo Direct presentation, the company revealed a more vibrant display on the Switch 2, a larger screen and several games that will launch with the console.",

      "Third-party exclusives likely to create some buzz include Koei-Tecmo's \"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,\" a hack-and-slash prequel to \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,\" coming this winter. From Software's \"The Duskbloods,\" a baroque multiplayer title from the creators of Elden Ring, is scheduled for 2026.",
      "Miss the GameCube? Nintendo said Switch Online subscribers will be able to access a limited selection of GameCube titles such as \"The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\" and \"F-Zero GX.\"",
      "The new console will be backwards compatible \u2014 able to play physical and digital Switch games \u2014 but users will need to purchase a microSD express memory card for the Switch 2. The presentation revealed that normal SD cards will not be compatible with the system. However, data from the original Switch can be transferred to the new console using a transfer feature.",
      "The original Switch, released in 2017, is \"one of the most popular game consoles of all time,\" Scott Stein, editor-at-large at CNET,\u00a0told CBS News Boston in January.",
      "It became popular in part because of its unique design. Resembling a tablet, the device has detachable pieces on each side that can be used to control game play. It also allows users to continuing playing a game on a television screen when docked on a charging station, a first-of-its-kind feature at the time.",
      "But the original has aged, leading to some of the excitement for the new version, Stein said.",
      "\"There's a lot of stuff it does well but there's a lot of stuff that people I think want it to do better for playing games they can play elsewhere,\" he said, noting the ability to take it on the go differentiates it from other gaming consoles.",
      "How much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?",
      "Nintendo will retail the Switch 2 for $449.99 at launch, which is significantly higher than the original Switch's $299 price tag. A separate bundle that includes the new \"Mario Kart World\" game will also be available for $499.99.",
      "Gene Park, a Washington Post reporter covering video games and gaming culture, told CBS News the console is \"a little pricey, but it is a more powerful system.\"",
      "He noted that the \"Mario Kart World\" game itself is priced at $80.",
      "\"It's a little eyebrow-raising. It's really the first Nintendo game to broach $80, and there's a lot of talk about video games becoming $100 right now,\" Park said.",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have hit the video game console industry at a fragile moment, said Joost van Dreunen, author of \"One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.",
      "\"At the beginning of a new hardware cycle, all of a sudden we're looking at this price hike,\" said van Dreunen, a games industry researcher. \"I had originally predicted that the Switch 2 would be $400. Now it's announced that it's $450. That $50 difference is a Trump tax.\"",
      "The tariffs, he said, impact games hardware because console devices are manufactured and shipped from China and that region at large.",
      "The early stages of a hardware life cycle are already very low margin, or usually a loss for hardware manufacturers, van Dreunen said. Those manufacturers typically eat the margin in order to get the devices out to stores.",
      "\"But with an increased tariff, that means that margin is probably even worse than it historically is. But their hands are kind of tied. They can't not progress. They can't not launch a new hardware generation. So for the consumer base, people are just going to pay more.\"",
      "The Consumer Technology Association also predicted President Trump's tariffs would drive up prices of video game consoles, and retailers like Best Buy have warned they may have to raise prices due to the tariffs.",
      "Nintendo plans to host \"Switch 2 Experience\" events in several countries, where gamers can get a hands-on experience with the new system. Those events are planned for cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris beginning this month.",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 10:24:33 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on about 90 countries, including China and the European Union. Here's the list.",
    "story": [
      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations will face only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries will be charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports will face the baseline rate of 10%, while China will face a 34% tariff.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his\u00a0Wednesday remarks.",
      "Asian nations will face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic. On top of China's 34% reciprocal tariff, imports from that nation will also face previously announced 20% tariffs, bringing that nation's total rate to more than 60%, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Full list of Trump's reciprocal tariffs by country",
      "When will these tariffs go into effect?",
      "The reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries likely to retaliate against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "For now, other countries are taking a more measured approach in their response. European Union trade chief Maros Sefcovic is scheduled to meet with U.S. officials on Friday after Mr. Trump hit the 27-nation bloc with a 20% tariff.",
      "Sefcovic told AFP Thursday the EU would act in \"a calm, carefully phased, unified way\" and allow time for talks, but he also warned the bloc \"won't stand idly by, should we be unable to reach a fair deal\".",

      "Asian stocks fell further Friday, though markets in Shanghai, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia were closed for holidays, limiting the extent of the day's declines, The Associated Press reported. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 2.8% while South Korea's Kospi sank 0.9%.",
      "European markets lost more ground, the AP said. Germany's DAX fell 2%. The CAC 40 in Paris was off 1.6%. And Britain's FTSE 100 declined 1.7%.",

      "Financial markets surged after Mr. Trump was re-elected in November, with Wall Street counting on lower taxes and deregulation to fuel corporate profits. Other investors bet on the Trump administration threatening tariffs mostly as a way to pressure other countries into making concessions on trade, rather than a full-fledged push to change the terms of global commerce.",
      "But after hitting all-time highs in February, stocks have turned tail as the White House makes clear it wasn't bluffing. Indeed, investors have been left stunned by the speed and scale of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",

Kennedy Jr.'s cuts to the nation's federal health agencies.",
      "In one example, a planned FDA exercise with a network of veterinary testing labs around the country to ensure they are able to detect the virus in milk has been suspended, due to the elimination of the agency's food safety lab in Illinois, two federal health officials said.",

The FDA lost around 3,500 full-time employees due to the layoffs, including staff supporting the agency's food and drug safety inspectors.",
      "\"This overhaul is about realigning HHS with its core mission: to stop the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again. Despite spending $1.9 trillion in annual costs, Americans are getting sicker every year, and we must shift course,\" an HHS official said in a statement.",

    "summary": "A new forecast from researchers at Colorado State University predicts the 2025 hurricane season will be busier than an average year.",
    "story": [
      "Researchers are predicting an above-average Atlantic hurricane season in 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but at the same time with\u00a0less intensity expected than last season. The annual prediction is closely watched in Florida and other coastal states at risk when hurricane season officially starts June 1.",
      "Experts at Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team estimate that nine hurricanes will occur over the course of the upcoming season, with 17 named storms overall.",
      "Four of the hurricanes are predicted to be major \u2014 meaning a\u00a0Category 3, 4 or 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Category 3 hurricanes are those with sustained winds that reach 111 to 129 miles per hour, enough to cause devastating damage. Category 4 hurricanes have sustained winds of 130 to 156 mph, and the most catastrophic Category 5 storms reach 157 mph or higher.",
      "Hurricane activity this year is expected to be roughly 125% higher than the 1991-2020 season average, according to the report. One of its authors, Levi Silvers, told CBS News that jump is significant, albeit slightly lower than the 2024 activity prediction, which was 130% higher than the 19-year average.",
      "\"It's a noticeable and important difference, because it matters for people along the coastlines whenever we have an above average season,\" Silvers said. \"But I think what's really important to understand here is that the amount of hurricanes that are occurring in the Atlantic and in the Gulf fluctuates a lot from decade to decade. As long as we've been paying attention to hurricanes, we've noticed that they fluctuate a lot from year to year.\"",
      "Warm sea surface temperatures were the primary driver for this year's above-average hurricane forecast. That was also the case in 2024, when Silvers said the measurement was \"off the charts.\"",
      "\"It was super warm, warmer than we've really seen before,\" he told CBS News, adding that, this year, \"they're still warmer than normal, but the temperatures have come down since last time. So that's one of the main factors, why we're forecasting less [activity] than last year, but it's still above average.\"",
      "The researchers' prediction recognizes that \"considerable uncertainty\" still exists as to the phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle. El Ni\u00f1o is the warmer half of the cycle, an alternating pattern of contrasting climate shifts defined by sea surface temperatures and precipitation in a block of the equatorial Pacific that depart from the neutral norm. La Ni\u00f1a, the inverse of El Ni\u00f1o, is the colder phase of ENSO.",
      "Weak La Ni\u00f1a conditions are currently present in that part of the tropical Pacific, but the CSU researchers said they anticipate those will transition to neutral conditions over the next couple of months. The likely absence of El Ni\u00f1o, which often is associated with conditions that disfavor hurricane activity, could mean the coming season is more conducive to hurricanes.",
      "\"We usually flip between El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, and we think that later in the season, it's going to be kind of neutral between the two of those,\" said Silvers. \"But we don't know for sure. That's actually one of the sources of uncertainty in our forecast. Trying to figure out if it's going to be a neutral state, or El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a is part of the challenge.\"",
      "Atlantic hurricane season happens annually in North America, beginning June 1 and ending November 30. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, scientists have pinpointed that timeframe as the window where hurricane activity peaks in the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Both Colorado State University and NOAA, the federal agency responsible for weather forecasts, release predictions each year before the season gets going. Usually their estimates\u00a0more or less align.",
      "Referencing recent\u00a0budget and staff cuts\u00a0at the federal agency, Silvers told CBS News that NOAA's data is integral to the university's research.",
      "\"A lot of what we do with this forecast is really fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe, but especially in the oceans,\" he said. \"And so it really would be pretty much impossible to get a good forecast for future hurricane seasons without NOAA's observational network.\"",
      "List of names for 2025 tropical storms and hurricanes",
      "Under a system maintained by the World Meteorological Organization, storms receive a name when they reach tropical storm strength, with sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Once winds reach 74 mph, the storm becomes a hurricane.",
      "The list of names for each season is determined in advance. For 2025, the first named storm of the year will be called Andrea, followed by Barry, Chantal, Dexter, Erin, Ferdinand, Gabrielle and on through the alphabet, ending with Wendy. (Q, U, X, Y and Z are excluded because there aren't enough names beginning with those letters.)",
      "If there continue to be more tropical storms after all 21 names on the list have been used, there is a supplemental list with another 21 names that would be assigned next.",

      "Amazon has submitted a bid for the app, the\u00a0New York Times reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter. Another plan under consideration is for a new entity backed by U.S. companies like BlackRock and Oracle to lease TikTok's algorithm from ByteDance, according to a source familiar with the situation.",
      "Both Amazon and TikTok declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the New York Times reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Air Force One over the weekend, Mr. Trump addressed the matter of TikTok's sale, saying, \"We have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.\"",
      "He added that he'd \"like to see TikTok remain alive.\"",
      "The U.S. government has said TikTok poses a threat to national security because its vast trove of customer data, including browsing patterns, locations and biometric information, could end up in the hands of the Chinese authorities.",
      "Ahead of the initial divestiture deadline, ByteDance earlier this year briefly shut down TikTok in the U.S. Mr. Trump quickly paused the ban and the service was restored.",
      "The ban does not target TikTok's U.S. users. But the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, signed into law in 2024 under former President Biden, would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores and web-hosting services to distribute or service TikTok.",

    "summary": "ICE agents took Turkish Ph.D. student Rumeysa Ozturk into custody near Tufts, revoked her visa and moved her to a detention center in Louisiana last week.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Boston considered Thursday a case involving a Tufts University Ph.D. student taken into custody in Massachusetts and moved by Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities to Louisiana last week.",
      "The government claimed in a filing Tuesday that Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student and Fulbright Scholar, had already been removed from Massachusetts before a judge issued an order for her to stay in the state, which prosecutors said strips the district court in Massachusetts of jurisdiction to hear the case.",
      "The Justice Department said in its filing that Ozturk had already been transferred to an ICE detention center in Basile, Louisiana.",
      "Attorneys for Ozturk had filed a habeas petition to block her removal from Massachusetts, as well as from the United States, and U.S. District Judge Denise Casper issued a new order several days after Ozturk was detained barring her removal from the U.S. to allow her to resolve the jurisdictional questions.",
      "Casper probed Ozturk's lawyers and the Justice Department about whether the habeas petition was filed in the appropriate venue, the court in Massachusetts, or whether the case should be transferred to Louisiana, where Ozturk is now being held. The student's lawyers are seeking an order that requires immigration officials to return Ozturk to Massachusetts and immediately release her while proceedings continue.",
      "She did not issue a decision on whether Ozturk's case should be moved, instead saying she was \"inclined to wrestle\" with the question.",
      "An attorney for the student argued that her whereabouts remained unknown to her lawyers in the hours after her arrest, and said not even the government's lawyers knew where she was, a situation Ozturk's attorney said it \"quite unusual.\"",
      "She accused immigration officials of ignoring the initial order preventing Ozturk's immediate removal out of Massachusetts and for failing to disclose her location to her lawyers.",
      "\"Here, we have a situation where it's the government that is forum shopping, that is whisking away a petitioner to its forum of choice and doing everything in its power to ensure that a habeas petition cannot be filed,\" the lawyer said.",
      "An acting Homeland Security Department official filed a sworn statement saying Ozturk was arrested on March 25 in Somerville, Massachusetts, where Tufts is located, and then moved to Lebanon, New Hampshire, then to St. Albans, Vermont, overnight. She was again moved at 4 a.m. on March 26 to Burlington, Vermont, before she was finally transferred to the ICE detention center in Basile. The court's order blocking her removal from Massachusetts was issued while Ozturk was in Vermont, and Ozturk's lawyers said her case could also be transferred there.",
      "A Justice Department lawyer sought to draw a distinction between Ozturk's lawyers not knowing where their client was, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement not being forthcoming about her location. He asked the court to dismiss Ozturk's petition outright or remove the case to Louisiana.",
      "\"ICE was still in the process of transferring her through Vermont at the time that the petition was filed,\" he said.",
      "The Justice Department said the decision to move Ozturk to Louisiana was made before she was taken into custody because there is no detention center in Massachusetts for a female detainee.",
      "Ozturk, who's in the U.S. on a student visa, was detained on her way to a Ramadan Iftar dinner on March 25. Surveillance footage showed six plainclothes ICE agents who appeared to be wearing masks stopping Ozturk on the street and taking her into custody.",
      "She's one of several students at American universities whose visas were revoked after they expressed support for Palestinians during the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Ozturk's attorneys argue her detention violates her constitutional rights to free speech and due process, and have asked for her immediate return to Massachusetts and for her to be freed from government custody.",
      "On Wednesday, Tufts president Sunil Kumar submitted a declaration defending Ozturk and supporting her motion regarding her release and return to Massachusetts. Kumar said the university \"has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention.\"",
      "He said that on March 26, the university received a notice stating that Ozturk was a \"'non-immigrant status violator'\" and citing the Immigration and Naturalization Act, it said \"the United States believed that her presence in the country would result in 'potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.'\"",
      "Ozturk was one of four students at Tufts University who co-authored an op-ed in the Tufts Daily college paper in March 2024 urging the university to \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide\" and \"divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.\" There is no mention of Hamas in the article. Kumar said the op-ed was consistent with the university's free speech policies and there were \"opinions that were shared just as strongly\" on other sides of the issue.",
      "\"The University has no further information suggesting that she has acted in a manner that would constitute a violation of the University's understanding of the Immigration and Naturalization Act,\" Kumar wrote. He asked that Ozturk \"receive the due process rights to which she is entitled,\" so she can return to Tufts to finish her studies and her degree.",
      "At the time of Ozturk's detention, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said Ozturk \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas,\" but did not provide details about her alleged activities. The government's filing Tuesday also contained no details about alleged ties to Hamas.",
      "The Justice Department's argument regarding jurisdiction \u2014 that the habeas petition arguments should be held where the person is being detained \u2014 has been used by the government in other court cases involving the Trump administration's deportation efforts, including in the case of former Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil and in the cases of five Venezuelan men who sued to block their deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has touted the administration's cancellation of more than 300 student visas so far and said that student visas are meant to encourage studying and getting degrees, \"not to become a social activist\" and \"tear up our university campuses.\"",

      "The White House says Musk isn't officially in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), although he has been heavily involved and the president and Vance speak of Musk and DOGE in tandem. By law, Musk, designated a special government employee, may only formally work for the government for 130 days, or a little over four months. That time would run out in late May or early June. Vance said Musk was told that the administration needed him to cut government and make it more efficient, a task Musk was told would take about six months.",
      "\"And that's what Elon signed up for,\" Vance said in an interview with Fox News' Lawrence Jones. \"But of course, he's going to continue to be an adviser. And by the way, the work of DOGE is not even close to done. The work of Elon is not even close to done.\"",
      "Vance touted the work Vance and DOGE have done, including unearthing grants the White House deems wasteful or fraudulent.",
      "\"And yeah, that work's gonna continue after Elon leaves, but fundamentally, Elon is going to remain a friend and an adviser of both me and the president, and he's done a lot of good things,\" Vance said. \"People don't realize how vast and uncontrolled the bureaucracy was. We've started to chip away at it but there's a lot of work to do. It's not going to happen all in six months, it's going to take a long and committed effort.\"",
      "Vance's comments come after Politico reported that the president has told his inner circle and members of his Cabinet that Musk still be stepping back in the coming weeks form his current role, a story Vance and Musk called \"fake news.\"",
      "As a special government employee, Musk's financial disclosure report is not public, and he is exempt from some ethics and conflict-of-interest rules that apply to permanent government employees. It's not clear what the White House would do if Musk, whom the White House says it not being paid, remains longer than 130 days.",

      "The NIH is the world's leading medical research agency and largest funder of cancer research, providing about $8 billion in cancer science funding annually.",
      "About 1,200 jobs are expected to be cut at NIH as part of the layoffs at the Health and Human Services Department, and the administration also has canceled hundreds of NIH grants to scientists around the country. Across HHS, nearly a quarter of staff, or 20,000 people, is expected to be laid off or take early retirement or voluntary separation offers.",
      "\"HHS deals with Americans from birth to death. There is absolutely no way you can lose 25% of the workforce without directly affecting Americans across this country,\" former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\u00a0recently told CBS News, adding this includes \"research and science at NIH, which is the gold standard of the world.\"",
      "Anjee Davis, the CEO of Fight Colorectal Cancer, a patient advocacy group, told CBS News her reaction to the cuts was fear.",
      "\"We're scared that these blanket mandates could erase decades of progress fighting cancer,\" she said. \"This isn't about politics. It's about protecting the progress we've fought so hard to achieve in cancer care and research over the past two decades.\"",
      "NIH is \"how we end up with new drugs and other advancements in medicine,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News,\u00a0recently told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "While the exact impacts of the cuts remain to be seen, she said, it does raise immediate and long-term concerns, including a slowing of biomedical research and potential delays in drug approvals.",

She had just qualified to enter a clinical trial that was going to be her last chance effort to slow the spread of her cancer. ... Her trial was about to start when NIH funding was pulled overnight, and the trial was canceled,\" she said. \"That's just one example. There are countless others.\"",
      "The University of Maryland has more than 250 active clinical trials, many that bring experimental medications to cancer patients across the country \u2014 but these trials are at risk of disruption, Stuart Martin, the deputy director of the University of Maryland's Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, said in media panel Thursday.",
      "\"(These) medications are developed from the research that's funded by NIH grants in many cases,\" he said, adding for some patients, these treatments \"could be their last hope for survival from cancer.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Backlash to President Trump's tariffs cropped up throughout Capitol Hill on Thursday, as Democrats, and some Republicans, expressed concern about the sweeping levies on foreign imports \u2014 while putting forward a handful of possible methods to counter them.",
      "On Wednesday, the president announced a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of countries that charge higher taxes on American exports. And after what Mr. Trump described as \"Liberation Day,\" investors appeared spooked, with members of Congress unclear on the path forward.",
      "The response from some lawmakers was swift. Sens. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat and Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, introduced bipartisan legislation Thursday aimed at reasserting Congress' role over trade policy. The measure, known as the Trade Review Act of 2025, would require the president to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or raising tariffs. The president would have to include an explanation and analysis of the potential impact, while lawmakers would have the ability to end the levy with a joint resolution.",
      "Grassley said in a statement that Congress has for too long \"delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,\" while Cantwell argued that the same check and balance that prevents the president from unilaterally declaring war should exist \"as it relates to protecting our commerce activities.\"",
      "\"Congress in the War Powers Act decided to reclaim its authority because they thought a president had overreached,\" Cantwell said on the Senate floor. \"Sen. Grassley and I are trying to do the same thing today by introducing the Trade Review Act of 2025.\"",
      "Meanwhile in the House, Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat who serves as the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Wednesday in response to the new tariffs that he plans to introduce a resolution to force a vote on \"ending the made up national emergency Trump is using to justify these taxes,\" effectively blocking them.",
      "\"Republicans can't keep ducking this \u2014 it's time they show whether they support the economic pain Trump is inflicting on their constituents,\" Meeks said in a post on X.",
      "The move would force a vote on the House floor within 15 days. And as the GOP wrestles with how to respond to the tariffs, a Democratic committee aide told CBS News they're looking to make the effort to pass Meeks' resolution a bipartisan one. But the resolution would ultimately require the president's signature or a veto-proof majority, making it a gambit unlikely to succeed.",
      "The efforts come after the Senate approved a resolution Wednesday aimed at blocking the president's Canada tariffs, as a handful of Republicans bucked their party leader to support the measure. The bill would have to be approved by the House, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged Speaker Mike Johnson to call the House back into session to take up the measure on Thursday, saying, \"Donald Trump is using tariffs in the dumbest way imaginable.\"",
      "But after House Republicans last month included in a\u00a0bill to keep the government funded\u00a0a provision that widely blocks members from forcing a vote on the Canada and Mexico tariffs amid a similar push by Meeks, it appears unlikely that the resolution would receive a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "Whether any of the moves can make it through both chambers and have an impact on the tariffs or trade situation more broadly remains to be seen. The legislative efforts to counter the tariffs come as congressional Republicans have appeared to struggle with how to respond, though few have appeared willing to strongly rebuke the move so far.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Thursday that he's concerned about the markets following the tariffs announcement. Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who was among the four Republicans who voted with Democrats to block the tariffs on Wednesday, told reporters, \"There is more pro-trade sentiment in the Republican caucus than was evidenced by the vote yesterday,\" adding that he expects after the market response Thursday, \"A lot of people are going to be reconsidering the wisdom of this.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Thursday morning that he was waiting to see how things shake out, noting that the market response was \"not unexpected.\"",
      "\"It's a big policy change, bold policy change, and I think it's going to take some time to determine what the ultimate impacts are going to be,\" Thune said. \"Right now, we're all kind of waiting and seeing and seeing how the administration reacts and what the ultimate permanent policy might look like.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump rolled out new tariffs on April 2 aimed at easing trade imbalances. Here's which products could become more expensive as a result.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation-weary Americans may soon find they're paying more for a host of products after President Trump announced two new types of tariffs on April 2, a day he termed \"Liberation Day\" because he believes the measures will erase trade imbalances between the U.S. and other nations.",
      "While Mr. Trump characterizes tariffs as paid by other nations, they are in fact paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart or Amazon. Because the tariffs create higher costs for those businesses, they typically pass on all or some of the tariffs to consumers through price hikes.",
      "The new tariffs introduced by Mr. Trump on Wednesday include a 10% universal tariff, as well as so-called reciprocal tariffs on more than 60 countries that are trade partners with the U.S. The tariffs will be additive, meaning that imports will face both the universal tariff of 10% plus the specific reciprocal import levies targeting each nation.",
      "During his announcement, Mr. Trump's said the tariffs will would eventually lower prices for Americans, an issue on which voters say they want him to focus. But economists are predicting instead that consumers and businesses will likely encounter higher inflation, with price hikes on everything from food imports like coffee and chocolate to iPhones and other electronics manufactured outside the U.S.",
      "\"For all of President Trump's talk of a new 'golden age,' this huge tax increase will inevitably result in higher prices for American families, lower growth and business investment, and diminished exports and manufacturing output as the country's factories face retaliation abroad and costlier inputs (roughly half of all imports) at home,\" said Scott Lincicome and Colin Grabow, trade experts at the Cato Institute, in an email.",
      "They added, \"With today's announcement, U.S. tariffs will approach levels not seen since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which incited a global trade war and deepened the Great Depression.\"",
      "The Trump administration said there are some exclusions to the tariffs, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals, although it added that these products might be subject to tariffs at a later time.",
      "Which products will become more expensive with tariffs?",
      "Because of the 10% universal tariff on imports, any imported good is likely to become more expensive in the coming weeks and months as American companies digest the import duties and adjust their prices in response.",
      "For instance, after Mr. Trump added tariffs to imported washing machines during his first term, the median price of an appliance jumped more than 11%, adding about $86 to the cost of a new unit,\u00a0according\u00a0to University of Chicago researchers.",
      "Electronics like iPhones and TVs",
      "Among the nations targeted by Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs are China, Taiwan and South Korea, who are top exporters of electronics to the U.S., from Apple iPhones to television sets.",
      "The Trump administration plans to hit China with a reciprocal tariff of 34%, which means that products manufactured there and imported into the U.S. could see higher prices soon after the levies go into effect on April 9.",
      "Almost all iPhones are still manufactured in China, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, although Apple has shifted some of its iPhone fabrication to India. However, the Trump administration will also be adding a 26% reciprocal tariff to Indian imports, it said on Wednesday.",
      "\"Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China and the question will be around exceptions/exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations/factories/plants in the U.S.,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in an April 2 research note.",
      "Automobiles",
      "In addition to Mr. Trump's previously announced 25% tariff on auto imports, which go into effect today, imported autos will also face the 10% universal tariffs. Some U.S.-made vehicles include parts imported from other countries, which will face new tariffs and increase the purchase price of those cars, experts said.",
      "Ultimately, American consumers could end up paying an additional $2,500 to $5,000 for the lowest-cost American cars, and up to $20,000 for some imported models, according to an April 2 estimate from Anderson Economic Group.",
      "Clothing and shoes",
      "The bulk of apparel and shoes sold in U.S. stores like Walmart and Target is manufactured outside the U.S., with China, Vietnam and Bangladesh among the biggest exporters.",
      "All three nations will face reciprocal tariffs from the Trump administration, at 34% for China, 46% for Vietnam and 37% for Bangladesh.",
      "Wine and spirits",
      "Italian and French wines and Scottish whisky are also likely to rise in price, as European Union imports will face a reciprocal tariff of 20% while United Kingdom-made products will face a 10% import duty.",
      "\"Tariffs on imported wines will create a ripple effect across the industry \u2014 impacting importers, distributors and consumers alike,\" Louis Amoroso, CEO of Full Glass Wine Co., told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Amoroso, whose company owns direct-to-consumer wine retailers, added, \"While it's better than 200%, a 20% tariff still compounds through the supply chain and could lead to a 40% or more cost increase for consumers.\"",
      "Furniture",
      "About 30% to 40% of furniture sold in the U.S. is manufactured in other countries, according to CNBC. Top exporters of furniture to the U.S. include China and Vietnam.",
      "Coffee and chocolate",
      "The U.S. imports about 80% of its coffee beans from Latin American countries such as Brazil and Colombia, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Both nations are included in Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs, with each facing rates of 10%.",
      "Chocolate is another major Latin American import, given that the U.S. climate is by and large unsuited to growing cocoa beans. Among the nations that export cocoa beans to the country are Cote d'Ivoire and Ecuador, according to the USDA. Those nations will face reciprocal tariffs of 21% and 10%, respectively.",

    "story": [
      "In a move that could upend American foreign relations across the globe, President Trump announced Wednesday that he is imposing what he calls \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. engages with in trade. From April 5, all imports to the U.S. will be subject to a baseline tariff of 10%. Then, beginning April 9, about 90 countries that the Trump administration says currently impose unfair barriers on imported U.S. goods will be hit by additional \"reciprocal\" taxes.",
      "Some of the Asian nations from which the U.S. has long imported vast quantities of consumer goods will be subjected to the highest tariffs, including a 34% blanket levy on imports from China, which quickly vowed to impose unspecified \"countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests.\"",
      "A number of nations, including Britain, Brazil and Egypt, were hit with the lowest, base-rate 10% tariffs.",
      "Economists have warned that across-the-board tariffs could impact lower-income Americans' finances the most and increase the likelihood of a recession.",
      "The response from other world leaders to Mr. Trump's announcement has almost universally included critique \u2014 or outright condemnation \u2014 of the American leader's overt pressure tactics, but it has also shown a recognition of the importance other countries place on trade relations with the world's largest economy.",
      "Below is a look at the criticism \u2014 and the desire to salvage economic relations with Washington \u2014 emanating from capital cities across the globe.",
      "China",
      "A White House official told CBS News that the tariffs announced Wednesday by Mr. Trump will be additive, meaning the 34% \"retaliatory tariffs\" will be on top of 20% levies imposed by Washington earlier this year.",
      "\"China firmly opposes this and will take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,\" China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement. \"There are no winners in trade wars, and there is no way out for protectionism. China urges the U.S. to immediately lift unilateral tariffs and properly resolve differences with its trading partners through dialogue on an equal footing.\"",
      "\"Protectionism has no exit ramp,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Thursday, urging Washington to drop the new taxes on Chinese imports. \"What the U.S. needs to do now is correct its wrong practices and resolve economic and trade differences with other countries \u2014 including China \u2014 through fair, respectful and reciprocal consultations.\"",
      "Beijing did not indicate what countermeasures it might take but in separate remarks, Ministry of Commerce spokesman He Yadong said \"the trade and economic departments of China and the United States have been maintaining communication,\" and he added that Asia's largest economy remained \"willing to engage with the United States on important issues in bilateral trade.\"",
      "The European Union",
      "Overall, the 27-nation European Union bloc is one of the United States' biggest trade partners and, as a collective entity, has come under some of Mr. Trump's most vociferous criticism for what he considers an unfair imbalance in economic relations.",
      "The EU will be hit next week with a blanket 20% \"reciprocal tariff\" on its exports to the U.S., Mr. Trump announced Wednesday.",
      "\"I know that many of you feel let down by our oldest ally,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a video statement. While she was unequivocal in predicting that Mr. Trump's tactics would negatively impact the entire world, she signaled that the EU would at least wait to see if a new trade deal can be reached before imposing additional retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "\"President Trump's announcement of universal tariffs on the whole world, including the EU, is a major blow to the world economy,\" she said. \"Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism. The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe.\"",
      "Von der Leyen said the EU was \"already finalizing a first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel, and we are now preparing for further countermeasures, to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail.\"",
      "The reaction to Mr. Trump's announcement from individual EU member states was, in some cases, more pointed.",
      "In Germany, the bloc's biggest single largest economy and a major exporter of vehicles to the U.S., in particular, Economy Minister Robert Habeck predicted a U-turn by the American president \u2014 if the EU is able to maintain a united front and push back against the tariffs with measures of its own.",
      "\"That is what I see, that Donald Trump buckles under pressure, corrects his announcements under pressure, but the logical consequence is that he must also feel the pressure, and this pressure must now be exerted from Germany, from Europe,\" Habeck said, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Germany's leader, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, called Mr. Trump's tariffs \"fundamentally wrong\" and \"an attack on a trade system that has created prosperity all round the world \u2014 itself an American achievement.\"",
      "\"The EU has the strongest internal market in the world with 450 million consumers, which gives us the strength to hold talks with the U.S. government to avert a trade war,\" he said. \"We want cooperation, not confrontation, and will defend our interests. Europe will respond united, strong and proportionately to this decision.\"",
      "Giorgia Meloni, Italy's right-wing prime minister and a Trump ally who visited him at Mar-a-Lago in January, called the 20% tariff on EU imports \"wrong\" and a move \"that does not suit any party.\"",
      "\"We will do everything we can to work a deal with the United States, aiming to prevent a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global actors,\" Meloni said. \"In any case, as always, we will act in the interests of Italy and its economy, even by comparing ourselves with other European partners.\"",
      "Ireland's Prime Minister Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, in a post on social media, called the U.S. tariffs on the EU \"deeply regrettable,\" adding: \"I strongly believe that tariffs benefit no one. My priority, and that of the government, is to protect Irish jobs and the Irish economy.\"",
      "The United Kingdom",
      "The U.K. pulled out of the EU almost a decade ago, and while the advantages and disadvantages of that \"Brexit\" remain hotly debated, it will see the U.K. dodge the higher 20% tariffs imposed on its European neighbors. But even the baseline 10% levy announced by Mr. Trump on Wednesday was met with disappointment in London and with a clear desire to keep the storied \"special relationship\" on track.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer huddled early Thursday with the top executives from some of Britain's biggest businesses, eager to voice his support for their enterprises and also to draw on their economic acumen as he pushes for a new trade deal with the U.S., with the hope of getting all tariffs lifted.",
      "\"Clearly, there will be an economic impact from the decisions the U.S. has taken both here and globally,\" Starmer told the business leaders. \"But I want to be crystal clear: We are prepared.",
      "\"Nobody wins in a trade war. That is not in our national interest, and we have a fair and balanced trade relationship with the U.S.,\" Starmer argued, adding that \"negotiations on an economic prosperity deal \u2014 one that strengthens our existing trading relationship [with the U.S.] \u2014 they continue, and we will fight for the best deal for Britain.\"",
      "\"Today marks a new stage in our preparations,\" said Starmer. \"We have a range of levers at our disposal, and we will continue our work with businesses across the country to understand their assessment of these options. As I say, our intention remains to secure a deal. But nothing is off the table.\"",
      "Japan",
      "\"We had been requesting that the U.S. government review its unilateral tariff measures at various levels and we are extremely disappointed and regret that such measures have been implemented nonetheless,\" Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Thursday as his nation woke up to the news of a new 24% levy being imposed by the White House \u2014 which was taking a toll on the Nikkei stock market.",
      "\"We will continue to strongly urge the U.S. to review its measures,\" Ishiba said, according to Reuters.",
      "Japanese Trade Minister Yoji Muto, asked if Tokyo would retaliate with its own new trade barriers to U.S. imports, said the government would \"need to decide what is best for Japan, and most effective, in a careful but bold and speedy manner.\"",
      "Brazil",
      "\"The Brazilian government is evaluating all possible actions to ensure reciprocity in bilateral trade, including resorting to the World Trade Organization, in defense of legitimate national interests,\" the Brazilian government said in a statement Thursday, according to Reuters.",
      "The statement came just after Brazil's Congress approved a bill that would give President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva a legal framework to respond to international tariffs, including with countermeasures such as retaliatory tariffs.",
      "The government statement said Brazil remained open to negotiations with the U.S., and it rejected the White House's characterization of the 10% levy as \"reciprocal,\" saying that assessment does not \"reflect reality.\"",
      "Lula said previously that Mr. Trump's decision to impose tariffs on America's trading partners risked damaging the U.S. economy, and he said Brazil would lodge a formal complaint with the WTO over a separate levy on Brazilian steel exports.",
      "\"It will raise the prices of goods and could lead to [U.S.] inflation that he hasn't yet realized,\" Lula said, according to Reuters. \"Protectionism doesn't help any country in the world.\"",
      "Vietnam",
      "Vietnam was among the nations hardest hit by Mr. Trump's tariff salvo on Wednesday, with the U.S. leader announcing 46% tariffs on exports from the Asian manufacturing hub. Its exports to the U.S. have flourished for years under the so-called China+1 strategy, which has seen Chinese manufacturers get around existing U.S. tariffs on their country by moving some production to other, less-heavily tariffed nations in the region.",
      "Vietnamese officials did not immediately signal any plan to impose retaliatory measures.",
      "As the nation's benchmark stock index appeared on course for its biggest single-day drop in four years and its currency hit an all-time low, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh declared a new task force dedicated to addressing the rapidly changing economic situation after holding a cabinet meeting early Thursday.",
      "Cambodia",
      "The French news agency AFP spoke Thursday with Penn Sovicheat, a spokesman for Cambodia's commerce ministry, who blasted the Trump administration's imposition of a 49% levy on the country's exports as \"not reasonable.\"",
      "The White House says Cambodia is among the nations, like Vietnam and Laos, that have developed their own economies by inviting Chinese investment under the China+1 strategy, enabling Chinese manufacturers to skirt existing U.S. trade barriers. According to Sovicheat, Cambodia exported about $10 billion worth of goods to the U.S. in 2024, largely clothing.",
      "\"China has turned Cambodia into the most important transshipment hub that Communist China uses to evade our tariffs,\" a White House official told reporters this week.",
      "Sovicheat acknowledged that American imports to Cambodia, which he said amounted to around $264 million worth of goods last year, were taxed at an average of 29.4%, but the White House figures Mr. Trump unveiled Wednesday claim the Asian nation has tariffs and other trade barriers in place on U.S. goods amounting to 97%.",
      "\"The 49% tariffs is not a good image for Cambodian industry or our investment attraction,\" Sovicheat told AFP, adding that the government was hoping to negotiate a trade agreement with the Trump administration through existing entities such as the ASEAN trade bloc or the World Trade Organization.",
      "Cambodian Commerce Minister Cham Nimul said in remarks aired by state TV that U.S. consumers would feel the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs on his country before Cambodians, according to the AFP.",
      "\"The increase in tariffs means that the U.S. people who make the purchase orders of Cambodian products are the first people to be impacted, and next will be Cambodia and business people,\" she was quoted as saying.",
      "Australia",
      "Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Thursday that Mr. Trump's 10% tariffs were \"not unexpected, but let me be clear, they are totally unwarranted.\"",
      "\"This is not the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, who, in addition to his frustration, appeared perplexed by the fact that the White House tariffs singled out some of his country's tiny, far-flung territories, including a group of islands that are home to lots of penguins, but no people.",
      "Norfolk Island is an inhabited Australian territory, but only by about 2,000 people, and Albanese called it \"a bit strange\" that it had been singled out by the White House and hit with an even greater tariff of 29%, nearly three times higher than the Australian mainland.",
      "The uninhabited Heard Island and McDonald Islands were subject to the same 10% levy as mainland Australia, meanwhile, despite them rarely seeing human footprints due to \"the extreme isolation\" and the \"persistently severe weather and sea conditions\" in the sub-Antarctic area.",

    "story": [
      "Miller Gardner, the youngest son of former New York Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, died on March 21 at the age of 14 while on vacation with his family in Costa Rica.",
      "Carbon monoxide poisoning was the cause of death, authorities in Costa Rica confirmed on April 2.\u00a0High levels of the toxic gas had been detected\u00a0in testing of the family's hotel room.",
      "Here is what we know about Miller Gardner's death.",
      "What happened to Miller Gardner?",
      "Miller Gardner's parents said in a statement that he died in his sleep after he and several other family members fell ill while vacationing. They did not elaborate on who else had gotten sick, what specific illness they were dealing with or what symptoms they had experienced.",
      "Where were the Gardners staying?",
      "The Gardners were vacationing at the Arenas Del Mar Beachfront & Rainforest Resort, which is along Costa Rica's Pacific coast, some 50 miles south of San Jos\u00e9.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by this loss, and our hearts go out to the family during this incredibly difficult time,\" the resort said in a statement on Tuesday, March 25. \"The factors that led to this tragic incident are unknown, and we are fully cooperating with authorities as they investigate. We remain committed to supporting our guests and staff, prioritizing their well-being and safety, while respecting the privacy of those affected.\"",
      "The resort also told CBS News that hotel staff responded to the incident according to protocol, saying: \"The hotel staff dispatched a medical team immediately, including a licensed doctor, which arrived to handle the emergency situation. Any medical attention to the family was done by medical professionals. Our staff did not administer any medical treatment.\"",
      "What are officials saying about the cause of death?",
      "Randall Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, director of the Judicial Investigation Agency, or OIJ, said on March 31 that investigators conducted testing in the hotel room where Gardner was staying and found high levels of carbon monoxide, which he said may have been caused by machinery in the room next door. The contamination they found led investigators to believe Gardner \"may have died from inhaling these highly dangerous gases,\" Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said.",
      "The cause of death was confirmed after Gardner was tested for carboxyhemoglobin, a compound generated when\u00a0carbon monoxide\u00a0binds to hemoglobin in the blood, according to Z\u00fa\u00f1iga. The test showed a carboxyhemoglobin saturation of 64%. Saturation is considered lethal when it exceeds 50%.",
      "The head of Costa Rica's judicial police also said that a \"layer\" was detected during the autopsy on Gardner's organs. That layer forms due to a high presence of carbon monoxide.",
      "Carbon monoxide\u00a0is an odorless gas produced by the burning of fossil fuels in equipment such as cars, furnaces, stoves, certain heaters and generators.\u00a0Symptoms\u00a0of carbon monoxide poisoning may include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and confusion.",
      "Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said the investigation was \"closely coordinated\" with the FBI.",
      "The hotel told CBS News in a statement on March 31 that it was \"diligently cooperating with the Costa Rican judicial authorities, who have taken over the investigation.\"",
      "\"We trust that the forensic process will objectively, clearly, and conclusively clarify the causes of this unfortunate incident,\" the hotel said.",
      "The OIJ director had said it was conducting three types of analyses, including a toxicology report, at its forensic science laboratories.",
      "Why did early reports say the cause was food poisoning or \"food intoxication\"?",
      "Asphyxiation was initially thought to be the cause of death, although that theory was ruled out after an autopsy performed by the Forensic Pathology Section. An initial statement had said: \"Preliminary reports indicate the cause of death is asphyxiation following possible food poisoning.\"",
      "Some news outlets quoted a local official who cited possible \"food intoxication,\" but there is no condition by that name, and it appears in this context to have meant the same thing as food poisoning.",
      "Following the reports of possible food poisoning, Hotel La Mariposa, located less than a mile from where the Gardners were staying, released a statement to address what it called \"misinformation circulating on social media.\"",

      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that takes hundreds of lives each year, and makes even more people sick \u2014 but there are steps you can take to help keep yourself and your family safe.",
      "More than 400 Americans die annually from unintentional carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, more than 100,000 visit the emergency room and more than 14,000 are hospitalized, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Poisoning occurs when breathing in CO fumes prevents the body from getting enough oxygen, which can harm the brain, heart and other organs, according to Johns Hopkins.",
      "The dangers of carbon monoxide are back in headlines as Costa Rican officials say Miller Gardner, the son of former Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner,\u00a0died from carbon monoxide poisoning in a hotel room where the family was staying in March. And authorities in Belize said three American women who were found dead in their hotel room in February had\u00a0died of carbon monoxide poisoning.",
      "Here's what to know to protect yourself.",
      "What causes carbon monoxide?",
      "Carbon monoxide is produced any time a fossil fuel is burned, meaning accidental poisoning can occur when home appliances and systems like furnaces, kerosene heaters, stoves, lanterns and generators produce fumes that people breathe in.",
      "Most CO exposures happen in the winter in cold climates because of unvented space heaters in the home, a common source of CO poisoning. Cases sometimes occur after hurricanes or other storms when people are relying on generators for emergency power that may not be vented properly.",
      "Where to put carbon monoxide detector?",
      "While CO poisoning can be fatal, it is also preventable with the use of CO detector devices. Detector can range between $20 for basic models to $100 for digital, low-level detectors.",
      "The\u00a0U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends each floor of the home have a separate CO detector.",
      "\"If you are getting a single detector, place it near the sleeping areas and make certain the alarm is loud enough to wake you up,\" the EPA notes.",
      "In addition to detectors, the CDC, Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins and other public safety advocates have a number of other recommendations, including:",
      "Car safety:\u00a0Don't run a car in an enclosed area like a garage. Even if the garage door is open, don't start a vehicle if the garage is attached to a home.",
      "Furnace and fireplaces:\u00a0Keep fireplaces clean and in good condition, make sure no debris is blocking the vents or chimney.",
      "Fuel-burning space heaters: Make sure heating systems, water heaters, and any other gas, oil, or coal burning appliances are cleaned and serviced every year, and make sure they're in well-ventilated areas. Johns Hopkins suggests opting for electrical space heaters, which pose no danger of carbon monoxide poisoning.",
      "Gas stoves and ovens: Never use these for heating a room.",
      "Portable generators: Never use generators inside a home or garage, even if doors and windows are open. Instead, place them outside more than 20 feet away from any windows, doors or vents.",

      "Anyone can be at risk for CO poisoning, but infants, the elderly and people with chronic heart disease, anemia or breathing problems are more likely to get sick, according to multiple health organizations.",
      "If you are experiencing these symptoms, get to fresh air and seek emergency care immediately, the organizations advise.",
      "Travel carbon monoxide detector",
      "It's also important to be aware of carbon monoxide while traveling, since some accommodations, from hotel rooms to home rentals, especially abroad, may not have appropriate safety measures in place.",

Three tourists were\u00a0staying at an apartment\u00a0in Mexico City,\u00a0reportedly\u00a0booked through Airbnb, while another group was at a Sandals Resort in the Bahamas.",
      "A spokesperson for Sandals Resorts confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch at the time that Sandals has carbon monoxide detectors in all rooms across its facilities. Airbnb started offering hosts free carbon monoxide detectors for units that don't already have the devices installed. Airbnb said it encourages its hosts to install detectors but does not require them. Guests can check if a rental has detectors by checking the \"safety devices\" section of the listing.",
      "Hyperbaric medicine specialist Dr. Andrew Moffat previously told CBS MoneyWatch he always travels with a portable detector.",
      "\"I bring my own carbon monoxide monitor with me everywhere I stay,\" he said. Moffatt cautioned that survivors of CO poisoning can suffer debilitating long-term effects like chronic anxiety and cognitive issues, and that many detectors don't go off until CO levels are so elevated that they damage the brain.",

The\u00a0initial hearing on the request\u00a0did not include anyone who opposed the move.

      "\"The case against Eric Adams should have never been brought in the first place\u2014and finally today that case is gone forever. From Day 1, the mayor has maintained his innocence and now justice for Eric Adams and New Yorkers has prevailed,\" Adams' attorney Alex Spiro said.",

      "The initial request to drop the charges made note that the decision was not based on \"the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based.\"",
      "That triggered concerns that Adams could not effectively govern the city because\u00a0he would be beholden to the Trump administration, as long as the possibility of the charges returning remained in place.",
      "Adams and his attorneys have vehemently denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Mayor Adams responds to charges being dropped",
      "Adams spoke at Gracie Mansion\u00a0after the case against him was dropped.",
      "\"As I've said all along, this case should have never been brought and I did nothing wrong,\" Adams said. \"I am now happy that our city can finally close the book and focus solely on the future of our great city. I want to thank New Yorkers who stood by my side, who prayed for me, who supported me from day one and stuck with me while we focused on the work at hand.\"",
      "He offered an apology to New Yorkers.",
      "\"I also want to apologize to New Yorkers for having to go through this with me, a baseless case that should have never been brought in the first place,\" Adams said.",
      "Adams said New Yorkers are his \"north star\" and he thinks about them every day.",
      "\"I'm a New Yorker, and this is the greatest city on the globe, and it's a privilege being your mayor, something I did not take for granted one day, and I'm going to continue to serve you,\" Adams said. \"As I have repeatedly said, I have always been solely beholden to the people of this city. No special interests, no political opponents, but just everyday New Yorkers. Just you, and I'm going to continue to do that. So today we turn the page, we move forward together.\"",
      "Before he went back into Gracie Mansion, Adams held up a copy of \"Government Gangsters,\" a book by FBI Director Kash Patel.",
      "\"Read it and understand how we can never allow this to happen to another innocent American,\" Adams said.",
      "More on the judge's ruling",
      "Judge Ho's decision includes words Adams' opponents are sure to focus in on: \"Everything here smacks of a bargain, dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions.\"",
      "In his ruling to dismiss the case with prejudice, Judge Ho took issue with the Department of Justice's request to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning he could've faced trial on the same charges again at a later time.",
      "Judge Ho summarized the DOJ's reasoning to drop the case as based on three things: It's tainted with impropriety, detrimental to national security and immigration enforcement, and was a weak case to begin with.",
      "\"There  may or may not be good reasons to drop this prosecution. But the reasons articulated by DOJ, if  taken at face value, are inconsistent with a decision to leave the charges in the Indictment hanging  like the proverbial Sword of Damocles over the Mayor,\" Judge Ho wrote. \"And there are many reasons to be troubled by DOJ's proffered rationales\u2014further supporting dismissal with prejudice.\"",
      "Judge Ho also addressed why he couldn't continue to pursue the case after the DOJ moved to dismiss it.",
      "\"Some will undoubtedly find today's decision unsatisfying, wondering why, if DOJ's ostensible reasons for dropping this case are so troubling, the Court does not simply deny the  Motion to Dismiss altogether. But, as explained above, the Court cannot order DOJ to continue  the prosecution, and it is aware of no authority (outside of the criminal contempt context) that  would empower it, as some have urged, to appoint an independent prosecutor,\" Judge Ho wrote. \"Therefore, any  decision by this Court to deny the Government's Motion to Dismiss would be futile at best, because  DOJ could\u2014and, by all indications, unequivocally would\u2014simply refuse to prosecute the case,  inevitably resulting in a dismissal after seventy days for violating the Mayor's right to a speedy  trial. That route would simply postpone finality in this case to a date uncomfortably close to the  June 24 mayoral primary. The public interest would not be served by such an outcome.\"",
      "\"To be clear, the Court again emphasizes that it does not express any opinion as to the merits  of the case or whether the prosecution of Mayor Adams 'should' move forward,\" Judge Ho added.",
      "Read the judge's order in full",
      "Read the judge's order in full",
      "\"Legally speaking, he is innocent until proven guilty, and he will never be proven guilty - that is an unequivocal, it is rare when we can rarely say things that definitively - but he will never face legal consequences for the allegations that were against him in this case,\" Hofstra Law Professor James Sample said.",
      "Impact on the mayor's race",
      "The timing of the decision to drop the case was critical for Adams, who faced a Thursday deadline to file petitions to run for mayor in New York City's Democratic primary. He later announced he will run as an independent candidate.",
      "The decision means Adams is now free to run without the threat of going to jail, or facing a politically damaging trial.",
      "CBS News New York has learned that Adams is immediately jumping into the political fray, and he plans to participate in a mayoral candidates forum sponsored by the National Action Network Thursday.",
      "\"He looks forward to engaging with fellow candidates and community leaders to discuss the future of our great city,\" a spokesman said.",
      "Since there's no possibility of the charges against him resurfacing, Adams can also say he is not beholden to President Trump or his administration, since they can no longer bring the same case against him. Adams has repeatedly said that, and just Tuesday night, New York City joined a suit against the Trump administration to challenge cuts that would cost New York City $100 million in CDC funding.",
      "\"When federal policies directly impact our city, we have been, and will continue to be, the first and loudest to advocate for New Yorkers. These funds are crucial in protecting public health, and the reversal will have serious consequences for communities across the five boroughs,\" Adams said in his statement Tuesday night.",
      "Even before Adams officially learned that his case had been dropped, Adams made it clear at a National Action Network event Wednesday that suggestions he was \"under the finger\" of President Trump were, in his mind, false.",
      "\"I do not know who you think I'm under the finger of,\" Adams said Wednesday morning. \"But I'm on the finger of Eric Adams, the mayor of the city of New York, and I'm going to continue to do so.\"",
      "Adams also made an argument voters can expect to hear if he seeks another term.",
      "\"I'm the same person that made sure we put $17 billion in the [minority and women-owned businesses] in this city, that invested in foster care children, that built more housing in year one and year two of our administration than in the history of this city,\" Adams said.",
      "Adams has previously told CBS News New York's Marcia Kramer to expect twists and turns in the upcoming mayoral election.",
      "Adams' opposition speaks out",
      "The mayor's detractors were also speaking out.",
      "\"Either way, I think there was tremendous damage that was done to this city because of an Adams administration, so the quickest we can get away from this administration, I think the better for the city,\" Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said.",
      "\"It's absolutely disgusting. You have a man that broke the law. We want to remind people that it wasn't just about flight upgrades. This was a man who illegally held a campaign donor scheme, and the fact that the judge unfortunately bowed to Trump is appalling,\" mayoral candidate Michael Blake said.",
      "\"The ruling does not change the facts: Eric Adams works for Donald Trump, not New Yorkers,\" mayoral candidate and city Comptroller Brad Lander said.",
      "\"Eric Adams has sold out New Yorkers and put himself above the public at every chance he could. Even the judge in the case agrees: this slimy deal reeks of a quid pro quo with the Trump administration. In exchange for his freedom, Adams has looked the other way while the federal government detains and disappears New Yorkers, steals money from our city, and wages war on working people. Adams should resign in disgrace,\" mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani said.",
      "Move to drop charges sparked resignations",
      "The DOJ memo seeking to drop the charges set off a spate of resignations that started in City Hall, at the very heart of Adams' inner circle, and reached all the way to the U.S. attorney's office. At issue was then-Acting U.S. Attorney of the Southern District of New York Danielle Sassoon's allegation that the request to dismiss the case amounted to a quid pro quo, namely Adams' cooperation on President Trump's immigration enforcement in exchange for his charges being dropped. Sassoon resigned, rather than drop the charges, as did several other people in the U.S. attorney's office.",
      "The mayor and his attorney pushed back strenuously against the notion of a quid pro quo.",
      "\"The idea that there was a quid pro quo is a total lie. We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us,\" Adams' attorney \u00a0Alex Spiro said.",
      "Allegations that Adams had been compromised by the Trump administration and was operating, essentially, under its thumb led\u00a0four New York City deputy mayors to resign\u00a0and spurred numerous calls for Adams to step down. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has the power to remove Adams from office, then met with key leaders to discuss his future. She ultimately acted to limit Adams' powers in a bid to restore trust in government, but said she wouldn't remove him.",
      "What Adams has been accused of",
      "Last September, federal prosecutors alleged Adams had been abusing his power for almost a decade. They said he solicited illegal campaign donations from wealthy foreigners and corporations, including a Turkish government official.",
      "In the\u00a057-page indictment, Adams was accused of receiving gifts he didn't disclose, including luxury travel, worth more than $100,000, in return for political favors.",
      "\"These upgrades and freebies were not part of some frequent flyer or loyalty program available to the general public. As we allege, this was a multi-year scheme to buy favor with a single New York City politician on the rise,\" then-U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District Damian Williams\u00a0said as he announced the indictment.",
      "Prosecutors accused Adams of pressuring FDNY officials to approve the Turkish consulate building in Manhattan, despite fire safety concerns.",
      "The Adams campaign was also accused of using \"straw donors\" for illicit contributions, enabling it to tap into $10 million in matching funds.",
      "\"These are bright red lines, and we allege that the mayor crossed them again and again for years,\" Williams said.",
      "Before the DOJ stepped in, prosecutors appeared to be ramping up their case, claiming they had uncovered\u00a0\"additional criminal conduct.\"",
      "Adams associates also under investigation",
      "The historic indictment came amid\u00a0multiple investigations into Adams' campaign, as well as other administration officials.",
      "Numerous top members of the Adams administration resigned before the indictment was announced, including former\u00a0NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban\u00a0and\u00a0his twin brother, James Caban. Former\u00a0Schools Chancellor David Banks\u00a0and his wife, former\u00a0Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright, and his brother, former\u00a0Deputy Mayor Philip Banks III, were also investigated.",
      "Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a longtime Adams advisor, pleaded not guilty to bribery, money laundering and conspiracy\u00a0in a case involving her son and two real estate developers. The mayor's former liaison for the Muslim community, Mohamed Bahi, was also\u00a0charged with conspiracy for his role in collecting illegal donations\u00a0for Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign and\u00a0has agreed to plead guilty, according to court documents.",

      "When carboxyhemoglobin saturation exceeds 50%, it is considered lethal. In Gardner's case, the test showed a saturation of 64%.",
      "\"It's important to note that adjacent to this room is a dedicated machine room, where it's believed there may be some type of contamination toward these rooms,\" Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said.",

      "Miller Gardner died on March 21 while staying with his family at a hotel on the Manuel Antonio beach in Costa Rica's Central Pacific.",
      "The family said in a statement that he died in his sleep.",
      "In a statement earlier this week, the hotel where the family had been staying, the Arenas Del Mar Beachfront & Rainforest Resort, said it was \"heartbroken by the tragic loss that recently occurred on our premises,\" and said, \"We are diligently cooperating with the Costa Rican judicial authorities, who have taken over the investigation. We trust that the forensic process will objectively, clearly, and conclusively clarify the causes of this unfortunate incident.\"",
      "Asphyxiation was initially thought to have caused his death, but after an autopsy was performed by the Forensic Pathology Section, that theory was ruled out. A previous line of investigation also looked into\u00a0whether the family had suffered food poisoning. Family members had reported feeling ill after dining at a nearby restaurant on the night of March 20 and received treatment from the hotel doctor.",
      "OIJ Director R\u00e1ndall Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said the death investigation was \"closely coordinated\" with the FBI.",

    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014\u00a0China announced Friday that it will impose a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10. The new tariff matches the rate of the U.S. tariff announced by President Trump this week, which he called a \"reciprocal\" measure, claiming China had tariffs and other measures in place on U.S. goods already that amounted to a 67% trade barrier.",
      "For Mr. Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, the White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers, in reaching its decision on how heavily to tariff almost every other country in the world. Economists have questioned the methodology, and many foreign governments have complained the levies are unfair and misrepresent their trade imbalances with the U.S.",
      "The Commerce Ministry in Beijing also said in a notice that it will impose more export controls on rare earths, which are materials used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries.",

    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 South Korea's Constitutional Court removed impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol from office Friday, ending his tumultuous presidency and setting up an election to find a new leader, four months after he threw South Korean politics into turmoil with an ill-fated declaration of martial law.",
      "The unanimous verdict capped a dramatic fall for Yoon, a former star prosecutor who went from political novice to president in 2022, just a year after he entered politics.",
      "In a nationally televised verdict, the court's acting chief Moon Hyung-bae said the eight-member bench upheld Yoon's impeachment because his martial law decree seriously violated the constitution and other laws.",
      "\"The defendant not only declared martial law, but also violated the constitution and laws by mobilizing military and police forces to obstruct the exercise of legislative authority,\" Moon said. \"Ultimately, the declaration of martial law in this case violated the substantive requirements for emergency martial law.\"",
      "\"Given the grave negative impact on constitutional order and the significant ripple effects of the defendant's violations, we find that the benefits of upholding the constitution by removing the defendant from office far outweigh the national losses from the removal of a president,\" the justice concluded.",
      "At an anti-Yoon rally near the old royal palace that dominates downtown Seoul, people erupted into tears and danced when the verdict was announced. Two women wept as they hugged and an old man near them leapt to his feet and screamed with joy.",
      "The crowd later began marching through Seoul streets. Some people were dressed in cute blue bear costumes, a protest mascot that uses the opposition's colors.",
      "Outside Yoon's official residence, thousands of supporters cried and screamed when they saw the news of the verdict on a giant TV screen. They waved South Korean and U.S. flags and chanted slogans.",
      "\"We will absolutely not be shaken!\" a protest leader shouted on stage. \"Anyone who accepts this ruling and prepares for an early presidential election is our enemy.\"",
      "No major violence was immediately reported.",
      "What's next for South Korea",
      "An election will be held within two months to replace Yoon, but a festering national divide over Yoon's impeachment will likely continue and could complicate South Korea's efforts to deal with President Trump's \"America First\" policies and North Korea's expanding ties with Russia, observers say.",
      "Yoon said in a statement issued via his defense team that he deeply regrets failing to live up to the public's expectations, but stopped short of explicitly accepting the verdict. There have been fears he would incite efforts to resist his removal, since he earlier vowed to fight to the end.",
      "He added that he will pray for the country and its people. \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve our nation,\" Yoon said.",
      "Yoon's ruling People Power Party said it would accept the decision, but one of Yoon's lawyers, Yoon Kap-keun, called the ruling \"completely incomprehensible\" and a \"pure political decision.\"",
      "Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country's acting leader, vowed in a televised speech to ensure \"there are no gaps in national security and diplomacy\" and maintain public safety and order. Han was appointed prime minister, the country's No.2 official, by Yoon.",
      "\"Respecting the will of our sovereign people, I will do my utmost to manage the next presidential election in accordance with the constitution and the law, ensuring a smooth transition to the next administration,\" Han said.",
      "Surveys show Lee Jae-myung, leader of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, is the early favorite to win the election to choose Yoon's successor. Lee is facing trials for corruption and other charges.",
      "Lee welcomed the ruling and credited the South Korean people for \"protecting our democratic republic.\"",
      "\"The courage of the people who stood in the face of guns, swords and tanks, along with the bravery of troops who refused to obey unjust orders, has led to this great revolution of light,\" Lee said.",
      "Nation still reeling from brief imposition of martial law",
      "Martial law lasted only six hours, but left behind a political crisis, rattling financial markets and unsettling the country's diplomatic partners. In January, Yoon was separately arrested and indicted by prosecutors on alleged rebellion in connection with his decree, a charge that carries the death penalty or a life sentence if convicted.",
      "Under Yoon's decree, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, hundreds of soldiers were dispatched to the assembly, election offices and other sites. Special operations soldiers smashed windows at the National Assembly and scuffled with citizens gathered to protest, shocking South Koreans and evoking traumatic memories of military rule.",
      "Enough lawmakers, including some from the ruling party, managed to enter the assembly to vote down his decree unanimously.",
      "No major violence occurred during the brief period of martial law, but some senior military and police officers sent to the assembly have testified that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to block a vote on his decree or to detain his political rivals. Yoon says the troops were deployed to the assembly simply to maintain order.",
      "Yoon, 64, a conservative, was impeached by the liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly on Dec. 14. The assembly accused him of violating the constitution and other laws by suppressing assembly activities, attempting to detain politicians, and undermining peace across the country.",
      "In his final testimony at the Constitutional Court hearing, Yoon said his decree was a desperate attempt to draw public support of his fight against the \"wickedness\" of the Democratic Party, which had obstructed his agenda, impeached top officials and slashed the government's budget bill. He earlier called the National Assembly \"a den of criminals\" and \"anti-state forces.\"",
      "Some experts say Yoon may have imposed military rule to head off a possible independent investigation into scandals involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee.",
      "Without presidential immunity, Yoon could face other criminal charges, such as abuse of power. He's the first South Korean president to be arrested or indicted while in office.",
      "Yoon served as prosecutor-general under his predecessor, liberal President Moon Jae-in, before joining the now-ruling party in 2021 following disputes with Moon allies. A public image as strong-minded and uncompromising helped him defeat Lee in the close-fought 2022 presidential election. But after becoming president, Yoon has faced criticism that he refused to replace officials implicated in scandals and vetoed many bills passed by the assembly.",

The bodies of 14 children and five women were recovered from the school in the Tuffah neighborhood of Gaza City, and the death toll could rise because some of the 70 wounded sustained critical injuries, said Health Ministry spokesman Zaher al-Wahidi.",
      "The Civil Defense rescue agency in Gaza said Friday that at least 31 people were killed in the strike on the school, with around 100 others injured.  More than 30 other Gaza residents were killed in strikes on homes in the nearby neighborhood of Shijaiyah, al-Wahidi said, citing records at Ahli Hospital.",
      "The Israeli military said it struck a \"Hamas command and control center\" in the Gaza City area, and that it took steps to lessen harm to civilians. Israel gave the same reason \u2014 striking Hamas militants in a \"command and control center\" \u2014 for attacking a United Nations building used as a shelter a day earlier, killing at least 17 people.",
      "Hamas, which had long been designated a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S. even before it carried out the brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza, called the strike on the school a \"heinous massacre\" of innocent civilians.",
      "Israel has long accused Hamas of hiding weapons and fighters in and around civilian infrastructure, but the Israel Defense Forces provided no immediate evidence to back up its claim that Hamas commanders were present in the Gaza school or the U.N. building it bombed this week.",
      "The strikes came as Israel's military ordered more residents in parts of northern Gaza to evacuate west and south to shelters, warning that it planned to \"work with extreme force in your area.\" A number of the Palestinians fleeing the targeted areas did so on foot, with some carrying their belongings on their backs and others using donkey carts.",
      "\"My wife and I have been walking for three hours covering only one kilometer,\" said Mohammad Ermana, 72. The couple, clasping hands, each walked with a cane. \"I'm searching for shelters every hour now, not every day,\" he said.",
      "Israel has issued sweeping evacuation orders for parts of northern Gaza ahead of expected expansions in its ground operations. The U.N. humanitarian office said around 280,000 Palestinians have been displaced since Israel abruptly ended a ceasefire with Hamas last month that had been brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.",
      "The fresh evacuation orders came a day after senior government officials said Israel would seize large parts of the Palestinian territory and establish a new security corridor across it. Israel has imposed a monthlong blockade on food, fuel and humanitarian aid on Gaza that has left civilians facing acute shortages as supplies dwindle \u2014 a tactic that rights groups say is a war crime. Israel says it is intended to pressure Hamas to release hostages and disarm.",
      "Hamas has said it will only release the remaining 59 hostages \u2014 24 of whom are believed to be alive \u2014 in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The group has rejected demands that it lay down its arms or leave the territory.",
      "Overnight strikes by Israel killed at least 55 people in the Gaza Strip, hospital officials said Thursday.",
      "In the southern city of Khan Younis, officials said the bodies of 14 people had been taken to Nasser Hospital \u2013 nine of them from the same family. The dead included five children and four women. The bodies of another 19 people, including five children aged between 1 and 7 years and a pregnant woman, were taken to the European hospital near Khan Younis, hospital officials said. In Gaza City, 21 bodies were taken to Ahli hospital, including those of seven children.",
      "Later in the day, strikes killed four more people in Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital, and another two people were killed in central Gaza and taken to Al Aqsa Hospital.",
      "The attacks came as the Israeli military promised an independent investigation of a March 23 operation in which its forces opened fire on ambulances in southern Gaza. U.N. officials say 15 Palestinian medics and emergency responders were killed, and their bodies and ambulances were buried by Israeli soldiers in a mass grave.",
      "The military initially said the ambulances were operating suspiciously and that nine militants were killed. The military said the probe would be led by an expert fact-finding body \"responsible for examining exceptional incidents\" during the war. Rights groups say such Israeli investigations are often lacking and that soldiers are rarely punished.",
      "The head of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, Younes Al-Khatib, said Thursday he believed some of the medics were still alive when they were overtaken by Israeli forces. The organization's radio dispatchers heard a conversation in Hebrew between medics and Israeli soldiers after the ambulances had come under fire, Al-Khatib told members of the U.N. Security Council.",
      "Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, told the U.N. Security Council he was turning over a video he obtained, allegedly showing the moments leading up to the Israeli killing of 15 humanitarian workers in Gaza.",
      "Mansour said the video shows that the aid workers, including eight members of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, were traveling in emergency vehicles with the lights on at night to deconflict with Israeli Defense Forces. But, Mansour said, the video \"found on the body of one of the martyrs,\" shows that the Israeli army ambushed the vehicle despite the emergency lights.",
      "Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 50,600 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't say whether those killed are civilians or combatants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. In an update on Friday, the ministry said 1,249 people had been killed in Gaza since March 18, when Israel resumed strikes, ending a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory.",
      "The death toll of the Israeli aggression has risen to 50,609 martyrs",

    "story": [
      "Indian police said on Thursday they had arrested a U.S. tourist who sneaked onto a highly restricted island carrying a coconut and a can of Diet Coke to a tribe untouched by the modern world. The incident occurred seven years after another American was killed\u00a0by the tribe on the same island.",
      "Mykhailo Viktorovych Polyakov, 24, set foot on the restricted territory of North Sentinel \u2014 part of India's Andaman Islands \u2014 in a bid to meet the Sentinelese people, who are believed to number only around 150.",
      "All outsiders, Indians and foreigners alike, are banned from traveling within three miles of the island to protect the Indigenous people from outside diseases and to preserve their way of life.",
      "\"The American citizen was presented before the local court after his arrest and is now on a three-day remand for further interrogation,\" Andaman and Nicobar Islands police chief HGS Dhaliwal told AFP.",
      "Satellite photographs show a coral reef-fringed island \u2014 stretching to some six miles at its widest point \u2014 with thick forest and white sand beaches.",
      "The Sentinelese last made international headlines in 2018 after they killed John Allen Chau, 27, an American missionary who landed illegally on their beach.",
      "Chau's body was not recovered and there were no investigations over his death because of the Indian law prohibiting anyone from going to the island. Officials at the time said he was apparently shot and killed by arrows.",
      "India sees the wider Andaman and Nicobar Islands as strategically sited on key global shipping lanes. They are closer to Myanmar than mainland India.",
      "New Delhi plans to invest at least $9 billion to expand naval and air bases, troop accommodations, the port and the main city in the region.",
      "\"Reckless and idiotic\"",
      "Dhaliwal said Polyakov kept blowing a whistle off the shore of North Sentinel Island for about an hour to attract the tribe's attention before he went ashore.",
      "\"He landed briefly for about five minutes, left the offerings on the shore, collected sand samples, and recorded a video before returning to his boat,\" Dhaliwal said. \"A review of his GoPro camera footage showed his entry and landing into the restricted North Sentinel Island.\"",
      "Police said Polyakov was arrested late on Monday, about two days after he went ashore, and had visited the region twice in recent months.",
      "He first used an inflatable kayak in October 2024 but was stopped by hotel staff, police said on Thursday. Polyakov made another unsuccessful attempt during a visit in January 2025.",
      "This time Polyakov used another inflatable boat with a motor to travel the roughly 22 miles of open sea from the main archipelago.",
      "The charity Survival International issued a statement, calling Polyakov's actions \"deeply disturbing/\"",
      "\"It beggars belief that someone could be that reckless and idiotic,\" the group's director, Carolina Pearce, said. \"This person's actions not only endangered his own life, they put the lives of the entire Sentinelese tribe at risk. It's very well known by now that uncontacted peoples have no immunity to common outside diseases like flu or measles, which could completely wipe them out.\"",
      "The Sentinelese, whose language and customs remain a mystery to outsiders, shun all contact and have a record of hostility to anyone who tries to get close.",
      "A photograph issued by the Indian Coast Guard and Survival International two decades ago showed a Sentinelese man aiming a bow and arrow at a passing helicopter.",
      "Indian authorities have prosecuted any locals who have aided attempts to enter the island and are trying to identify anyone who may have helped Polyakov.",
      "The Andamans are also home to the 400-strong Jarawa tribe, who activists say are also threatened by contact from outsiders. Tourists have previously bribed local officials in a bid to spend time with the Jarawa.",

    "published": "Thu, 03 Apr 2025 11:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "America's global trading partners are bristling at President Trump's tariff tactics, but many also stress a desire to strike new deals with the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "In a move that could upend American foreign relations across the globe, President Trump announced Wednesday that he is imposing what he calls \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. engages with in trade. From April 5, all imports to the U.S. will be subject to a baseline tariff of 10%. Then, beginning April 9, about 90 countries that the Trump administration says currently impose unfair barriers on imported U.S. goods will be hit by additional \"reciprocal\" taxes.",
      "Some of the Asian nations from which the U.S. has long imported vast quantities of consumer goods will be subjected to the highest tariffs, including a 34% blanket levy on imports from China, which quickly vowed to impose unspecified \"countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests.\"",
      "A number of nations, including Britain, Brazil and Egypt, were hit with the lowest, base-rate 10% tariffs.",
      "Economists have warned that across-the-board tariffs could impact lower-income Americans' finances the most and increase the likelihood of a recession.",
      "The response from other world leaders to Mr. Trump's announcement has almost universally included critique \u2014 or outright condemnation \u2014 of the American leader's overt pressure tactics, but it has also shown a recognition of the importance other countries place on trade relations with the world's largest economy.",
      "Below is a look at the criticism \u2014 and the desire to salvage economic relations with Washington \u2014 emanating from capital cities across the globe.",
      "China",
      "A White House official told CBS News that the tariffs announced Wednesday by Mr. Trump will be additive, meaning the 34% \"retaliatory tariffs\" will be on top of 20% levies imposed by Washington earlier this year.",
      "\"China firmly opposes this and will take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,\" China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement. \"There are no winners in trade wars, and there is no way out for protectionism. China urges the U.S. to immediately lift unilateral tariffs and properly resolve differences with its trading partners through dialogue on an equal footing.\"",
      "\"Protectionism has no exit ramp,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Thursday, urging Washington to drop the new taxes on Chinese imports. \"What the U.S. needs to do now is correct its wrong practices and resolve economic and trade differences with other countries \u2014 including China \u2014 through fair, respectful and reciprocal consultations.\"",
      "Beijing did not indicate what countermeasures it might take but in separate remarks, Ministry of Commerce spokesman He Yadong said \"the trade and economic departments of China and the United States have been maintaining communication,\" and he added that Asia's largest economy remained \"willing to engage with the United States on important issues in bilateral trade.\"",
      "The European Union",
      "Overall, the 27-nation European Union bloc is one of the United States' biggest trade partners and, as a collective entity, has come under some of Mr. Trump's most vociferous criticism for what he considers an unfair imbalance in economic relations.",
      "The EU will be hit next week with a blanket 20% \"reciprocal tariff\" on its exports to the U.S., Mr. Trump announced Wednesday.",
      "\"I know that many of you feel let down by our oldest ally,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a video statement. While she was unequivocal in predicting that Mr. Trump's tactics would negatively impact the entire world, she signaled that the EU would at least wait to see if a new trade deal can be reached before imposing additional retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "\"President Trump's announcement of universal tariffs on the whole world, including the EU, is a major blow to the world economy,\" she said. \"Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism. The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe.\"",
      "Von der Leyen said the EU was \"already finalizing a first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel, and we are now preparing for further countermeasures, to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail.\"",
      "The reaction to Mr. Trump's announcement from individual EU member states was, in some cases, more pointed.",
      "In Germany, the bloc's biggest single largest economy and a major exporter of vehicles to the U.S., in particular, Economy Minister Robert Habeck predicted a U-turn by the American president \u2014 if the EU is able to maintain a united front and push back against the tariffs with measures of its own.",
      "\"That is what I see, that Donald Trump buckles under pressure, corrects his announcements under pressure, but the logical consequence is that he must also feel the pressure, and this pressure must now be exerted from Germany, from Europe,\" Habeck said, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Germany's leader, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, called Mr. Trump's tariffs \"fundamentally wrong\" and \"an attack on a trade system that has created prosperity all round the world \u2014 itself an American achievement.\"",
      "\"The EU has the strongest internal market in the world with 450 million consumers, which gives us the strength to hold talks with the U.S. government to avert a trade war,\" he said. \"We want cooperation, not confrontation, and will defend our interests. Europe will respond united, strong and proportionately to this decision.\"",
      "Giorgia Meloni, Italy's right-wing prime minister and a Trump ally who visited him at Mar-a-Lago in January, called the 20% tariff on EU imports \"wrong\" and a move \"that does not suit any party.\"",
      "\"We will do everything we can to work a deal with the United States, aiming to prevent a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global actors,\" Meloni said. \"In any case, as always, we will act in the interests of Italy and its economy, even by comparing ourselves with other European partners.\"",
      "Ireland's Prime Minister Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, in a post on social media, called the U.S. tariffs on the EU \"deeply regrettable,\" adding: \"I strongly believe that tariffs benefit no one. My priority, and that of the government, is to protect Irish jobs and the Irish economy.\"",
      "The United Kingdom",
      "The U.K. pulled out of the EU almost a decade ago, and while the advantages and disadvantages of that \"Brexit\" remain hotly debated, it will see the U.K. dodge the higher 20% tariffs imposed on its European neighbors. But even the baseline 10% levy announced by Mr. Trump on Wednesday was met with disappointment in London and with a clear desire to keep the storied \"special relationship\" on track.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer huddled early Thursday with the top executives from some of Britain's biggest businesses, eager to voice his support for their enterprises and also to draw on their economic acumen as he pushes for a new trade deal with the U.S., with the hope of getting all tariffs lifted.",
      "\"Clearly, there will be an economic impact from the decisions the U.S. has taken both here and globally,\" Starmer told the business leaders. \"But I want to be crystal clear: We are prepared.",
      "\"Nobody wins in a trade war. That is not in our national interest, and we have a fair and balanced trade relationship with the U.S.,\" Starmer argued, adding that \"negotiations on an economic prosperity deal \u2014 one that strengthens our existing trading relationship [with the U.S.] \u2014 they continue, and we will fight for the best deal for Britain.\"",
      "\"Today marks a new stage in our preparations,\" said Starmer. \"We have a range of levers at our disposal, and we will continue our work with businesses across the country to understand their assessment of these options. As I say, our intention remains to secure a deal. But nothing is off the table.\"",
      "Japan",
      "\"We had been requesting that the U.S. government review its unilateral tariff measures at various levels and we are extremely disappointed and regret that such measures have been implemented nonetheless,\" Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Thursday as his nation woke up to the news of a new 24% levy being imposed by the White House \u2014 which was taking a toll on the Nikkei stock market.",
      "\"We will continue to strongly urge the U.S. to review its measures,\" Ishiba said, according to Reuters.",
      "Japanese Trade Minister Yoji Muto, asked if Tokyo would retaliate with its own new trade barriers to U.S. imports, said the government would \"need to decide what is best for Japan, and most effective, in a careful but bold and speedy manner.\"",
      "Brazil",
      "\"The Brazilian government is evaluating all possible actions to ensure reciprocity in bilateral trade, including resorting to the World Trade Organization, in defense of legitimate national interests,\" the Brazilian government said in a statement Thursday, according to Reuters.",
      "The statement came just after Brazil's Congress approved a bill that would give President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva a legal framework to respond to international tariffs, including with countermeasures such as retaliatory tariffs.",
      "The government statement said Brazil remained open to negotiations with the U.S., and it rejected the White House's characterization of the 10% levy as \"reciprocal,\" saying that assessment does not \"reflect reality.\"",
      "Lula said previously that Mr. Trump's decision to impose tariffs on America's trading partners risked damaging the U.S. economy, and he said Brazil would lodge a formal complaint with the WTO over a separate levy on Brazilian steel exports.",
      "\"It will raise the prices of goods and could lead to [U.S.] inflation that he hasn't yet realized,\" Lula said, according to Reuters. \"Protectionism doesn't help any country in the world.\"",
      "Vietnam",
      "Vietnam was among the nations hardest hit by Mr. Trump's tariff salvo on Wednesday, with the U.S. leader announcing 46% tariffs on exports from the Asian manufacturing hub. Its exports to the U.S. have flourished for years under the so-called China+1 strategy, which has seen Chinese manufacturers get around existing U.S. tariffs on their country by moving some production to other, less-heavily tariffed nations in the region.",
      "Vietnamese officials did not immediately signal any plan to impose retaliatory measures.",
      "As the nation's benchmark stock index appeared on course for its biggest single-day drop in four years and its currency hit an all-time low, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh declared a new task force dedicated to addressing the rapidly changing economic situation after holding a cabinet meeting early Thursday.",
      "Cambodia",
      "The French news agency AFP spoke Thursday with Penn Sovicheat, a spokesman for Cambodia's commerce ministry, who blasted the Trump administration's imposition of a 49% levy on the country's exports as \"not reasonable.\"",
      "The White House says Cambodia is among the nations, like Vietnam and Laos, that have developed their own economies by inviting Chinese investment under the China+1 strategy, enabling Chinese manufacturers to skirt existing U.S. trade barriers. According to Sovicheat, Cambodia exported about $10 billion worth of goods to the U.S. in 2024, largely clothing.",
      "\"China has turned Cambodia into the most important transshipment hub that Communist China uses to evade our tariffs,\" a White House official told reporters this week.",
      "Sovicheat acknowledged that American imports to Cambodia, which he said amounted to around $264 million worth of goods last year, were taxed at an average of 29.4%, but the White House figures Mr. Trump unveiled Wednesday claim the Asian nation has tariffs and other trade barriers in place on U.S. goods amounting to 97%.",
      "\"The 49% tariffs is not a good image for Cambodian industry or our investment attraction,\" Sovicheat told AFP, adding that the government was hoping to negotiate a trade agreement with the Trump administration through existing entities such as the ASEAN trade bloc or the World Trade Organization.",
      "Cambodian Commerce Minister Cham Nimul said in remarks aired by state TV that U.S. consumers would feel the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs on his country before Cambodians, according to the AFP.",
      "\"The increase in tariffs means that the U.S. people who make the purchase orders of Cambodian products are the first people to be impacted, and next will be Cambodia and business people,\" she was quoted as saying.",
      "Australia",
      "Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Thursday that Mr. Trump's 10% tariffs were \"not unexpected, but let me be clear, they are totally unwarranted.\"",
      "\"This is not the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, who, in addition to his frustration, appeared perplexed by the fact that the White House tariffs singled out some of his country's tiny, far-flung territories, including a group of islands that are home to lots of penguins, but no people.",
      "Norfolk Island is an inhabited Australian territory, but only by about 2,000 people, and Albanese called it \"a bit strange\" that it had been singled out by the White House and hit with an even greater tariff of 29%, nearly three times higher than the Australian mainland.",
      "The uninhabited Heard Island and McDonald Islands were subject to the same 10% levy as mainland Australia, meanwhile, despite them rarely seeing human footprints due to \"the extreme isolation\" and the \"persistently severe weather and sea conditions\" in the sub-Antarctic area.",

    "story": [
      "Life-sized statues of a man and a woman were discovered in a tomb in Pompeii, researchers said, thousands of years after a deadly volcano wiped out the ancient Roman city.",
      "Researchers say the nearly life-size figures shed new light on life and religion in Pompeii, which was destroyed when Mt. Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D.",
      "The discovery was made while researchers from the archaeological site and the University of Valencia worked on an excavation focused on the necropolis of Porta Sarno, which was just outside the city, according to a news release. The site served as a burial ground, and was discovered in the 1990s during railway construction. Since 1998, researchers have found evidence of over 50 cremation burials in the necropolis. The current excavation, called \"Investigating the Archaeology of Death in Pompeii,\" has been ongoing since July 2024.",
      "The statues were found in the southern half of the tomb, covered in pumice stone, according to a report by the researchers. The pumice stone indicated that this part of the tomb had been buried in earthquakes shortly before the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius.",
      "The figures are a funerary relief, the researchers said. The couple may have been married and appear to have been \"well-to-do,\" according to the researchers.",
      "\"The delicacy and detail of the sculpture is remarkable,\" the researchers wrote. \"We can appreciate the careful carving of the hands, fingers and nails. We can also see the detailed work on the folds of the clothing and the ornaments: rings, bracelets, necklace, etc.\"",
      "The woman's figure includes carved accessories that may indicate she was a priestess of Ceres, a Roman harvest and fertility goddess. Researchers said that it is likely only women from prominent families held this position. Priestesses wielded political power and had the highest social standing possible for Roman women. Statues of priestesses holding items associated with their positions are very rare in southern Italy, the researchers said.",
      "The man is wearing a toga indicating that he is a Roman citizen. Both are depicted wearing rings that may be wedding bands.",
      "Other relics, including ointment jars that may have held perfumed oil, a broken mirror and a coin depicting the sea god Neptune were also found in the tomb. These items may have been important in funerary rites, the researchers said.",
      "The statues may date back to the late Republican period, which ranged from 133 to 31 B.C., the researchers said.",
      "The statues have been transferred to another part of Pompeii for restoration work. They will be featured in an exhibition that focuses on womanhood in ancient Pompeii, which will open on April 16. The restoration will be carried out in front of exhibition visitors, the park said.",
      "Other major finds have been unearthed in Pompeii in recent months. In February, paintings depicting Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, were discovered. The images were painted on the walls of a large banquet room. In January, archaeologists excavated a large private bathhouse that included multiple rooms and a plunge pool.",

    "story": [
      "Miller Gardner, the youngest son of former New York Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, died on March 21 at the age of 14 while on vacation with his family in Costa Rica.",
      "Carbon monoxide poisoning was the cause of death, authorities in Costa Rica confirmed on April 2.\u00a0High levels of the toxic gas had been detected\u00a0in testing of the family's hotel room.",
      "Here is what we know about Miller Gardner's death.",
      "What happened to Miller Gardner?",
      "Miller Gardner's parents said in a statement that he died in his sleep after he and several other family members fell ill while vacationing. They did not elaborate on who else had gotten sick, what specific illness they were dealing with or what symptoms they had experienced.",
      "Where were the Gardners staying?",
      "The Gardners were vacationing at the Arenas Del Mar Beachfront & Rainforest Resort, which is along Costa Rica's Pacific coast, some 50 miles south of San Jos\u00e9.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by this loss, and our hearts go out to the family during this incredibly difficult time,\" the resort said in a statement on Tuesday, March 25. \"The factors that led to this tragic incident are unknown, and we are fully cooperating with authorities as they investigate. We remain committed to supporting our guests and staff, prioritizing their well-being and safety, while respecting the privacy of those affected.\"",
      "The resort also told CBS News that hotel staff responded to the incident according to protocol, saying: \"The hotel staff dispatched a medical team immediately, including a licensed doctor, which arrived to handle the emergency situation. Any medical attention to the family was done by medical professionals. Our staff did not administer any medical treatment.\"",
      "What are officials saying about the cause of death?",
      "Randall Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, director of the Judicial Investigation Agency, or OIJ, said on March 31 that investigators conducted testing in the hotel room where Gardner was staying and found high levels of carbon monoxide, which he said may have been caused by machinery in the room next door. The contamination they found led investigators to believe Gardner \"may have died from inhaling these highly dangerous gases,\" Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said.",
      "The cause of death was confirmed after Gardner was tested for carboxyhemoglobin, a compound generated when\u00a0carbon monoxide\u00a0binds to hemoglobin in the blood, according to Z\u00fa\u00f1iga. The test showed a carboxyhemoglobin saturation of 64%. Saturation is considered lethal when it exceeds 50%.",
      "The head of Costa Rica's judicial police also said that a \"layer\" was detected during the autopsy on Gardner's organs. That layer forms due to a high presence of carbon monoxide.",
      "Carbon monoxide\u00a0is an odorless gas produced by the burning of fossil fuels in equipment such as cars, furnaces, stoves, certain heaters and generators.\u00a0Symptoms\u00a0of carbon monoxide poisoning may include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and confusion.",
      "Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said the investigation was \"closely coordinated\" with the FBI.",
      "The hotel told CBS News in a statement on March 31 that it was \"diligently cooperating with the Costa Rican judicial authorities, who have taken over the investigation.\"",
      "\"We trust that the forensic process will objectively, clearly, and conclusively clarify the causes of this unfortunate incident,\" the hotel said.",
      "The OIJ director had said it was conducting three types of analyses, including a toxicology report, at its forensic science laboratories.",
      "Why did early reports say the cause was food poisoning or \"food intoxication\"?",
      "Asphyxiation was initially thought to be the cause of death, although that theory was ruled out after an autopsy performed by the Forensic Pathology Section. An initial statement had said: \"Preliminary reports indicate the cause of death is asphyxiation following possible food poisoning.\"",
      "Some news outlets quoted a local official who cited possible \"food intoxication,\" but there is no condition by that name, and it appears in this context to have meant the same thing as food poisoning.",
      "Following the reports of possible food poisoning, Hotel La Mariposa, located less than a mile from where the Gardners were staying, released a statement to address what it called \"misinformation circulating on social media.\"",
      "\"The Gardner family dined at our restaurant, Le Papillon, on the afternoon of Tuesday, March 18, 2025\u2014three days before Miller's tragic passing. Any claims suggesting a link between our restaurant and this heartbreaking event are entirely false and unfounded,\" the restaurant said. \"Any news, statements, or claims to the contrary do not reflect the reality of the situation. Furthermore, we do not have any additional information, as the Gardner family did not stay at our hotel.\" The hotel also extended its \"heartfelt condolences to the Gardner family.\"",
      "The Arenas Del Mar resort, where the Gardners were staying, said in a statement, \"The family did not eat at any of Arenas Del Mar's restaurants for lunch or dinner the previous day. Additionally, on March 14th, we had an inspection by the Health Ministry in which the hotel passed with a 98.5 out of 100.\"",
      "What has the Gardner family said?",
      "In a statement before the cause of death was confirmed, Miller Gardner's parents, Brett and Jessica Gardner, said they had \"so many questions and so few answers.\"",
      "\"Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile,\" they said. \"He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.\"",
      "\"We are so thankful to all who have reached out to offer support and encouragement during this difficult time and we are confident our faith, family, and friends will help us navigate this unimaginable loss,\" their statement continued. \"Our prayers go out to Miller's teammates and friends, as well as to all other families who have lost a child far too soon as we share their grief.\"",
      "An\u00a0obituary\u00a0posted online described Miller Gardner as an Honor Roll student who played football and baseball and loved traveling with his family.",

    "story": [
      "San Jose, Costa Rica \u2014 Carbon monoxide poisoning was the cause of death of the teenage son of former New York Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, authorities in Costa Rica confirmed Wednesday night. They had reported earlier this week that it was suspected, after high levels of the toxic gas were detected in testing of the family's hotel room.",
      "Randall Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, director of the Judicial Investigation Agency, or OIJ, said they tested the body of 14-year-old Miller Gardner for carboxyhemoglobin, a compound generated when carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin in the blood.",
      "When carboxyhemoglobin saturation exceeds 50%, it is considered lethal. In Gardner's case, the test showed a saturation of 64%.",
      "\"It's important to note that adjacent to this room is a dedicated machine room, where it's believed there may be some type of contamination toward these rooms,\" Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said.",

We trust that the forensic process will objectively, clearly, and conclusively clarify the causes of this unfortunate incident.\"",
      "Asphyxiation was initially thought to have caused his death, but after an autopsy was performed by the Forensic Pathology Section, that theory was ruled out.

      "The Jalisco cartel is among other criminal groups in Mexico that have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.",
      "While the image was met by applause during the concert, Jalisco prosecutors quickly announced they were summoning the band to testify in an investigation into whether they were promoting violence, a crime which could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison. The state of Michoacan also announced an investigation into the Los Alegres del Barranco for projecting the same images during a concert in the city of Uruapan.",

      "The band was scheduled to play in Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 4. While the event hasn't been publicly canceled, ticket sales websites read: \"No tickets available for now on our site\" for that date.",
      "\"You can't justify violence or criminal groups\"",
      "The dispute coincides with a larger cultural debate in Mexico as artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano usher in a global renaissance of Mexican regional music, by mixing classic ballads with trap music. In 2023, Peso Pluma beat Taylor Swift out as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "Many of the artists now topping the charts have come under fierce criticism because their lyrics often paint cartel leaders as Robin Hood-esque figures. Others say that the genre, known as \"narco corridos,\" expresses the harsh realities of many youths across Mexico.",
      "A number of Mexican states have banned public performances of the music in recent years, the most recent being the state of Nayarit in February. Some of the bans have come as famed artists have received death threats from cartels, forcing a number of them to cancel their performances.",
      "Others, including Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, have sought a less aggressive approach to addressing the genre. Sheinbaum, who has come out against censoring the music, has suggested instead that the Mexican government push forward initiatives that promote Mexican regional music with more socially acceptable lyrics.",

      "The president, who signed an executive order to impose the tariffs, insisted the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of are \"over.\" The reciprocal tariffs, Mr. Trump said, will amount to roughly half the tariff rate those countries impose on U.S. exports, or less. Countries that will see tariffs higher than 10% include the European Union, China and Israel.",
      "Senior administration officials said the 10% worldwide tariffs take effect April 5 at 12:01 a.m., and the higher reciprocal tariffs go into effect on April 9 at 12:01 a.m.",
      "\"In short, chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life,\" the president said in a White House Rose Garden announcement. \"And for these reasons, starting tomorrow, the United States will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations.\"",
      "\"For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating, and because we are being very kind, we're a kind people, very kind,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You're not so kind when you're ripped off\u2026 We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.\"",

      "Canada and Mexico are not subject to these tariffs for now, senior administration officials said, but tariffs the president has already imposed, citing fentanyl and migration issues, persist.",

      "\"It's our declaration of economic independence,\" the president said in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Trump labeled Wednesday \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "The president lamented that the U.S. imports phones and other electronics, as well as pharmaceuticals, saying that if there's a war, the U.S. would struggle. He said his moves Wednesday are also standing up for U.S. farmers and ranchers who have been \"brutalized\" by other countries, specifically blasting Canada.",

      "\"In the first term, they said tariffs would crash the economy,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Instead, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.\"",
      "In the audience for the president's announcement were rank-and-file steelworkers and auto workers, House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as most of Mr. Trump's Cabinet, including Vice President JD Vance.",
      "What new tariffs did Trump announce today?",
      "The president says his plan will place a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on all countries, with reciprocal tariffs on many trading partners that have their own tariffs placed on the U.S. The 25% tariffs the president previously announced on foreign cars and foreign auto parts are set to go into effect at midnight.",
      "A White House official said the reciprocal tariffs are additive, meaning they will be imposed in addition to any previous tariffs already in place, unless a specific good is exempt under Section 232 of the Tariffs Act, which carries a flat 25% rate on certain things like steel and aluminum.",

      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday that tariffs are one tool to get companies to bring jobs back to the U.S.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and- and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here,\" Fain said. \"And, you know, invest in the American workers. The American working class people have been left behind for decades, and they're sick of it.\"",
      "What are tariffs, exactly?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S.\u00a0The most common type of tariffs are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value\"), which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of a product. The 25% auto tariffs are these types of tariffs.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, and \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold.",
      "What do financial experts say about tariffs?",
      "Economists and taxpayer advocacy groups have their doubts, and are warning tariffs could upset economic growth and will almost surely contribute to higher prices for American consumers. Some automakers have already announced higher car prices, after the president announced tariffs on foreign cars and parts.",
      "More than a dozen leaders at think tanks and taxpayer advocacy groups, including at the National Taxpayers Union, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, on Tuesday sent a joint letter to congressional leaders and the commerce and treasury secretaries, urging them to consider how tariffs on steel, lumber, energy, pharmaceutical and medical supplies and cars and car parts will increase prices.",
      "\"We encourage you to consider whether tariffs may, in many cases, undermine President Trump's broader long-term economic goals by increasing the cost of goods subject to tariffs,\" they wrote. \"We are especially concerned about tariffs on inputs needed by U.S. manufacturers that make it harder to compete with finished goods made abroad and tariffs that increase the price of necessities like food and housing.\"",
      "Alex Jacquez, who worked on the Biden White House National Economic Council, said that although it's hard to know the exact impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs without knowing all the details, CEOs are telling investors and shareholders they will be hiking prices.",
      "\"What the major retailers and companies who may be affected by tariffs are planning to do and they're planning out in public here is pass these costs along to consumers as much as they possibly can,\" Jacquez, now the chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "Colin Grabow, associate director at the libertarian Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, wrote in a USA Today op-ed that \"tariffs are a costly and inefficient tax usually borne by the importing country's customers.\"",
      "\"Americans may have voted for lower prices in November, but under the guise of tariff reciprocity, the Trump administration is set to deliver something very different,\" Grabow wrote.",
      "A reporter on Tuesday asked Leavitt if the president is thinking about seniors on fixed income who are stressed about the recent swings in the stock market, swings partly attributed to the president's tariff announcements. Stocks have struggled as Wall Street braces for the next round of tariffs.",
      "\"Well certainly, they are legitimate concerns and the president takes those concerns very seriously,\" Leavitt said. \"And he's addressing them every single day. And tomorrow's announcement is to protect future generations of the senior citizens you mentioned. It's for their kids and their grandkids, to ensure that there are jobs here in the United States of America for their children to live the American dream, just like they presumably did.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. citizen wife of a 29-year-old man who the Trump administration has admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador said she fears for his safety in the infamous mega-prison where he's being held, maintaining that her husband is \"an amazing father\" and \"not a criminal.\"",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador on March 15 and imprisoned inside that country's maximum-security prison known as CECOT, as part of a series of U.S. deportation flights that have ignited a high-stakes legal battle in American courts.",
      "The Trump administration has acknowledged in federal court that his deportation was an \"administrative error,\" since an immigration judge in 2019 had granted him legal protection from being sent to El Salvador. But it has rejected requests to bring back Abrego Garcia, saying the U.S. no longer has custody over him. It is also accusing him of being part of MS-13, a transnational criminal gang. Abrego Garcia's lawyers have said in court documents that their client has no criminal record, a finding the government has not contested.",
      "During an exclusive interview with CBS News, Jennifer, Abrego Garcia's wife, said she confirmed her husband had been deported from the U.S. and imprisoned at the CECOT prison after identifying him in a photo posted by the Salvadoran government.",
      "\"When I saw it, I immediately broke down 'cause I knew it was him,\" she said. \"I was scared for his life.\"",
      "Jennifer, who requested that her surname be withheld, said she was \"very scared\" about Abrego Garcia's transfer to CECOT because it houses some of El Salvador's most dangerous gang members. After all, she said, the reason a U.S. immigration judge in 2019 granted him a reprieve from deportation was because of concerns that he could be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador.",
      "\"I've seen news of that prison,\" she said. \"I know they take criminals there. And my husband's not a criminal.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. in 2011, when he was 16. According to court documents, he entered the country illegally, without being inspected by immigration officials.",
      "In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after an encounter with local police outside of a Maryland Home Depot. Abrego Garcia's attorneys said he went there looking for work. He remained in ICE detention for months, while an immigration judge reviewed his case.",
      "Court documents show an immigration judge initially denied Abrego Garcia's release on bond, partially due to information submitted by the government that it said tied him to MS-13. The judge's bond denial, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board, mentioned information from an informant who the government deemed to be credible.",
      "But Abrego Garcia was ultimately released from ICE custody after another immigration judge granted him \"withholding of removal,\" a legal classification that bars officials from deporting individuals who prove they are more likely than not to face persecution in their home country. In his order, the judge said Abrego Garcia could be targeted by gangs if sent to El Salvador.",
      "Jennifer said her husband attended regular check-ins with ICE after he was released. He became their family's main breadwinner, she added, and helped her raise their 5-year-old disabled son, as well as two children from a previous relationship. He worked five days a week as a sheet metal worker while also attending college classes, she said.",

      "Hegseth, in Tokyo on Sunday, called Japan an \"indispensable partner\" in deterring Chinese assertiveness and announced an upgrade of the U.S. military command in Japan to a new \"war-fighting headquarters.\" He stressed the need for the U.S. and Japan to do more to strengthen their military capability as the region faces China's rising assertiveness in its myriad territorial disputes in the region.",
      "\"Japan is our indispensable partner in deterring Communist Chinese military aggression,\" Hegseth said at the beginning of his talks with Japan's Defense Minister Gen Nakatani in Tokyo. \"The U.S. is moving fast, as you know, to reestablish deterrence in this region and around the world.\"",

    "summary": "Top ICE official calls removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia on deportation flight that sent him to a supermax prison in El Salvador an \"administrative error.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration admitted in a court filing Monday that an \"administrative error\" and an \"oversight\" resulted in a Salvadoran man's deportation and imprisonment in a supermax prison in El Salvador, despite a legal order prohibiting his removal there.",
      "Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office director Robert Cerna said that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was removed from the U.S. on March 15 as part of a series of deportation flights that sent hundreds of alleged gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador, even though an immigration judge had granted him a legal protection from deportation.",
      "Those flights are at the center of a court battle between the Justice Department and U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg, who blocked further deportations of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members under the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The March 15 deportation flights transported 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadorans, all of whom Trump administration officials described as members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs. Lawyers and relatives of many of the Venezuelans have strongly denied claims that their clients and loved ones are gang members.",
      "The filings were made as part of a suit filed by attorneys for Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man and Maryland resident who received a legal status known as \"withholding of removal\" in 2019 after an immigration judge found that Abrego Garcia, who left his native country in 2011 at age 16, could face persecution by gangs if deported to El Salvador. His case was first reported by The Atlantic late Monday.",
      "Although the Trump administration concedes it made a mistake when it deported Abrego Garcia, it is opposing a request for him to be brought back to the U.S. The government has argued Abrego Garcia is a danger to the community, alleging that he's a member of the MS-13 gang.",
      "The Justice Department has also argued that federal courts lack the authority to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, since he's now being held by the Salvadoran government and no longer in U.S. custody. Even if they did have the power to order his return, the Justice Department said in a filing, there has been \"no showing that El Salvador is even inclined to consider a request to release a detainee at the United States' request.\"",
      "Attorney Simon Sandoval-Mosheberg called the Trump administration's refusal to try to get his client back \"appalling.\"",
      "\"I've had wrongful deportation cases before, including in the last Trump administration and in every single such case, as soon as they realize what they've done, they bent over backwards,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Abrego Garcia was living in Maryland, alongside his wife and their disabled 5-year-old son, both of whom are U.S. citizens, according to the court filings submitted by his lawyers. Before he was arrested by ICE last month, Abrego Garcia was routinely attending check-ins with the agency, the filings said. His lawyers said he has no criminal record in the U.S., a finding the government has not disputed.",
      "In 2019, Abrego Garcia was standing outside of a Home Depot in Hyattsville, Maryland, soliciting work with three other men when he was arrested. His attorney said he was questioned about whether he was a gang member, and when he told police he was not, the police said they didn't believe him and said they were calling ICE.",
      "During immigration proceedings, Abrego Garcia's attorneys said the only evidence the government provided in support of his gang affiliation was that he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie and that a confidential informant said he was an active MS-13 member in a branch of the gang that operates on Long Island, New York, where Abrego Garcia's attorneys say he has never lived.",
      "\"He's not a gang member. The allegations against him are based on whispers and shadows,\" Sandoval-Mosheberg said.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys wrote in their initial complaint\u00a0that their client's name was not included in a Hyattsville City Police Department report about the Home Depot arrest, and said that the detective who authored the gang affiliation part of the report had been suspended.",
      "An immigration judge ruled that the informant's testimony was \"proven and reliable,\" but said that he should not be deported to El Salvador.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Abrego Garcia is \"a member of the brutal MS-13 gang and was reportedly involved in human trafficking. Whether he be in El Salvador or a detention facility in the U.S. he should be locked up.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance responded to media reports about the deportation on Tuesday, posting on X that \"It is telling that the entire American media is going to run a propaganda operation today making you think an innocent 'father of 3' was apprehended by a gulag,\" adding that Abrego Garcia \"is an illegal immigrant with no right to be in our country.\"",

      "Through his discussions with people on the street for Medtronic, Savage has uncovered key lifestyle factors affecting longevity. He noted a cultural shift in what we consider to be old age, highlighting that people today consider themselves \"young-ish\" for longer.",
      "Savage also pointed to Blue Zones, regions known for long life expectancy, but questioned whether longevity there stems simply from location or cultural practices.",
      "\"We assume people in these areas live longer because of where they are, but what if it\u2019s really just the way they live? That\u2019s the part that fascinates me,\" he said.\u00a0AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS",
      "\"There\u2019s no magic secret. It\u2019s a mix of daily habits \u2014 what you eat, how you move, how you interact with your community, how you handle stress. All those things matter.\"",
      "Savage has taken a personal interest in testing different longevity strategies in his own life. He spoke candidly with Fox News Digital about his journey with intermittent fasting, which helped him lose 25 pounds and eliminate sleep apnea.",
      "\"It\u2019s crazy how much of a difference it made,\" he said. \"I didn\u2019t just lose weight. I felt sharper, I slept better and I stopped snoring. It was like flipping a switch on my health.\"",
      "He also reflected on his past smoking habits and what it took to quit.",
      "\"I had to admit I wasn\u2019t smoking for enjoyment,\" Savage said. \"I was just doing it out of habit. Once I realized that, it was easy to quit.\"",
      "Medtronic is investigating how science can extend our lives. Savage believes that lifestyle choices and community have been beneficial in his own life. (iStock)",
      "On alcohol, Savage dismissed the idea of a universal approach, arguing that studies conflict. While he personally cut back, he emphasized that people shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about their lifestyle choices.",
      "\"I'm a big believer in not feeling guilty about the things that you do to the core, whether it's smoking, whether it's watching something dumb or puzzling for 100 hours at a time,\" he said. \"I don't care about any of those. We all do these things to sort of bring relaxation and down regulate. I just think that alcohol is an especially poor down regulator in the final analysis.\"",
      "Beyond lifestyle choices, medical advancements are playing an increasingly critical role in extending both lifespan and \"healthspan,\" the years we live without serious disease. Medtronic, which focuses on healthcare technology globally, has developed medical devices designed to manage chronic conditions, improve heart health and advance minimally invasive surgeries.",
      "According to Medtronic, as people live longer, the focus is shifting toward enhancing not just lifespan but quality of life. The company\u2019s latest innovations include artificial intelligence-driven healthcare monitoring, robotic-assisted surgeries and advanced pacemakers, all aimed at improving long-term health outcomes. Savage also spoke about the psychological aspects of aging, emphasizing that mindset and community play a significant role in longevity.",
      "Medtronic claims the first person to live to 150 may already have been born. When asked if there is an upper limit to human life, Savage replied, \"I think right now 150 is a very realistic target to be shooting for and to be discussing.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"That's really what science foreshadowing is,\" added Savage. \"It's about asking these questions and seeing, \u2018OK, what numbers are unrealistic.\u2019 I think 40 years ago, 150 would have seemed radically unrealistic. Today it seems more realistic, and I think it's entirely reasonable that, let's say, by 2040, we may all have a different cultural answer to that question.\"",

      "Getting into the groove of living a healthy lifestyle \u2014 from making sure to engage in consistent exercise plus eating a balanced diet \u2014 can sometimes feel like a heavy lift.",
      "Dr. John Whyte, WebMD chief medical officer, recently spoke with Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview in New York about the power of proper nutrition for healthy living. (See the video at the top of this article.)",
      "\"Food really is medicine,\" he said. \"It's as powerful as a prescription drug. It impacts every system of your body.\"",
      "HEALTHY EATING IN MIDDLE AGE HAS THIS KEY LONGEVITY BENEFIT",
      "Knowing what to eat and which diets to try can get \"easily overwhelming,\" Whyte acknowledged.",
      "He recommended starting with a few simple steps to get into a healthy routine. Read on.",
      "Food can be \"as powerful as a prescription drug. It impacts every system of your body.\" (iStock)",

      "\"There's so much food that we consume that's processed and, even more concerning, ultraprocessed,\" he said.",

      "As an example, Whyte referenced \"blue zones,\" areas of the world where people live to be 100 and have a low incidence of dementia and heart disease.",
      "Residents in blue zones eat a primarily plant-based, whole-foods diet, he noted.",
      "\"Food really is medicine. It's as powerful as a prescription drug.\"",
      "\"They're not eating a lot of processed cookies, meats or snacks,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Health care took center stage during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0 And in the five years since, the industry has experienced change and innovation.",
      "The field of medicine has undergone significant changes since the COVID-19 pandemic, with the biggest breakthrough right at our fingertips: telemedicine.\u00a0 While it may feel like a \"normal\" part of healthcare now, connected technology dominated how Americans saw doctors during the pandemic. \"Before the pandemic, virtual care was available, but it was not widely used. Now telemedicine is mainstream,\" says Dr. Michael Aziz, an Attending Physician at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital.",
      "According to one study, telemedicine encounters increased 766% in the first three months of the COVID outbreak. And while use of the 2-D technology has tapered off, Dr. Aziz, believes still plays a vital role in medical care, \"Especially for people in rural areas. Especially for young professionals. And it offers convenience. But we have so many barriers when it comes to telemedicine.... especially for senior citizens,\u2019 he explains, \"Also, the government has put some many roadblocks for patients to use that. One is the cost. There's a cost associated with that. It's not covered by many insurance.\"",
      "Experts say while telemedicine has been revolutionary, it's best suited for certain ailments, particularly psychiatric services.\u00a0 Dr. Chris Ivany, Psychiatrist and COO of Family Care Center, emphasizes, \"I think it's clear to say that the pandemic certainly had a immediate and negative effect on many Americans' mental health.\"",
      "A recent Gallup poll shows adults 18 to 49 reported a steep drop in their mental health since 2020, with many suffering from depression, anxiety, and isolation.\u00a0 This has led to an increase in Americans seeking help post-crisis.\u00a0 Dr. Ivany notes, \"The stigma to seeking mental health care is definitely decreased over the course of the past five or so years.... but also, in part to just a general recognition that mental health care is part of health care overall.\"\u00a0 Dr. Ivany points to two main reasons we're seeing a growth in mental health care, \"Part of what the pandemic has done is to raise the awareness of mental health issues, challenges across the American population in a way that really hadn't been done really in the past.... And I think the second is the field now is much more flexible in terms of how care can be delivered to people.\"",
      "Another challenge changing the landscape of the industry, a significant reduction in staffing. Dr. Aziz says, \"About 3000 healthcare professionals have died and about 100,000 have retired or changed career... Hospitals have a hard time not only hiring physicians and health care workers, but they have a hard time retaining them.\"",
      "While telemedicine has been a game changer, it\u2019s not the only major innovation to emerge from the pandemic. The production and rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, along with advancements in rapid testing and antigen tests, are also transformative innovations born out of the pandemic."

      "President Donald Trump predicts US will ultimately flourish and 'boom' because of his tariffs plan.",
      "For decades, President Donald Trump has remained a staunch advocate for tariffs \u2014 routinely declaring the word one of the most beautiful in the dictionary and regularly accusing foreign countries of ripping off the U.S.",
      "Following through on 2024 campaign promises and building upon policies his first administration introduced, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs at the White House\u2019s Rose Garden on Wednesday for a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event as part of a day his administration dubbed \"Liberation Day\" for the U.S.",
      "While some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have voiced concern over the policy, tariffs are an area where Trump\u2019s views have remained incredibly consistent over the years, as he has routinely decried that other countries have treated the U.S. unfairly in trade deals.",
      "For example, Trump wrote in his 2011 book, \"Time to Get Tough: Making America #1 Again!\" that he backed a solid 20% tariff on all foreign items imported into the U.S. and singled out China as a high offender.",
      "\"I want foreign countries to finally start forking over cash in order to have access to our markets,\" Trump wrote in the book, according to an excerpt. \"So here\u2019s the deal: any foreign country shipping goods into the United States pays a 20 percent tax. If they want a piece of the American market, they\u2019re going to pay for it. No more free admission into the biggest show in town \u2014 and that especially includes China.\"",

      "Trump also boasted about the benefits of tariffs during his campaign in the election for his first run at president, when he outlined his trade priorities during a June 2016 Pennsylvania speech.",
      "\"Our original Constitution did not even have an income tax,\" Trump said at the event. \"Instead, it had tariffs emphasizing taxation of foreign, not domestic, production. Yet today, 240 years after the Revolution, we've turned things completely upside down.",
      "President Donald Trump speaks during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" trade announcement event in the Rose Garden at the White House on Wednesday. (Getty Images)",
      "\"We tax and regulate and restrict our companies to death, and then we allow foreign countries that cheat to export their goods to us tax-free,\" Trump said. \"How stupid is this? How could it happen? How stupid is this. As a result, we have become more dependent on foreign countries than ever before. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to declare our economic independence once again.\"",
      "Following Trump\u2019s victory in the 2016 election, Trump moved to impose a series of tariffs on countries and various products, including 25% duties on steel and 10% duties on aluminum from most countries, and others targeting China. In response to these tariffs, China issued its own retaliatory tariffs that cost the U.S. federal government billions of dollars in government aid to farmers who suffered financial losses due to the retaliation on their agricultural exports.",
      "Critiques of other countries' trade practices have continued into Trump\u2019s second administration, and he has routinely blamed them for allegedly engaging in unfair trade practices against the U.S.",
      "He also argues that tariffs will help return manufacturing jobs to the U.S. As a result, he and his administration have called for employing tariffs to address the nation\u2019s 2024 record $1.2 trillion trade deficit.",

      "\"For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,\" Trump said Wednesday.",
      "Earlier in 2025, the Trump administration imposed up to 25% tariffs on certain goods from Mexico and Canada, as well as a 20% tariff on shipments from China. The White House said that tariffs already imposed on Canada and Mexico will remain in place; however, new tariffs on China will be added on top of existing duties on Beijing.",
      "Tariffs function as a tax that governments collect on foreign goods and services that manufacturers import, and are collected while undergoing customs clearance in foreign ports, according to the International Trade Administration.",

      "The new tariff plan sets out a baseline duty of 10% on imports to the U.S., while customized tariffs are set for countries, like China, which have higher duties in place on American goods.",
      "\"If you want your tariff rate to be zero, then you build your product right here in America,\" Trump said Wednesday at the White House.",
      "The tariffs are slated to impact a variety of goods, including electronics like iPhones that are predominantly manufactured in China, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. They are also expected to hit goods like wine and other alcohols originating from European Union countries like Italy.",
      "Both parties in Congress have voiced opposition to the new tariffs and have warned that the tariffs will raise prices for American consumers.",
      "For countries considering implementing their own tariffs against U.S. products in retaliation, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent issued a simple message: \"Don\u2019t.\"",
      "\"My advice to every country right now: Do not retaliate,\" Bessent said in a Wednesday interview with Fox News Wednesday. \"If you retaliate, there will be escalation.\"",

    "summary": "Experts say hackers who used to focus on Windows operating systems are increasingly targeting Apple IDs as part of a new phishing campaign.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent David Spunt has more on the \"sophisticated penetration\" of several carriers on \"Special Report.\"",
      "If there\u2019s one thing that has become clear over the past year, it\u2019s that Apple devices are not as secure as the company wants you to believe.",
      "We\u2019re four months into 2025 and there have already been over 10 instances in which attackers specifically targeted Apple users, and these are just the incidents we know of.",
      "I\u2019ll admit no device is foolproof, but there seems to be a growing trend where bad actors prefer targeting Apple users over other platforms. In fact, security researchers have recently identified a new phishing campaign in which hackers, who previously focused on Windows, are now setting their sights on Apple IDs.",

      "A person working on an Apple laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0LayerX Labs have uncovered a new phishing campaign that specifically targets Mac users, marking a shift from its previous focus on Windows. The attackers initially lured Windows users with fake Microsoft security alerts designed to steal login credentials. However, after Microsoft, Chrome and Firefox implemented new security features to block these attacks, the hackers started redirecting their efforts toward Mac users instead.",
      "The new attack closely mirrors its predecessor but with key modifications. The phishing pages have been redesigned to resemble Apple\u2019s security warnings, making them appear legitimate to macOS users. The attack code has also been adjusted to specifically detect macOS and Safari users, ensuring that only Apple users see the fraudulent pages.",
      "Plus, despite shifting their focus, the attackers continue to host these phishing pages on Microsoft\u2019s Windows[.]net domain. Since this is a trusted Microsoft platform, it allows the phishing pages to evade detection by security tools that assess risk based on domain reputation.",

      "FBI WARNS OF DANGEROUS NEW \u2018SMISHING\u2019 SCAM TARGETING YOUR PHONE",
      "How victims are lured in",
      "The phishing campaign exploits common yet highly effective methods called typosquatting and malicious redirects. Victims often end up on these phishing pages after making a simple mistake, such as mistyping a URL while trying to visit a legitimate website.",
      "Instead of reaching the intended site, they land on a compromised domain parking page. From there, they are redirected through multiple websites before ultimately arriving at the phishing page, which presents a fake Apple security warning. Believing their Apple ID is at risk, victims are tricked into entering their credentials, unknowingly handing them over to the attackers.",
      "One notable case involved a person using Safari who was working at a business secured by a Secure Web Gateway. Despite the organization\u2019s security measures, the phishing attempt managed to bypass the gateway\u2019s protections.",

      "7 ways to stay safe from attackers targeting Apple users",
      "Phishing campaigns are increasingly targeting macOS users, but you\u2019re not defenseless. Here are four essential steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0A reliable antivirus program is your first line of defense against phishing attempts and malicious websites. While Apple\u2019s built-in security features provide some protection, they aren\u2019t foolproof, especially against sophisticated phishing attacks that mimic legitimate Apple warnings. A robust antivirus solution can detect and block malicious sites before you even reach them, preventing you from accidentally entering your credentials on a fraudulent page. Additionally, advanced security software can identify suspicious redirects and alert you before you fall victim to typosquatting traps.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Keep your software up to date:\u00a0Regular\u00a0updates to macOS and your applications aren\u2019t just about new features. They\u2019re critical patches that fix security vulnerabilities. Attackers are quick to exploit any weakness, so ensuring your operating system and all installed software are current minimizes the risk of a breach. Enable automatic updates where possible so you\u2019re always protected by the latest security enhancements.",
      "3. Regularly monitor your Apple ID activity: Even with strong security measures in place, it\u2019s important to keep an eye on your Apple ID account for any signs of unauthorized access. Apple allows users to review their account activity, including devices logged into the account and recent changes. Regularly check your Apple ID settings to ensure that only trusted devices are connected and that no suspicious activity has occurred. If you notice anything unusual, such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, immediately change your password and remove unauthorized devices. This proactive approach can help you catch potential breaches early and minimize damage.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Strong, unique passwords for every account are essential, but they\u2019re even more effective when combined with\u00a0two-factor authentication. Even if attackers manage to steal your credentials through a phishing attack,\u00a02FA adds an extra barrier that makes unauthorized access significantly harder. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use a recovery key for enhanced security: Apple offers an optional feature called a recovery key, which is a 28-character code that provides an extra layer of security for your Apple ID. When you enable a recovery key, Apple disables its standard account recovery process, meaning you\u2019ll need this key, along with access to a trusted device or phone number, to reset your password or regain access to your account. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to take control of your account.",
      "To set up a recovery key, go to\u00a0Settings > [Your Name] > Sign-in & Security > Recovery Key on your iPhone, iPad or Mac. Follow the prompts to generate and confirm your recovery key. Be sure to write it down and store it in a secure location, such as a safe or with a trusted family member. Keep in mind that losing both your recovery key and access to trusted devices can permanently lock you out of your account. However, if used responsibly, this feature gives you greater control over your account\u2019s security.",
      "6. Enable biometric authentication: Apple devices offer advanced\u00a0biometric authentication options like Face ID and Touch ID, which provide an extra layer of security. These features make it significantly harder for attackers to gain access to your device or sensitive accounts, even if they manage to steal your credentials. Enable biometric authentication wherever possible, especially for apps and services that store personal or financial information. Since biometric data is unique to you, it adds a level of protection that passwords alone cannot provide.",
      "7. Practice safe browsing:\u00a0Many attacks rely on simple user mistakes, such as mistyping a URL or clicking on suspicious links. Always verify that you\u2019re visiting legitimate websites before entering any personal information. Be skeptical of unexpected security alerts, even if they mimic Apple\u2019s design. Learning to identify the subtle signs of phishing, like unusual URL structures or generic greetings, can help you avoid falling for these scams.",
      "HOW TO PROTECT YOUR IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Apple has long sold the idea that its ecosystem is inherently safer than the alternatives, but that claim is starting to wear thin. The reality is that attackers are no longer ignoring Mac users, they\u2019re actively targeting them, and Apple\u2019s response has been anything but proactive. While Microsoft, Google and others roll out new security measures to counter evolving threats, Apple remains slow to adapt, relying on outdated assumptions about its platform\u2019s safety.",

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Implement strong password policies and use a password manager: Ensure all passwords are unique, at least 15 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Also, consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely. This reduces the risk of password reuse and weak passwords, which are common entry points for ransomware attacks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "3. Educate and train employees on cybersecurity awareness:\u00a0Many ransomware attacks start with phishing emails or social engineering tactics. As seen in the scam targeting executives, attackers often use fear-based tactics to manipulate victims into acting quickly. Train your employees, particularly high-level executives, to recognize suspicious emails, fraudulent requests and phishing attempts.",
      "4. Backup data and maintain a secure recovery plan:\u00a0Data backups are a critical safeguard against ransomware. Regularly back up critical data to secure, offline locations that ransomware cannot access. Testing your recovery plans frequently ensures that if an attack does occur, you can recover quickly with minimal impact on operations. In addition, consider using a cloud service with encryption to ensure that even if an attack happens, the backup remains safe.",
      "5.\u00a0Utilize two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Two-factor authentication is an essential security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to sensitive systems and data. With 2FA, even if attackers manage to obtain login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access critical systems without the second factor of authentication, whether it\u2019s a code sent to a phone or biometric verification.",
      "6. Verify threats before taking action:\u00a0If you receive a ransom demand (digital or physical), investigate its legitimacy. Scams often lack proof of data breaches or network compromise. Consult cybersecurity experts or law enforcement before responding.",
      "7. Report suspicious activity: Notify law enforcement or organizations like the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center if you encounter scams or ransomware threats. Reporting helps authorities track and mitigate these activities.",
      "FBI WARNS OF DANGEROUS NEW \u2018SMISHING\u2019 SCAM TARGETING YOUR PHONE",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Healthcare is seriously lagging when it comes to cybersecurity. It's crazy that so many health institutions don\u2019t have a CISO or a dedicated security team. Instead, the IT department, which isn\u2019t always trained in cybersecurity, gets stuck trying to handle it all. With so much sensitive data at risk, it\u2019s shocking that so many healthcare organizations still treat cybersecurity as an afterthought.",
      "Cyberattacks are only going to get worse, and unless the industry steps up its game, it\u2019s just a matter of time before more hospitals, clinics and health systems get hit. It\u2019s time to take security seriously.",

    "story": [
      "Cybercriminals are sending fake meeting invitations that seem legitimate.",
      "Google Chrome is the most popular browser in the world, and it is used by billions of people. However, its widespread usage also makes it a prime target for bad actors who exploit various methods, such as malicious extensions, phishing links and fake websites. The latest attack involves hackers exploiting a browser vulnerability to conduct espionage. Google has acknowledged the security flaw and has released an update to fix it.",

      "A man using Google Chrome on his laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "About the attack",
      "Cybersecurity researchers at Kaspersky recently discovered a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in Google Chrome. The attack was triggered when victims unknowingly clicked on a phishing link in an email, launching a malicious site in their browser. Shockingly, no further action was required. Simply opening the link was enough to infect the system.",
      "According to\u00a0Kaspersky\u2019s report, the malware was based on a zero-day vulnerability, later identified as CVE-2025-2783. Researchers say they analyzed the exploit, reverse-engineered its logic and uncovered that it allowed attackers to bypass Chrome\u2019s built-in security features as if they didn\u2019t exist.",
      "The vulnerability exploited Chrome's inter-process communication framework, known as Mojo, which is crucial for the browser's functionality. This allowed the attackers to execute malicious code across different processes within Chrome, effectively bypassing its security measures.",
      "\"We have discovered and reported dozens of zero-day exploits actively used in attacks, but this particular exploit is certainly one of the most interesting we\u2019ve encountered,\" Kaspersky noted.",
      "The cybersecurity team also highlighted the stealthy nature of the attack, which primarily targeted media professionals, educational institutions and government agencies. Dubbed \"Operation ForumTroll,\" the campaign appeared to have espionage as its primary goal.",

      "As with most security updates, Google is keeping the details under wraps until the majority of users have installed the fix. This is a standard precaution to prevent other hackers from exploiting the flaw, while some users are still unprotected. If the bug also affects third-party software, Google will continue restricting details until those platforms release their own patches.",

You can avoid all of this by installing strong antivirus software that will detect any potential threat before it can take over your device.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Many online accounts, including Google, offer two-factor authentication as an extra security measure.\u00a0Enabling 2FA ensures that even if a hacker obtains your password, they still need a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, to access your account. This simple step significantly reduces the chances of unauthorized access.",
      "3) Use a secure password manager:\u00a0A strong password is crucial, but remembering multiple complex passwords can be difficult. A password manager generates, stores and autofills strong passwords for your accounts, reducing the risk of password-related breaches. Avoid using the same password across different sites and always opt for long, unique passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This incident serves as yet another reminder that even the most secure systems are never truly invulnerable, especially when state-backed or highly skilled actors are in play. While Google\u2019s quick response is commendable, it also highlights the never-ending cat-and-mouse game between security teams and cybercriminals. If you are using Chrome, update it now.",

    "summary": "This phishing kit bypasses 2FA via session hijacking and real-time credential theft. Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson offers four ways to stay safe from Astaroth phishing attacks.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Phishing attacks are everywhere, and most of us can spot the obvious ones. Even if someone falls for one and hands over their password, two-factor authentication (2FA) usually adds a crucial layer of protection. But a new phishing kit making the rounds can bypass 2FA entirely by using session hijacking and real-time credential interception.",
      "Known as Astaroth, this tool intercepts and manipulates traffic between your device and legitimate authentication services like Gmail, Yahoo and Microsoft. Since it grabs everything in real time, it completely bypasses 2FA and gives attackers full access to your account.",
      "Stay protected & informed! Get security alerts & expert tech tips \u2013 sign up for Kurt\u2019s The CyberGuy Report now.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Astaroth works",
      "Astaroth is a next-level phishing kit that takes scamming to a whole new level. Instead of using basic fake login pages like traditional phishing kits, it works as a middleman between your device and the real authentication service while silently grabbing everything needed to break in.",
      "The attack begins when you click on a phishing link and land on a malicious site that looks identical to the real one. Since the site has valid SSL certificates, there are no red flags, no security warnings and no sketchy pop-ups. When you enter your login details, including username, password, device info and IP address, Astaroth snatches them up before passing the request to the actual website.",
      "Two-factor authentication is not a problem for Astaroth. It intercepts one-time passwords the second they are entered, whether they come from an authenticator app, SMS or a push notification. The stolen codes are instantly sent to the attacker through a web panel or Telegram alert, so they can use them before they expire.",
      "The real kicker is that Astaroth also grabs session cookies, which are the small bits of data that keep users logged in after authentication. Attackers can inject these cookies into their own browsers, skipping the need for passwords or two-factor authentication altogether. Once they have the session, they are in with no extra steps required.",
      "An example of what the victim and attacker would see (SlashNext) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR MAC, PC, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS - CYBERGUY PICKS",
      "Astaroth is shockingly advanced",
      "As reported by cybersecurity company\u00a0SlashNext, Astaroth stands out from other phishing kits because of its ability to intercept credentials in real time, automate attacks and resist takedown efforts. Traditional phishing depends on tricking victims into entering their credentials on fake login pages, but Astaroth removes that step entirely.",
      "Beyond its advanced capabilities, Astaroth comes with features that make it appealing to cybercriminals. It uses bulletproof hosting to stay online despite law enforcement efforts, receives frequent updates to bypass security patches and follows a structured payment model. For $2,000, buyers get six months of continuous upgrades. To build trust, the creators even let hackers test the phishing kit before purchasing.",
      "Astaroth is widely available through Telegram and underground cybercrime forums. The anonymity of these platforms makes it difficult for authorities to track distribution.",

      "Monitor bank accounts and email inboxes for suspicious activity",
      "4 ways to stay safe from Astaroth phishing attacks",
      "1) Avoid unknown links and use strong antivirus software: Remember that no matter how advanced the malware is, it still needs input from you. In most cases, an attacker will require you to click a link before they can steal your data. For example, for Astaroth to work, you have to click a link, visit a malicious website and enter your credentials. If you don\u2019t click the link, you stay clear of the malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS device.",
      "2) Double-check sites:\u00a0Always verify website addresses and use bookmarks for trusted sites. Instead of clicking on links in emails or messages, manually type the URL or use a trusted bookmark. This minimizes the risk of landing on a fraudulent page designed to mimic a legitimate website.",
      "3) Update your devices:\u00a0You might wonder how keeping your devices updated helps against malware like Astaroth. While it doesn\u2019t directly prevent an attack, it ensures the situation doesn\u2019t get worse.\u00a0Keeping your operating system and applications up to date with the latest security patches closes vulnerabilities that malware might exploit, making it harder for attackers to gain a foothold on your device.",
      "4) Avoid typing passwords:\u00a0Avoid entering passwords whenever possible to reduce the risk of credential theft. Instead, use authentication methods like passkeys, Google Sign-In or Apple Sign-In.",
      "A passkey is a feature that uses cryptographic key pairs to verify your identity, eliminating the need for traditional passwords. It allows you to sign in to apps and websites using the same process you use to unlock your device, such as biometrics, PIN or pattern.",
      "Google Sign-In is a feature that allows you to log in to third-party apps or websites using their Google Account credentials. It simplifies the sign-in process by eliminating the need to create and remember separate usernames and passwords for each service. You can sign in via a \"Sign in with Google\" button, a Google sign-in prompt or automatic sign-in if previously authorized.",
      "Apple Sign-In is a feature that enables you to privately sign in to participating third-party apps and websites using your Apple ID. It offers a fast, easy and more private way to authenticate without the need to create new accounts or remember additional passwords. To set up an account to \"Sign in with Apple,\" when a participating website or app asks you to set up or upgrade an account, do the following: Tap Sign in with Apple. Follow the onscreen instructions. Some apps (and websites) don\u2019t request your name and email address. In this case, you simply authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID (depending on your model), then start using the app.\u00a0Others may ask for your name and email address to set up a personalized account. When an app asks for this information, Sign in with Apple displays your name and the personal email address from your Apple Account for you to review.",
      "These methods rely on cryptographic keys or secure tokens, making it much harder for attackers to intercept your login information, even if they manage to trick you into visiting a malicious site.",
      "FBI WARNS OF DANGEROUS NEW \u2018SMISHING\u2019 SCAM TARGETING YOUR PHONE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Astaroth shows just how far phishing kits have come, taking things beyond the usual tricks and bypassing 2FA with ease. It\u2019s a reminder that no matter how secure we think our systems are, there\u2019s always a smarter attack waiting to exploit the gaps. Cybercriminals are adapting fast, and while traditional defenses may not cut it anymore, there are still steps you can take to fight back: use passwordless logins, stay updated and keep learning about these evolving threats.",

      "The brain-computer interface: A new era of control",
      "The device, known as a brain-computer interface (BCI), represents a fusion of advanced AI and neural engineering. BCIs have previously struggled to maintain functionality over extended periods, often losing effectiveness after just one or two days. However, the newly developed BCI has set a record by functioning seamlessly for seven months without requiring major adjustments.",

      "The sophisticated fraud techniques emerging today are virtually undetectable to the untrained eye, or ear. And the financial impact is staggering. Since 2020, phishing and scam activity has\u00a0increased by 94%, with millions of new scam pages appearing monthly.

      "Today's scammers use generative AI to \"supercharge\" their existing techniques while enabling entirely new types of fraud, according to\u00a0Dave Schroeder, UW\u2013Madison national security research strategist. Here are the four most dangerous ways they're using this technology.",
      "With just three seconds of audio, easily obtained from social media, voicemails or videos, fraudsters can create a convincing replica of your voice using AI. \"Imagine a situation where a 'family member' calls from what appears to be their phone number and says they have been kidnapped,\" explains Schroeder. \"Victims of these scams have said they were sure it was their family member's voice.\"",
      "These AI-generated voice clones can be used to manipulate loved ones, coworkers or even financial institutions into transferring money or sharing sensitive information, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent calls.",
      "Today's AI tools can generate convincing fake identification documents with AI-generated images. Criminals use these to verify identity when fraudulently opening accounts or taking over existing ones. These AI-generated fake IDs are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often including realistic holograms and barcodes that can bypass traditional security checks and even fool automated verification systems.",
      "Many financial institutions use selfies for customer verification. However, fraudsters can take images from social media to create deepfakes that bypass these security measures. These AI-generated deepfakes are not limited to still images; they can also produce realistic videos that can fool liveness detection checks during facial recognition processes, posing a significant threat to biometric authentication systems.",
      "Similarly, GenAI now crafts flawlessly written, highly personalized\u00a0phishing emails that analyze your online presence to create messages specifically tailored to your interests and personal details. These AI-enhanced phishing attempts can also incorporate sophisticated chatbots and improved grammar, making them significantly more convincing and harder to detect than traditional\u00a0phishing scams.",
      "A man working on his laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO PROTECT YOUR DATA FROM IRS SCAMMERS THIS TAX SEASON",
      "Why you might be a prime target",
      "While everyone is at risk from these sophisticated AI scams, certain factors can make you a more attractive target to fraudsters. Those with substantial retirement savings or investments naturally represent more valuable targets \u2014 the more assets you have, the more attention you'll attract from criminals looking for bigger payoffs. Many older adults are particularly vulnerable as they didn't grow up with today's technology and may be less familiar with AI's capabilities. This knowledge gap makes it harder to recognize when AI is being used maliciously. Compounding this risk is an extensive digital footprint: if you're active on social media or have a significant online presence, you're inadvertently providing fraudsters with the raw materials they need to create convincing deepfakes and highly personalized scams designed specifically to exploit your trust.",

      "How to protect yourself in the age of AI",
      "Protection against AI-powered threats requires a multi-layered approach that goes well beyond just digital measures. Awareness is your first line of defense \u2014 understanding how these scams work helps you spot red flags before you become a victim. This awareness should be paired with both digital safeguards and \"analog\" verification systems that exist entirely offline. Here are some key steps to protect yourself:",
      "1.\u00a0Invest in personal data removal services: Generative AI fundamentally needs your personal data to craft convincing scams, which is why limiting your online footprint has become paramount in today's fraud landscape. The less information about you that's publicly available, the fewer raw materials scammers have to work with. Going completely off-grid is unrealistic for most of us today \u2014 much like never leaving your home. But you can reduce your online footprint substantially with a personal data removal service like Incogni, making yourself significantly less exposed to AI-powered scams.",
      "By removing your personal data from data broker companies, you not only protect yourself from GenAI-powered fraud but also gain numerous other privacy benefits, such as reduced risks of receiving spam and falling victim to identity theft, as well as helping to prevent stalking and harassment. As AI technology advances, gen-AI scams will only become more sophisticated. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "2. Establish your own verification protocols:\u00a0Consider agreeing on a \"safe word\" that only family members know. If you receive an unexpected call from a relative in distress, ask for this word before taking action.",
      "3. Choose strong, unique passwords for each account: Create complex passwords using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. A password manager can generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts, reducing the risk of password reuse and making it easier to maintain good password hygiene. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts: 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "5. Receive MFA codes via an authenticator app on your phone rather than email when possible: Using an\u00a0authenticator app like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator is more secure than receiving codes via email. Authenticator apps generate time-based one-time passcodes (TOTPs) that are not transmitted over email or SMS, reducing the risk of interception by hackers. Additionally, authenticator apps often support biometric authentication and push notifications, making the verification process both secure and convenient.",
      "6. Use a strong antivirus software: Modern cybersecurity threats are evolving rapidly, with AI being used to create more convincing phishing attacks, deepfake scams, and malware. Investing in strong antivirus software can help identify and block suspicious activity before it reaches you. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7. Trust your intuition and verify: If something feels \"off,\" like you notice unusual phrasing or strange background noises, trust your instincts. Don't let fraudsters create a false sense of urgency. If you receive a communication claiming to be from a financial institution, call that institution directly using the official number from its website.",
      "8. Monitor your accounts: Review account statements regularly for suspicious transactions. Don\u2019t hesitate to request a credit freeze if you suspect your data has been compromised.",

      "Greif: UCLA\u2019s Lauren Betts. The 6-foot-7 center is the national defensive player of the year not only because she can guard post players, but also stifle wings, averaging 3.5 blocks during the NCAA tournament. Oh, and she\u2019s putting up 23 points and nearly 10 rebounds per night in the tournament, as well. How UCLA strategizes to maximize its star Betts, and Connecticut its own in  Bueckers, will be must-watch TV.",
      "Team I\u2019m most worried about",
      "Greif: Texas. The Longhorns take 10 3-pointers per game, and only two teams attempted fewer this season in the entire country. That formula has worked just fine to this point, but against a superior team like South Carolina, that could be asking a lot to score against the Gamecocks\u2019 defense.",
      "Much of that responsibility will fall to SEC Player of the Year and Texas wing Madison Booker. South Carolina is 2-1 against Texas this season, with its wins coming by an average of 18 points.",
      "Nadkarni: Truth be told I am not exactly \u201cworried\u201d about any of these teams because they are all good. This question feels like a trap! I will not be giving anyone bulletin-board material! But since I am being forced to pick, I\u2019ll nominate South Carolina here.",
      "The Gamecocks have won their last two games by only eight points combined, which means opponents have been hanging a little close. Do I feel silly saying this about a Dawn Staley-coached team that\u2019s won two of out of the last three national championships? Of course!

Like, \u2018I don\u2019t really need that.\u2019\u201d",
      "That stance changed last weekend when the bats erupted into the public's attention \u2014 and with them, overnight big business. Ainsworth estimated that half of Marucci-affiliated hitters have now tried a torpedo model and said he expects that to increase to 80% by month\u2019s end.",
      "\u201cAll I can say,\u201d said Bobby Hillerich, a vice president of manufacturing and operations for Hillerich and Bradsby Co., the maker of Louisville Slugger bats, \u201cis that it\u2019s crazy.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are 1,500 preorders for a bat that doesn\u2019t exist, and there\u2019s no website yet,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cTorpedo bats\u201d officially entered the sports lexicon after the Yankees hit an MLB-record 15 home runs in three games, including a combined nine by five Yankees hitters using the new bats, which shift the \u201csweet spot\u201d closer to where hitters typically make contact. Sometimes, the shift can be as much as 6 inches. The bats\u2019 existence might have gone unnoticed, however, if not for Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay.",
      "On social media, a clip of Kay describing the bats\u2019 origin story \u2014 a Yankees study had found certain players weren\u2019t hitting the ball with the barrel of the bat, but lower toward its handle, prompting an MLB-approved design change moving more mass toward the handle \u2014 went viral.",

      "After cheating death, Dodgers pitcher Dustin May makes his way back to the mound",
      "Billie Jean King to receive Hollywood Walk of Fame star",
      "\u201cThis has been all over the country and really around the world, people talking about bats and this bat design, and it just shows you the impact of what the Yankees can do when something happens there,\u201d Ainsworth said.",
      "Ever since, phones have been ringing in the offices of the 41 MLB-approved batmakers. One such call came Monday morning from the Cincinnati Reds, who asked a Louisville Slugger executive and sales rep to drive samples to their ballpark 90 minutes away as soon as possible. Within hours, Reds star Elly De La Cruz was testing a sample torpedo bat in batting practice and liked it so much that he kept it for that night\u2019s game, in which he went 4-for-5 with two home runs.",
      "On Monday, Louisville Slugger had developed 20 different models with varying tapers, lengths and weights. By week\u2019s end, Hillerich estimates, that number will rise to closer to 70 to respond to MLB teams\u2019 requests for adjustments and to meet trickle-down demand it anticipates from youth and collegiate wood-bat leagues. One of the biggest wrinkles Hillerich has encountered is ensuring Louisville Slugger has enough wood \u2014 its company largely uses birch for MLB hitters \u2014 to meet demand.",
      "\u201cWe have two log buyers that go out, and they usually go out once every two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them to get on the road Monday morning and not come back.\u201d",
      "For Marucci, which uses largely maple in its professional bats, sourcing wood isn\u2019t an issue, as it owns a timber company in Pennsylvania and two mills. (In addition, metal bats used in youth and collegiate leagues are Marucci\u2019s biggest seller, he said.) The logistical challenge has been turning around bats quickly enough for its roster of MLB players.",
      "At Marucci\u2019s headquarters in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, a bat tailored to an MLB hitter\u2019s specific swing and balance points can be produced and in the hitter\u2019s hands in about a week. Although Ainsworth said a true torpedo model might not make much sense for younger players, who rarely make contact in the same place and need larger barrels, the company clearly anticipates strong demand from the public, as well as the pros. By midweek, a banner had been placed across the top of the Marucci website leading to the company\u2019s three different torpedo models: \u201cThe bat everyone\u2019s talking about is here.\u201d Victus, a Pennsylvania-based batmaker Marucci acquired in 2017, had a similar landing page on its website.",
      "\u201cI will tell you that it has been a nice bump for the company,\u201d Ainsworth said.",
      "Yet for Ainsworth, the biggest winner from the surge in interest produced by the bats was baseball itself. For years, the sport has battled an existential debate about whether it had enough stars with crossover cultural appeal and whether its slower pace of play and stodgy tradition could attract younger fans. For the past week, however, as the NBA playoffs and the NFL draft approach, the buzz has been about baseball.",
      "Louisville Slugger, which Wilson Sporting Goods has owned since 2015, has experienced sales spikes before. Rick Redman, a vice president of corporate communications at Hillerich and Bradsby who has worked in public relations for Louisville Slugger for 22 years, said the last time he could recall a product this hot was 2006, when Louisville Slugger produced pink bats for Mother\u2019s Day.",
      "And sales of souvenir bats quadrupled in 2016 when the Chicago Cubs broke a 107-year-old World Series drought, Hillerich said. Yet the demand curve for torpedo bats could look similar to the skyrocketing arc of one of the Yankees\u2019 weekend home runs, because, unlike a novelty item, they represent an innovation that could shake up a century-old game.",
      "Pitchers have used data and technology in recent seasons to throw harder. Hitters, meanwhile, were still playing catch-up by changing how, not what, they swung. For batmakers, that gap between hitters and pitchers created a market opportunity. Both Louisville Slugger and Marucci operate high-tech hitting labs to test their equipment. In recent years, Ainsworth, who played four MLB seasons as a pitcher before he co-founded Marucci in 2004, had become inspired by applying golf\u2019s use of different clubs for different purposes to baseball.",
      "\u201cYou go into an industry that\u2019s been, I don\u2019t want to say stale for a while, but it\u2019s been in America\u2019s pastime, the player uses the same bat versus every pitcher,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t use the same golf club for every shot. Why in baseball were we using the same bat?\u201d",
      "In 2022, Paul Goldschmidt became the National League\u2019s most valuable player using a Marucci bat with a knob shaped like a hockey puck, which shifted the weight below the hitter\u2019s hands. The design differed from that of the torpedo bats, but the idea was the same: What is the optimal design to create the biggest opportunity for hits? Some have pushed back against the effectiveness of the new design, such as Milwaukee manager Pat Murphy, whose team allowed the 15 home runs to the Yankees.",
      "\u201cMy old ass will tell you this, for sure: It ain\u2019t the wand, it\u2019s the magician,\u201d Murphy told reporters last weekend.",
      "Not everyone agrees with the theory. Aaron Leanhardt, a former physicist who now works for the Miami Marlins, has been credited with working with various batmakers to develop the bowling-pin design during his time with the Yankees after he discovered that some Yankees hitters rarely made contact on the barrel.",
      "Both Marucci and Louisville Slugger officials said that the bowling-pin model first became a reality late in 2023 and that a few players used it last season, including New York Mets star Francisco Lindor and Yankees slugger Giancarlo Stanton, who hit seven postseason home runs using such a model. Cody Bellinger, then with the Chicago Cubs, tried a Louisville Slugger model but wasn\u2019t quite sold until he joined the Yankees this season and tested newer models tweaked to his preferences. He was among the torpedo users to hit home runs during New York\u2019s explosive opening weekend. Yet the shape went unscrutinized last year. Why, then, did it take nearly a year and a half for the torpedo bat to capture the zeitgeist and affect the bottom line?",
      "Hillerich agreed that the Yankees\u2019 national exposure, combined with the intrigue of a new innovation, \u201cjust made for the perfect storm.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf Cody Bellinger would have struck out,\u201d Hillerich said, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be talking right now.\""

      "In the plot, he solicited people \u2014 primarily Indonesian and Indo-American investors \u2014 to invest in two sham programs, called Easy Transfer and Global Transfer.

      "The scheme collapsed in May 2021 when Marganda and co-conspirators stopped making payments to investors.",

It was the biggest protest held since the council was installed a year ago.",
      "\u201cHaitian people, you\u2019ve spoken, and we\u2019ve heard you,\u201d Jean said. \u201cWe understand your misery. We know your pain and your suffering.\u201d",

Since then, cohesion between political parties involved in creating that government \u201chas now largely collapsed,\u201d Da Rin said.",
      "\u201cThe groups that originally supported this government are now calling for a change in leadership,\u201d he noted.",

The criminal gangs killed a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fight against the darkness is not insignificant. But we are not insignificant ourselves\u2026 It\u2019s nothing compared with the battle we fought to get out of slavery.\u201d",
      "Jean referenced how Haiti became the world\u2019s first free Black republic in a bid to rally support from Haitians, asking them to help law enforcement officials and eschew efforts by gangs to recruit people, especially children.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t let people profit from your distress and drag you in bad directions,\u201d he said.",

      "Jean also said that the electoral council is working so that Haiti can have new leadership once the transitional presidential council\u2019s term ends on Feb. 7 next year. He added that officials are taking steps so that the diaspora can vote in what would be Haiti\u2019s first general elections held in almost a decade.",
      "Haiti has not had a president since former President Jovenel Mo\u00efse was assassinated in 2021, with gangs becoming increasingly powerful in the aftermath.",
      "Last year, a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police arrived in Haiti to help local authorities quell gang violence, but the mission remains understaffed and underfunded, with only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel originally envisioned.",
      "Jean\u2019s speech did not appear to resonate with those most affected by gang violence.",
      "Mario Jean-Pierre, a 53-year-old street vendor who sells used clothes that he carries on his back, said he wasn\u2019t impressed by the public address.",
      "Gang violence recently forced him and his two children to move into a makeshift shelter in the yard of Haiti\u2019s Ministry of Public Works.",

And I\u2019d hate for the party to suffer that because I think current policy is good policy for the economy.

So that's good, and I hope our leadership will take that cue,\" Hawley told reporters before the vote.",

      "That's easier said than done. The House-approved budget, which Trump endorsed, makes it mathematically impossible for Republicans to achieve their targets without cutting Medicare or Medicaid. Lawmakers say they want to cut waste and fraud, along with imposing a potential work requirement for Medicaid. Beyond that, they haven't identified ways to reduce spending.",
      "Overall, GOP leaders say they want to find trillions of dollars in spending cuts to balance out the other side of the ledger after their tax breaks, as well as spending hikes on immigration enforcement and the military.",

Mike Rounds, R-S.D., who did not attend the meeting Thursday evening, said the leadership was \u201cnot twisting arms,\u201d but \u201csome folks wanted to make sure that they understood how the process worked. They sat down with a number of folks who were very familiar with it, and went through it. It took a little bit longer to get it done.\u201d"

      "\"Not only was Plaintiff Abrego Garcia removed to El Salvador in direct violation of federal law, but to make matters worse, Defendants are paying the government of El Salvador a sum of money to incarcerate him in the infamous CECOT prison, where he is being subjected to torture and an imminent risk of death,\u201d Garcia's attorney wrote in their petition.",

I think there\u2019s a high likelihood that the government of El Salvador would actually accede to that request,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me that they haven\u2019t even so much as picked up the phone to just ask for this man back.\u201d",

Civil rights attorneys say the arrest of Marcy Rheintgen last month is the first they know of for violating transgender\u00a0bathroom restrictions\u00a0passed by numerous state legislatures across the country.",
      "Capitol police had been alerted and were waiting for Rheintgen, 20, when she entered the building in Tallahassee March 19. They told her she would receive a trespass warning once she entered the women\u2019s restroom to wash her hands and pray the rosary, but she was later placed under arrest when she refused to leave, according to an arrest affidavit.",
      "Rheintgen faces a misdemeanor trespassing charge punishable by up to 60 days in jail and is due to appear in court in May.",
      "\u201cI wanted people to see the absurdity of this law in practice,\u201d Rheintgen told The Associated Press. \u201cIf I\u2019m a criminal, it\u2019s going to be so hard for me to live a normal life, all because I washed my hands. Like, that\u2019s so insane.\u201d",
      "At least 14 states have adopted laws barring transgender women from entering women\u2019s bathrooms at public schools and, in some cases, other government buildings. Only two \u2014 Florida and Utah \u2014 criminalize the act. A judge on Wednesday\u00a0temporarily blocked\u00a0Montana\u2019s new bathroom law.",
      "Rheintgen\u2019s arrest in Florida is the first that American Civil Liberties Union attorneys are aware of in any state with a criminal ban, senior staff attorney Jon Davidson said.",
      "Rheintgen was in town visiting her grandparents when she decided to pen a letter to each of Florida\u2019s 160 state lawmakers informing them of her plan to enter a public restroom inconsistent with her sex assigned at birth. The Illinois resident said her act of civil disobedience was fueled by anger at seeing a place she loves and visits regularly grow hostile toward trans people.",
      "\u201cI know that you know in your heart that this law is wrong and unjust,\u201d she wrote in her letter to lawmakers. \u201cI know that you know in your heart that transgender people are human too, and that you can\u2019t arrest us away. I know that you know that I have dignity. That\u2019s why I know that you won\u2019t arrest me.\u201d",
      "Her arrest comes as many Republican-led states that have enacted restroom restrictions grapple with\u00a0how to enforce them. Laws in\u00a0Alabama,\u00a0Kansas,\u00a0Kentucky\u00a0and North Dakota do not spell out any enforcement mechanism, and even the state laws that do largely rely on private individuals to report violations.",
      "In Utah, activists\u00a0flooded a tip line\u00a0created to alert state officials to possible violations of its\u00a0bathroom law\u00a0with thousands of hoax reports in an effort to shield transgender residents and their allies from any legitimate complaints that could lead to an investigation.",
      "The Republican sponsors of the Florida bathroom law, Rep. Rachel Plakon and Sen. Erin Grall, did not immediately respond Thursday to phone messages, emails and visits to their offices to seek comment on Rheintgen\u2019s arrest. They have said the restrictions are needed to protect women and girls in single-sex spaces.",
      "Opponents of the law such as Nadine Smith, executive director of the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Equality Florida, said it creates dangerous situations for all by giving people license to police others\u2019 bodies in bathrooms.",
      "\u201cThe arrest of Marcy Rheintgen is not about safety,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s about cruelty, humiliation and the deliberate erosion of human dignity. Transgender people have been using restrooms aligned with their gender for generations without incident. What\u2019s changed is not their presence \u2014 it\u2019s a wave of laws designed to intimidate them out of public life.\u201d",
      "If Rheintgen is convicted, she worries she could be jailed with men, forced to cut her long hair and prevented temporarily from taking gender-affirming hormones.",
      "\u201cPeople are telling me it\u2019s a legal test, like this is the first case that\u2019s being brought,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s how they test the law. But I didn\u2019t do this to test the law. I did it because I was upset. I can\u2019t have any expectations for what\u2019s going to happen because this has never been prosecuted before. I\u2019m horrified and scared.\u201d"

There\u2019s going to be a lot of bad ones throughout the way. You\u2019ve just got to learn how to brush them off and go to the next one. That\u2019s what I did.\u201d",
      "The Reds\u2019 lone hit off Cortes came from Jose Trevino, who delivered a one-out double in the third off his former Yankees teammate. Cincinnati\u2019s only other hit Thursday was a single by Jeimer Candelario off Elvis Peguero in the seventh.",
      "Cincinnati has a combined nine hits, three walks and 27 strikeouts during the skid.",
      "\u201cTo be totally honest, you see this all the time throughout a baseball season,\u201d Trevino said. \u201cPitchers will pick up the hitters and the hitters will pick up the pitchers. It will all switch at some point. We\u2019re going to need them. They\u2019re going to need us. And at some point, we\u2019re all going to be together. That\u2019s just how the baseball season goes.",
      "\u201cRight now, our pitchers are doing really well and our hitters, we\u2019re grinding. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re out there trying to give outs away. We\u2019re out there putting some good at-bats together. We\u2019re going to turn this thing around. I have full confidence in this team.\u201d"

      "While Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia was left out of the long list, Trump slapped 10% tariffs on Heard Island and McDonald Islands, a mostly barren, tiny outpost largely populated by penguins.",
      "The island group is located in the middle of the Antarctic Ocean and remains among the world\u2019s most remote places where no humans live.

      "According to the World Bank, the Heard and McDonald islands exported about $1.4 million worth of goods to the U.S. in 2022, most of which were unspecified \u201cmachinery and electrical\u201d products, while the U.S. exported about $21,600 to the islands in the same year. It is unclear how these goods are traded despite a lack of human habitation, but a report by The Guardian newspaper found that some goods may have been mislabeled as coming from the territory.",
      "Norfolk Island, another Australian territory with a population of about 2000 people, received a 29% tariff, triple that of the rest of the country.

      "Are you a Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda or a Samantha?",
      "It's a question as old as time (or at least since June 6, 1998, when \"Sex and the City\" premiered on HBO).",
      "The show's four leading ladies collectively comprise a group of best friends in their 30s, navigating life and relationships in New York City in a time after the\u00a0\"end of love in Manhattan,\" as Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) puts it in the pilot.",
      "Their friendship is maintained through phone calls, parties, cab rides and meals and often consists of a central debate, with each person bringing a different perspective to the situation. Their conversations are full of banter and little disagreements, with each scene illuminating just how different each character is, setting up a perfect \u2014 and lasting \u2014 form of self-categorization.",
      "Kristin Davis, who plays Charlotte, says she fittingly identifies as a \"Charlotte.\"",
      "\"I think BuzzFeed had a quiz and people send it around. My daughter has gotten it, which is hysterical, and luckily she is a Charlotte,\" she tells TODAY.com with a laugh, referring to daughter Gemma.",
      "The personality litmus test also lent itself to her latest venture, a \"Sex and the City\" rewatch podcast called, \"Are You A Charlotte?\" The goal of the podcast is to connect with fans, she says.",
      "Currently on the podcast, Davis and her guests \u2014 a lineup she says will include TODAY's own Jenna Bush Hager, \"Sex and the City\" author Candace Bushnell and Sarah Jessica Parker \u2014 are still rewatching Season 1.",
      "\"The first season, especially, I barely remember it,\" Davis says. \"Because we used to film really quickly, also, so we would film all night. Maybe we had five days, I want to say, an episode ... I'd have to go back, it might have even been four. Like it was fast.\"",
      "Now, there's more time dedicated to filming each episode, she says. Davis currently stars as Charlotte in \"And Just Like That...,\" the \"Sex and the City\" revival.",
      "Headed into Season 3, Davis calls it \"a big season.\" Viewers left Charlotte in Season 2 on her journey of returning to work while balancing the expectations of being a wife and mother, including setting husband Harry (Evan Handler) straight on the division of their workload.",
      "\"The pressure of trying to be a good wife, be a good mother, her children are getting older, so she's trying to figure out, 'How much time can I devote to my career, at my job? ... What do I need to succeed?'\" Davis says. \"This is a big question for everyone, so I really relate to it myself, obviously, too. And that continues through the season, and you're going to see her really struggle with that.",
      "\"And it's a fun, fun storyline,\" she adds.",
      "\"And Just Like That...,\" which premiered in December 2021, reunited Davis, Nixon and Parker as Charlotte, Miranda and Carrie. Season 2 memorably saw the brief return of Samantha, when Kim Cattrall made a cameo in the finale.",
      "How to tell if you're a Carrie, Charlotte, Samantha or Miranda",
      "While fans have been categorizing themselves as a Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda or Samantha for years, Davis has her own ideas for how to decide which character you're most like. She boils it down to four key questions to ask yourself, centered on each character's core identity:",
      "Are you a searcher? Are you a trailblazer?Do you say it like it is?Are you looking for a traditional outcome for your life?",
      "Are you a searcher?",
      "Are you a trailblazer?",
      "Do you say it like it is?",
      "Are you looking for a traditional outcome for your life?",
      "After whichever question has you shouting, \"Yes!\" the most definitively, read on for which \"Sex and the City\" character that makes you.",
      "Are you a searcher?",
      "Yes? Congrats, you're a ...",
      "Carrie!",
      "\"In terms of the other (characters), like Carrie, I would say, are you a searcher? Are you looking for answers? Are you investigating things?\" Davis poses.",
      "In each episode of the original show, Parker\u2019s character, a columnist, took on a relationship or life dilemma, and in the process of writing it, often framed the issue as a question. Davis says the key to Carrie's identity is her signature phrase: \"I couldn't help but wonder.\"",
      "Carrie is also \"not so worried about tradition,\" Davis notes.",
      "\"Carrie is more independent and looking for what would make her happy, not necessarily what society might be expecting,\" she says.",
      "Are you a trailblazer?",
      "Then you're a...",
      "Samantha!",
      "Taking things a step further from Carrie's independence, Davis describes Samantha as a \"trailblazer.\"",
      "\"Are you super independent?\" Davis says. \"Are you unapologetic about getting what you need? Such good qualities, powerful qualities.\"",
      "Do you say it like it is?",
      "You're most like...",
      "Miranda!",
      "Davis describes a Miranda as someone \"open in how you talk.\"",
      "\"Do you say it like it is?\" she says. \"Are you open to eating food out of a trash can? Do you like cats?\"",
      "A huge part of a Miranda's identity is also career-centric, she says.",
      "\"Are you into your career? She is a lawyer, and she's very good at it, and she wants to become partner, and she's super smart,\" Davis says. \"So are you super smart? That would be a Miranda question.\"",

      "At the time, the \"That's So Raven\" star received quite a bit of backlash online for her comments about her race. Now, in her interview with Lee, she is once again addressing it and clarifying what she meant.",
      "\"I am not an African American. I'm an American. I am a Black American. I am definitely Black. And yes, my ancestors come from Africa,\" she said.",
      "\"How long does a bloodline have to live in one land before they are considered a pure species of that land? Meaning, how long did my people have to be in America to say, 'Hey, no, we're American,\" compared to some people who are English American, who are Irish American, who are German American from their ancestors, but they get to call themselves American,\" Raven-Symon\u00e9 continued.",
      "The \"Cheetah Girls\" singer explained that there is \"nothing wrong\" with someone identifying as African American, \"but a true African American is someone that is from Africa and moved here, either first generation or second generation, and has a tie to that country that I do not have.\"",

      "There, Raven-Symon\u00e9 said that she immediately felt \"judged\" when she saw all the backlash that she was getting from the public back then.

    "summary": "Kevin Bacon plays a demon hunter from hell in \"The Bondsman, and he reveals the surprising thing he shares in common with his TV counterpart.",
    "story": [
      "Kevin Bacon has played almost every kind of character imaginable over the course of his tenured career, but it's his latest role in the new series, \"The Bondsman,\" that has the 66-year-old actor catching hell as Hub Halloran, a demon-hunter searching for redemption.",
      "\"It was a fun show for me because there's a lot of physical challenges, which I really like. There's a lot of running, jumping, fighting and underwater stuff,\" Bacon says during a sit-down interview with TODAY.com",
      "\"You know, just basically demon ass-kicking,\" he laughs.",
      "The new Prime series, which premiered on April 3, is about a murdered bounty hunter (Bacon) resurrected by Satan to help track down escaped demons, so it's naturally going to be hellish. But fortunately, for Bacon, it\u2019s in all the right ways.",
      "\"What's really fun to me is the fact that the character is such a badass, but at the same time, he's such a child in a lot of ways,\" Bacon says of the role. \"He's living in his mother's garage, he hasn't been able to make it work with his ex-wife. He's estranged from his son. He's kind of a mess in his life.\"",
      "That complicated backstory is exactly why he enjoyed taking on the character. \"If you're going to play somebody who is ultimately the hero of the show, it's fun to have that kind of complexity.\"",
      "Produced by showrunner Erik Oleson, \"The Bondsman\" also stars Beth Grant as Kitty Halloran, Bacon's tough-as-nails mother, Maxwell Jenkins as his son, Cade, and Sugarland's Jennifer Nettles as the ex-wife he still carries a torch for.",
      "It's a campy, often gory mix of comedy, action and straight-up horror as Bacon battles various demons as part of a mission he's been sent on to round up wayward demons by the Devil himself.",
      "No stranger to the genre, the \"Footloose\" actor has appeared in a variety of horror films, including the original \"Friday the 13th,\" \"Hollow Man\" and \"Tremors.\"",
      "Beyond it's genre identity, \"The Bondsman\" is also a metaphor for personal redemption, with its phrase, \"to hell and back,\" serving as both a literal and figurative meaning.",
      "Kevin Bacon vs. Hub Halloran: Similar or different?",
      "While Bacon says he doesn't connect with his character Hub's alter ego, they do share a passion for music.",
      "Along with acting, Bacon has spent decades touring with his brother, Michael, as one half of the musical duo known as The Bacon Brothers. Hub, a failed musician, provided Bacon with the perfect opportunity to marry two of his loves in \"The Bondsman.\"",
      "\"It came up when we were about to pitch (\"The Bondsman\"), that it might be fun for me to write some songs, and then Jennifer (Nettles) got cast, and she was definitely the best person for the part, the best actress, but she was also a fabulous singer and a great, great songwriter,\" Bacon tells Craig Melvin and Savannah Guthrie during a segment on TODAY April 3.",
      "\"So, right away, we wrote a song, and that song was rejected,\u201d Bacon said. \"And then we wrote some more, and wrote some more, and we ended up with three of our tunes in the show.\"",
      "Music, however, isn't the only thing that Bacon and Hub have in common. Bacon says that Hub's calm and collected way of dealing with chaos is something he can relate to.",
      "\"Part of the humor lies in the fact that when all this crazy stuff starts happening around (Hub), he's pretty cool around it. He's like, 'OK, well, now, I've come back from the dead and now I've got to go and hunt these demons. So, let me just figure out how I'm going to do that.' You know what I mean? I would say, if anything, that's a similar quality,\" explains Bacon.",
      "Big screen vs. little screen: Which does Kevin Bacon prefer?",
      "\"The Bondsman\" is far from Bacon's first TV series. The actor also starred in the 2019 cop drama \"City on a Hill,\" the 2016 comedy  \"I Love Dick\" and the 2013 serial killer series \"The Following,\" among others.",
      "He also stars opposite Julianne Moore in the upcoming Netflix series, \"Sirens,\" which will be released on May 22.",
      "Having appeared on both the big and little screens, does Bacon have a preference between the two?",
      "\"When I started out, all I wanted was to be in movies and on the stage. Those were my two dreams,\" he explains. \"It's hard to imagine, but back then, if you went from the movies to the small screen, it was kind of a sign that you were throwing in the towel.",
      "\"Now, movie stars left and right do it, everyone does it, and I love it. I'd never not do TV,\" Bacon continues. \"I also really love movies and I go to them, I would say, maybe once a week. I go to the theater, sit in the room, get the popcorn, go through that experience because I love it.\""

    "story": [
      "\u201cBoy Meets World\u201d stars have mixed feelings today about a complicated storyline that Will Friedle described as having an \u201cimportant message, not great execution.\u201d",
      "In the latest \u201cPod Meets World\u201d episode, podcast hosts Friedle, Danielle Fishel and Rider Strong criticized a 1998 episode titled \u201cEverybody Loves Stuart,\u201d in which a college professor makes an inappropriate move on Fishel\u2019s character Topanga.",
      "The theme of the episode, in their opinion, is, \u201cWhat happens when people in position of power take advantage of your trust.\u201d The trio, however, were frustrated with the way the storyline plays out.",
      "Professor Stuart is portrayed by Fred Savage, the older brother of \u201cBoy Meet World\u201d star Ben Savage. In it, he is known as the \u201ccool teacher\u201d and makes a pass on Topanga, who is one of his students and is engaged to Ben Savage\u2019s Cory.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t like (it),\u201d Friedle said. \u201cTopanga just sits there, quiet through the whole freaking thing, like, never speaks. It\u2019s not about her at all.\u201d",
      "In the episode, Cory becomes furious after Topanga tells him that Stuart hit on her in her dorm room. Cory confronts the professor and pushes him into a screen window in the common room. Because of his actions, he is at risk of being expelled.",
      "The \u201cPod Meets World\u201d hosts disliked how the storyline turned its focus on Cory instead of Topanga, who was the actual victim.",
      "Fishel agreed with Friedle, saying that being harassed by her professor became less about Topanga and more about, \u201cHow is the man in her life going to feel about it, and what\u2019s he going to do about it?\u201d",
      "\u201cTopanga's agency was completely just taken away, I did not appreciate that at all,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHow do we get across how important this is without being too heavy handed, and without trying to seem like we\u2019re making light of it?\" she added. \u201cI don\u2019t think that goal was achieved. I do think they just decided, let\u2019s lean into the melodrama of it.\u201d",
      "Friedle went on to note that the \u201cone time Topanga opens her mouth, she\u2019s told to be quiet by the dean.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe never tells her story to anybody that can help,\u201d he continued, adding that Cory doesn\u2019t even share Topanga\u2019s story. Instead, it's Mr. Feeny who takes charge.",
      "Strong, who called the episode \u201cpainful\u201d to watch, wondered why it was Cory\u2019s responsibility to stand up for Topanga.",
      "\u201cWhy is it Cory\u2019s responsibility to take the fall when he does stand up for her?\u201d\u00a0he asked.",
      "\u201cThe concern is not how Topanga feels,\u201d Strong added. \u201cIt\u2019s about how the violation of Topanga is reflected through how it violates Cory\u2019s rights ... It just made me so uncomfortable.\u201d",
      "Fishel did point out that the show is titled \u201cBoy Meets World,\u201d which centers on Cory\u2019s point of view. However, she believed the episode could have benefited from a scene where Cory asks Topanga, \u201cWhat do you want to do about this? This happened to you... How can I best support you?\u201d",
      "Fishel said she was also confused by Cory pushing Stuart and how it\u2019s unknown if Topanga asks Cory to confront him.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t even know whether or not Topanga wants this to happen or is expecting him to say something,\u201d she said, adding that what happens to her character \u201cbecomes unimportant.\u201d",
      "As the trio continued to watch the episode, Friedle said, overall, he was \u201cso thrown by this episode.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe second Cory walks in, it is now Cory\u2019s taking over the story and it\u2019s about how he\u2019s going to deal with what happened to Topanga,\" Friedle said. \u201cThey should\u2019ve stayed with the Topanga storyline.\""

      "She tells TODAY.com the amount of questions has been overwhelming, but that she's proud of her son.",
      "\"I'm happy for him because he's worked so hard. He takes acting classes all the time, and for every role like this you get, you're rejected like 300 times. You have to be resilient. You have to stay at it. And he has really stayed at it. And he'll have to stay at it after this. He's got to have life after 'White Lotus,' but his life during 'White Lotus' is pretty wild.\"",
      "In this season of the hit HBO show, Schwarzenegger portrays an entitled finance bro who works for his father's business in North Carolina. The Ratliff family is vacationing in Thailand to help Saxon's sister, Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook), complete her college thesis \u2014 or so she says.",
      "About halfway through the season, Piper reveals she actually wanted to travel to the country to visit a monastery to meet a monk she wants to study under for a year, all while her dad, Tim (Jason Isaacs), learns there is a warrant out for his arrest back in the U.S.",
      "The fate of the Ratliffs will be revealed during the finale April 6, and Shriver says she believed she would be able to watch the last episode with her son.",

    "story": [
      "With spring in full swing, it\u2019s time to defrost your reading list with picks from New York Times bestselling author Jennifer Weiner. As the author behind \u201cGood in Bed,\u201d \u201cThe Summer Place\u201d and this year\u2019s \u201cThe Griffin Sisters\u2019 Greatest Hits,\u201d it\u2019s clear that Weiner has some expert writing skills. But she also has some pretty great recommendations, too.",
      "Maybe you\u2019re in the mood for a domestic thriller that makes you think about how well you really know those closest to you. Or maybe you\u2019re on the opposite side of the spectrum and are in the market for a cozy romance.",
      "Whatever the book worm in you is feeling this month, Weiner has you covered. Joining the 3rd hour of TODAY in-studio, these are all the novels she thinks you should add to your spring TBR.",
      "\"Famous Last Words\"",
      "On her way out of the house one day, literary agent and new mom Camilla notices that her husband Luke has left her a rather eerie goodbye note. Eventually, the police inform her that he\u2019s been wrapped up in a hostage situation. But nothing is really as it seems in this suspenseful thriller.",
      "What drew Weiner to this pick was \u201cthe relatable heroine, the non-stop plot twists, and the big question \u2014 how well do we know the people we love,\u201d she told TODAY.com.",
      "\"The Friend\"",
      "After a tragic death, the novel\u2019s unnamed narrator acquires an unlikely inheritance: a Great Dane named Apollo. This pick investigates grief, gain and the complex relationship between dogs and humans.",
      "Through caring for this massive dog, the narrator finds \u201cthe love she never expected and desperately needed,\u201d said Weiner. \u201cI read this book for the first time on a plane, and I was crying so hard by the end of it that the flight attendant was worried about me.\u201d",
      "\"Jane and Dan at the End of the World\"",
      "Jane and Dan\u2019s marriage has been stale for the better part of their two-decade long marriage. Right when Jane has made up her mind to ask for a divorce at a luxe restaurant, the place is invaded by armed climate-activist terrorists ... including the pair\u2019s daughter.",
      "This read explores the complexities of partnership and parenthood under difficult circumstances. That being said, \u201cthe humor of the voice, the portrait of the marriage, the feeling of superiority,\u201d make this read truly epic, Weiner explained. Plus, \u201cknowing that no matter how bad my teenagers might be, they\u2019re not going to take me hostage\u201d is a great reminder.",
      "\"The Shots You Take\"",
      "\u201cRachel Reid writes hockey romances, which was not a genre I ever thought I was particularly interested in,\u201d Weiner said. \u201cBut her books are so well-written and entertaining that I got sucked right in.\u201d",
      "In this second-chance romance, former hockey teammates Riley and Adam reconnect after twenty years. Back when they were dominating the ice, the pair had a steamy no-strings-attached relationship. With Riley an out gay man and Adam finally single, these two might finally find their way back to each other.",
      "\"Happy Land\"",
      "For a scenic read with depth, this book follows a single mother who uproots her life in Washington, DC. to spend time with her grandmother, Mother Rita, on her flower farm. In the process of fighting against her grandmother\u2019s eviction, she learns of her family\u2019s incredible legacy, including \u201ca kingdom of free Black people established on the border of North and South Carolina after the Civil War,\u201d Weiner said.",
      "What had Weiner hooked from the start was \u201cthe relationships between four generations of women, learning about the real Happy Land kingdom, as well as the inheritance laws being used to take property away from Black families.\u201d",
      "\"Hazel Says No\"",
      "The Blum family goes from Brooklyn to Maine. There, something happens to the teenage daughter that impacts them as a unit and as individuals. Switching perspectives, the book shows what happens and will you wonder \u2014 what would you do?",
      "The book offers an astute understanding of character and psychological depth."

      "But after several travelers from Western nations were detained or deported as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, the 20-year-old British citizen from Leicester, England, is planning on carrying a burner phone when he comes to the U.S. in May. That\u2019s if he ends up going at all.",
      "\u201cI have a very, you know, stereotypical name as well,\u201d Ihsanullah told NBC News.",
      "He might swap out devices, he said, \u201cjust so that I have the added security of knowing that no one\u2019s going to go through my phone.\u201d",
      "Potential U.S. visitors such as Ihsanullah are expressing growing uncertainty about their travel plans amid the crackdown and warnings from U.S. embassies in more than a dozen countries, like the one in Sweden that said anyone entering the U.S. on a visa is a \u201cguest\u201d and if you lie about your intended behavior while in the country, \"You\u2019re out.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, a Lebanese doctor working at Brown University's medical center was sent home despite having a valid U.S. visa after U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents searching her phone found photos and videos they said were \u201csympathetic\u201d to the former leader of the Hezbollah militant group, whose funeral she told agents she attended last month.",
      "Such searches pre-date the new Trump administration, and Customs and Border Protection says it conducts them to detect \u201cdigital contraband, terrorism-related content, and information relevant to visitor admissibility.\u201d",
      "\u201cClaims that CBP is searching more electronic media due to administration change are false,\u201d CBP Assistant Commissioner Hilton Beckham told NBC News in an emailed statement.",
      "\u201cAllegations that political beliefs trigger inspections or removals are baseless and irresponsible,\u201d he added.",
      "Such searches are not new to travelers from parts of the world who already face stringent visa requirements \u2014 Chinese students arriving in the U.S., for example, have complained in recent years of being increasingly subject to interrogation and detention on national security grounds.",
      "But many of the cases in recent weeks have involved travelers from countries such as France, Germany and Canada \u2014 longtime allies with which the U.S. shares intelligence, has frequent cultural exchanges and does hundreds of billions of dollars in trade. Several of those held have spoken out about being scrutinized and sometimes locked up for days at the border.",
      "Last week, France\u2019s interior minister said a French researcher had been turned away by U.S. border agents after they found messages on his phone criticizing the Trump administration. The CBP said searches of the researcher's electronic media devices \u2014 they have not been named by the French authorities \u2014 led to the \u201cdiscovery of proprietary information\u201d from a U.S. laboratory.",
      "CBP does not need a warrant to search the phones of any travelers arriving at the U.S. border, including airports, said Saira Hussain, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group based in San Francisco.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. government has taken the view that they have the ability to search your devices without a warrant and without suspicion under what\u2019s known as the border search exception to the Fourth Amendment,\u201d she said.",
      "Other travelers have found themselves unexpectedly detained.",
      "Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian woman who was reapplying for a U.S. work visa, was detained without explanation on March 3 at the Mexican border near San Diego and spent 12 days in detention before returning home. She wrote in The Guardian that she was  detained after she was questioned about the status of her visa, which had been granted following an initial rejection.",
      "\u201cThere is no communication, you don\u2019t have an officer to talk to,\u201d Mooney told MSNBC last week. \u201cYou can\u2019t contact your lawyers or your friends or your family.\u201d",
      "When Rebecca Burke, a backpacker from Britain, tried to enter from Canada in February, she spent nearly three weeks at a detention center.\u00a0In a statement to the BBC, the Northwest ICE Processing Center said Burke was repatriated after being detained \u201crelated to the violation of the terms and conditions of her admission.\u201d",
      "Burke's family said it believes her detention was due to a misunderstanding about her accommodation arrangements, which were free in exchange for helping hosts with household chores and which her father says authorities may have suspected constituted employment in violation of her visa.",
      "And U.S. citizen Lennon Tyler said she was chained to a bench by border agents last month when her German fianc\u00e9, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit while trying to enter from Mexico. Sielaff was detained for two weeks before returning to Germany, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Such incidents have prompted some governments to issue warnings for their citizens traveling to the U.S. The updated British travel advisory reads \u201cyou may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules.\u201d",
      "Those warnings have potential visitors to the U.S., like Pat Bastow, a Canadian citizen who plans to rent a car to visit Montana in July for a three-week holiday, seeking advice on how to protect themselves.",
      "\u201cA lot of travel agents are warning people not to go just in case Trump deports,\u201d Bastow, a retired cattle farmer, told NBC News.",

      "Turning phones off before arrival is also helpful, she said, as doing so disables facial recognition until a passcode is entered.",
      "Travelers\u2019 rights vary depending on their status \u2014 whether they are U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents or foreign visa holders \u2014 and their port of entry. Almost a quarter of the nearly 47,000 searches of electronic devices conducted at U.S. borders in the last financial year were of U.S. citizens, according to CBP data.",
      "Hussain advised legal permanent residents, or green card holders, \u201cwho may have a bit of a complicated situation\u201d to consult an attorney before traveling.",
      "Visa holders who refuse a search of their devices could see their visas revoked and be barred from entering the U.S., she added.",
      "Rules can vary across the country because the courts have largely avoided ruling on electronic device searches. Last year, a federal judge in New York barred CBP from warrantless searches of people\u2019s phones, but that applies only to John F. Kennedy International Airport.",
      "That lack of consistency, Hussain said, is \u201creally why we believe that the Supreme Court needs to weigh in on this issue.\u201d"

    "summary": "Donald Trump has been giving leaders such as Mark Carney, Mexican Claudia Sheinbaum, Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer a popularity boost, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 The second Trump administration may have ruffled the feathers of America\u2019s allies, but there is also evidence it has boosted world leaders scrambling to deal with the White House\u2019s norm-busting approach.",
      "Some have gained plaudits for meeting Trump head-on, while others have taken a more nuanced line between flattering the president and trying to shore up their own interests against the headwinds blowing from Washington.",
      "Canada\u2019s Mark Carney is poised to win next month\u2019s election by volubly rejecting President Donald Trump\u2019s hostile advances to make his country the 51st state. On the flip side, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has earned accolades for becoming something of a Trump whisperer, deftly responding to his tariff threats and seeing her own popularity rise accordingly.",
      "In Europe, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have received polling boosts following their widely praised Trump strategies. And the embattled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has seen his numbers rise as he has tried to cope with Washington\u2019s brusque approach.",
      "\u201cThe standing of politicians who are having to deal with the crisis engendered by Trump\u2019s presidency is leading to a rise in their popularity, if they seem to be doing this in a reasoned and proper way,\u201d said Dominic Grieve, the former British attorney general and an ex-senior lawmaker for the Conservative Party.",
      "To be clear, Trump is no panacea for leaders. Macron and Starmer are still relatively unpopular and face harsh criticisms on domestic issues that will likely decide future elections. Likewise, good polling numbers will be of limited cheer for Zelenskyy while the future of his entire country is in doubt.",
      "Other analysts debate the extent to which this popularity boost is solely because of Trump, rather than the general climate of global instability and uncertainty of which Washington is a part.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure so how much it\u2019s a Trump bounce or more of a international crisis bounce,\u201d said Anand Menon, director of the think tank U.K. in a Changing Europe. \u201cInsecurity means that, initially at least, trust in the government goes up.\u201d",
      "Still, the abrupt change of tone and policy from the White House is an undeniable factor.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on Canada have seen a remarkable turnaround for Carney\u2019s Liberals. They were headed for historic losses, but Trump\u2019s onslaught has seen them ride a wave of renewed Canadian nationalism and lead the polls at 45% ahead of April 28\u2019s election.",
      "\u201cThe old relationship we had with the United States,\u201d Carney told a news conference Thursday, \u201cis over.\u201d",
      "Mexico\u2019s Sheinbaum has chosen a different tack, taking action on immigration and fentanyl trafficking \u2014 including sending 10,000 National Guard troops to the border. That earned a delay on Trump\u2019s tariffs, as well as praise from the U.S. president, who called her \u201ca wonderful woman.\u201d",
      "At home, she has mixed this strategy with a cerebral nationalism, telling voters that this is about \u201ccoordination, yes \u2014 submission, never.\u201d",
      "Her already high ratings have risen to 85%, according to the El Financiero newspaper in February.",
      "In the United Kingdom, Starmer\u2019s ratings have gone up 8.5 percentage points from February, according to the British pollster Ipsos. That followed an Oval Office meeting with Trump in which he mixed compliments with candor: talking up a potential trade deal while refusing to budge from a commitment to Ukraine.",
      "He has promised to hike British defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, part of the wider nervousness in Europe about Trump\u2019s commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance.",
      "The economy and health care will likely decide the next election. But defense is now the third most important issue for British voters, most polls show. And it is defense and international trade on which voters think Starmer is performing best, according to the Ipsos poll taken between March 14 and 17.",
      "\u201cPretty much all of his readings have become somewhat less unpopular in the wake of his trip to Washington,\u201d said John Curtice, one of Britain\u2019s most respected polling experts and a professor at Scotland\u2019s University of Strathclyde. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say the public have noticed that he\u2019s risen to the challenge.\u201d",
      "Another man banging the drum on European defense is France\u2019s Macron. He and Starmer are leading an informal \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d \u2014 a group of countries prepared to send troops to Ukraine to uphold any eventual ceasefire.",
      "Likewise, the current international upheaval has seen Macron\u2019s popularity jump to 31% in March, up 7 points from the previous month, according to an Ifop poll.",
      "These numbers are still relatively low, however, and they may well be fleeting. Macron can\u2019t run again in the next election, in 2027, but his centrist heirs risk losing the presidency to the far-right National Rally, the current favorite.",
      "The same is true for Starmer, whose Labour Party has slid from a landslide victory last year to near parity with the Conservatives and hard-right Reform U.K. Most voters are worried about high prices for food, energy and housing, rather than their leader\u2019s Oval Office repartee.",
      "For any leader enjoying a momentary upside, Menon, of U.K. in a Changing Europe, has a word of warning: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get complacent on the back of the fact that, right at the moment, things are looking a little bit better because Trump uncertainty.\u201d"

      "The leader of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council tried to allay surging alarm among Haitians over rampant gang violence by acknowledging Thursday that the country has \u201cbecome hell for everyone\u201d and promising new measures to stop the bloodshed.",
      "Fritz Alphonse Jean spoke a day after gunfire erupted in the capital, Port-au-Prince, as thousands of protesters demanding an end to gang violence clashed with police outside the offices of the council and the prime minister. It was the biggest protest held since the council was installed a year ago.",
      "\u201cHaitian people, you\u2019ve spoken, and we\u2019ve heard you,\u201d Jean said. \u201cWe understand your misery. We know your pain and your suffering.\u201d",
      "More than 4,200 people have been reported killed across Haiti from July to February, and another 1,356 were injured, according to the U.N.",
      "Recent gang violence also left more than 60,000 people homeless in one month alone, according to the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration.",
      "\u201cThis national address comes at a decisive moment for the transitional government,\u201d said Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. \u201cProtesters from various parts of the capital deliberately marched toward key government buildings to express their frustration.\u201d",
      "He noted that Jean\u2019s address marked the first anniversary of the political agreement that established the new transitional government\u2019s structure and objectives. Since then, cohesion between political parties involved in creating that government \u201chas now largely collapsed,\u201d Da Rin said.",
      "\u201cThe groups that originally supported this government are now calling for a change in leadership,\u201d he noted.",
      "The council has not addressed those concerns, which also have been voiced by the international community.",
      "During his public address, Jean rattled off a list of neighborhoods that gangs have recently attacked.",
      "\u201cYou lost your homes, you lost your businesses, you lost your jobs, they raped you, they raped your kids. The criminal gangs killed a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fight against the darkness is not insignificant. But we are not insignificant ourselves\u2026 It\u2019s nothing compared with the battle we fought to get out of slavery.\u201d",
      "Jean referenced how Haiti became the world\u2019s first free Black republic in a bid to rally support from Haitians, asking them to help law enforcement officials and eschew efforts by gangs to recruit people, especially children.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t let people profit from your distress and drag you in bad directions,\u201d he said.",
      "Jean said the council would take \u201cimportant measures\u201d to help quell the persistent violence, including setting aside a special budget and incorporating agents from an armed state environmental group known as BSAP.",
      "\u201cThe council asks the prime minister and the police to take these measures without delay,\u201d Jean said. \u201cWe are telling everyone in this government that we are at war.\u201d",
      "Jean did not provide further details, including how much money would be set aside for the budget and how many BSAP agents would join the fight against gangs.",
      "Jean also said that the electoral council is working so that Haiti can have new leadership once the transitional presidential council\u2019s term ends on Feb. 7 next year. He added that officials are taking steps so that the diaspora can vote in what would be Haiti\u2019s first general elections held in almost a decade.",
      "Haiti has not had a president since former President Jovenel Mo\u00efse was assassinated in 2021, with gangs becoming increasingly powerful in the aftermath.",
      "Last year, a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police arrived in Haiti to help local authorities quell gang violence, but the mission remains understaffed and underfunded, with only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel originally envisioned.",
      "Jean\u2019s speech did not appear to resonate with those most affected by gang violence.",
      "Mario Jean-Pierre, a 53-year-old street vendor who sells used clothes that he carries on his back, said he wasn\u2019t impressed by the public address.",
      "Gang violence recently forced him and his two children to move into a makeshift shelter in the yard of Haiti\u2019s Ministry of Public Works.",
      "\u201cFlying bullets are coming at you in different directions,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a few people in this camp who were hit by bullets as they slept.\u201d",
      "He worries constantly about his children\u2019s safety and said he didn\u2019t believe Jean\u2019s pledge to improve security.",
      "\u201cThis speech is not any different from other speeches,\u201d he said. \u201cThey keep making promises and don\u2019t accomplish any of the promises they\u2019ve made.\u201d",
      "Da Rin noted that throughout his speech, Jean emphasized the transnational dimension of Haiti\u2019s security crisis, stressing that the gang issue is part of a broader problem involving money laundering and arms and drugs trafficking that spans several countries.",
      "\u201cBy framing Haiti\u2019s gang problem as a matter of transnational crime that goes beyond Haiti\u2019s borders, the president seems to be seeking to rally international support for further security assistance that matches the escalating threats,\u201d he said."

It is unclear how these goods are traded despite a lack of human habitation, but a report by The Guardian newspaper found that some goods may have been mislabeled as coming from the territory.",
      "Norfolk Island, another Australian territory with a population of about 2000 people, received a 29% tariff, triple that of the rest of the country. Norfolk Island exported about $273,000 of mostly chemicals to the U.S. in 2022, while importing $52,000 worth of goods, according to World Bank data.",

      "Although Australia established a year-round research station on Heard Island in 1947, the territory hasn\u2019t been inhabited since it closed in 1954, he said.",
      "\u201cThe most recent visit by humans that I\u2019m aware of was a three-week visit of amateur\u00a0radio operators in 2016,\u201d Coffin said, adding that two Australian fishing companies are licensed to catch\u00a0fish surrounding the Heard Island and McDonald Islands.",
