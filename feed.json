      "The new action-sports league being launched by Shaun White will air on NBC and stream on Peacock beginning next year.",
      "White announced earlier this year that he was putting together The Snow League, a four-stop circuit that will feature halfpipe snowboarding and freeskiing. On Tuesday, the league and NBC revealed that the first event is set for March 7-8 in Aspen, with the rest of the schedule still to be announced.",
      "White plans on getting 20 men and 16 women in each contest for a prize pool of more than $1.5 million over the first season. A list of athletes who have committed to the league is expected later this year.",
      "The debut in Aspen will come 11 months before the start of the Winter Olympics in Italy, also set to be carried by NBC and its streaming service, Peacock.",
      "White, a three-time Olympic gold medalist who retired after the 2022 Games in Beijing, said a key reason for starting the league was to bring together the world's top action-sports stars, who often divide time between a number of circuits, including the Dew Tour and stops on the Grand Prix and X Games tours.",
      "\u201cIn the end, we really want to be that premier thing, where it\u2019s amazing to go to the Olympics and win a medal, but this is like winning Wimbledon or the NBA finals. It\u2019s almost more prestigious,\u201d White said in an interview earlier this year.",

      "When the Pixies set out to make their 1988 debut studio album, they enlisted Steve Albini to engineer \u201cSurfer Rosa,\u201d the seminal alternative record which includes the enduring hit, \u201cWhere Is My Mind?\u201d That experience was mutually beneficial to both parties \u2014 and was the beginning of a decades-long friendship between the prickly Albini and Kim Deal, the band\u2019s bassist at the time.",
      "Nearly 35 years later \u2014 and just before the acclaimed audio engineer died in May at age 61 \u2014 Deal turned to Albini once again for what would be their final collaboration, this time for another debut. Eight of the 11 tracks on Deal\u2019s first solo studio album, \u201cNobody Loves You More,\" were produced by both Albini and Deal \u2014 the ideal partnership of his experimentation and her musical skill.",
      "Deal\u2019s music has always been a reflection of both the rugged exterior needed to be a woman at the forefront of the '90s alternative rock scene as well as a tenderness that subverts the indifference often characterizing that same scene.",
      "Those features, ostensibly at odds with one another, culminate in \u201cNobody Loves You More,\u201d thanks to her poignant lyricism and the unique instrumentation woven throughout the record. At its heart, this is still a rock album \u2014 one that Deal is uniquely suited to make.",
      "The album\u2019s final track, \u201cA Good Time Pushed,\u201d musically and lyrically captures the fine line between doom and joy. \u201cWe\u2019re having a good time,\u201d she repeats, in what is perhaps an effort to convince herself that she is.",
      "Although the continuity is there between this album and the music of the Pixies and Deal's band The Breeders, aspects of it are unequivocally distinct.",
      "The resounding brass instruments on the title track and \u201cCoast,\u201d along with the orchestra featured on \u201cSummerland,\" are a departure from the traditional rock instrumentation that many listeners have come to associate with the 63-year-old.",
      "As the album title suggests, much of the songs on \u201cNobody Loves You More\u201d are also lyrically earnest and romantic. \u201cAre you mine?/Are you my baby?/I have no mind/For nothin but love,\u201d Deal croons on the doo-wop-inspired \u201cAre You Mine?\u201d",
      "There are anomalies \u2014 like in the drum- and synth-heavy \u201cBig Ben Beat,\u201d which is evocative of rocker Kim Gordon\u2019s electronic pivot in 2024's \u201cThe Collective.\" That one was produced only by Deal, not Albini.",
      "As a whole, \u201cNobody Loves You More\u201d is varied \u2014 and as distinctly American as the myriad locations which inspired it, from the Massachusetts island of Nantucket (the breezy sounds of \u201cCoast\u201d) to the Florida Keys (\"Summerland\") to Deal's hometown of Dayton, Ohio.",
      "Fans of the Pixies and the Breeders will find a lot to enjoy here \u2014 it is both familiar and different.",

      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge ordered prosecutors Tuesday not to use papers taken from the jail cell of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs until he rules on defense claims that they are trial preparation materials protected by attorney-client privilege.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian made his ruling at a Manhattan federal court hearing after lawyers fiercely disputed the circumstances and relevance of the seizure of 19 pages that were photographed by an investigator inside the cell of the music mogul.",
      "Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to all charges, is accused of coercing and abusing women for years with the aid of a network of associates and employees.",
      "The seizure came during what the government has described as a multi-day sweep of all cells at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, intended to remove any weapons or contraband as an anti-violence measure.",
      "Defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo said he may ask the judge to dismiss the indictment or force a recusal of prosecutors if the judge rules that the materials were obtained and used improperly.",
      "Combs, who hugged his lawyers when he first entered the courtroom, carried a stack of papers as he was led away at the end of the hearing.",
      "Agnifilo said he was unaware that the papers in Combs' cell had been photographed by an investigator with the Bureau of Prisons and turned over to prosecutors until he saw them cited in written arguments opposing his $50 million bail proposal. A bail hearing is set for Friday.",
      "He said two references to the papers were made as prosecutors argued that Combs has continued to commit crimes since his September arrest.",
      "Prosecutors said Combs orchestrated social media campaigns aimed at tainting the jury pool, tried to publicly leak materials he thought would be helpful to his case and contacted potential witnesses through third parties.",
      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Slavik said the seized materials were scrutinized by independent government lawyers who are walled off from the prosecution to determine if they were protected by attorney-client privilege.",
      "They were not discussed with defense lawyers because some of them were deemed to pertain to a covert and continuing investigation of Combs, she said.",
      "Slavik also said prosecutors had no contact with jail officials beforehand and gave no instructions regarding any search of Combs' cell.",
      "Some of the photographed pages contained a to-do list and inspirational quotes along with comments about birthdays, according to Slavik, while two excerpts pertained to Combs paying and finding damaging material about potential witnesses.",
      "Agnifilo said, however, that even things that seem unrelated to the case are protected by attorney-client privilege. For instance, he said, attorneys have discussed with Combs prospective witnesses they might call.",
      "\u201cEvery single thing\u201d in the seized papers is subject to attorney-client privilege because Combs discussed them with lawyers, Agnifilo said.",
      "\u201cThe government now knows potential defense witnesses for a May 5 trial,\u201d he added. \u201cThis has been a complete government failure.\u201d",
      "The judge asked each side to submit written arguments in the coming weeks."

    "summary": "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook &ldquo;Europe on 5 Dollars a Day,&rdquo; has died",
    "story": [
      "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by convincing average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\u201cMy father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\u201d",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry\u2019s best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer\u2019s brand, led today by his daughter Pauline, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy \u2014 stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants \u2014 changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\u201d That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn\u2019t hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship. The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn\u2019t visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer\u2019s guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer\u2019s advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks. \"It was really pioneering stuff,\u201d Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \u201cthat would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I\u2019ve got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\u201d",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\" The concept no longer made sense when hotels could not be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire did not disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer \u2014 in a David vs. Goliath triumph \u2014 got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\u201cI never dreamed at my age I\u2019d be working this hard,\u201d he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show. He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony postings. And he coined the phrase \u201cTrump Slump\u201d in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight. Eventually he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe,\" and a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece, distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Eventually Frommer gave up law to write the guides full-time. Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \u201cmost Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. \u2026 And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn\u2019t have to be well-heeled.\u201d",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \u201cI fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\u201d he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap, and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\u201d",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer\u2019s survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren."

      "Shuntaro Tanikawa, who pioneered modern Japanese poetry, poignant but conversational in its divergence from haiku and other traditions, has died",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Shuntaro Tanikawa, who pioneered modern Japanese poetry, poignant but conversational in its divergence from haiku and other traditions, has died. He was 92.",
      "Tanikawa, who translated the \u201cPeanuts\u201d comic strip and penned the lyrics for the theme song of the animation series \u201cAstro Boy,\u201d died Nov. 13, his son Kensaku Tanikawa said Tuesday. He said his father died at a Tokyo hospital due to old age.",
      "Shuntaro Tanikawa stunned the literary world with his 1952 debut \u201cTwo Billion Light Years of Solitude,\u201d a bold look at the cosmic in daily life, sensual, vivid but simple in its use of everyday language. Written before Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019 \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude,\u201d it became a bestseller.",
      "Tanikawa\u2019s \u201cKotoba Asobi Uta,\u201d or \u201cWord Play Songs,\u201d is a rhythmical experiment in juxtaposing words that sound similar, such as \u201ckappa,\u201d a mythical animal and \u201crappa,\u201d a horn, that makes for a joyful singsong compilation, filled with alliterations and onomatopoeia.",
      "\u201cFor me, the Japanese language is the ground. Like a plant, I place my roots, drink in the nutrients of the Japanese language, sprouting leaves, flowers and bearing fruit,\u201d he said in a 2022 interview with The Associated Press at his Tokyo home.",
      "Tanikawa explored the poetic, not only in the repetitive music of the spoken word but also the magic hidden in little things.",
      "One of his works is titled, \u201cI wanted to talk to you in the kitchen in the middle of the night.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the past, there was something about it being a job, being commissioned. Now, I can write as I want,\u201d he said.",
      "In every work Tanikawa tackled, including the script for Kon Ichikawa\u2019s \u201cTokyo Olympiad,\" a documentary film of the 1964 Tokyo Games, the respectful love for the beauty of the Japanese language resonates.",
      "He also translated Mother Goose, Maurice Sendak and Leo Lionni. Tanikawa has in turn been widely translated, including English, Chinese and various European languages.",
      "Some of his works were made into picture books for children, and they are often featured in Japanese school textbooks. He also incorporated Japanese words derived from foreign origins into his poems like Coca-Cola.",
      "In his prose poem with that title, in which a boy is opening a Coke can, he wrote: \u201cIf, for instance, he saw the infinite universe that started or ended at the tip of his can, he was totally unaware of it. One might be able to opine that he named every bit of the unknown about to swallow him with all the vocabulary he could muster, which included his future vocabulary that was yet dormant in his subconscious.\u201d",
      "In his debut poem that catapulted him to stardom, he is more sparse:",
      "\u201cBecause the universe goes on expanding, we are all uneasy. With the chill of two billion light-years of solitude, I suddenly sneezed,\u201d is the way the poem ends, as translated by William I. Elliott and Kazuo Kawamura.",
      "When asked about it, Tanikawa acknowledged it felt as though someone else had written it, but noted he still thought it was a good poem.",
      "\u201cTanikawa\u2019s poetry reflects a metaphysical and quasi-religious attitude toward experience. In simple, spare language, he sketches profound ideas and emotional truths,\u201d according to the Poetry Foundation, a U.S. literary organization.",
      "Tanikawa was born in 1931, a son of philosopher Tetsuzo Tanikawa, and began writing poetry in his teens, circulating with the famous poets of that era, like Makoto Ooka and Shuji Terayama.",
      "He said he used to think poems descended like an inspiration from the heavens. But, as he grew older, he felt the poems welling up from the ground.",
      "In person, Tanikawa was friendly and unassuming, often reading in public with other poets. He never seemed to take himself too seriously but used to confess his one regret in life was never finishing his education, having dropped out amid stardom at a young age.",
      "His relative isolation from the bleakly serious scholarly poetry scene of postwar Japan likely helped him take his free-verse approach that went on to innovate and define Japanese contemporary poetics.",
      "Tanikawa said he wasn\u2019t afraid of death, implying he perhaps meant to write a poem about that experience, too.",
      "\u201cI am more curious about where I will go when I die. It\u2019s a different world, right? Of course, I don\u2019t want pain. I don\u2019t want to die after major surgery or anything. I just want to die, all of a sudden,\u201d he said.",
      "He is survived by his son, musician Kensaku Tanikawa and daughter Shino and several grandchildren. Funeral services were held privately with family and friends. A farewell event in his honor is being planned, Kensaku Tanikawa said.",
      "\u201cAs they did with all of you, Shuntaro\u2019s poems stunned and moved me, making me chuckle or shed a tear. Wasn\u2019t it all so fun?\u201d he said. \u201cHis poems are with you forever.\u201d",

      "Italian authorities have announced the seizure of an illegal excavation of an Etruscan burial site in the central Umbria region",
      "ROME -- Italian authorities announced Tuesday the seizure of an illegal excavation of an Etruscan burial site in the central Umbria region and are investigating two people for suspected theft of urns, sarcophagi and other artifacts worth 8 million euros ($8.5 million) intended for sale on the black market.",
      "The illegal dig was adjacent to another Etruscan burial site discovered by a farmer tilling his land in 2015, authorities said. They were tipped off by photographs of artifacts and the site that were circulating on the black market that resembled objects found on the farmer's land.",
      "Using a drone for aerial photography and phone taps, they located the second site on land belonging to a local businessman who had access to earthmoving equipment.",
      "At the new site they found two sarcophagi, believed to be of two Etruscan princesses, one still with the skeleton inside, and a burial trousseau complete with urns with battle and hunting scenes, perfume jars and a comb made from bone.",
      "The Etruscan civilization existed from about 900 B.C. to 27 B.C. in central Italy primarily between the Tiber and Arno rivers, covering parts of present-day Tuscany, Umbria and Lazio.",
      "___",
      "The headline of this story has been corrected to reflect that the artifacts recovered are worth $8.5 million, not $8.5 billion."

      "After almost a year of testimony, prosecutors in Atlanta rested their case against the two remaining defendants in a gang and racketeering trial that had included rapper Young Thug before he pleaded guilty",
      "ATLANTA -- After almost a year of testimony in a sweeping gang and racketeering indictment against Young Thug and an initial 27 defendants, prosecutors rested their case Tuesday in the longest trial in Georgia's history.",
      "Both Deamonte Kendrick, also known as Yak Gotti, and Shannon Stillwell told the judge Tuesday they would not testify in their own defense. Both earlier rejected plea offers after over a week of negotiation.",
      "Defense lawyers indicated that they would ask Fulton County Superior Court Judge Paige Reese Whitaker to direct the jury to issue a verdict of not guilty against Kendrick and Stillwell on Wednesday, which requires the lawyers to argue that no reasonable person could find that the state had proved Kendrick and Stillwell guilty.",
      "If Whitaker rejects the request for a directed verdict, lawyers are also likely Wednesday to argue about instructions to jurors about what they must find to convict Kendrick and Stillwell.",
      "Jurors will return on Thursday and could begin deliberation before the end of the week.",
      "Young Thug, the 33-year-old Atlanta-born Grammy winning artist whose given name is Jeffery Williams, pleaded guilty to gang, drug and gun charges in October after negotiations with prosecutors broke down. That left the sentence up to Whitaker, who gave him a 40-year sentence that let him walk free on probation with hefty restrictions, including a ban from the metro Atlanta area for the first 10 years except for certain occasions.",
      "The slow-moving trial has been fraught with problems from the start. Jury selection took nearly 10 months, and Fulton County Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville, the original judge, was removed from the case in July after defense attorneys filed a recusal motion based on a secretive meeting he held with prosecutors and a state witness.",
      "Whitaker took over the case and often lost patience with prosecutors for what she once called \u201cpoor lawyering.\u201d She and defense attorneys scolded prosecutors for not sharing evidence in advance.",
      "More than 175 witnesses testified throughout the trial. Prosecutors alleged that Young Thug and two others co-founded a violent criminal street gang in 2012 called Young Slime Life, or YSL, which they say is affiliated with the national Bloods gang.",
      "At Young Thug's plea hearing, defense attorney Brian Steel said that Young Thug was \u201cfalsely accused\" and the evidence against him was weak. He also condemned the use of rap lyrics during the trial.",
      "Steel said he thought they were winning the trial and wanted to stick it out to a jury verdict, but Young Thug wanted to go home to his family instead of sitting through the rest of the trial, which felt like \u201chell.\u201d",
      "Nine people charged in the indictment, including Atlanta rapper Gunna, whose real name is Sergio Kitchens, accepted plea deals before the trial began. Twelve others are to be tried separately. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case."

      "Australian writer Richard Flanagan has won Britain\u2019s leading nonfiction book prize, a decade after being awarded the Booker Prize for fiction",
      "LONDON -- Australian writer Richard Flanagan completed an unprecedented literary double on Tuesday, winning Britain\u2019s leading nonfiction book prize a decade after being awarded the Booker Prize for fiction.",
      "Flanagan was awarded the 50,000 pound ($63,000) Baillie Gifford Prize for his genre-bending memoir \u201cQuestion 7,\u201d which combines autobiography, family history and the story of the development of the atomic bomb.",
      "Flanagan won the Booker Prize in 2014 for \u201cThe Narrow Road to the Deep North,\u201d a novel that drew on his father\u2019s experiences as a World War II prisoner of the Japanese military.",
      "Baillie Gifford Prize director Toby Mundy said that for the same writer to win the leading U.K.-based fiction and nonfiction awards was \u201ccompletely unprecedented.\u201d",
      "Journalist Isabel Hilton, who chaired the judging panel, said Flanagan had written a \u201cmeditative symphony of a book\u201d that weaves together \u201cenormous traumatic events of the 20th century \u2026 with an extraordinary personal narrative.\u201d",
      "Hilton said Flanagan\u2019s fiction background was evident in the book\u2019s inventiveness and \u201cnarrative beat.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the book benefitted from that novelist\u2019s eye,\u201d she said.",
      "Flanagan was not on hand to receive the trophy in person at a ceremony in London. Organizers said he was trekking in the Tasmanian rainforest.",
      "Flanagan\u2019s book beat five other finalists, including American writer Annie Jacobsen\u2019s sobering \u201cNuclear War: A Scenario\u201d and Pulitzer Prize winner Viet Thanh Nguyen\u2019s autobiographical \u201cA Man of Two Faces: A Memoir, A History, A Memorial.\u201d",
      "Founded in 1999, the Baillie Gifford Prize recognizes English-language books in current affairs, history, politics, science, sport, travel, biography, autobiography and the arts. It has been credited with bringing an eclectic slate of fact-based books to a wider audience.",
      "Last year\u2019s winner was John Vaillant\u2019s real-life climate-change thriller \u201cFire Weather: A True Story from a Hotter World.\u201d",
      "Sponsor Baillie Gifford, an Edinburgh-based finance firm, has faced protests from environmental groups over its investments in fossil fuel businesses. Amid the controversy, the company stopped sponsoring several British book festivals, including the Edinburgh International Book Festival.",
      "That has prompted a backlash from others in the culture world, who say it starves the arts of much-needed funding.",
      "Mundy said the nonfiction prize hoped to renew Baillie Gifford\u2019s sponsorship, which runs until 2026.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been exemplary sponsors and I think exemplary supporters of the literary culture of this country,\u201d he said."

      "Father John Misty\u2019s sixth studio album is titled \u201cMahashmashana,\u201d a reference to cremation",
      "The title of Father John Misty's sixth studio album, \u201cMahashmashana,\u201d is a reference to cremation, and the first song proposes \u201ca corpse dance.\u201d Religious overtones mix with the undercurrent of a midlife crisis atop his folk chamber pop. And for those despairing recent events, some lyrics seem topical.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always the darkest right before the end,\u201d Misty sings on \u201cScreamland,\u201d a power ballad full of desperation and overdriven amplifiers. His advice: \u201cStay young, get numb, keep dreaming.\u201d",
      "\u201cScreamland\u201d is one of eight songs on \u201cMahashmashana,\u201d Misty\u2019s jaundiced, smart, cynical, droll, druggy, opaque, arch, theatrical take on life \u2013 and death. The album will be released Friday, Nov. 22.",
      "Misty, the stage name for Josh Tillman, describes himself in one song as a windbag. While that\u2019s a bit harsh, the album will delight those who enjoy listening to music with a dictionary.",
      "\u201cShaken like a pawl fly/obscene as a lick,\u201d Misty sings on the title cut. \u201cPanoply,\u201d \u201cpanopticon\u201d and \u201cthe Anthropocene\u201d also receive mentions.",
      "Misty can be verbose or concise: Three song titles are complete sentences. Incongruous but colorful couplets come in waves, seeking answers while unsure of the question.",
      "Misty frames his wordsmithery in cinematic rock noir arrangements as dense as the lyrics. A marvelous string section underpins the lush sound, darting and swooping amid thundering drums and a pounding piano.",
      "Tempos tend toward slow, matching Misty\u2019s melodrama. But \u201cShe Cleans Up\u201d is delightfully jagged art rock, with slashing guitars and sax, and \u201cI Guess Time Just Makes Fools of Us All\u201d pairs a sweet groove and sour outlook. Characters come and go on the latter tune, but through nine verses the song repeatedly reaches the same rueful conclusion.",
      "The title cut runs even longer, needing nearly 10 minutes for descriptions, such as courtiers \u201cresplendent in donor class panache.\u201d It\u2019s a love story.",
      "So is \u201cMental Health,\u201d a whimsical ode to insanity with Disney-esque woodwinds and backing vocals. \u201cNo one knows you like yourself,\u201d goes one lyric. \u201cYou two should speak in the presence of a licensee.\u201d",
      "On \u201cMahashmashana,\u201d Misty wrestles with a reality that is confounding, off-kilter, even crazy, knowing it won\u2019t end well. Root for him.",

      "\u201cWicked\u201d lovers, prepare your pink outfits \u2013 and your green ones",
      "It\u2019s the ultimate celebrity redemption tour, two decades in the making. In the annals of pop culture, few characters have undergone an image makeover quite like the Wicked Witch of the West.",
      "Oh, she may have been vengeful and scary in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d But something changed \u2014 like, REALLY changed \u2014 on the way from the yellow brick road to the Great White Way. Since 2003, crowds have packed nightly into \u201cWicked\u201d at Broadway\u2019s Gershwin Theatre to cheer as the green-skinned, misunderstood Elphaba rises up on her broomstick to belt \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d that enduring girl-power anthem.",
      "How many people have seen \u201cWicked\u201d? Rudimentary math suggests more than 15 million on Broadway alone. And now we have \u201cWicked\u201d the movie, director Jon M. Chu\u2019s lavish, faithful, impeccably crafted (and nearly three-hour) ode to this origin story of Elphaba and her (eventual) bestie \u2014 Glinda, the very good and very blonde. Welcome to Hollywood, ladies.",
      "Before we get to what this movie does well (Those big numbers! Those costumes!), just a couple thornier issues to ponder. Will this \u201cWicked,\u201d powered by a soulful Cynthia Erivo (owner of one of the best singing voices on the planet) and a sprightly, comedic, hair-tossing Ariana Grande, turn even musical theater haters into lovers?",
      "Tricky question. Some people just don\u2019t buy into the musical thing, and they should be allowed to live freely amongst us. But if people breaking into song delights rather than flummoxes you, if elaborate dance numbers in village squares and fantastical nightclubs and emerald-hued cities make perfect sense to you, and especially if you already love \u201cWicked,\u201d well then, you will likely love this film. If it feels like they made the best \u201cWicked\u201d movie money could buy \u2014 well, it\u2019s because they kinda did.",
      "Much credit for that goes to Chu, who has said he spent so many years working on \u201cWicked\u201d that three of his five children were born during that span. Chu clearly has musical theater in his DNA, as we already knew from \u201cIn the Heights.\u201d His actors don\u2019t break awkwardly into composer Stephen Schwartz\u2019s famous pop-show tunes: they run headlong into them, and sometimes blow the roof off with them.",
      "Another question: Will people be turned off when they see \u201cTo Be Continued\u201d at the end, after two hours and 40 minutes, realizing they must wait a year for Part 2? Also tricky. Surely this COULD have been one movie. But then, how would they have followed \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d which brings down the Act 1 curtain (and the house) in the show? It\u2019s hard to imagine just continuing with the plot.",
      "Yes, the plot: We begin with Grande\u2019s Glinda descending on Munchkinland in her glistening bubble, which since 1939 has been upgraded with a comfy sofa, to announce that, indeed, the wicked witch is dead.",
      "But someone challenges Glinda: Is it true you were her friend? Well, er, yes, Glinda replies carefully. Their paths did cross \u2014 back at school.",
      "Cue opening day at Shiz University. Glinda \u2014 well, for now, Galinda \u201cwith a ga\u201d \u2014 an aspiring sorcery major, arrives in her pink suit looking like mix of Grace Kelly and Elle Woods. She already has a fan base and a private suite.",
      "Also arriving is Elphaba there to help her sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode) settle in. The students are horrified at her green skin. But when imperious Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh), dean of sorcery at Shiz, gets a glimpse of Elphaba\u2019s unharnessed magical powers, the green girl becomes her prized student.",
      "Elphaba hopes her sorcery lessons will lead to a meeting with the all-powerful Wizard of Oz, whose glorified head is carved into the campus and who, she secretly hopes, will grant her wish to be \u201cde-greenified.\u201d She sings of this wish in \u201cThe Wizard and I,\u201d a lovely number introducing Erivo\u2019s uniquely supple vocals.",
      "Another upbeat number, \u201cWhat is this Feeling?,\" introduces the \u201cloathing, unadulterated loathing\u201d between Elphaba and Glinda, forced to room together. These early songs have a zippy appeal, and the best is \u201cDancing Through Life,\u201d a bang-up dance number that showcases the rakish charm of local prince Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey of \u201cBridgerton,\u201d dripping with charm) who proudly urges fellow students to join him in his shallowness.",
      "\u201cLife\u2019s more painless, for the brainless,\u201d sings Bailey, accompanied by acrobatic dancers on huge, coordinated \u201ctornado wheels\u201d in a fabulous library. \u201cLife Is fraught less, when you\u2019re thoughtless.\u201d Fiyero will develop into something different in Part 2. For now, he woos Glinda and strikes up a friendship with Elphaba.",
      "But \u201cWicked\u201d is about female friendship, and the sudden, surprising bond between polar opposites Glinda and Elphaba \u2014 chirpy vs. deep, pink-clad vs. black-clad.

      "The lessons of Socrates have never really gone out of style, but if there\u2019s ever a perfect time to revisit the ancient philosopher, now is it.",
      "In \u201cHow to Think Like Socrates: Ancient Philosophy as a Way of Life in the Modern World,\u201d Donald J. Robertson describes Socrates' Athens in terms that seem all too familiar: a society recovering from a pandemic where people's trust in government is shaken, and an extremely polarized split between political factions.",
      "Despite its title, Robertson's book isn't solely a self-help guide based on ancient philosophy. Robertson's book is certainly easier than slogging through Plato and multiple volumes of ancient Greek history.",
      "But the book is inconsistent and difficult to follow sometimes, as it bounces from an easy distillation of Socrates' philosophy to an all-too-detailed history of ancient Greece. Some of the history is understandably needed to give context to Socrates, but often it feels as though Robertson is writing two separate books for two different audiences.",
      "The explanation of Socrates, particularly a section walking readers through the Socratic Method \u2014 the question-based method Socrates used to teach students \u2014 is the strongest portion of Robertson's book. The book offers a solid biography of Socrates and his times, but it could use some work weaving in the modern-day application of his lessons.",
      "Robertson easily demonstrates throughout the book how Socratic philosophy can be used for addressing fear, including anxiety over death. His lessons on how to defend ourselves against rhetoric are particularly timely in an era of rampant misinformation.",
      "Robertson also successfully explains to readers why they should be skeptical of the sweeping generalizations offered by self-help books.",
      "\u201cWisdom requires being able to identify when a rule no longer holds true, and good advice becomes bad advice,\u201d he writes.",
      "Through Robertson is able to underscore how timeless Socrates' advice remains, his book could stand to be more accessible for readers hoping to find that advice.",

      "BetMGM said the fight was its most-bet boxing or mixed-martial arts fight, taking three times the number of bets and four times the money of any combat sport in the sportsbook's history. A Caesars Sportsbook official said the fight was on par with an NFL Monday night game.",

      "Now, after his career as sheriff of fictional Absaroka County, Wyoming, comes to an end, Longmire tells the decades-old tale to a friend. The result is \u201cTooth and Claw,\u201d the second short novel (the other being \u201cFirst Frost,\u201d published last May) in which Craig Johnson adds flesh and muscle to the back story of a character featured in 21 novels and the TV series \u201cLongmire\u201d that spanned six seasons on A&E and Netflix.",
      "The action begins when Longmire accompanies U.S. Geological Survey researchers on a flight to a remote pack of frozen sea ice. Things go bad from the start when an enormous polar bear kills and eats a member of the team. Then it gets worse.",
      "A sudden blizzard forces the team to seek shelter in their small plane. Plunging temperatures cause equipment, including some of their weapons, to malfunction. Powerful winds tear the plane from its moorings and send it skittering upside down across the ice. The ice cracks, threatening to drop the plane into the sea. And the bear, whose white coat makes him all but impossible to see in the landscape of snow and ice, is still hunting them.",
      "The crew sees salvation in the form of a ship\u2019s hull in the near distance, but when they flee from the plane and scramble aboard, they discover that it is the SS Baychimo, a legendary ghost ship that has been floating around the Arctic since it was abandoned by its crew in 1931.",
      "They gather in the captain\u2019s quarters, find coal to burn in a stove to keep from freezing to death, and struggle to get the ship\u2019s ancient radio working so they can summon help. But before long, they discover they are not alone. The bear found the ship first and has made it his home.",
      "Meanwhile, the storm and the bear are not their only problems. A few greedy members of the research team have a secret agenda that puts Longmire in further peril.",

      "But the Jones family decided to show up for the event Sunday night in Hollywood for a celebration of his life and work with humor from Jamie Foxx, a rousing performance by Jennifer Hudson and a moment with his family: His daughter Rashida Jones even read the speech he had been working on up until a month ago.",
      "\u201cWe felt like we wanted to celebrate his beautiful life and career,\u201d she said. \u201cHis music has literally defined an entire century of culture spanning genres.\u201d",
      "It was a moving end to a celebratory evening that had Hugh Grant roasting Curtis for getting a \u201ckind of Oscar\u201d and Daniel Craig celebrating the legacy of the James Bond films.",
      "The audience in the Ray Dolby Ballroom was starrier than even the Oscars. The event, put on by the film academy\u2019s board of governors, is also a de-facto campaign stop for Oscar hopefuls as awards season gets underway.",
      "Everywhere you looked there were famous faces greeting one another: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson at the bar ordering a margarita on the rocks; Jude Law and Kristen Wiig exchanging hellos; Zooey Deschanel sipping champagne; Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz Beckham wandering around; Saoirse Ronan and Elizabeth Olsen deep in conversation; Sharon Stone hugging Kieran Culkin; Jesse Eisenberg chatting with Elle Fanning; and Jeremy Strong taking a selfie with Guy Pearce.",
      "Others remained near their seats, like Jennifer Lawrence, June Squibb and Angelina Jolie, who attended alongside her son Knox Jolie-Pitt. They sat beside her \u201cMaria\u201d director Pablo Larra\u00edn and across from \u201cHis Three Daughters\u201d stars Natasha Lyonne and Olson. At another table, Barry Keoghan kept making his way to Margarat Qualley\u2019s side, squeezing in between her and Demi Moore.",
      "But most of the schmoozing subsided for the main event. With no television cameras or band to play anyone off during a speech, it is a night during which friends and colleagues can pay tribute to the year\u2019s honorary Oscar recipients.",
      "Broccoli and her brother Wilson followed in her father\u2019s footsteps receiving the rarely given Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, celebrating the work of producers. Albert \u201cCubby\u201d Broccoli accepted his own trophy, then a bust of Thalberg, at the 1982 Academy Awards as they looked on from the audience.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heavier than I thought,\u201d Wilson said, holding the Oscar statuette.",
      "Broccoli also commented on the importance of producers, a credit she said that lately is being handed out like party favors.",
      "They got some gentle ribbing from Craig beforehand. Broccoli, he said, \u201ccackles, I mean, crackles with passion.\u201d But for a man who has always had a seemingly conflicted relationship with his Bond era, his admiration for them was evident.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much I admire your integrity,\u201d Craig said. \u201cThese (Bond movies) are the most expensive independent films ever made.\u201d",
      "Grant was less delicate but infinitely funnier paying tribute to Curtis, who has written for and directed him in many films including \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral,\u201d \u201cNotting Hill\u201d and \u201cLove, Actually.\u201d",
      "\u201cWould we call it an Oscar? It\u2019s a kind of Oscar,\u201d Grant said. \u201cIt\u2019s a better than nothing Oscar.\u201d",
      "Curtis may be best known for his contributions to romantic comedies, but the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award was for a lifetime of charitable work, which Grant said was \u201cannoying and frankly selfish.\u201d In his acceptance speech, Curtis made a plea to the room to set aside a small portion of film budgets to hire an impact producer.",
      "Nicole Kidman presented the honorary Oscar to Taylor, a casting director unaccustomed to being publicly celebrated for her contributions to cinema. In her career of more than four decades, she cast classics like \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d \u201cWorking Girl,\u201d \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d and \u201cSchindler\u2019s List.\u201d Squibb, at the event with her \u201cThelma\u201d director Josh Margolin, said that Taylor cast her in her fist film, Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cAlice.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have a career in motion pictures without it,\u201d Squibb said.",
      "While Taylor was excited about her award, she was even happier that her peers are soon going to be regularly recognized. Starting with films released in 2025, the film academy will give a new competitive Oscar to casting directors.",
      "There were many somber references throughout the evening to the events of the \u201clast few weeks,\u201d although no one speaking from the stage said anything much more specific. Jamie Foxx, introducing the Quincy Jones tribute, did his own little impersonation of President Elect Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cWhy is everyone so down on these few weeks,\u201d he said.",
      "Foxx quickly got back on track to speak about Jones, whose celebration closed out the evening on a cathartic note.",
      "\u201cHe was really excited to attend tonight,\u201d Rashida Jones said. \u201cHe has so many friends in this room. Well, actually, probably in every room to be honest because wherever he went he made connections with everyone. Real ones. He knew how to stay present, to stay curious, to stay loving.\"",
      "Jones invited the audience to listen on the way home, to go for the deepest cuts.",
      "\u201cThere's an entire universe waiting in his seven decades of music,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd while you listen, hear him, hear how he imbued love into every single second of music he made. That was his real legacy: Love.\u201d"

      "Mehmet Oz, a celebrity heart surgeon turned talk show host and lifestyle guru, is President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the massive federal health care bureaucracy that covers more than a third of Americans.",
      "Here's a look at a television doctor who became a politician and is now designated to lead an agency that touches nearly all Americans in some way.",
      "Trained as a heart surgeon, Oz rose to prominence on Oprah Winfrey's leading daytime television show before spinning off his own series, \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\" in 2009.",
      "The program aired for 13 seasons and made Oz a household name.",
      "Oz stopped doing surgeries in 2018 but his physician license remains active in Pennsylvania through the end of this year, according to the state's online database.",
      "Oz is an author of New York Times bestsellers, an Emmy-winning TV show host, radio talk show host, presidential appointee, founder of a national nonprofit to educate teens about healthy habits, and self-styled ambassador for wellness.",
      "He also guest hosted the \u201cJeopardy!\u201d game show and helped save a dying man at Newark Liberty International Airport.",
      "Oz was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of a heart surgeon who emigrated from Turkey.",
      "He attended a private high school in Delaware and Harvard University as a college undergraduate, also playing football there, and served in the Turkish army to maintain his dual citizenship.",
      "Oz dispensed nutritional and lifestyle advice on his show, portraying himself as a trusted doctor capable of explaining health matters in an engaging and approachable way. But his show also blurred the line between medical advice and advertising, failing to make clear to his audience just how closely he worked with the companies he pitched.",
      "He repeatedly promoted products of questionable medical value and was named in lawsuits that alleged he made misleading claims on the show. Several of the companies he has promoted are structured as multilevel marketing businesses whose practices have repeatedly drawn the attention of federal regulators.",
      "Oz had a net worth between $100 million and $315 million, according to a federal financial disclosure he filed in 2022, which gives dollar values in ranges but does not provide specific figures.",
      "Oz ran for U.S. Senate as a Republican in 2022, one of the highest-profile races of that year's midterms. Though he was a longtime resident of New Jersey and worked in New York City, Oz ran in Pennsylvania, citing ties to the state through his wife's parents.",
      "His campaign leaned heavily into his celebrity. Its logo looked just like his TV show logo. His themes \u2014 \u201ca dose of reality\u201d or \u201cthe doctor is in\u201d \u2014 spun off his TV doctor reputation.",
      "He ran in a crowded Republican primary and won Trump's eagerly sought endorsement.",
      "\u201cWomen, in particular, are drawn to Dr. Oz for his advice and counsel. I have seen this many times over the years. They know him, believe in him, and trust him,\u201d Trump said when he endorsed Oz.",
      "Following a court battle that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Oz narrowly won the primary over McCormick by 951 votes but lost to Democrat John Fetterman in the general election.",
      "Oz told The Associated Press in a 2022 interview that he first met Trump in 2004 or 2005 when he asked Trump to use his golf course for an event for Oz\u2019s children\u2019s charity. Trump agreed. After that, they saw each other intermittently at social events before Oz interviewed Trump about his health during the 2016 presidential campaign.",
      "In a 2016 appearance on \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d Trump said his wife, Melania Trump, was \u201ca big fan\u201d of the show.",
      "Trump appointed Oz to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition during his first term.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate to lead CMS, Oz would oversee Medicare, Medicaid, children\u2019s health insurance and the Affordable Care Act, better known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d The programs cover more than 160 million people, from newborns to nursing home residents.",
      "CMS also plays a central role in the nation\u2019s $4.5 trillion health care economy, setting Medicare payment rates for hospitals, doctors, labs and other service providers. Government payment levels become the foundation for private insurers. The agency also sets standards that govern how health care providers operate.",
      "The agency has more than 6,000 employees and a $1.1 trillion budget."

      "A South Dakota judge has dismissed a lawsuit that an anti-abortion group filed in June targeting an abortion rights measure that voters went on to reject",
      "A South Dakota judge dismissed a lawsuit that an anti-abortion group filed in June targeting an abortion rights measure that voters rejected this month.",
      "In an order dated Friday, Circuit Court Judge John Pekas granted Life Defense Fund's motion to dismiss its lawsuit against Dakotans for Health, the measure group.",
      "In a statement, Life Defense Fund co-chair Leslee Unruh said: \u201cThe people have decided, and South Dakotans overwhelmingly rejected this constitutional abortion measure. We have won in the court of public opinion, and South Dakotans clearly saw the abortion lobby\u2019s deception.\u201d",
      "Dakotans for Health co-founder Rick Weiland said he had expected the lawsuit to be dismissed.",
      "\u201cThe Life Defense Fund\u2019s accusations were part of a broader, failed effort to keep Amendment G off the ballot and silence the voices of South Dakota voters,\u201d Weiland said in a statement. \"But make no mistake \u2014 this dismissal is just one battle in a much larger war over the future of direct democracy in South Dakota.\u201d",
      "Life Defense Fund's lawsuit had challenged petitions that got the measure on the ballot, saying they contained invalid signatures and circulators committed fraud and various wrongdoing. The anti-abortion group sought to invalidate the ballot initiative and bar the measure group and its workers from doing ballot-measure work for four years.",
      "The judge initially dismissed the lawsuit in July, but the state Supreme Court sent it back to him in August. In September, an apparent misunderstanding between attorneys and the court regarding scheduling of the trial pushed the case back until after the election.",
      "Even before the measure made the ballot in May, South Dakota's Republican-led Legislature cemented its formal opposition and passed a law allowing people to withdraw their petition signatures.",
      "A South Dakota law that took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 outlaws abortion and makes it a felony to perform one except to save the life of the mother.",
      "South Dakota was one of three states where abortion rights measures failed this month. The others were Florida and Nebraska. Voters in six other states passed such measures.",

    "story": [
      "A judge has struck down Wyoming\u2019s overall ban on abortion and its first-in-the nation explicit prohibition on the use of medication to end pregnancy",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- A state judge on Monday struck down Wyoming's overall ban on abortion and its first-in-the-nation explicit prohibition on the use of medication to end pregnancy in line with voters in yet more states voicing support for abortion rights.",
      "Since 2022, Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens has ruled consistently three times to block the laws while they were disputed in court.",
      "The decision marks another victory for abortion rights advocates after voters in seven states passed measures in support of access.",
      "One Wyoming law that Owens said violated women's rights under the state constitution bans abortion except to protect to a pregnant woman's life or in cases involving rape and incest. The other made Wyoming the only state to explicitly ban abortion pills, though other states have instituted de facto bans on the medication by broadly prohibiting abortion.",
      "The laws were challenged by four women, including two obstetricians, and two nonprofit organizations. One of the groups, Wellspring Health Access, opened as the state\u2019s first full-service abortion clinic in years in April 2023 following an arson attack in 2022.",
      "\u201cThis is a wonderful day for the citizens of Wyoming \u2014 and women everywhere who should have control over their own bodies,\" Wellspring Health Access President Julie Burkhart said in a statement.",
      "The recent elections saw voters in Missouri clear the way to undo one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bans in a series of victories for abortion rights advocates. Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota, meanwhile, defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment in support of abortion rights, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "The abortion landscape underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion and cleared the way for bans to take effect in most Republican-controlled states.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "Nearly every ban has been challenged with a lawsuit. Courts have blocked enforcement of some restrictions, including bans throughout pregnancy in Utah and Wyoming. Judges struck down bans in Georgia and North Dakota in September 2024. Georgia\u2019s Supreme Court ruled the next month that the ban there can be enforced while it considers the case.",
      "In the Wyoming case, the women and nonprofits who challenged the laws argued that the bans stood to harm their health, well-being and livelihoods, claims disputed by attorneys for the state. They also argued the bans violated a 2012 state constitutional amendment saying competent Wyoming residents have a right to make their own health care decisions.",
      "As she had done with previous rulings, Owens found merit in both arguments. The abortion bans \u201cwill undermine the integrity of the medical profession by hamstringing the ability of physicians to provide evidence-based medicine to their patients,\u201d Owens ruled.",
      "The abortion laws impede the fundamental right of women to make health care decisions for an entire class of people \u2014 those who are pregnant \u2014 in violation of the constitutional amendment, Owens ruled.",
      "Wyoming voters approved the amendment amid fears of government overreach following approval of the federal Affordable Care Act and its initial requirements for people to have health insurance.",
      "Attorneys for the state argued that health care, under the amendment, didn\u2019t include abortion. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon, whose administration has defended the laws passed in 2022 and 2023, did not immediately return an email message Monday seeking comment.",
      "Both sides wanted Owens to rule on the lawsuit challenging the abortion bans rather than allow it to go to trial in the spring. A three-day bench trial before Owens was previously set, but won\u2019t be necessary with this ruling."

      "Kansas has promised to provide more hospital beds for mentally ill criminal defendants",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- Kansas has promised to provide more hospital beds for mentally ill criminal defendants to settle a federal lawsuit filed over defendants waiting months for evaluations of whether they were fit for a trial.",
      "The agreement between state officials and representatives of five defendants requires the state to \u201cuse its best efforts\u201d to open a new psychiatric hospital by January 2027 in Wichita, the state's largest city. Officials also must seek funding from the Kansas Legislature to reopen a previously closed 30-bed unit at its psychiatric hospital in Larned in western Kansas, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.",
      "The agreement was announced this week by the two groups pursuing the lawsuit, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and the National Police Accountability Project, based in the Seattle area. The groups sued in 2022 on behalf of attorneys for four defendants and the mother of a fifth. The accused were identified only by their initials.",
      "The state operates two psychiatric hospitals, but only the one in Larned has a unit for evaluating whether mentally ill criminal defendants can understand their cases and participate in their own defense. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Larned State Hospital has had fewer than 80 beds for defendants awaiting evaluation.",
      "The state Department for Aging and Disability Services, which runs the Larned facility, acknowledged before the lawsuit was filed that defendants were waiting an average of about 11 months to be evaluated. The lawsuit said defendants remained in county jails that weren't providing adequate treatment, making the inmates' conditions worse and violating their rights. The lawsuit also said the state was violating the federal Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating against people with mental health problems.",
      "\u201cThis settlement is more than a legal agreement; it\u2019s a lifeline for those who have been lost in the system, a promise that their dignity and humanity will no longer be ignored,\u201d said Lauren Bonds, the police accountability group's executive director.",
      "One of the five defendants covered by the lawsuit had been held in a county jail for 13 months facing criminal threat charges when the lawsuit was filed. That's longer than the maximum prison sentence for a conviction on that charge.",
      "\u201cRemaining in the jail environment is devastating and deeply harmful even for those whose mental health is not in question, and condemning Kansans to languish across the state in their county jails was contradictory to our values of justice,\" said Monica Bennett, the ACLU of Kansas' legal director.",
      "State officials argued that they already had been addressing the long waits. The state began having Larned State Hospital officials operate a mobile evaluation unit in 2019; and in 2022, the Legislature passed a law to allow other qualified hospitals and organizations to examine criminal defendants.",
      "The state and Wichita's home county hope to start construction early next year on a secure, $101.5 million psychiatric hospital with 104 beds, half of them set aside for the state. Federal COVID-19 relief dollars provided part of the funding.",
      "KDADS spokesperson Cara Sloan-Ramos said the department and Gov. Laura Kelly are committed to reducing wait times.",
      "Republican state Rep. Stephen Owens, chair of the House committee handling criminal justice issues, was pleased that the state could settle the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly been aware of this issue and have been working on solutions,\" Owens said Tuesday."

Most people infected don\u2019t have symptoms, but in severe cases, polio can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis within hours, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that 1 in 200 polio cases results in permanent paralysis, usually of the legs.",
      "Poland's inspectorate said about 86% of the country's 3-year-olds have been vaccinated against polio and that vaccinating at least 95% of children can prevent the spread of the virus. Poland has seen the rise of anti-vaccination movements among some parents, which has worried health officials.",

      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at these climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan, called COP29",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Good or bad, the United Nations climate negotiations process itself became the focus of the international talks that aim to curb warming from coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at the climate talks called COP29. At the same time, a letter signed by a former United Nations secretary-general and ex-top climate negotiators called for dramatic reform. And the conference's chief negotiator said current talks \u2014 aimed at striking a deal worth hundreds of billions of dollars to help finance a transition to clean energy and adapting to climate change \u2014 were going too slowly.",
      "All that put the focus on process \u2014 not results.",
      "\u201cWe consider COP29 as a litmus test for the global climate architecture,\" conference lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev said at a Friday news conference.",
      "A letter signed by former U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon, former U.N. climate secretary Christiana Figueres and former Ireland President Mary Robinson called for \u201ca fundamental overhaul of the COP.\"",
      "\"We need a shift from negotiation to implementation,\u201d it said.",
      "Two signees \u2014 Figueres and Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research \u2014 said the letter was being badly misinterpreted as criticism of the climate talks. They said the letter was intended to show support for the process, which they said has worked and just needs to shift into a new mode.",
      "Instead of spending so much effort negotiating new deals in annual conferences that can attract 70,000 people, the process should be smaller and more frequent and aimed at putting what was already agreed upon into action, Rockstrom said.",
      "\u201cIt's about strengthening the COP,\" Rockstrom said. \u201cIt's about recognizing we\u2019ve accomplished so much that we have what we need. ... We really need to get serious about delivery.\"",
      "Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare said he had issues with some of the suggestions in the letter and personally considers the COP process broken. His analysis this week showed that after the 2015 Paris agreement projected future warming dropped, but in the past three years, warming projections \u2014 based on negotiations, promises and policies \u2014 for the future have stayed the same or even gone up slightly.",
      "An analysis from the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition said Friday that the official attendance list of the talks featured at least 1,770 people connected to fossil fuel interests.",
      "Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub, suggested that there should be a \u201cfirewall\u201d between fossil fuel lobbyists, U.N. climate bodies and negotiators from countries. \u201cWe know over 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists are here at COP29. That is not acceptable,\u201d she said.",
      "Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who on Friday presented new data on carbon pollution sites, said \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree.\"",
      "For his part, COP29 negotiator Rafiyev defended the process.",
      "\u201cThe process has already delivered, the COP process so far by reducing projected warming, delivering finance to those in need,\" Rafiev said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than any alternative.\u201d",
      "One key benefit of the U.N. climate talks process is it's the only place where vulnerable small island nations have an equal seat at the table, United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. But the process has its limits because \u201cthe rules of the game are set by member states,\u201d she said.",
      "At a press conference, Alliance of Small Islands States Chair Cedric Schuster said the negotiating bloc felt the need to remind everyone else why the talks matter.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to defend the Paris agreement,\u201d Schuster said, referring to the climate deal in 2015 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that countries are forgetting that protecting the world\u2019s most vulnerable is at the core of this framework.\u201d",
      "Also at the talks Friday, new data from an organization co-founded by Gore that combines observations and artificial intelligence found that cities in Asia and the United States emit the most heat-trapping gas, with Shanghai the most polluting.",
      "Using observations and artificial intelligence, Climate Trace quantifies heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas.",
      "Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth.",
      "Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra potent methane rising 0.2%. The figures are higher than other datasets \u201cbecause we have such comprehensive coverage and we have observed more emissions in more sectors than are typically available,\u201d said Gavin McCormick, Climate Trace's co-founder.",
      "Shanghai's 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases led all cities and exceeded those from the nations of Colombia or Norway. Tokyo's 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City's 160 million metric tons and Houston's 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions. Seoul, South Korea, ranks fifth among cities at 142 million metric tons.",
      "\u201cOne of the sites in the Permian Basin in Texas is by far the No. 1 worst polluting site in the entire world,\u201d Gore said. \u201cAnd maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by that, but I think of how dirty some of these sites are in Russia and China and so forth. But Permian Basin is putting them all in the shade.\u201d",
      "China, India, Iran, Indonesia and Russia had the biggest increases in emissions from 2022 to 2023, while Venezuela, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States had the biggest decreases in pollution.",
      "The dataset \u2014 maintained by scientists and analysts from various groups \u2014 also looked at traditional pollutants such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and other chemicals associated with dirty air. Burning fossil fuels releases both types of pollution, Gore said.",
      "This \u201crepresents the single biggest health threat facing humanity,\u201d Gore said.",

    "story": [
      "There\u2019s one exercise group that says you really can keep up with outdoor workouts through the winter",
      "The sun had yet to come up in Edmonton, Alberta, and it was more than 20 degrees below zero. Tanis Smith layered up anyway, ready to run up and down hundreds of stairs among the trees in the Saskatchewan River Valley.",
      "When she arrived at 6 a.m., 10 other people joined her. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time they risked freezing their toes off to get in a workout before the rest of the world wakes up.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re pretty much just putting everything you own on,\u201d said Smith, an accountant. \u201cIf you look at the pictures, you don\u2019t know who you are unless you remember what you were wearing.\u201d",
      "Since that winter of 2013, Smith has rarely missed a workout with the group, called November Project, a network of free outdoor group exercise classes that started in Boston. No matter the month or weather, participants roll out of bed before dawn at least once a week and shield their faces from the blistering cold.",
      "One part intense training and one part abject silliness, the project is a model for how to stay motivated to exercise outside throughout the winter.",
      "It started when a pair of friends challenged each other to exercise every morning for the month of November. By the end of the month, they were recruiting others.",
      "\u201cA party is better when there\u2019s more people around,\u201d said Bojan Mandaric, who created the project with Brogan Graham in 2011. \u201cWe would talk to anybody who would listen.\u201d",
      "Soon, their meetings were attracting a few dozen people, who then brought the idea to other cities when they moved. Now there are 52 chapters in eight countries, including 44 in the United States and Canada.",
      "Workouts, which attract all ages and fitness levels, begin with a \u201cbounce,\u201d a hopping, call-and-response chant to loosen people up physically and mentally. How the classes continue varies on the location and day of the week, but most include running and body weight exercises like squats or burpees.",
      "To promote the idea that exercise can be fun, they also might weave in activities that would be at home during childhood recess in the schoolyard.",
      "In Edmonton, they\u2019ve played an intense version of duck duck goose, gone sledding in winter and done Slip \u2019n\u2019 Slide in summer. One workout in Boston involved a kind of Easter egg hunt, where you search for plastic eggs at a sprint. Crack them open to find commands that could be, walk like a gorilla, do a cartwheel, or grab grass and dump it on Mandaric\u2019s head.",
      "The point is to lower inhibitions, which helps people make connections, said Jason Shaw, co-leader of the Indianapolis chapter.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s cool at November Project,\u201d he said. \u201cAt different gyms, especially, you always have the people who just are so cool, or think they\u2019re so cool. We try to nip that in the bud.\u201d",
      "Shaw said chapters mark different milestones, much like Scout merit badges, by spray painting a tag on your shirt for, say, showing up on your first single-digit day.",
      "But they don\u2019t spray when it\u2019s too cold. The paint freezes.",
      "If you don\u2019t have a chapter nearby, many cities offer some kind of running or outdoor exercise group, though many are not free. Otherwise, November Project organizers offered a few suggestions on how to stay motived to keep working through the colder months.",
      "Accountability is a core tenet of the project. Members make a verbal promise to show up, and there is almost a sense of letting down your teammates if you don\u2019t, said Mandaric, who moved to Boston from Serbia to row crew for Northeastern University.",
      "There\u2019s no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing, Shaw said. At a minimum, buy a moisture-wicking base layer that will help keep you warm and dry. Avoid cotton, which keeps sweat in contact with your body and will make you colder. And add a top jacket with wind-breaking fabric.",
      "Commit to exercising on the same days and times for a month. Creating a predictable routine will help you get into a groove that is easier to maintain, Mandaric said.",
      "One of the things Smith appreciates most about the project is its social aspect. She called it \u201ca chosen family\u201d that was formed partly because they were having fun while exercising.",
      "\u201cFitness doesn\u2019t have to be this hard-nosed, drill-sergeant type thing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have fun and get fit.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot going on that\u2019s positive here, but on the big picture of actually getting stuff done to reduce emissions ... to me it feels broken,\u201d Hare said.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris.

      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",

      "A U.S. military watchdog says Navy officials lacked sufficient understanding of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a drinking water well at Pearl Harbor where spilled jet fuel poisoned more than 6,000 people",
      "HONOLULU -- Navy officials \u201clacked sufficient understanding\u201d of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a drinking water well at Pearl Harbor where spilled jet fuel poisoned more than 6,000 people in 2021, a U.S. military watchdog said Thursday.",
      "That lack of awareness came even though officials had engineering drawings and environmental studies that described the risks, the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s inspector general said.",
      "The finding was among a long list of Navy failures identified by the inspector general in two reports that follow a yearslong investigation into the fuel leak at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. Investigators said it was imperative for the Navy to address its management of fuel and water systems at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and recommended that the military assess leak detection systems at other Navy fuel facilities.",
      "\"The DoD must take this action, and others, to ensure that tragedies like the one in November of 2021 are not allowed to repeat,\u201d Inspector General Robert P. Storch said in a statement.",
      "The military built the Red Hill fuel tanks into the side of a mountain in the early 1940s to protect them from aerial attack. There were 20 tanks in all, each about the height of a 25-story building with the capacity to hold 12.5 million gallons (47.3 million liters.) The site was in the hills above Pearl Harbor and on top of an aquifer equipped with wells that provided drinking water to the Navy and to Honolulu's municipal water system.",
      "Fuel leaks at Red Hill had occurred before, including in 2014, prompting the Sierra Club of Hawaii and the Honolulu Board of Water Supply to ask the military to move the tanks to a place where they wouldn't threaten Oahu's water. But the Navy refused, saying the island's water was safe.",
      "The 2021 spill gushed from a ruptured pipe in May of that year. Most of it flowed into a fire suppression drain system, where it sat unnoticed for six months until a cart rammed a sagging line holding the liquid. Crews believed they mopped up most of this fuel but they failed to get about 5,000 gallons (19,000 liters.) Around Thanksgiving, the fuel flowed into a drain and drinking water well that supplied water to 90,000 people at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.",
      "The inspector general's report noted 4,000 families had to move out of their homes for months because they couldn't drink or bathe in their water. The military spent more than $220 million housing residents in hotels and responding to the spill. Congress appropriated $2.1 billion more, some of which is helping the Navy close the Red Hill facility in compliance with an order from Hawaii regulators.",
      "Among the inspector general's other findings:",
      "1. The Navy never told the state Department of Health, which regulates underground fuel tanks, about the missing fuel after the May 2021 spill. 2. The Navy missed four separate opportunities in November 2021 to activate emergency response plans to respond to the water contamination. That includes on Nov. 20, when fuel was released from the drainage pipe, and on Nov. 28, when residents called base authorities to report chemical and fuel smells emanating from their water. 3. The Navy issued news releases on Nov. 21 and 22 saying \u201cthe drinking water was safe\u201d but did so without conducting any laboratory analysis to confirm that was the case.4. The Navy didn't assume contamination from the spill had spread throughout Pearl Harbor's drinking water system, as required by the water system emergency response plan. The report said some residents may have continued to cook and shower with their tap water as a result.",

That includes on Nov. 20, when fuel was released from the drainage pipe, and on Nov. 28, when residents called base authorities to report chemical and fuel smells emanating from their water.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F",
      "NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday he will nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, putting a man whose views public health officials have decried as dangerous in charge of a massive agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research, Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "\u201cFor too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,\u201d Trump said Thursday in a post on his Truth Social site announcing the appointment. Kennedy, he said, would \u201cend the Chronic Disease epidemic\" and \u201cMake America Great and Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "Trump said Kennedy would target drugs, food additives and chemicals.",
      "As one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world, Kennedy's nomination immediately alarmed some public health officials.",
      "Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go backwards and see children or adults suffer or lose their lives to remind us that vaccines work, and so I am concerned.\u201d",
      "Trump also announced Thursday that he has chosen Doug Collins, a former congressman from Georgia, to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins is a chaplain in the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command. The Republican served in Congress from 2013 to 2021, and he helped defend Trump during his first impeachment process.",
      "Later Thursday, Trump said he was nominating North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to lead the Department of the Interior. After ending his own presidential campaign in December 2023, Burgum endorsed Trump and became an outspoken supporter, appearing on TV news shows and at rallies and other events. He was on Trump's short list of potential running mates.",
      "Kennedy hails from one of the nation\u2019s most storied political families and is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination last year. He then ran as an independent but abandoned his bid this summer after striking a deal to endorse Trump in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role during a second Trump administration.",
      "He and the president-elect have since become good friends. The two campaigned together extensively during the race\u2019s final stretch, and Trump made clear he intended to give Kennedy a major public health role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to let him go wild on health,\u201d Trump said at a rally last month.",
      "During the campaign, Kennedy told NewsNation that Trump had asked him to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies including the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Kennedy has pushed against processed foods and the use of herbicides like Roundup weed killer. He has long criticized the large commercial farms and animal feeding operations that dominate the industry.",
      "But he is perhaps best known for his criticism of childhood vaccines.",
      "Again and again, Kennedy has made his opposition to vaccines clear. In July, he said in a podcast interview that \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and told FOX News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism.",
      "In a 2021 podcast he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d CDC guidelines that advise when kids should receive routine vaccinations.",
      "\u201cI see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, \u2018Better not get them vaccinated,\u2019\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Repeated scientific studies in the U.S. and abroad have found no link between vaccines and autism. Vaccines have been proven safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades. The World Health Organization credits childhood vaccines with preventing as many as 5 million deaths a year.",
      "Trump during his first term launched Operation Warp Speed, an effort to speed the production and distribution of a vaccine to combat COVID-19. The resulting vaccines were widely credited, including by Trump himself, with saving lives.",
      "Kennedy has also worked to shore up support among young mothers in particular, on a message of ridding the U.S. of unhealthy ingredients in foods, promising to model regulations after those imposed in Europe. His claims that the U.S. obesity epidemic, as well as a rise in chronic diseases like diabetes, are the result of processed and unhealthy foods has resonated on social media among fitness gurus and mom influencers alike.",
      "It remains unclear how that will square with Trump\u2019s history of deregulation of big industries, including food. Trump has pushed for fewer inspections of the meat industry, for example.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s stance on vaccines raises question about his ability to get confirmed, even in a GOP-controlled Senate. He also has said he would make a controversial recommendation to remove fluoride from drinking water, although fluoride levels are mandated by state and local governments. The addition of the mineral has been cited as leading to improved dental health and is considered safe at low levels.",
      "Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune would not comment on Trump's pick of Kennedy or any other potential nominee. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any judgments about any of these folks at this point,\u201d he said.",
      "But Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, R-MO, praised the HHS pick, posting on X: \u201cBad day for Big Pharma! @RobertKennedyJr.\"",
      "Several Democrats quickly condemned the selection.",
      "Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the No. 3 Democrat, said that Kennedy\u2019s confirmation would be \u201cnothing short of a disaster for the health of millions of families.\u201d",
      "But not every Democrat recoiled from the news. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he was \u201cexcited\u201d for Kennedy to lead HHS. Polis said he wants to see Kennedy take on \u201cbig pharma\u201d and hopes he will \u201clean into personal choice\u201d on vaccines.",
      "That idea is concerning to former New York Public Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan, who said that if people opt against vaccines, deadly viruses could run wild. He points to an uptick in measles outbreaks \u2014 16 have occurred so far this year compared to four last year. \u201cThat\u2019s going to continue if we have someone at the top of our health system that is saying, \u2018I\u2019m not so sure about the science here,\u2019\u201d Vasan said.",
      "FDA could have one of the biggest shakeups, with Kennedy's promises of more regulations \u2014 action that would buck the moves that previous Republican administrations have made. He has promised a crackdown on food dyes and preservatives. And with pharmaceutical companies, he's suggested that drugmakers be barred from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar enterprise that accounts for most of the industry\u2019s marketing dollars. He also proposed eliminating fees that drugmakers pay the FDA to review their products.",
      "He wants to weaken FDA regulations around a host of unsubstantiated therapies, including psychedelics and stem cells as well as discredited COVID-era drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.",
      "Kennedy also will focus on ending the \u201crevolving door\u201d of employees who have previously worked for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his former campaign communications manager, Del Bigtree, told the AP last month.",
      "This past weekend, Kennedy said he wanted to fire 600 employees at NIH, which oversees vaccine research and replace them with 600 new people. In separate comments, he has said that in his first week he would order a pause in drug development and infectious disease research, shifting the focus to chronic diseases.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",
      "Trump also announced Thursday that he will nominate Jay Clayton, who served as chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during his first term, to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.",

      "The 71-year-old retiree starts each morning this way with a walking club.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m obsessed,\u201d she said. Not only does it ease her joint pain, \u201cit just gives me energy \u2026 And then it calms me, too.\u201d",
      "Medical experts agree that walking is an easy way to improve physical and mental health, bolster fitness and prevent disease. While it\u2019s not the only sort of exercise people should do, it\u2019s a great first step toward a healthy life.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need equipment and you don\u2019t need a gym membership,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Eby, a sports medicine physician with Mass General Brigham. \u201cAnd the benefits are so vast.\u201d",
      "Walking can help meet the U.S. surgeon general\u2019s recommendation that adults get at least 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity physical activity every week. This helps lower the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, dementia, depression and many types of cancer.",
      "Walking also improves blood sugar levels, is good for bone health and can help you lose weight and sleep better, added Julie Schmied, a nurse practitioner with Norton Healthcare, which runs the free Get Healthy Walking Club.",
      "Another advantage? It\u2019s a low-impact exercise that puts less pressure on joints as it strengthens your heart and lungs.",
      "James Blankenship, 68, said joining the walking club at the Louisville Zoo last year helped him bounce back after a heart attack and triple bypass in 2022.",
      "\u201cMy cardiologist says I\u2019m doing great,\u201d he said.",
      "For all its benefits, however, walking \u201cis not enough for overall health and well-being\u201d because it doesn\u2019t provide resistance training that builds muscle strength and endurance, said Anita Gust, who teaches exercise science at the University of Minnesota Crookston.",

      "Setting a time goal can also be useful. Shmied suggests breaking the recommended 150 minutes per week into 30 minutes a day, or 10 minutes three times a day, for five days. During inclement weather, people can walk in malls or on treadmills.",
      "As they become seasoned walkers, they can speed up the pace or challenge themselves with hills while still keeping the activity level moderate.",

      "NEW YORK -- A simple, uncommon ritual starts each staff meeting at Myosin Marketing. When everyone is gathered on Zoom, and before they get to the meat of the agenda, CEO Sean Clayton leads his team through a deep-breathing exercise.",
      "The practice sets the tone for the meeting, and helps his employees, most of whom work remotely, to feel safe, grounded and willing to take creative risks, he said.",
      "\u201cAt first they thought it was really weird, like, \u2018What are we doing?\u2019\u201d Clayton said. \u201cThere were a lot of cameras off and I\u2019m sure a lot of people were like, \u2018This is awkward.\u2019\" But after a couple of weeks, there was a shift. Employees of the Austin, Texas company were saying, 'This feels good,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Deep breathing can be an effective way to reduce stress at work, studies show. But on the job, many people don\u2019t think about how they\u2019re inhaling and exhaling.",
      "Desk workers sitting a computer tend to take shallow breaths as their shoulders creep up. Workers who spend the day on their feet in retail or health care may be too busy to focus on breathing.",
      "But there's good reason to remember to pause to take deep breaths. Chronic, unmanaged stress, which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, can be as harmful to our health as secondhand smoke, according to the American Heart Association. Research suggests deep-breathing exercises can lower a person's blood pressure and reduce anxiety.",
      "Other benefits: deep breathing is free, can be done anywhere and doesn't require taking a half-hour to meditate. Spending just a minute or two breathing deeply can help calm racing thoughts, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt relaxes my mind. It makes my mind so full of ease,\u201d Lisa Marie Deleveaux, a marketing professional and mother of five, said. \u201cIt brings you back to the present moment.\u201d",
      "Deleveaux was laid off several months ago and has struggled to find a new job. She wakes most mornings at 4 or 5 a.m., before the children, to do breathing exercises. One is a technique known as alternate nostril breathing, a yoga exercise that involves inhaling through one nostril and out through another, using a thumb or forefinger to hold one nostril closed at a time.",
      "\u201cIf you set a priority for yourself ... you can make the time,\u201d Deleveaux said.",
      "Focusing on breathing for one to five minutes \"can help you clear the slate and wipe all these things out of your mind...and allow you to get back to focusing on the one thing you want to accomplish,\u201d said cardiologist Glenn Levine, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \u201cThe best analogy is turning your computer off when you have 37 programs (open) and it freezes.\u201d",
      "A good way to do deep breathing exercises is while sitting on a bench outside, Levine said. If that\u2019s not an option, doing it at a desk works.",
      "\u201cEither turn off your screen or just put something blank on the screen so people think you\u2019re still working,\" Levine said. \u201cInstead of focusing on the screen or work, just focus on your breathing. If possible, close your eyes.\u201d",
      "There are other ways to fit in breathing exercises. To get ahead of anxiety before starting a day of cold calls, sales development representative Lindsay Carlisle does breathing exercises with her 7-year-old daughter during the drive to school. They breathe in for seven counts, hold their breath for five, breathe out for seven counts, and then repeat the cycle several times.",
      "\u201cThroughout that process, my shoulders start to drop on their own, and it really is calming,\u201d Carlisle, who lives in Flint, Michigan, said. \u201cI\u2019m not a yoga instructor. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, but it works.\u201d",
      "Suze Yalof Schwartz was an overworked fashion editor when her mother-in-law taught her a three-minute meditation technique that she says changed her life. She gave up her fashion career and founded Unplug Meditation, a Santa Monica, California, company with a meditation studio, an app and programs for corporate clients.",
      "\u201cWhen we slow down our breath, we send a signal to our brain that everything\u2019s OK, even when it\u2019s not,\" she said.",
      "A 16-second breathing technique she's taught to firefighters, police officers, doctors and others is called the box breathing technique. You breathe in for four counts, hold for four, breathe out for four counts and hold for four.",
      "\u201cIt is the best thing that you can do at work before you have a meeting, before you send out an email that you wish you didn\u2019t send, before you have a difficult conversation, because it just calms you down, gets rid of your negative energy,\" Yalof Schwartz said.",
      "Employers such as Coca-Cola, Mattel and Netflix have hired Unplug Meditation to teach breathing or meditation.",
      "It's not always easy for workers to find space for deep breathing exercises. For example, in retail jobs, workers often mix with customers. Yalof Schwartz recommends doing breathing exercises when ringing up a sale or folding clothes. You can also take a deep breath right before walking through a door.",
      "Office workers can set a timer on their phones to remind themselves to breathe deeply. That's what Carlisle, the sales representative, does. She also keeps a Post-it note on her monitor that says \u201cBreathe.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe anxiety is always going to be there,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cBut at least I know I have one small tool. ... It sounds so simple and silly, but it works.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Health officials said Saturday they have confirmed the first U.S. case of a new form of mpox that was first seen in eastern Congo.",
      "The person had traveled to eastern Africa and was treated in Northern California upon return, according to the California Department of Public Health. Symptoms are improving and the risk to the public is low.",
      "The individual was isolating at home and health workers are reaching out to close contacts as a precaution, the state health department said.",
      "Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with a virus that\u2019s in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa, where people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals. Milder symptoms can include fever, chills and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals.",
      "Earlier this year, scientists reported the emergence of a new form of mpox in Africa that was spread through close contact including through sex. It was widely transmitted in eastern and central Africa. But in cases that were identified in travelers outside of the continent, spread has been very limited, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "More than 3,100 confirmed cases have been reported just since late September, according to the World Health Organization. The vast majority of them have been in three African countries \u2014 Burundi, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "Since then, cases of travelers with the new mpox form have been reported in Germany, India, Kenya, Sweden, Thailand, Zimbabwe, and the United Kingdom.",
      "Health officials earlier this month said the situation in Congo appears to be stabilizing. The Africa CDC has estimated Congo needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the spread, and another 7 million vaccines for the rest of Africa. The spread is mostly through sexual transmission as well as through close contact among children, pregnant women and other vulnerable groups.",
      "The current outbreak is different from the 2022 global outbreak of mpox where gay and bisexual men made up the vast majority of cases.",

Authorities in Norway have insisted Breivik has the same rights as any other prisoner, arguing that treating him differently would undermine the principles that underpin Norwegian society, including the rule of law and freedom of speech.",
      "Two years ago, Breivik was transferred to Ringerike prison, where he is held in a two-story complex with a kitchen, dining room and TV room with an Xbox, several armchairs and black and white pictures of the Eiffel Tower on the wall. He also has a fitness room with weights, a treadmill and a rowing machine, while three parakeets fly around the complex.",
      "The parole application is being heard in a makeshift courtroom in the Ringerike prison gymnasium where a similar hearing was held in January 2022. It was not known when a ruling will be made.",
      "Breivik was convicted in 2012 of mass murder and terrorism for a bombing that killed eight people in a government building in Oslo, and a shooting massacre on Ut\u00f8ya island where he gunned down 69 people at a holiday camp for youth activists from the center-left Labor Party."

      "U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein held what he called \u201cvery constructive talks\u201d with Lebanese officials in Beirut on Tuesday about a possible cease-fire in the Israel-Hezbollah war.",
      "\"Today, we have continued to significantly narrow the gaps,\u201d Hochstein said, a day after Hezbollah reportedly gave a positive response to a U.S. draft proposal to end the 13-month war, which the Lebanese group launched to support Hamas in Gaza.",
      "The U.S. proposal could see Israeli ground forces leave Lebanon and Hezbollah militants withdraw away from the Israeli border. More Lebanese army troops and U.N. peacekeepers would be sent to a buffer zone in southern Lebanon as part of the deal.",
      "An Israeli airstrike on Tuesday hit a Lebanese army base in the southern town of Sarafand, killing three soldiers, the army said \u2013 the second deadly strike on Lebanese soldiers in as many days. There was no immediate comment by the Israeli military.",
      "Israeli strikes and combat in Lebanon have killed more than 3,500 people and wounded 15,000, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. The war has displaced nearly 1.2 million people, or a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population.",
      "On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians, including some foreign farmworkers, have been killed by attacks involving rockets, drones and missiles.",
      "In Gaza, health authorities say Israel's war against Hamas has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children.",

      "Here's the Latest:",
      "UNITED NATIONS \u2013 The U.N. humanitarian office says thousands of Palestinians in areas of northern Gaza under siege by Israeli forces are struggling to stay alive because there have been virtually no food or humanitarian aid deliveries for more than 40 days.",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric delivered the grim report from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian affairs known as OCHA on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cOCHA reports that all attempts by the U.N. to support people in Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahiya and parts of Jabaliya \u2013 all of which remain under siege \u2013 have been either denied or impeded,\u201d he said.",
      "So far in November, Dujarric said OCHA reports that 27 out of 31 planned humanitarian missions were rejected by Israel and the other four were severely impeded. That means they were prevented from accomplishing all the critical work they set out to do, he said.",
      "\u201cThe result is that bakeries and kitchens in North Gaza governorate have shut down, nutrition support has been suspended, and the refueling of water and sanitation facilities has been completely blocked,\u201d Dujarric said.",
      "An Israeli ground and air offensive in the north has severely restricting access to its three hospitals which are desperately short of medical supplies, blood and fuel, he said.",
      "Israel blocked attempts by U.N. partners to send in an international emergency medical team to help, he said.",
      "On Sunday, Dujarric said, OCHA supported a mission led by the U.N. World Health Organization that was able to deliver 10,000 liters of fuel to Kamal Adwan Hospital and transfer some 17 patients, three unaccompanied children and nearly two dozen caregivers to Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.",
      "Food and medical supplies were also supposed to be delivered to Kamal Adwan but Dujarric said, \u201cour partners say the team was forced to offload the food at an Israeli military checkpoint before reaching the hospital, and only some of the medical supplies could be delivered to the facility.\u201d",
      "Asked whether the U.N. believes Israel is trying to force the estimated 75,000 Palestinians in northern Gaza to move south by denying the aid deliveries, Dujarric replied: \u201cI can\u2019t speak to the intentions of the Israeli government and the Israeli policy. We\u2019re just seeing the result of it and trying to deal with it.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration says the first meeting of a U.S.-Israel panel to look into reports of civilian harm and damage from the war in Gaza will meet in early December, missing by more than a month a U.S. call for the channel to be set up by the end of October.",
      "State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday that the upcoming meeting had been agreed to after much discussion between U.S. and Israeli officials on specific incidents and reports of civilian casualties involving American-made or -supplied weapons.",
      "Miller told reporters that \u201cthe purpose of this channel is to inform the ongoing work that the State Department has to make assessments about the use of U.S.-provided weapons.\u201d",
      "He said the information gathered through that channel will inform U.S. policy decisions about any response to potential violations of international humanitarian law in the conflict.",
      "In October, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sent a letter to top Israeli officials warning them that the Biden administration might limit the provision of some U.S. weapons systems to Israel, a close ally, if action to improve humanitarian conditions was not taken within 30 days.",
      "That deadline expired last week with no decisions being made on military aid and officials saying that Israel had taken some positive steps but was still not meeting the criteria for improvements laid out in the letter.",
      "UNITED NATIONS \u2013 The U.N. peacekeeping chief says diplomatic efforts toward a cease-fire in Lebanon are \u201cencouraging,\u201d and that the United Nations is working on the role its peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon could play after the Israel-Hezbollah war ends.",
      "Jean-Pierre Lacroix, who just returned from Lebanon and Israel, told reporters Tuesday that the U.N. is proceeding on the basis that Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, will remain the framework for a settlement .",
      "Key will be the resolution\u2019s demand for Lebanon\u2019s armed forces to deploy throughout the south, which Hezbollah largely controls, to assert the country\u2019s sovereignty, Lacroix said.",
      "The resolution calls for UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, to support the implementation of the resolution\u2019s provisions, and Lacroix says he stressed the importance of \u201cgenuine political will\u201d to achieve that.",
      "The undersecretary-general for peace operations said he also stressed the importance of UNIFIL\u2019s freedom of movement, which is sometimes limited, and the need to clarify restrictions on peacekeepers entering private property.",
      "Lacroix said the U.N. is also looking at using technology to monitor compliance, and UNIFIL\u2019s potential role in rebuilding and supporting the return of Lebanese people to devastated villages in the south.",
      "There will also be a need for mine-clearing experts in the south and for engineers because many roads have been damaged and destroyed, he said.",
      "BEIRUT \u2014 The Lebanese army said an Israeli airstrike targeted one of its military bases late Tuesday in the southern town of Sarafand, killing three Lebanese soldiers. The Health Ministry said at least 17 people were also wounded, including civilians who lived near the facility.",
      "In total, 41 Lebanese soldiers have been killed amid the war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.",
      "Lebanon's army has largely stood on the sidelines during the 13-month conflict, and if a cease-fire is reached, the army could play a key role in securing a U.N. buffer zone in southern Lebanon.",
      "The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the attack \u2014 the latest in a series of Israeli strikes targeting the Lebanese military. On Sunday, Israel bombed a Lebanese army post in Mari, in Hasbaya province, killing two soldiers and critically injured three others.",
      "In response, the Lebanese government announced on Monday plans to file a formal complaint with the U.N. Security Council on the \u201crepeated attacks\u201d on the Lebanese army, citing repeated violations of international law.",

      "Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry also said that 28 people were killed Monday, raising the nationwide toll over to at least 3,544 killed and 15,036 wounded.",
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has offered a $5 million reward and one-way ticket out of Gaza to Palestinians who free Israeli hostages held in the territory.",
      "Netanyahu made the offer during a tour of central Gaza on Tuesday.",
      "Israel says Hamas continues to hold 101 hostages, roughly one-third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel has vowed to press ahead with its war, which has devastated Gaza, until all hostages are free.",

      "Families of the hostages have accused Netanyahu of not doing enough to bring their loved-ones home, and tens of thousands of Israelis regularly take to the streets calling on him to reach a deal.",
      "A former aide to Netanyahu has been arrested on suspicion of leaking classified materials to foreign media over the summer in an apparent effort to scuttle a deal.",
      "Critics accuse Netanyahu of dragging his feet because a deal would likely lead to the collapse of his hardline government and the launch of an official investigation into the government\u2019s failures ahead of Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack.",
      "Netanyahu rejects the criticism and says he is doing his utmost to free them.",

      "According to the Italian defense ministry, the eight 107-millimenter rockets hit outdoor areas and a warehouse at the base in Shama, where no soldiers were present. Five soldiers were being kept under observation, the statement said.",
      "Italy said it was investigating from where the rockets originated, and who was responsible.",
      "It was the second time in a week that Italy has complained about rockets or shells hitting its peacekeepers' base.",

      "Police first were deployed at the protest camp on Monday to temporarily evacuate parts of the camp with tree houses due to a planned search for explosive ordnance from World War II. However, the activists refused to leave and instead climbed high up some of the trees, German news agency dpa reported. Police eventually pulled six people out of tree houses who did not want to leave voluntarily.",
      "Tuesday's complete breakup of the camp came because the activists repeatedly violated regulations and committed criminal offenses, local police spokesperson Daniel Keip told dpa. He said it was also not possible to establish contact with the leaders of the protests and it could no longer be assumed that the protest would remain peaceful.",
      "The site near the factory has been under investigation for suspected ordnance left from World War II for some time. Unexploded bombs are still found frequently in Germany almost 80 years after the end of the war, and often during work on construction sites. They are usually defused or disposed of in controlled explosions, a process that sometimes entails large-scale evacuations as a precaution."

Ukraine's military claimed the strike hit a Russian ammunition depot.",
      "While the doctrine envisions a possible nuclear response by Russia to such a conventional strike, it is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons and keep Putin's options open.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov emphasized that the Ukrainian strike in Bryansk marked an escalation and urged the U.S. and other Western allies to study the modernized nuclear doctrine.",
      "\u201cIf the long-range missiles are used from the territory of Ukraine against the Russian territory, it will mean that they are controlled by American military experts and we will view that as a qualitatively new phase of the Western war against Russia and respond accordingly,\u201d Lavrov said on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Brazil without elaborating.",
      "The approval of the document demonstrates Putin\u2019s readiness to tap his nuclear arsenal to force the West to back down as Moscow presses a slow-moving offensive in Ukraine as the war reached its 1,000th day.",
      "Asked Tuesday if a Ukrainian attack with longer-range U.S. missiles could potentially trigger a nuclear response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov answered affirmatively, pointing to the doctrine\u2019s provision that holds the door open for it after a conventional strike that raises critical threats for the \"sovereignty and territorial integrity: of Russia and its ally, Belarus.",
      "Commenting on whether the updated doctrine was deliberately issued to follow Biden\u2019s decision, Peskov said the document was published \u201cin a timely manner\u201d and that Putin instructed the government to update it earlier this year so that it is \u201cin line with the current situation.\u201d",
      "Putin first announced changes in the nuclear doctrine in September, when he chaired a meeting discussing the proposed revisions. He has previously warned the U.S. and other NATO allies that allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied longer-range weapons to hit Russian territory would mean that Russia and NATO are at war.",
      "Washington has permitted Ukraine to use the longer-range weapons on targets inside Russia after declaring that thousands of North Korean troops were deployed in the Russian region of Kursk to fight an incursion by Kyiv's forces.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m unfortunately not surprised by the comments the Kremlin has made around the publication of this new, revised document,\" said U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller, adding that since the war began, Russia has sought to \"coerce and intimidate both Ukraine and other countries around the world through irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behavior.\"",
      "He added that Washington has not seen any reason \"to adjust our own nuclear posture, but we will continue to call on Russia to stop bellicose and irresponsible rhetoric.\u201d",
      "A U.S. National Security Council official who was not authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity underscored that the arrival of thousands of North Korea soldiers to take part in combat operations against Ukraine was a major escalation by Moscow that demanded a response.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer denounced the \"irresponsible rhetoric coming from Russia, and that is not going to deter our support for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re now on Day 1,000 of a conflict. That\u2019s 1000 days of Russian aggression, 1,000 days of sacrifices in Ukraine,\" he said at the G-20 summit in Brazil. \"We have stood with Ukraine from the start. I\u2019ve been doubling down in my clear message that we need to ensure Ukraine has what is needed for as long as needed to win this war against Putin.\u201d",
      "German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in Warsaw that her country would not be intimidated by Russia\u2019s new policy, saying her country made the mistake of cowering in the face of Moscow's aggression in the past but would not do so again.",
      "In Warsaw, Poland's Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski described the revised Russian nuclear doctrine as a tacit acknowledgement that Moscow\u2019s conventional forces are weaker than NATO.",
      "The updated doctrine says an attack against Russia by a nonnuclear power with the \u201cparticipation or support of a nuclear power\u201d will be seen as their \u201cjoint attack on the Russian Federation.\u201d",
      "It says any massive aerial attack on Russia could trigger a nuclear response but avoids any firm commitment and mentions the \u201cuncertainty of scale, time and place of possible use of nuclear deterrent\u201d among the key principles of the nuclear deterrence.",
      "The document also notes that aggression against Russia by a member of a military bloc or coalition is viewed as \"an aggression by the entire bloc,\" a clear reference to NATO.",
      "At the same time, it spells out conditions for using nuclear weapons in greater detail compared with previous versions of the doctrine, noting they could be used in case of a massive air attack involving ballistic and cruise missiles, aircraft, drones and other flying vehicles.",
      "The formulation appears to significantly broaden the triggers for possible nuclear weapons use compared with the document's previous version, which stated Russia could tap its atomic arsenal if case of an attack with ballistic missiles.",
      "President Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for more than 30 years and has relied on Russian subsidies and support, has allowed Russia to use his country\u2019s territory to send troops into Ukraine and to deploy some of its tactical nuclear weapons.",
      "Since Putin sent troops into Ukraine, he and other Russian voices have frequently threatened the West with Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal to discourage it from ramping up support for Kyiv.",
      "Russian hawks called for toughening the doctrine for months, arguing the previous version failed to deter the West from increasing its aid to Ukraine and created the impression that Moscow would not resort to nuclear weapons.",

      "HONG KONG -- Forty-five prominent activists in Hong Kong were sentenced to jail for up to 10 years on Tuesday, sparking criticism from foreign governments and rights groups. Beijing defended the decisions.",
      "The democracy advocates were among 47 people charged under a Beijing-imposed national security law in 2021 for their involvement in an unofficial primary election to pick opposition candidates. In the city's biggest national security case to date, they were accused of agreeing to veto government-proposed budgets after potentially securing a legislative majority to force a dissolution of the legislature and the ouster of the city\u2019s leader.",
      "The case involved pro-democracy figures. Thirty-one of them pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion. Fourteen others were convicted following a long trial. Two were acquitted.",
      "Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said her government is \u201cgravely concerned\u201d by the sentences for Australian citizen Gordon Ng and the other activists. Wong said Australia has expressed strong objections to authorities in China and Hong Kong over the continuing broad application of national security legislation.",
      "Catherine West, minister for the Indo-Pacific in Britain\u2019s Foreign Office, said the sentencing demonstrates how Hong Kong authorities use the security law to criminalize political dissent.",
      "\u201cThose sentenced today were exercising their right to freedom of speech, of assembly and of political participation,\u201d she said.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said no one should be allowed to use democracy as a pretext to engage in unlawful activities and escape justice. Lin said certain Western countries ignored that they maintain their own national security through judicial procedures while unreasonably criticizing Hong Kong courts for \"fairly implementing\" the security law.",
      "\u201cThis severely violates and tramples on the spirit of the rule of law,\u201d he said at a news briefing.",
      "He said Beijing firmly opposes what he described as certain Western countries' interference in China's internal affairs and their attempts to smear Hong Kong's rule of law.",
      "The European Union called the sentencing \u201canother unprecedented blow\u201d against the city's fundamental freedoms, democratic participation and pluralism.",
      "The bloc said in a statement that its members are deeply concerned about the politically motivated prosecution of people engaging in peaceful political activity. It said such activities should be legitimate in any political system that respects basic democratic principles.",

      "The government said the case was handled strictly in accordance with the law.",

      "\u201cDifferent people may have different judgments about whether the sentencing is appropriate. But I think the important point is the rule of law,\" he said in a news briefing.",
      "Taiwan presidential office spokesperson Karen Kuo said democracy is not a crime and condemned the Chinese government for using what she called unjust procedures to suppress the political participation and freedom of speech of Hong Kong pro-democracy figures.",
      "The sentencing \"not only breaks the promises of \u201850 years unchanged\u2019 and \u2018high degree of autonomy,\u2019 but further proves that \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 is unfeasible,\" she said in a statement.",
      "When Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997, Beijing promised to retain its Western-style civil liberties for 50 years under the governing principle of \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe will continue to engage with the Chinese authorities as we have done in the past,\" he said.",
      "The State Department said it \u201cstrongly\u201d condemned the sentences and called on Hong Kong authorities to \u201cimmediately and unconditionally release the 45 individuals and similarly detained political prisoners.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong said the defendants were aggressively prosecuted and jailed for participating in normal political activity protected under the city's mini-constitution, and called for their immediate release.",
      "In Washington, D.C., the chairs of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission said the sentences violate international law and called for wide condemnation. Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican, and Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, asked the Biden administration to sanction judges and prosecutors responsible for \u201cundermining democracy and human rights in Hong Kong.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese politically motivated prosecutions are occurring at the same time that dozens of U.S. CEOs are being wined and dined by Hong Kong officials and urged to invest in Hong Kong,\" the lawmakers said. \u201cEach of these U.S. financial titans should be asked whether the Hong Kong government\u2019s mass detentions of political prisoners and regular bulldozing of the rule of law undermine the city\u2019s attractiveness as an international commercial and financial center.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein says an agreement to end the Israel-Hezbollah war is \u201cwithin our grasp\u201d after meeting with officials in Lebanon",
      "BEIRUT -- A United States envoy said an agreement to end the Israel-Hezbollah war is \u201cwithin our grasp\u201d after talks in Lebanon on Tuesday.",
      "However, there was no such optimism in the Gaza Strip, where the looting of nearly 100 aid trucks by armed men worsened an already severe food crisis.",
      "Amos Hochstein, the Biden administration\u2019s pointman on Israel and Lebanon, arrived as Hezbollah\u2019s allies in the Lebanese government said the militant group had responded positively to the proposal, which would entail both its fighters and Israeli ground forces withdrawing from a U.N. buffer zone in southern Lebanon.",
      "The buffer zone would be policed by thousands of additional U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese troops. Israel has called for a stronger enforcement mechanism, potentially including the ability to conduct military operations against any Hezbollah threats, something Lebanon is likely to oppose.",
      "An Israeli airstrike on Tuesday hit a Lebanese army base in the southern town of Sarafand, killing three soldiers, the army said \u2013 the second deadly strike on Lebanese soldiers in as many days. The Israeli military did not immediately comment. At least 41 soldiers have been killed by Israeli bombardment the past month, according to the Lebanese army.",
      "Hochstein said he held \u201cvery constructive talks\u201d with Lebanon\u2019s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who is mediating on the group\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cSpecifically today, we have continued to significantly narrow the gaps,\u201d the envoy told reporters after the two-hour meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately the decisions of the parties to reach a conclusion to this conflict. ... It is now within our grasp.\u201d",
      "Berri said the \"situation is good in principle,\u201d although some technical details remain unresolved. The Lebanese side was waiting to hear the results of Hochstein's talks with Israeli officials, he told the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper.",
      "The United Nations humanitarian office says virtually no food or humanitarian aid has been delivered to northernmost Gaza for more than 40 days because of the Israeli military's siege there.",
      "Experts say famine may already have set in in the north, where Israel has been waging a weekslong offensive that has killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes.",
      "So far in November, OCHA reports that 27 out of 31 planned humanitarian missions to the north were rejected by Israel and the other four were severely impeded, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday. Devastated towns like Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahiya and parts of Jabaliya remain cut off, he said.",
      "Asked whether the U.N. believes Israel is trying to force the estimated 75,000 Palestinians in northern Gaza to move south by denying the aid deliveries, Dujarric replied: \u201cI can\u2019t speak to the intentions of the Israeli government and the Israeli policy. We\u2019re just seeing the result of it and trying to deal with it.\u201d",
      "Israel says it puts no restrictions on the quantity of aid entering Gaza and that it is working to increase the amount. This month, it opened a new crossing into central Gaza. So far it has reported a few dozen trucks entering through it.",
      "The flow of aid is at nearly the lowest level of the entire 13-month war. So far this month, Israel says it let into Gaza an average of 88 trucks a day \u2013 less than half the highest rate of the war, in April, which aid groups say was still too low.",
      "From the aid that does enter, only about half actually reaches Palestinians because Israeli military restrictions and fears of theft often prevent the agency from collecting truck cargos at the border, according to UNRWA, the U.N. agency with the biggest role in the humanitarian operation.",
      "The theft in Gaza over the weekend of nearly 100 trucks loaded with food and other humanitarian aid sent prices soaring and caused shortages in central Gaza, where most of the population of 2.3 million people have fled and where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps.",
      "On Monday, a crowd of people waited outside a shuttered bakery in the central city of Deir al-Balah. A woman who had been displaced from Gaza City, identifying herself as Umm Shadi, said the price of flour had climbed to 400 shekels (over $100) a bag, if it can even be found.",
      "Nora Muhanna, also displaced from Gaza City, said she was leaving empty-handed after waiting five hours for a bag of bread for her children. \u201cFrom the beginning, there are no goods, and even if they are available, there is no money,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.N. said armed men stole food and other aid from 98 trucks over the weekend, the largest single incident of its kind since the war began. It did not say who was behind the theft.",
      "Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, said the convoy of 109 trucks was instructed by the Israeli military to take an \u201calternative, unfamiliar route\u201d after the aid was brought through the Kerem Shalom crossing, and that the trucks were robbed near the crossing itself.",
      "Israel accuses criminal gangs and Hamas of stealing aid, allegations denied by the militant group.",
      "Al-Aqsa TV, operated by the militants, said Hamas-run security forces in Gaza had launched an operation against looters, killing 20 of them.",
      "Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official based abroad, said the looters were young Bedouins who operate east of Rafah near Israeli military positions.",
      "The Hamas-run government had a police force that maintained public security before the war, but they have vanished in many areas after being targeted by Israeli strikes. Hamas says it has taken measures to prevent looting and price-gouging in markets.",
      "But the biggest problem is not theft \u2013 it\u2019s the low amount of aid Israel allows into Gaza, said Tamara Alrifai, communications director for UNRWA.",
      "\u201cTake aid into a war zone a few trucks at a time, what do we expect a displaced, hungry and traumatized population to do?\u201d she said.",
      "Hamas ignited the war in Gaza when its fighters stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of them believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed almost 44,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their toll. The war has left much of the territory in ruins and forced around 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million to flee, often multiple times.",
      "Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after the Hamas attack in what it said was solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes, and all-out war erupted in September.",
      "Israeli bombardment has killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon and wounded almost 15,000, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. It also displaced nearly 1.2 million, or a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population. On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians have been killed by rockets, drones and missiles, and tens of thousands of Israelis have been evacuated from homes near the border.",

      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Shuntaro Tanikawa, who pioneered modern Japanese poetry, poignant but conversational in its divergence from haiku and other traditions, has died. He was 92.",
      "Tanikawa, who translated the \u201cPeanuts\u201d comic strip and penned the lyrics for the theme song of the animation series \u201cAstro Boy,\u201d died Nov. 13, his son Kensaku Tanikawa said Tuesday. He said his father died at a Tokyo hospital due to old age.",
      "Shuntaro Tanikawa stunned the literary world with his 1952 debut \u201cTwo Billion Light Years of Solitude,\u201d a bold look at the cosmic in daily life, sensual, vivid but simple in its use of everyday language. Written before Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019 \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude,\u201d it became a bestseller.",
      "Tanikawa\u2019s \u201cKotoba Asobi Uta,\u201d or \u201cWord Play Songs,\u201d is a rhythmical experiment in juxtaposing words that sound similar, such as \u201ckappa,\u201d a mythical animal and \u201crappa,\u201d a horn, that makes for a joyful singsong compilation, filled with alliterations and onomatopoeia.",
      "\u201cFor me, the Japanese language is the ground. Like a plant, I place my roots, drink in the nutrients of the Japanese language, sprouting leaves, flowers and bearing fruit,\u201d he said in a 2022 interview with The Associated Press at his Tokyo home.",
      "Tanikawa explored the poetic, not only in the repetitive music of the spoken word but also the magic hidden in little things.",
      "One of his works is titled, \u201cI wanted to talk to you in the kitchen in the middle of the night.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the past, there was something about it being a job, being commissioned. Now, I can write as I want,\u201d he said.",
      "In every work Tanikawa tackled, including the script for Kon Ichikawa\u2019s \u201cTokyo Olympiad,\" a documentary film of the 1964 Tokyo Games, the respectful love for the beauty of the Japanese language resonates.",
      "He also translated Mother Goose, Maurice Sendak and Leo Lionni. Tanikawa has in turn been widely translated, including English, Chinese and various European languages.",
      "Some of his works were made into picture books for children, and they are often featured in Japanese school textbooks. He also incorporated Japanese words derived from foreign origins into his poems like Coca-Cola.",
      "In his prose poem with that title, in which a boy is opening a Coke can, he wrote: \u201cIf, for instance, he saw the infinite universe that started or ended at the tip of his can, he was totally unaware of it. One might be able to opine that he named every bit of the unknown about to swallow him with all the vocabulary he could muster, which included his future vocabulary that was yet dormant in his subconscious.\u201d",
      "In his debut poem that catapulted him to stardom, he is more sparse:",
      "\u201cBecause the universe goes on expanding, we are all uneasy. With the chill of two billion light-years of solitude, I suddenly sneezed,\u201d is the way the poem ends, as translated by William I. Elliott and Kazuo Kawamura.",
      "When asked about it, Tanikawa acknowledged it felt as though someone else had written it, but noted he still thought it was a good poem.",
      "\u201cTanikawa\u2019s poetry reflects a metaphysical and quasi-religious attitude toward experience. In simple, spare language, he sketches profound ideas and emotional truths,\u201d according to the Poetry Foundation, a U.S. literary organization.",
      "Tanikawa was born in 1931, a son of philosopher Tetsuzo Tanikawa, and began writing poetry in his teens, circulating with the famous poets of that era, like Makoto Ooka and Shuji Terayama.",
      "He said he used to think poems descended like an inspiration from the heavens. But, as he grew older, he felt the poems welling up from the ground.",
      "In person, Tanikawa was friendly and unassuming, often reading in public with other poets. He never seemed to take himself too seriously but used to confess his one regret in life was never finishing his education, having dropped out amid stardom at a young age.",
      "His relative isolation from the bleakly serious scholarly poetry scene of postwar Japan likely helped him take his free-verse approach that went on to innovate and define Japanese contemporary poetics.",
      "Tanikawa said he wasn\u2019t afraid of death, implying he perhaps meant to write a poem about that experience, too.",
      "\u201cI am more curious about where I will go when I die. It\u2019s a different world, right? Of course, I don\u2019t want pain. I don\u2019t want to die after major surgery or anything. I just want to die, all of a sudden,\u201d he said.",
      "He is survived by his son, musician Kensaku Tanikawa and daughter Shino and several grandchildren. Funeral services were held privately with family and friends. A farewell event in his honor is being planned, Kensaku Tanikawa said.",
      "\u201cAs they did with all of you, Shuntaro\u2019s poems stunned and moved me, making me chuckle or shed a tear. Wasn\u2019t it all so fun?\u201d he said. \u201cHis poems are with you forever.\u201d",

      "\u201cJust fighting for the rights that our t\u016bpuna, our ancestors, fought for,\u201d Shanell Bob said as she waited for the march to begin. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for our tamariki, for our mokopuna, so they can have what we haven\u2019t been able to have,\u201d she added, using the M\u0101ori words for children and grandchildren.",
      "What was likely the country\u2019s largest-ever protest in support of M\u0101ori rights \u2014 a subject that has preoccupied modern New Zealand for much of its young history \u2014 followed a long tradition of peaceful cross-country marches that have marked turning points in the nation's story.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going for a walk!\u201d one organizer proclaimed from the stage as crowds gathered at the opposite end of the city from the nation\u2019s Parliament. People had traveled from across the nation over the past nine days.",
      "For many, the turnout reflected growing solidarity on Indigenous rights from non-M\u0101ori. At bus stops during the usual morning commute, people of all ages and races waited with M\u0101ori sovereignty flags. Some local schools said they would not register students as absent. The city\u2019s mayor joined the protest.",
      "The bill that marchers are opposing is unpopular and unlikely to become law. But opposition to it has been widespread, which marchers said indicated rising knowledge of the Treaty of Waitangi\u2019s promises to M\u0101ori among New Zealanders \u2014 and a small but vocal backlash from those who are angered by the attempts of courts and lawmakers to keep them.",
      "M\u0101ori marching for their rights is not new. But the crowds were larger than at treaty marches before and the mood was changed, Indigenous people said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s different to when I was a child,\u201d Bob said. \u201cWe\u2019re stronger now, our tamariki are stronger now, they know who they are, they\u2019re proud of who they are.\u201d",
      "As the marchers moved through the streets of Wellington with ringing M\u0101ori haka \u2014 rhythmic chants \u2014 and waiata, or songs, thousands more holding signs lined the pavement in support.",
      "Some placards bore jokes or insults about the lawmakers responsible for the bill, which would change the meaning of the principles of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi and prevent them from applying only to M\u0101ori \u2014 whose chiefs signed the document when New Zealand was colonized.",
      "But others read \u201cproud to be M\u0101ori\u201d or acknowledged the bearer\u2019s heritage as a non-M\u0101ori person endorsing the protest. Some denounced the widespread expropriation of M\u0101ori land during colonization, one of the main grievances arising from the treaty.",
      "\u201cThe treaty is a document that lets us be here in Aotearoa so holding it up and respecting it is really important,\u201d said Ben Ogilvie, who is of P\u0101keh\u0101 or New Zealand European descent, using the M\u0101ori name for the country. \u201cI hate what this government is doing to tear it down.\u201d",
      "Police estimated that 42,000 people tried to crowd into Parliament\u2019s grounds, with some spilling into the surrounding streets. People crammed themselves onto the children's slide on the lawn for a vantage point; others perched in trees. The tone was almost joyful; as people waited to leave the cramped area, some struck up M\u0101ori songs that most New Zealanders learn at school.",
      "A sea of M\u0101ori sovereignty flags in red, black and white stretched down the lawn and into the streets. But marchers bore Samoan, Tongan, Indigenous Australian, U.S., Palestinian and Israeli flags, too. At Parliament, speeches from political leaders drew attention to the reason for the protest \u2014 a proposed law that would change the meaning of words in the country\u2019s founding treaty, cement them in law and extend them to everyone.",
      "Its author, libertarian lawmaker David Seymour \u2014 who is M\u0101ori \u2014 says the process of redress for decades of Crown breaches of its treaty with M\u0101ori has created special treatment for Indigenous people, which he opposes.",
      "The bill\u2019s detractors say it would spell constitutional upheaval, dilute Indigenous rights, and that it has provoked divisive rhetoric about M\u0101ori \u2014 who are still disadvantaged on almost every social and economic metric, despite attempts by the courts and lawmakers in recent decades to rectify inequities caused in large part by breaches of the treaty.",
      "It is not expected to ever become law, but Seymour made a political deal that saw it shepherded through a first vote last Thursday. In a statement Tuesday, he said the public could now make submissions on the bill, which he hopes will experience a swell of support.",
      "Seymour briefly walked out onto Parliament\u2019s forecourt to observe the protest, although he was not among the lawmakers invited to speak. Some in the crowd booed him.",
      "The protest was \u201ca long time coming,\u201d said Papa Heta, one of the marchers, who said M\u0101ori sought acknowledgement and respect.",
      "\u201cWe hope that we can unite with our P\u0101keh\u0101 friends, Europeans,\" he added. \"Unfortunately, there are those that make decisions that put us in a difficult place.\u201d"

      "BERLIN -- Germany's defense minister said Tuesday officials have to assume damage to two data cables under the Baltic Sea, one of which ends in Germany, was caused by sabotage \u2014 though he said they have no proof at present.",
      "Damage was detected Monday to the C-Lion1 cable that runs nearly 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) from Finland's capital, Helsinki, to the German port city of Rostock. Another cable between Lithuania and Sweden was also damaged.",
      "Speaking in Brussels, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that Russia poses not just a military but also a hybrid threat, and that Europe needs to take a broad approach to defense. He said the damage to the two cables was \u201ca very clear sign that something is afoot.\"",
      "\u201cNo one believes these cables were severed by mistake, and I also don't want to believe versions that it was anchors that by chance caused damage to these cables,\u201d he said at a regular meeting of European Union defense ministers.",
      "\u201cSo we have to state \u2014 without knowing in concrete terms who it came from \u2014 that this is a hybrid action. And we also have to assume \u2014 without already knowing it, obviously \u2014 that this is sabotage.\u201d",
      "The foreign ministries of Finland and Germany had already said Monday evening that the damage raised suspicion of sabotage.",
      "They said in a joint statement that the damage comes at a time that \u201cour European security is not only under threat from Russia\u2018s war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors.\u201d",
      "The statement said the countries were investigating the incident, and that it was crucial that such \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d be safeguarded.",
      "On Tuesday, Swedish police said they had launched a preliminary investigation into suspected sabotage regarding the two cable breaches, though they said the classification of the suspected offense \u201cmay change.\u201d"

      "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan's Prime Minister on Tuesday approved a long-awaited \u201ccomprehensive military operation\u201d against separatist groups in the restive southwest, more than a week after an outlawed group killed 26 people in a suicide bombing at a train station, officials said.",
      "The announcement by Shehbaz Sharif to launch the operation \"against terrorist organizations\" operating in Balochistan came after a meeting of the government's security committee in Islamabad, the capital. On Nov. 9, a suicide bomber with the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army group blew himself up at a train station in Quetta, killing 26 people, most of them soldiers.",
      "In a statement, Sharif's office said the BLA and other groups will be targeted buit didn't say when the operation would begin. The office blamed the groups for \u201ctargeting innocent civilians and foreign nationals to scuttle Pakistan\u2019s economic progress by creating insecurity at the behest of hostile external powers.\"",
      "In recent months, Balochistan and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province have witnessed a surge in militant violence, most blamed on the outlawed BLA and TTP groups. The train station attack in Quetta was the deadliest since August, when separatists killed more than 50 people in multiple coordinated attacks on passengers buses, police and security forces across Balochistan.",
      "Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan\u2019s largest but also least populated province. It is a hub for the country\u2019s ethnic Baloch minority whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government.",
      "The BLA mostly targets security forces and foreigners, especially Chinese nationals who are in Pakistan as part of Beijing\u2019s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative.

      "Also Tuesday, a suicide car bomber targeted a security post in Bannu, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to Irfan Kahn, a local police official.

      "While Chancellor Olaf Scholz meets world leaders in Brazil, a discussion is swirling in his party at home about whether he should seek a second term as German leader in an early election expected in February",
      "BERLIN -- While Chancellor Olaf Scholz meets world leaders in Brazil, a discussion is swirling in his party at home about whether he should seek a second term as German leader in an early election expected in February.",
      "Unlike their rivals, Scholz's center-left Social Democrats haven't yet formally nominated their candidate for chancellor in the vote expected Feb. 23. And that is generating persistent speculation that the party might instead choose to run with Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, who enjoys higher popularity. Party leaders and Cabinet ministers insist that Scholz will be the candidate but have struggled to tamp down talk of a switch.",
      "Two influential lawmakers said late Monday that Scholz's \u201ccurrent standing is strongly linked with the ... coalition\u201d that he led until it collapsed two weeks ago in a dispute about how to revive Germany's stagnant economy.",
      "Wiebke Esdar and Dirk Wiese, who lead a group of Social Democratic lawmakers from North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, said in a statement that while Scholz's work and decisions will be judged far more positively \u201cat some distance,\u201d a debate is playing out in lawmakers' districts.",
      "\u201cIn the center is the question of what the best political lineup is now for this election,\u201d they said. \u201cWe are hearing a lot of compliments for Boris Pistorius. It is clear that ultimately the party committees will decide on the question of the candidacy for chancellor, and that is also the right place for it.\u201d",
      "Scholz doesn't have a formal position in the party leadership, but Social Democrat leaders have stood firmly behind Scholz even as polls show support for the party stuck around 16% \u2014 roughly half the level of the center-right opposition Union bloc, which is in the lead.",
      "That compares with the 25.7% it scored to narrowly win the 2021 election, in which Scholz \u2014 then a well-regarded vice chancellor and finance minister \u2014 was able to come from behind and present himself as the safest pair of hands against rivals who struggled with gaffes and party infighting.",
      "The chancellor's popularity declined along with the standing of his coalition with the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats, which gained a reputation for incessant squabbling and poor communication while presiding over a weak economy. Its troubles came to a head on Nov. 6, when Scholz fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner and Lindner's Free Democrats quit the government.",
      "Scholz plans to call a confidence vote in parliament for Dec. 16. He's expected to lose that, paving the way for Germany's president to dissolve parliament and call the new election seven months before it was originally planned.",
      "Scholz has made clear for months that he intends to run for a second term.",
      "Hours before the intervention by Esdar and Wiese, the Social Democrats' co-leader, Saskia Esken, reiterated her support.",
      "\u201cWe are determined to go into the election campaign with Olaf Scholz and to win this election together with him,\u201d Esken told ARD television. \u201cHe is ... our chancellor, our candidate for chancellor.\u201d",
      "Asked why the party leadership hadn't formally decided that yet, she replied: \u201cBecause it's so clear.\u201d",
      "Scholz himself is expected to return from the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday.",
      "Rivals have already made their decisions. The Union bloc nominated Friedrich Merz as its challenger in September. Scholz's remaining coalition partners, the Greens, named Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck to head up their challenge on Sunday.",
      "Pistorius has repeatedly said he stands behind Scholz and has given no indication that he plans to run for chancellor, but also hasn't entirely ruled it out. \u201cYou should never rule out anything in politics, no matter what it's about,\u201d he said at an event in Passau Monday, German news agency dpa reported."

No such intimidation would suppress the Belarusians\u2019 striving for freedom and democracy.\u201d",
      "The Interior Ministry released a video showing the drills with helmeted police in black riot gear beating their shields with truncheons in preparation for dispersing a protest. One episode featured an officer arresting a man who was posing as a voter holding a ballot, twisting his arm right next to the ballot box. Other scenes showed gun-toting special forces deploying to take control of a building.",

      "Major opposition figures were either imprisoned or fled the country. Human rights activists say Belarus now holds about 1,300 political prisoners and that many of them are denied adequate medical care and contact with their families.",
      "The authorities have intensified the repression ahead of the Jan. 26 election. Hundreds have been arrested in recent raids targeting relatives and friends of political prisoners and participants in online chats created by residents of apartment buildings in various Belarusian cities.",
      "On Monday, Lukashenko also issued a decree stripping 21 military and law enforcement officials of their ranks for their \u201cunlawful action\u201d in 2020. While the presidential office didn\u2019t give any names or provide details, the move appeared to punish those in the ranks whose loyalties wavered during the protests.",
      "At the same time, Lukashenko has pardoned 146 political prisoners since July in what observers saw as a signal that he\u2019s open for a dialogue with the U.S. and the European Union, which had imposed sweeping sanctions because of his crackdowns on dissent. Those freed had health problems, wrote petitions for pardons and said they repented."

      "Brazil's federal police have arrested five officers accused of plotting a coup that included plans to overthrow the government following the 2022 elections and kill then-President-elect Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva",
      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Brazil \u2019s federal police arrested Tuesday five officers accused of plotting a coup that included plans to overthrow the government following the 2022 elections and kill then-President-elect Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, authorities said.",
      "The five also planned to kill Lula's running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The arrested included four special operations military personnel, one of whom is a retired brigadier general, and a federal police officer.",
      "The police said they also carried out three search warrants along with other measures, including seizing the suspects' passports and preventing them from contacting others. It was not clear when charges would be officially raised against the five suspects.",
      "\u201cThe objective was to prevent the inauguration of the legitimately elected government and undermine the free exercise of democracy and the authority of Brazil\u2019s judiciary,\u201d de Moraes, who authorized the arrests, said of the plot in his order.",
      "\u201cThese actions, peaking between November and December 2022, were part of a broader plan to carry out a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat,\u201d he added.",
      "Lula returned as Brazil\u2019s president for a third, non-consecutive term after narrowly defeating far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro in October 2022. Bolsonaro, who frequently cast doubt on the election results without providing evidence and never conceded, left for the United States days before Lula\u2019s January 2023 inauguration.",
      "In the aftermath of the elections, die-hard Bolsonaro supporters staged nationwide protests challenging the results, closing highways and camping outside military installations. That culminated in a Jan. 8, 2023 uprising, when thousands of demonstrators stormed government buildings in the capital of Brasilia a week after Lula\u2019s inauguration, seeking to oust him from power.",
      "Retired Brig. Gen. M\u00e1rio Fernandes, one of the officers arrested Tuesday, played a key role in linking these pro-Bolsonaro protest camps to Bolsonaro's Cabinet, according to details of the investigation that were included in the judge\u2019s order and that were seen by The Associated Press.",
      "Fernandes served as interim general secretary in Bolsonaro\u2019s Cabinet from October 2020 until the end of his term. Police said they found evidence that he outlined a plan to kill de Moraes, Lula and Alckmin and visited the protest camps outside military installations, including at the army headquarters in Brasilia. According to the police, there's evidence that Fernandes gave instructions and financial support to the protesters.",
      "Fernandes' plan, according to the document, also considered different scenarios \u2014 such as using explosives or poison at an official event \u2014 to assassinate the judge.",
      "Bolsonaro had long railed against the Supreme Court, focusing his ire on de Moraes. The former president's supporters consider de Moraes their chief enemy.",
      "The judge led a five-year probe into fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices, which has led to the ban of some far-right allies and supporters from social media and even some prison terms.",
      "De Moraes also presided over the nation\u2019s top electoral court when it ruled Bolsonaro ineligible for office until 2030, finding that he had abused his power and cast unfounded doubts on the validity of the 2022 election result.",
      "Bolsonaro is also being investigated for a slew of potential crimes, including whether he was involved in inciting the capital uprising to oust his successor.",
      "Fernandes\u2019 plan also described a scenario of poisoning Lula. The federal police officer arrested Tuesday, Wladimir Matos Soares, allegedly provided the other military coup plotters with information about Lula\u2019s security.",
      "The document Tuesday contained no indication that any attempt to carry out an assassination on Lula or Alckmin was put into motion. However, investigators found messages and documents indicating that the plotters were monitoring and following de Moraes at the time.",
      "According to text messages analyzed by investigators, one of the military officers arrested was involved in an operation that officials believe was likely aimed at capturing the Supreme Court justice. On Dec. 15, 2022, military personnel had even taken positions near de Moraes in a parking lot, but the messages indicated they decided to abort the plan last minute.",
      "Sen. Flavio Bolsonaro, the former president\u2019s son, appeared to seize on that, saying no assassination attempt actually took place and claimed that \u201cas repugnant as it is to think about killing someone, it\u2019s not a crime.\u201d",

H\u00e9lio Ferreira Lima, detailed a plan to overthrow the elected government, including orchestrating a probe into alleged election fraud and calling for new elections with a presidential decree backed by Congress.",

      "Police have also found evidence that some of these documents were printed inside the presidential palace during Bolsonaro's term and that part of the plan was discussed at the residence of his running mate, former defense minister Gen. Braga Walter Braga Netto. Braga Netto's lawyers told local media they would wait to review the investigation before making any comments.",
      "In March, two top Brazilian military leaders told police that Bolsonaro had presented them a plan for him to remain in power after losing the 2022 election. However, both refused to take part in the plan and warned Bolsonaro they would arrest him if he tried it, according to judicial documents released earlier this year.",
      "Lula was informed of the arrests on Tuesday morning, according to media reports, as he was hosting the final day of the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro where the Brazilian leader was to meet President Joe Biden and others. Lula made no mention of the arrests during his opening speech on the second day Tuesday of the summit.",
      "The army later said none of the arrested suspects were involved in providing security for the G20 but declined further comment the ongoing investigation.",
      "Last Wednesday, a man set off an explosion outside the Supreme Court in Brasilia, which de Moraes described as a consequence of frequent far-right attacks and hate speech targeting the country\u2019s institutions.",
      "Federal police are investigating the blast as terrorism, according to the force's director, Andrei Passos Rodrigues.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump says he is nominating Dr. Mehmet Oz, who hosted a long-running television talk show, to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday tapped Dr. Mehmet Oz, a former television talk show host and heart surgeon, to head the agency that oversees health insurance programs for millions of older, poor and disabled Americans. Trump also selected Wall Street executive Howard Lutnick to lead the Commerce Department as he fills out his Cabinet.",
      "\u201cDr. Oz will be a leader in incentivizing Disease Prevention, so we get the best results in the World for every dollar we spend on Healthcare in our Great Country,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cHe will also cut waste and fraud within our Country\u2019s most expensive Government Agency, which is a third of our Nation\u2019s Healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire National Budget.\u201d",
      "Oz, who ran a failed 2022 bid to represent Pennsylvania in the U.S. Senate, has been an outspoken supporter of Trump and in recent days expressed support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s nomination for the nation\u2019s top health agency, the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "As the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Oz would report to Kennedy. If confirmed by the Senate, Oz would be responsible for the programs \u2014 Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act \u2014 that more than half the country relies on for health insurance. Medicaid provides nearly-free health care coverage to millions of the poorest children and adults in the U.S. while Medicare gives older Americans and the disabled access to health insurance. The Affordable Care Act is the Obama-era program that offers health insurance plans to millions of Americans who do not qualify for government-assisted health insurance, but do not get insurance through their employer.",
      "\u201cAmericans need better research on healthy lifestyle choices from unbiased scientists, and @robertfkennedyjr can help as HHS secretary,\u201d Oz shared in a post on Instagram last week, along with a photo of him and Kennedy together.",
      "Oz has been accused of hawking dubious medical treatments and products on his defunct TV show. And during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, he pressured government officials to make hydroxychloroquine widely available, despite unresolved questions about its safety and effectiveness.",
      "Lutnick, meanwhile, will have a key role carrying out Trump's plan to raise and enforce tariffs as commerce secretary, Trump said. Lutnick is a cryptocurrency enthusiast and head of brokerage and investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald.",
      "Trump made the announcement on his social media platform, Truth Social. In the post, Trump said Lutnick \u201cwill lead our Tariff and Trade agenda, with additional direct responsibility for the Office of the United States Trade Representative.\"",
      "Lutnick is a co-chair of Trump\u2019s transition team, along with Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive who previously led Trump\u2019s Small Business Administration. Both are tasked with putting forward candidates for key roles in the next administration.",
      "The nomination would put Lutnick in charge of a sprawling Cabinet agency that is involved in funding new computer chip factories, imposing trade restrictions, releasing economic data and monitoring the weather. It is also a position in which connections to CEOs and the wider business community are crucial.",
      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick told CNBC in September that \u201ctariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker.\" Trump on the campaign trail proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the United States imports.",
      "Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.",
      "Lutnick had been considered for treasury secretary, a role that has been at the center of high-profile jockeying within the Trump world. At the same time, the treasury position is closely watched in financial circles, where a disruptive nominee could have immediate negative consequences on the stock market, which Trump watches closely.",
      "The news also comes after billionaire Elon Musk and others in Trump\u2019s orbit called on Trump to dump previous front-runner for treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in favor of Lutnick. Musk said in his post that \u201cBessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas @howardlutnick will actually enact change.\u201d",

      "Lutnick has donated to both Democrats and Republicans in the past, and once appeared on Trump\u2019s NBC reality show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d He has become a part of the president-elect\u2019s inner circle, and has shared the stage with Trump at events in the closing days of his campaign, including a rally at Madison Square Garden.",
      "He came under criticism in the campaign\u2019s final days for an interview with CNN in which he repeated Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s debunked criticisms of vaccines.",

      "British farmers have descended on Parliament to protest a tax hike they say will deal a \u201chammer blow\u201d to struggling family farms",
      "LONDON -- With banners, bullhorns and toy tractors, thousands of British farmers descended on Parliament on Tuesday to protest a tax hike they say will deal a \u201chammer blow\u201d to struggling family farms.",
      "U.K. farmers are rarely as militant as their European neighbors, and Britain has not seen large-scale protests like those that have snarled cities in France and other European countries. Now, though, farmers say they will step up their action if the government doesn\u2019t listen.",
      "The flashpoint is the government\u2019s decision in its budget last month to scrap a tax break dating from the 1990s that exempts agricultural property from inheritance tax. From April 2026, farms worth more than 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) face a 20% tax when the owner dies and they are passed on to the next generation.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s mad,\u201d said Olly Harrison, co-organizer of a protest that flooded the streets around Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s Downing Street office. He said many \u201cwant to take to the streets and block roads and go full French.\u201d",
      "Organizers urged protesters not to bring farm machinery into central London, though a handful of tractors drove past Downing Street festooned with signs saying \u201cthe final straw\u201d and \u201cno farmers, no food.\u201d",
      "They were cheered by a crowd that police estimated at 13,000. Some held signs proclaiming \u201cStand with a farmer, not Starmer.\u201d",
      "Children on toy tractors looped round Parliament Square after a rally addressed by speakers including former \u201cTop Gear\u201d TV host and celebrity farmer Jeremy Clarkson. Another 1,800 farmers were invited into Parliament for a \u201cmass lobby\u201d organized by the National Farmers\u2019 Union.",
      "\u201cThe human impact of this policy is simply not acceptable, it\u2019s wrong,\" NFU President Tom Bradshaw said. \u201cIt\u2019s kicking the legs out from under British food security.\"",
      "Volatile weather exacerbated by climate change, global instability and the upheaval caused by Britain\u2019s 2020 departure from the European Union have all added to the burden on farmers. Many feel the Labour Party government\u2019s tax change, part of an effort to raise billions of pounds to fund public services, is the last straw.",
      "\u201cFour out of the last five years, we\u2019ve lost money,\u201d said Harrison, a fifth-generation farmer who grows cereal crops near Liverpool in northwest England. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s kept me going is doing it for my kids. And maybe a little bit of appreciation on the land allows you to keep borrowing, to keep going. But now that\u2019s just disappeared overnight.\u201d",
      "Starmer\u2019s center-left government says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of farms -\u2013 about 75% \u2014 will not have to pay inheritance tax, and various loopholes mean that a farming couple can pass on an estate worth up to 3 million pounds ($3.9 million) to their children tax-free. The 20% levy is half the 40% inheritance tax paid on other land and property in the U.K.",
      "Starmer spokeswoman Camilla Marshall said the tax decision had been \u201cdifficult\u201d but was not being reconsidered.",
      "Supporters of the tax say it will recoup money from wealthy people who have bought up agricultural land as an investment, driving up the cost of farmland.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s become the most effective way for the super rich to avoid paying their inheritance tax,\u201d Environment Secretary Steve Reed wrote in The Daily Telegraph, adding that high land prices were \u201crobbing young farmers of the dream of owning their own farm.\u201d",
      "But the farmers\u2019 union says more than 60% of working farms could face a tax hit. And while farms may be worth a lot on paper, profits are often small. Government figures show that income for most types of farms fell in the year ending February 2024, in some cases by more than 70%. Average farm income ranged from about 17,000 pounds ($21,000) for grazing livestock farms to 143,000 pounds ($180,000) for specialist poultry farms.",
      "The last decade has been turbulent. Many British farmers backed Brexit as a chance to get out of the EU\u2019s complex and much-criticized Common Agricultural Policy. Since then, the U.K. has brought in changes such as paying farmers to restore nature and promote biodiversity, as well as for producing food.",
      "Some farmers have welcomed those moves, but many feel goodwill was squandered through bureaucratic bungling \u2014 by previous Conservative governments as well as Starmer's Labour administration \u2014 alongside a failure of subsidies to keep up with inflation and new trade deals with countries including Australia and New Zealand that have opened the door to cheap imports.",
      "National Farmers\u2019 Union Deputy President David Exwood said the government has \u201ccompletely blown their trust with the industry.\u201d",
      "Heidi Fermor, who helps run her family\u2019s fruit, vegetable and arable farm in southeast England, said she was attending her first protest because government officials had \u201cno idea\u201d about the reality of farmers\u2019 lives.",
      "\u201cFarming is hard. We\u2019re very privileged, we have a lovely life, but it\u2019s hard,\" she said. \"We want to farm for life, for future generations, not just for today.\u201d"

      "Jersey Mike\u2019s, the quickly expanding sandwich chain, is being acquired by the private equity firm Blackstone in a deal valued at $8 billion",
      "NEW YORK -- Jersey Mike's, the quickly expanding sandwich chain, is being acquired by asset management giant Blackstone.",
      "In the transaction announced Tuesday, private equity funds managed by Blackstone will be used to acquire majority ownership of Jersey Mike's. The deal is \"intended to help enable Jersey Mike\u2019s to accelerate its expansion across and beyond the U.S. market,\" the companies said, as well as aid ongoing technological investments.",
      "Blackstone and Jersey Mike\u2019s did not immediately disclose financial terms in their Tuesday announcement. But a source familiar with the matter confirmed to The Associated Press that the transaction would value Jersey Mike's at around $8 billion, a figure previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "The acquisition of the private company is expected to close in early 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Under terms of the agreement, Jersey Mike\u2019s founder and CEO Peter Cancro will continue to lead the business and maintains a \u201csignificant equity stake\" in the chain, the companies said.",
      "\u201cWe believe we are still in the early innings of Jersey Mike\u2019s growth story and that Blackstone is the right partner to help us reach even greater heights,\" Cancro said in a prepared statement \u2014 adding that Blackstone \u201chas helped drive the success of some of the most iconic franchise businesses globally.\u201d",
      "Jersey Mike\u2019s roots date back to 1956, with a Point Pleasant, New Jersey storefront location that was originally called Mike\u2019s Subs. In 1975, Cancro, then a 17-year-old high school senior who had worked there since he was 14, bought the operation with the help of his football coach.",
      "The chain has expanded rapidly over the last decade, more than tripling its locations from 857 stores in 2014, to more than 2,800 this year, according to Technomic, a restaurant consulting company.",
      "Jersey Mike's posted sales of $3.3 billion in 2023, up 25% from the prior year, according to Technomic. It's the 30th largest chain in the U.S. based on annual sales.",
      "Its aggressive growth has helped Jersey Mike's take market share from rivals like Subway, which has been struggling with a glut of aging stores. Last year, Subway was acquired by Roark Capital, a private equity firm with expertise in restaurant management. Roark also owns Inspire Brands, which houses two other Jersey Mike\u2019s rivals: Jimmy John\u2019s and Arby\u2019s.",
      "Tuesday's agreement with Jersey Mike's follows a series of similar investments from Blackstone. Just earlier this year, the private equity firm acquired Tropical Smoothie Cafe in a deal that it said would also aid the chain's expansion."

      "Building the current crop of artificial intelligence chatbots has relied on specialized computer chips pioneered by Nvidia, which dominates the market and made itself the poster child of the AI boom",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Building the current crop of artificial intelligence chatbots has relied on specialized computer chips pioneered by Nvidia, which dominates the market and made itself the poster child of the AI boom.",
      "But the same qualities that make those graphics processor chips, or GPUs, so effective at creating powerful AI systems from scratch make them less efficient at putting AI products to work.",
      "That's opened up the AI chip industry to rivals who think they can compete with Nvidia in selling so-called AI inference chips that are more attuned to the day-to-day running of AI tools and designed to reduce some of the huge computing costs of generative AI.",
      "\u201cThese companies are seeing opportunity for that kind of specialized hardware,\u201d said Jacob Feldgoise, an analyst at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. \u201cThe broader the adoption of these models, the more compute will be needed for inference and the more demand there will be for inference chips.\u201d",
      "It takes a lot of computing power to make an AI chatbot. It starts with a process called training or pretraining \u2014 the \u201cP\u201d in ChatGPT \u2014 that involves AI systems \u201clearning\u201d from the patterns of huge troves of data. GPUs are good at doing that work because they can run many calculations at a time on a network of devices in communication with each other.",
      "However, once trained, a generative AI tool still needs chips to do the work \u2014 such as when you ask a chatbot to compose a document or generate an image. That's where inferencing comes in. A trained AI model must take in new information and make inferences from what it already knows to produce a response.",
      "GPUs can do that work, too. But it can be a bit like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.",
      "\u201cWith training, you\u2019re doing a lot heavier, a lot more work. With inferencing, that\u2019s a lighter weight,\u201d said Forrester analyst Alvin Nguyen.",
      "That's led startups like Cerebras, Groq and d-Matrix as well as Nvidia's traditional chipmaking rivals \u2014 such as AMD and Intel \u2014 to pitch more inference-friendly chips as Nvidia focuses on meeting the huge demand from bigger tech companies for its higher-end hardware.",
      "D-Matrix, which is launching its first product this week, was founded in 2019 \u2014 a bit late to the AI chip game, as CEO Sid Sheth explained during a recent interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in Santa Clara, California, the same Silicon Valley city that's also home to AMD, Intel and Nvidia.",
      "\u201cThere were already 100-plus companies. So when we went out there, the first reaction we got was \u2018you\u2019re too late,\u2019\u201d he said. The pandemic's arrival six months later didn't help as the tech industry pivoted to a focus on software to serve remote work.",
      "Now, however, Sheth sees a big market in AI inferencing, comparing that later stage of machine learning to how human beings apply the knowledge they acquired in school.",
      "\u201cWe spent the first 20 years of our lives going to school, educating ourselves. That\u2019s training, right?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the next 40 years of your life, you kind of go out there and apply that knowledge \u2014 and then you get rewarded for being efficient.\u201d",
      "The product, called Corsair, consists of two chips with four chiplets each, made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company \u2014 the same manufacturer of most of Nvidia's chips \u2014 and packaged together in a way that helps to keep them cool.",
      "The chips are designed in Santa Clara, assembled in Taiwan and then tested back in California. Testing is a long process and can take six months \u2014 if anything is off, it can be sent back to Taiwan.",
      "D-Matrix workers were doing final testing on the chips during a recent visit to a laboratory with blue metal desks covered with cables, motherboards and computers, with a cold server room next door.",
      "While tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have been gobbling up the supply of costly GPUs in a race to outdo each other in AI development, makers of AI inference chips are aiming for a broader clientele.",
      "Forrester's Nguyen said that could include Fortune 500 companies that want to make use of new generative AI technology without having to build their own AI infrastructure. Sheth said he expects a strong interest in AI video generation.",
      "\u201cThe dream of AI for a lot of these enterprise companies is you can use your own enterprise data,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cBuying (AI inference chips) should be cheaper than buying the ultimate GPUs from Nvidia and others. But I think there\u2019s going to be a learning curve in terms of integrating it.\u201d",
      "Feldgoise said that, unlike training-focused chips, AI inference work prioritizes how fast a person will get a chatbot's response.",
      "He said another whole set of companies is developing AI hardware for inference that can run not just in big data centers but locally on desktop computers, laptops and phones.",
      "Better-designed chips could bring down the huge costs of running AI to businesses. That could also affect the environmental and energy costs for everyone else.",
      "Sheth says the big concern right now is, \u201care we going to burn the planet down in our quest for what people call AGI \u2014 human-like intelligence?\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still fuzzy when AI might get to the point of artificial general intelligence \u2014 predictions range from a few years to decades. But, Sheth notes, only a handful of tech giants are on that quest.",
      "\u201cBut then what about the rest?\u201d he said. \u201cThey cannot be put on the same path.\u201d",
      "The other set of companies don\u2019t want to use very large AI models \u2014 it\u2019s too costly and uses too much energy.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if people truly, really appreciate that inference is actually really going to be a much bigger opportunity than training. I don\u2019t think they appreciate that. It\u2019s still training that is really grabbing all the headlines,\u201d Sheth said."

      "His manager, Traci Burnes, helped steer the company through the pandemic, during a fraught time when they could have shuttered, by figuring out how to retain employees and stay afloat during the shutdown.",
      "\u201cAt that point, we started thinking, this is really a lot more than the manager. She should be a co-owner, right?,\u201d Roach said. \u201cSo then we sort of started trying to think about how we could engineer that and and really got serious about it about a year ago.\u201d",
      "He worked with his longtime accountant, who has a law degree, to formulate a plan. Roach offered Burns a third-co-owner position, with the understanding she eventually could take over the business.",
      "About 51% of small business owners are over the age of 55, according to the U.S. Census. Given that most people in the U.S. retire in their 60s, that time will soon be coming up for many owners.",
      "The most common options for exiting a business include creating a succession plan for a family member or someone already involved in the business; selling the business to an outsider; or simply winding down the business and shuttering it.",

      "\u201cIt was kind of like buying a house in the sense that it just took a lot of time when we transitioned the business ... in terms of paperwork and meeting with attorneys,\" Trapani said. \"And I wasn\u2019t really expecting that and how complicated that got.\u201d",
      "Now the owner, she recommends talking to other small business owners with similar situations to find the best path.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s helpful to see how other people organize that piece of it,\u201d she said.",
      "Once a business owner has decided on a course of action, they should make plans to get the business in shape to sell or turn over to the next owner. It's important to start early because of the potential time involved. Those who wait until the last minute to make an exit plan risk losing value they could have had if they started earlier.",
      "Finally, an owner should be transparent with employees and clients so they aren't surprised or upset when the change occurs.",
      "\u201cMake sure you plan early and and get ahead of it, that you have a clear strategy and path forward,\u201d Roach said."

      "Big money to respond to climate change is key to the United Nations talks underway in Azerbaijan",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Just as a simple lever can move heavy objects, rich nations are hoping another kind of leverage \u2014 the financial sort \u2014 can help them come up with the money that poorer nations need to cope with climate change.",
      "It involves a complex package of grants, loans and private investment, and it's becoming the major currency at annual United Nations climate talks known as COP29.",
      "But poorer nations worry they\u2019ll get the short end of the lever: not much money and plenty of debt.",
      "Meanwhile, half a world away in Brazil, leaders of the 20 most powerful economies issued a statement that among other things gave support to strong financial aid for climate for poor nations and the use of leverage financial mechanisms. That was cheered by climate analysts and advocates.",
      "Money is the key issue in Baku, where negotiators are working on a new amount of cash for developing nations to transition to clean energy, adapt to climate change and deal with weather disasters. It\u2019ll replace the current goal of $100 billion annually \u2014 a goal set in 2009.",
      "Negotiators are fighting over three big parts of the issue: How big the numbers are, how much is grants or loans, and who pays. The how big question is the toughest to negotiate and will likely be resolved only after the first two are solved, COP29 lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThere are interlinkages of the elements. That\u2019s why having one of them agreed could unlock the other one,\u201d Rafiyev said.",
      "It's like the first domino falling leading to another, he said.",
      "In these negotiations, rich potential donor nations have been reluctant to offer a starting figure to negotiate from. So Rafiyev said the conference presidency is putting the pressure on them, telling \u201cthe developed countries that the figure should be fair and ambitious, corresponding to the needs and priorities of the world.\u201d",
      "India\u2019s junior environment minister Kirti Vardhan Singh, who is at the Baku talks, said that \u201cthe global south are bearing a huge financial burden.\u201d",

      "Experts put the number needed for climate finance at $1 trillion, while developing nations have said they'll need $1.3 trillion. But negotiators are talking about different types of money as well as amounts.",
      "So far rich nations have not quite offered a number for the core of money they could provide. But the European Union is expected to finally do that and it will likely be in the $200 to $300 billion a year range, Linda Kalcher, executive director of the think tank Strategic Perspectives, said Tuesday. It might be even as much as four times the original $100 billion, said Luca Bergamaschi, co-founding director of the Italian ECCO think tank.",
      "But there's a big difference between $200 billion and $1.3 trillion. That can be bridged with \u201cthe power of leverage,\" said Avinash Persaud, climate adviser for the Inter-American Development Bank.",
      "When a country gives a multilateral development bank like his $1, it could be used with loans and private investment to get as much as $16 in spending for transitioning away from dirty energy, Persaud said. When it comes to spending to adapt to climate change, the bang for the buck, is a bit less, about $6 for every dollar, he said.",
      "But when it comes to compensating poor nations already damaged by climate change \u2014 such as Caribbean nations devastated by repeated hurricanes \u2014 leverage doesn't work because there's no investment and loans. That's where straight-out grants could help, Persaud said.",
      "Whatever the form of the finance, Ireland\u2019s environment minister Eamon Ryan said it would be \u201cunforgivable\u201d for developed countries to walk away from negotiations in without making a firm commitment toward developing ones.",
      "\u201cWe have to make an agreement here,\u201d he said. \"We do have to provide the finance, particularly for the developing countries, and to give confidence that they will not be excluded, that they will be center stage.\u201d",
      "If climate finance comes mostly in the form of loans, it means more debt for nations that are already drowning in it, said Michai Robertson, climate finance negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States.",
      "\u201cAll of these things are just nice ways of saying more debt,\u201d Robertson said.",
      "His organization argues that most of the $1.3 trillion it seeks should be in grants and very low-interest and long-term loans that are easier to pay back. Only about $400 billion should be in leveraged loans, Robertson said.",
      "Leverage from loans \u201cwill be a critical part of the solution,\u201d said United Nations Environment Programme Director Inger Andersen. But so must grants and so must debt relief, she added.",
      "Rohey John, Gambia's environment minister, said the absence of a financial commitment from rich nations suggests \u201cthey are not interested in the development of the rest of the mankind.\u201d",

      "\u201cG20 Leaders have sent a clear message to their negotiators at COP29: do not leave Baku without a successful new finance goal,\u201d United Nations climate secretary Simon Stiell said. \u201cThis is an essential signal, in a world plagued by debt crises and spiraling climate impacts, wrecking lives, slamming supply chains and fanning inflation in every economy.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The founder of an artificial intelligence company that supplied school districts in Los Angeles, New York and Atlanta with a chatbot to create learning plans for students was arrested on fraud charges Tuesday, accused of spending investor money on herself as her company spiraled into bankruptcy.",
      "Joanna Smith-Griffin, 33, of Raleigh, North Carolina, was arrested in her home state and charged with securities and wire fraud, along with identity theft.",
      "She founded ALLHere Education Inc., an artificial intelligence technology company that created \u201cEd\u201d the chatbot. The Los Angeles Unified School District was among those that used the product for a time before shutting it down, citing the financial collapse of Smith-Griffin's company.",
      "Authorities say the company's products were also used in other major school districts including New York City and Atlanta.",
      "An indictment unsealed Tuesday in Manhattan federal court accused Smith-Griffin of making misrepresentations to investors that enabled her to collect millions of dollars illegally from them since 2020.",
      "It says she used some of the fraudulently obtained money from investors to put a down payment on her home in North Carolina and to pay for her wedding. After the company collapsed and employees were laid off, it entered bankruptcy proceedings and a trustee took over its finances, authorities said.",

      "From foster grandparents who volunteer at an early child care center to citizen scientists who collect water quality data in remote locations, nonprofit volunteers have come back after the pandemic.",
      "A new survey released Tuesday from the U.S. Census Bureau and AmeriCorps shows 28.3% or 75.8 million people in the U.S. volunteered with a nonprofit between Sept. 2022 and Sept. 2023. That is a rebound since COVID-19 public health shutdowns tanked participation by almost 7 percentage points to 23.2% in 2021, the last time the survey was conducted. It is not a full return to pre-pandemic rates of volunteerism.",
      "The drop in volunteer participation was a wake up call for nonprofits, said AmeriCorps CEO Michael D. Smith, and a real test of whether volunteers, whose habits and routines were disrupted, would return.",
      "\u201cThe fact that we went from a point in this country where we were telling people, \u2018Don\u2019t come, our doors are closed,' \u2014 The fact that that did not lead to a flatline or lead to a gradual increase, but to see more than 5% jump is pretty impressive,\" said Smith.",
      "The survey on volunteering and civic life, conducted by the U.S. Census every two years, asks respondents if they volunteered at a nonprofit. It also asks if they informally helped friends, family or neighbors or gave to charity.",
      "The free labor volunteers provide to nonprofits fuels a huge range of services across every kind of community in the U.S., with the survey estimating the value of a volunteer hour at $33.49, far more than the minimum wage in any state or major U.S. city.",
      "At the Alpine Watershed Group, like many nonprofits, they describe volunteers as \u201cfoundational\u201d to their work. Executive director Kimra McAfee said her organization has monitored the river and waters of California\u2019s Alpine County for more than 20 years. Four times a year, volunteers go out to their sites to collect water quality samples, sometimes cross country skiing to get there, she said.",
      "The survey also reveals differences in volunteer participation between states, with a handful like Utah and Vermont at the top with more than 40% participation and a couple of states like Rhode Island and Nevada dropping below 20% participation at the bottom.",
      "Smith said states that top the list often have better institutional supports for nonprofits and volunteers, including paid time off.",
      "The nonprofit After-School All-Stars Las Vegas has volunteers visit students to talk about their career paths or businesses, said executive director Jodi Manzella. Because her nonprofit works out of schools, they weren't able to invite volunteers to fully return until the last school year.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see us falling at the bottom, but we are a booming state and a transitional state,\u201d she said of Nevada with many people moving in and out especially of the Las Vegas area.",
      "Compared to other adults, people between the ages of 45 and 54 volunteered at the highest rates overall, the survey found, and more women volunteered than men, continuing a long-term trend. People with higher incomes reported volunteering with a nonprofit at higher rates than people with lower incomes. Many more people, or 54.3% of people in the U.S., help out informally, which could include anything from babysitting for a family member to lending a tool to a neighbor.",
      "A little more than half of the 15,000 volunteers at Crisis Text Line in 2023 were 18 to 25 years old, said CEO Dena Trujillo. Overall, the survey found 22.6% of a similar age group reported volunteering for a nonprofit.",
      "Crisis Text Line acts like \u201cmental health emergency room,\u201d Trujillo said, with volunteers responding to people in crisis by text 24 hours a day. Volunteers go through 15 hours of training and then work under the supervision of mental health clinicians. People of all ages text the service looking for help with anxiety, depression and relationships, though the majority are 24 years of age or younger, she said.",
      "Trujillo said besides finding purpose in immediately helping people who are in crisis, volunteers report that they feel more equipped to support their family and friends and to deescalate and manage situations in their own lives after completing the training.",
      "\u201cWhen I look at young people, quite frankly, I think the issue is that the volunteering has to match what is relevant to that young person\u2019s life,\u201d she said, with many seeing mental health and well-being as urgent issues.",
      "The ability to text from their homes and at hours convenient for them makes volunteering accessible to a broad range of people, Trujillo said.",
      "For the first time this year, the volunteerism survey asked people to report if their volunteering took place at least in part virtually and 18% of volunteers said it had. While it\u2019s not possible to compare to previous years yet, Smith sees the embrace of virtual volunteering as a way to make more volunteer opportunities available to more people.",
      "Another strategy organizations can use to find more volunteers is to draw from the communities they serve. The Federal Hill House in Providence, Rhode Island, runs early childcare programs, a senior center and a large food pantry. Executive Director Kimberly Fernandez said often the older people who help take care of babies in the morning will stay for lunch and an exercise class in the afternoon.",
      "\u201cPart of the volunteering that happens here is also part of the programming, right? So we don\u2019t try to divide: \u2018You are the service recipient and you\u2019re the volunteer service provider,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Many nonprofits are run exclusively by volunteers to respond to needs in their communities. The Lincoln Bike Kitchen in Nebraska repairs used bikes bikes and gives them away. Shari Weiss Shanks recently became the nonprofit's first executive director and said all kinds of people use the bikes to commute to work or school, filling a need for transportation and independence.",
      "While they certainly love getting volunteers who have mechanical skills, she said there are a lot of different roles people can play depending on their interests.",
      "\u201cThe one thing I would say about about volunteering is if you are angry or you aren\u2019t finding a purpose or a cause, go volunteer for a nonprofit,\" she said. \"It will change your life.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by convincing average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\u201cMy father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\u201d",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry\u2019s best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer\u2019s brand, led today by his daughter Pauline, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy \u2013 stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants \u2013 changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\u201d That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn\u2019t hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship. The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn\u2019t visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer\u2019s guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer\u2019s advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks. \"It was really pioneering stuff,\u201d Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \u201cthat would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I\u2019ve got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\u201d",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\" The concept no longer made sense when hotels could not be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire did not disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer \u2014 in a David vs. Goliath triumph \u2014 got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\u201cI never dreamed at my age I\u2019d be working this hard,\u201d he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show. He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony postings. And he coined the phrase \u201cTrump Slump\u201d in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight. Eventually he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe,\" and a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece, distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Eventually Frommer gave up law to write the guides full-time. Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \u201cmost Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. \u2026 And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn\u2019t have to be well-heeled.\u201d",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \u201cI fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\u201d he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap, and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\u201d",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer\u2019s survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and two granddaughters."

      "Journalist unions in Greece have launched a 24-hour strike, joining broader labor unrest on the eve of a nationwide general strike",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Journalist unions in Greece launched a 24-hour strike Tuesday, joining broader labor unrest ahead of a nationwide general strike planned for Wednesday. Public and many private media outlets across the country, including print, broadcast, and online platforms, halted operations in solidarity with demands for better wages. Unions are demanding that the conservative government fully restore collective bargaining rights that were scaled back during a 2010-18 financial crisis and successive international bailouts. The country has since returned to healthy growth and investment grade status but retains the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in the European Union. Wednesday's general strike organized by private and public sector unions is expected to paralyze public transport and disrupt other services.",
      "Union leaders criticize the government for failing to address escalating inflation and inadequate housing policies which have eroded workers\u2019 living standards."

    "story": [
      "Rory McIlroy looks back on a great year with four wins and a sixth title as Europe's best",
      "Tied for the lead with three holes left in an exhausting season for Rory McIlroy, he launched a pitching wedge toward the 16th green in Dubai and barked out desperate instructions.",
      "\u201cGo! Go! Go!\" he urged the golf ball as it descended over the water.",
      "It dropped in front of the flag, a foot from the hole, a shot that carried him to another victory in the season-ending DP World Tour Championship, his fourth win of the year, and a sixth title as No. 1 on the European tour.",
      "By all accounts, it was a great year.",
      "But it's different when those trophies \u2014 and a big one that was missing \u2014 belong to McIlroy.",
      "\u201cI'm going to look back on 2024 and I'm going to have four wins,\u201d he said.",
      "Two were in Dubai, at the start and finish of the year. One was at Quail Hollow for the fourth time. The other was the most fun \u2014 the Zurich Classic with close friend Shane Lowry, followed by McIlroy belting out Journey's \u201cDon't Stop Believin'\u201d at a post-tournament party.",
      "\u201cBut I know that my 2024 is going to be defined \u2014 at least by others \u2014 by the tournaments that I didn't win as much as the tournaments I did,\u201d he said.",
      "Such are the expectations for McIlroy. He has to come to accept them, or he wouldn't have brought that up without any prompting. This is what happens with greatness. And this is a level of play that remarkably doesn't get enough credit.",
      "Yes, he was tops in Europe for the third consecutive time, and sixth overall. That leaves him only two away from matching the record of Colin Montgomerie, who had the advantage of never leaving Europe to play two tours.",
      "But go back to Oct. 4, 2009. McIlroy tied for second in the Dunhill Links Championship and moved to No. 19 in the world at age 20. He has not been outside the top 20 ever since, an astonishing streak of 15 years and counting.",
      "Phil Mickelson at 16 years and 30 weeks is the only player to have a longer run in the top 20.",
      "Even so, the only streak that matters when the conversation turns to McIlroy is his 10 straight years without a major. That's what gives him pause when he rates his year. He was three holes away from a U.S. Open title at Pinehurst No. 2 until he missed short par putts on the 16th and 18th holes, and Bryson DeChambeau saved par with an exquisite bunker shot to beat him.",
      "McIlroy has been desperate to win the Masters for the career Grand Slam. At this point, any major would do. Who could have imagined his last major would have come at age 25?",
      "There also was disappointment on losing a late lead to a fast-charging Rasmus Hojgaard in the Irish Open at Royal County Down, right when all of Northern Ireland was ready to celebrate McIlroy winning on home soil.",
      "Billy Horschel beat him in a playoff at Wentworth. McIlroy's dynamic charge in Paris drowned with a wedge into the water at the Olympics. Play long enough at that level and those outcomes are bound to happen.",
      "A great year? For anyone else, sure.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately for Rory, I think everybody looks at the glass half-empty,\u201d Lowry said. \"I look at it glass half-full. He's had an amazingly consistent year. I've had a consistent year, but he's had consistent top-3 finishes \u2014 mine are top 15s.",
      "\u201cHe probably should have won the U.S. Open \u2014 let's be honest, and he'd say that himself \u2014 but he didn't,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cI think he is more determined than ever to come out firing next year, and obviously the Masters will be on the forefront.\u201d",
      "It was more than DeChambeau pipping him at Pinehurst that gave McIlroy pause. He won four times and actually dropped one spot in the world ranking to No. 3, behind Scottie Scheffler and Xander Schauffele.",
      "Scheffler has no equal at the moment with eight wins, including the Masters, The Players Championship and Olympic gold. Schauffele won two majors at the PGA Championship and British Open.",
      "\u201cThey certainly separated themselves from the pack this year,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI'm obviously aware of that, and it only makes me more motivated to try to emulate what they did this year.\u201d",
      "McIlroy said he got choked up at the end of his season at the mention of tying the late Seve Ballesteros with a sixth Order of Merit. Ballesteros is the soul of European golf, and that's not likely to change no matter how many more titles McIlroy wins.",
      "But there was more to the emotion. The end of any season tends to bring that out, and this was a season like no other.",
      "Off the course, McIlroy has been involved in negotiations between the PGA Tour and the Saudi backers of LIV Golf, and his desire to reunite with LIV defectors occasionally has put him at odds with other players.",
      "Far more personal was the shock announcement in May he had filed for divorce, and then disclosing a month later they had scrapped the divorce filing in a bid to save their marriage. His wife, Erica, and 4-year-old daughter Poppy celebrated with him in Dubai. Call it five wins for the year.",
      "He played 27 times, a lot early in search of the right formula to be ready for the Masters, and a lot late because the European tour means a lot to him. He says he will scale back. He is not getting any younger. He is no less entertaining.",
      "In light of it all, golf is a game. But that wedge was big. Winning was important. For such a tumultuous year, it was the ideal way for it to end.",
      "\u201cYeah, it's been quite the year,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cBut you know, I'm super happy with where I am in my career and in my life. And I feel like everything\u2019s worked out the way it was supposed to.\u201d",

      "\u201c The titles, the numbers, are there, so people probably know that, but the way I would like to be remembered is as a good person from a small village in Mallorca,\u201d the 38-year-old Nadal told the flag-waving, sign-toting crowd at the sold-out Palacio de Deportes Jose Maria Martin Carpena. \u201cJust a kid that followed their dreams, worked as hard as possible. ... I have been very lucky.\u201d",
      "He had said beforehand that his feelings would need to be put on hold, that this week was about attempting to claim one last trophy for his country, not about pondering his impending retirement, which he announced last month would come after this event.",
      "But he acknowledged after playing that \"the emotions were difficult to manage,\u201d and that he felt nerves out there amid the roars of an adoring audience that mostly showed up for one player and one player only.",
      "After Nadal, a 14-time French Open champion, was beaten on the indoor hard court in southern Spain, he became a cheerleader for his heir apparent, Carlos Alcaraz, who evened the matchup against the Netherlands at 1-all by getting past Tallon Griekspoor 7-6 (0), 6-3 in the other singles match. But then van de Zandschulp and Wesley Koolhof clinched the victory for the Dutch by defeating Alcaraz and Marcel Granollers 7-6 (4), 7-6 (3) in the deciding doubles match.",
      "Even if Spain had managed to get past the Netherlands, Nadal said that if he were his team's captain, he wouldn't pick himself to play again in the semifinals after that performance against the 80th-ranked van de Zandschulp.",
      "At least he was in a joking mood after the result put a stop to his 29-match winning streak in Davis Cup singles. The only other blemish on his record, which stood at 29-1 entering Tuesday, came in his 2004 debut.",
      "\u201cI lost my first match in the Davis Cup, and I lost my last one,\u201d Nadal said with a wide grin. \u201cSo we close the circle.\u201d",
      "When a forehand found the net to close his last match, Nadal walked to the net for a quick hug with his opponent.",
      "\u201cThat was a tough, tough match to play,\u201d said van de Zandschulp, noting that he idolized Nadal while growing up.",
      "In certain ways, this was, unmistakably, the Nadal that van de Zandschulp \u2014 and so many others \u2014 can remember. The white headband, marked with the red bull logo Nadal made famous. The white tape wrapped around all four of his left, racket-holding fingers. The water bottles by his sideline bench, placed just so.",
      "There was the occasional ace right on a line. The occasional serve-and-volley foray. The occasional over-the-shoulder putaway. And, yes, the occasional uppercut and scream of \u201cVamos!\u201d There also were \u2014 neither to Nadal\u2019s or most of the 9,200 spectators\u2019 liking \u2014 several points where he looked like a once-dominant figure diminished by age and injuries.",
      "Nadal was just not able to bring his best, no matter how many chants of \u201cRa-fa!\u201d or \u201cEspa\u00f1a!\u201d or \u201cSi, se puede!\u201d (\u201cYes, you can!\u201d) broke out, no matter how many scarves reading \u201cGracias, Rafa!\u201d or red-and-yellow Spanish flags of all sizes filled the arena.",
      "This version of Nadal had hip issues, including surgery in June 2023, and abdominal problems that combined to limit him to only 24 matches over the past two years. He went 12-8 in singles in 2024.",
      "The match against van de Zandschulp \u2014 who upset Alcaraz at the U.S. Open \u2014 was Nadal\u2019s first outing that counted since early August at the Paris Olympics. He lost there in the second round of singles to Djokovic and bowed out in the doubles quarterfinals alongside Alcaraz.",
      "Nadal and Alcaraz practiced with each other hours before the start of play. The day, much like the entire Davis Cup leadup, was largely about memories of, and praise for, Nadal.",
      "\u201cYou know very well what you have meant to the tennis world,\u201d said Spain's captain, David Ferrer, who lost to Nadal in the 2013 French Open final. \u201cWe will miss you a lot.\u201d",
      "Nadal\u2019s appeal was found in how he played tennis, relentless and striking each shot as if it might be his last, and the humility he displayed away from competition. No one cared for him as much as his fellow Spaniards. He is a national hero, transcending sports, and that was clear from the love expressed over and over via shouts and standing ovations \u2014 when Nadal entered the court, when he won a point, when his match ended, and so on.",
      "\u201cWhen we heard the news that Rafa was retiring, this really became something special \u2014 a chance to see the greatest sportsman in the country\u2019s history,\u201d said Luis Julve, a 19-year-old college student who made the trip from Madrid with his mother and aunt.",
      "When the matches, the ceremony, the night and his career were over, Nadal hugged his teammates and left the court, pausing to waive to goodbye to his fans one last time.",
      "\u201cThe truth is that nobody ever wants to arrive at this moment,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cI\u2019m not tired of playing tennis, but it\u2019s my body that doesn\u2019t want to play anymore, so I have to accept the situation. Honestly, I feel super privileged for having been able to make a career out of my hobby, and for having played for much longer than I could ever have imagined.\"",

      "The game was tied at 95 with 8:46 left, but LaVine had nine points in a 13-2 run that put the Bulls up by 11 with 5:45 to go. He hit six 3-pointers in the quarter after a slow start.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 14:42:16 -0500",

    "story": [
      "Indiana has made the type of turnaround that had only happened once before at the power-conference level over the last decade",
      "Indiana has made the type of turnaround that had only happened once before at the power-conference level over the last decade.",
      "But this new era of college football with unbalanced schedules and loosened transfer restrictions might make such dramatic transformations more common.",
      "\u201cI think any P4 school with the proper commitment is capable of being successful and being ultimately successful because really the difference between victory and defeat in most of these games is very slight, slim,\u201d Indiana coach Curt Cignetti said. \u201cIt\u2019s all attainable.\u201d",
      "Cignetti just agreed to terms on an eight-year contract as No. 5 Indiana prepares for arguably the biggest game in program history, a showdown Saturday at No. 2 Ohio State. Cignetti\u2019s new deal gives him an annual salary of $8 million plus a $1 million annual retention bonus.",
      "He earned that raise when Indiana won its first 10 games this season after going 3-9 the year before his arrival.",
      "\u201cWhat he\u2019s done is utterly amazing,\u201d said Jimbo Fisher, the former Florida State and Texas A&M coach who now hosts a show on SiriusXM Radio. \u201cI think it\u2019s the best job in college football right now. I think he\u2019s national coach of the year.\u201d",
      "If the pandemic-shortened 2020 season is taken out of consideration, Indiana is the 21st team since 1973 to win at least 10 games immediately after a season in which it had three wins or fewer, according to Sportradar.",
      "Indiana is the first Power Four team to accomplish this since Michigan State went 10-3 in 2017 after going 3-9 in 2016. The last Power Four program to do it before Michigan State was Auburn, which was 3-9 in 2012 but went 12-1 and reached the BCS championship game in 2013.",
      "Indiana\u2019s emergence has come in a season featuring many other dramatic rises and falls, whether it\u2019s Vanderbilt going from 2-10 in 2023 to beating Alabama and becoming bowl eligible this year, or Florida State winning just one game thus far after posting an undefeated regular-season record a year ago.",
      "That lends credence to the notion that the loosening of transfer restrictions and the emergence of unbalanced schedules in super-sized conferences could enable other programs to replicate Indiana\u2019s rapid rebuild.",
      "\u201cI do think it\u2019s more conducive to happening, yes,\u201d Fisher said.",
      "Now that players don\u2019t have to sit out a season after switching schools \u2014 resulting in exponentially more transfers \u2014 teams can reshape their rosters every year. Indiana opened the season with 27 transfer newcomers and had just 36 returning scholarship players.",
      "The only Football Bowl Subdivision teams with fewer returning scholarship players were North Texas and Colorado, with 31 each.",
      "\u201cThey just did a really good job of bringing in the right guys, bringing in the right people,\u201d said Michigan coach Sherrone Moore, whose team lost at Indiana 20-15 on Nov. 9.",
      "The fortunes of teams from year to year also can change depending on their conference schedules. The Big Ten has 18 teams playing nine conference games and the Southeastern Conference has 16 teams with an eight-game conference schedule. That means some teams will have much tougher or easier schedules than their conference foes.",
      "Only one of the 10 teams Indiana has beaten owns a winning record: Washington (6-5).",
      "\u201cI do think it will be that way because there are chances you\u2019re going to have years where you get to roll through a schedule that might not be the trickiest,\u201d said Dan Mullen, a former Florida and Mississippi State coach now working as an analyst for ESPN.",
      "Mullen also noted that sometimes you don\u2019t know how favorable a schedule might be until the end of the season. For instance, Indiana played Michigan and Washington, the two participants in last year\u2019s College Football Playoff championship game. Both are struggling to finish above .500 this year.",
      "While the transfer portal and the unbalanced schedules could make it easier for teams to rebuild on the fly, Indiana\u2019s rise included some unique elements. After Cignetti left James Madison for Indiana, 13 players from his former school joined him.",
      "Those former James Madison players already were familiar with Cignetti\u2019s approach and assisted Indiana\u2019s holdovers in adapting to it. That made for an easier transition than if all of Indiana\u2019s transfers had come from a variety of other programs.",
      "\u201cThat whole JMU crew that came over really facilitated the culture change here, and they\u2019re all major contributors for the most part,\u201d Cignetti said. \u201cBetween the white lines and on defense you\u2019ve got some real key guys playing at a high level. I think that familiarity with the program, the defense, the offense, the special teams has been extremely beneficial.\u201d",
      "Big Ten Network analyst Gerry DiNardo wonders if Indiana\u2019s success might cause another Power Four program making a coaching change to try something similar by hiring a successful Group of Five coach who could bring along players from his former school.",
      "\u201cThat is a new model,\u201d DiNardo said. \u201cAnd that new model obviously is working, and that new model obviously could work again.\u201d",
      "The help Indiana got from the transfer portal and its favorable schedule shouldn\u2019t diminish what the Hoosiers have accomplished. Revitalizing a program remains challenging even in this era. Just ask Nebraska and Wisconsin, two of Indiana\u2019s Big Ten rivals.",
      "Both programs have much greater football traditions than Indiana, which had never won as many as 10 games in a season before this year. Nebraska\u2019s Matt Rhule and Wisconsin\u2019s Luke Fickell \u2014 both in their second years \u2014 had higher profiles than Cignetti had upon his arrival at Indiana. Yet the Cornhuskers and Badgers are at .500 heading into their Saturday matchup and recently made offensive coordinator changes.",
      "DiNardo understands the enormity of Indiana\u2019s accomplishment better than most. He posted an 8-27 record as Indiana\u2019s coach from 2002-04 and knows the challenges of winning there. He credits athletic director Scott Dolson for bucking the trend of hiring an up-and-coming offensive coordinator and instead choosing the 63-year-old Cignetti, who had a proven record of head coaching success at smaller programs.",
      "\u201cScott Dolson, he deserves a lot of credit for this decision,\u201d DiNardo said last week, before Cignetti got his new deal. \u201cAnd I think he will continue to support the football coach at a high level, more than previous athletic directors have. It\u2019s not just a one-year deal for Scott. He will give the football coach what he needs to be successful. That wasn\u2019t always true. It was always true that the AD would give the basketball coach what they need to be successful. I think Scott will do both.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Boston Bruins have fired coach Jim Montgomery after losing 12 of their first 20 games",
      "BOSTON -- Boston coach Jim Montgomery, who led the Bruins to the greatest regular season in NHL history but never got them past the second round of the playoffs, was fired Tuesday, a day after the below-.500 team lost to last-place Columbus to extend its losing streak to three games.",
      "\u201cJim Montgomery is a very good NHL coach and an even better person,\u201d general manager Don Sweeney said in a news release announcing the move. \u201cOur team\u2019s inconsistency and performance in the first 20 games of the 2024-25 season has been concerning and below how the Bruins want to reward our fans.\"",
      "Assistant Joe Sacco, who led the Colorado Avalanche to a 130-134-40 record from 2009-2014 and was a finalist for coach of the year in his first season, will lead the Bruins on an interim basis.",
      "\u201cI believe Joe Sacco has the coaching experience to bring the players and the team back to focusing on the consistent effort the NHL requires to have success,\u201d Sweeney said. \"We will continue to work to make the necessary adjustments to meet the standard and performance our supportive fans expect.\u201d",
      "Montgomery, 55, was fired 20 games into his third season in Boston and a day after a 5-1 loss to Columbus in which the Bruins allowed two short-handed goals. He leaves with a 8-9-3 record this season and a 180-84-33 mark in his career, which also included one-plus season in Dallas.",
      "The Bruins finished with more than 100 points in each of Montgomery's first two seasons \u2014 including a record-setting debut, when their 65 wins and 135 points were both the most in NHL history. But the team lost in the first round of the playoffs that year and advanced to only the second round last season.",
      "The struggles carried over into the new season, with an opening night loss to Florida in which they fell behind 5-1 and an 8-2 loss to Carolina on Halloween. After the Monday night loss in which the team was booed off the ice at home after falling behind 3-0 in the first period, Montgomery grew philosophical.",
      "\u201cEveryone goes through struggles. Whether in life, or your team,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what life\u2019s about. How do you pick yourself up? It\u2019s not how hard you fall. It\u2019s how quickly you pick yourself up.\u201d",
      "The Bruins\u2019 best hope is that a coaching change kick-starts a roster with high-end talent that hasn\u2019t been performing.",
      "As a team, the Bruins have given up 21 more goals than they\u2019ve allowed \u2014 third-worst in the NHL. All-Star David Pastrnak managed no shots on Monday and his minus-4 is the lowest plus-minus of his career; Brad Marchand is minus-3, the lowest since he became a full-time NHLer.",
      "\u201cDefinitely not happy with the way that things are going,\u201d Marchand said Monday night. \u201cWe need to be much better in a lot of areas. ... It\u2019s not acceptable to continue to have the same mistakes and do the same things over and over that aren\u2019t bringing us success. So, yeah, we need to be a lot better.\u201d",
      "But the biggest problem has been the goaltending.",
      "And that can\u2019t be blamed on the coach.",
      "A year after alternating two No. 1 goalies for the entire regular season \u2014 and finishing with more than 100 points for the sixth full season in a row \u2014 the Bruins came out of training camp with none. General manager Don Sweeney traded 2023 Vezina Trophy winner Linus Ullmark over the summer \u2014 before agreeing to a new contract with Jeremy Swayman.",
      "The timing emboldened Swayman\u2019s holdout, and the 25-year-old from Alaska didn\u2019t agree to a new deal \u2014 eight years and $66 million \u2014 until the eve of the regular season. His numbers (5-7 record, .884 save percentage, 3.47 goals-against average) may be the hangover from missing training camp; Jonas Korpisalo (3-2, .901, 2.74), who was acquired from Ottawa over the summer, hasn\u2019t been the answer either. \u201cI think I\u2019ve had enough time now to adapt and get back to things,\u201d Swayman said Monday night. \u201cI\u2019m really trying to to engulf just being in a room again and being a leader and I want my play to speak for that. So I need to step up, and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d",
      "A genial hockey lifer who led Maine to the 1993 NCAA title \u2014 scoring a third-period hat trick in the final \u2014 Montgomery played in 122 NHL games over six years before he turned to coaching. He won two U.S. junior titles and led Denver to an NCAA championship before he was hired by the Dallas Stars.",
      "In his first season on the bench, Dallas made the playoffs for the first time in three years. In his second, the team would reach the Stanley Cup Final but with a new coach.",
      "Montgomery was fired 32 games into the year for what the team called unprofessional conduct. He has since admitted to binge drinking to the point of blackouts and conceded that he deserved to be fired. After going through rehab, he was hired as an assistant in St. Louis and then for the head coaching job with the Bruins.",
      "In Boston, Montgomery replaced Bruce Cassidy \u2014 another likeable Bruins coach whose teams racked up 100-point seasons but flamed out in the postseason. Cassidy was fired three years after leading Boston to the 2019 Stanley Cup Final and hired by Vegas eight days after the Bruins fired him.",

      "Rafael Nadal is heading into retirement after Spain was eliminated from the Davis Cup",
      "MALAGA, Spain -- Rafael Nadal's remarkable tennis career came to end on Tuesday and he heads into retirement after Spain lost to the Netherlands in the quarterfinals at the Davis Cup Final 8.",
      "The 38-year-old Nadal played on tour for more than two decades and collected 22 Grand Slam titles, including 14 on his favorite clay at the French Open, and 92 singles titles overall. He reached No. 1 in the ATP rankings and spent the longest consecutive span in the top 10 in history \u2014 nearly 18 full years \u2014 until playing sparingly the past two seasons because of several injuries.",
      "Nadal forever will be remembered as a member of the Big Three of men\u2019s tennis, along with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic.",
      "Here is a year-by-year look back at the victories, losses, rivalries and injuries that marked Nadal's career:",
      "Nadal gave it one last go, but he missed three of the four Grand Slam tournaments and went just 12-8 in singles. He got a tough draw at his beloved French Open and lost in the first round to eventual runner-up Alexander Zverev. At the Paris Olympics, contested at Roland Garros, Nadal was eliminated by Djokovic in the second round of singles, then bowed out in the doubles quarterfinals alongside Carlos Alcaraz. On Oct. 10, Nadal announced that his last professional appearance would be at the Davis Cup, representing Spain at home in Malaga. On Tuesday, Nadal played his final match, losing 6-4, 6-4 to Botic van de Zandschulp of the Netherlands.",
      "Nadal lost in the second round of the Australian Open to Mackie McDonald while dealing with a left hip flexor injury. It was Nadal\u2019s earliest Grand Slam loss in seven years. He didn\u2019t play the rest of the year and had hip surgery in June.",
      "Nadal briefly moved into sole possession of the record for most Grand Slam singles titles, breaking a tie with Federer, by claiming No. 21 at the Australian Open, coming back to beat Daniil Medvedev after dropping the first two sets of the final. Nadal then got No. 22 (Djokovic eventually would pass him and is currently at 24) at the French Open, where he overcame debilitating pain in his left foot with nerve-numbing injections to lift the trophy for the 14th time by beating Casper Ruud in the final. That improved Nadal\u2019s career record there to 112-3. He pulled out of Wimbledon before the semifinals because of torn abdominal muscle, then lost in the U.S. Open\u2019s fourth round to Frances Tiafoe.",
      "Blew a two-set lead against Stefanos Tsitsipas in the Australian Open quarterfinals, then lost to Djokovic in the French Open semifinals. Played only two matches the rest of the year because of chronic pain in his left foot.",
      "Pulled even with Federer with 20 Slam trophies with a 13th title at the French Open, defeating Djokovic in the final. Won multiple titles in a season for 16th consecutive year.",
      "French Open title No. 12 and U.S. Open title No. 4 arrived, as did a return to No. 1 at age 33. Lost to Djokovic in the Australian Open final and to Federer in the Wimbledon semifinals. Was troubled by thigh, knee, left hand and abdominal problems at various points.",
      "Won an 11th championship at Roland Garros. Stopped playing two Grand Slam matches elsewhere because of injuries and skipped other tournaments with knee, hip and abdominal issues.",
      "After losing the Australian Open final in five sets to Federer, Nadal returned to dominance at the French Open, dropping just 35 games through seven matches en route to a 10th title there, beating Stan Wawrinka in the final. Added a third U.S. Open trophy \u2014 his 16th major overall, moving within one of Federer \u2014 and finished at No. 1 in the rankings for the fourth time.",
      "For first time since 2004, Nadal did not reach any Grand Slam quarterfinals. He lost in the Australian Open\u2019s first round and withdrew from the French Open before third round because of an injured left wrist and was out of action for months.",

Lost to 144th-ranked Nick Kyrgios in the fourth round at Wimbledon, then missed three months with a bad right wrist. After returning, Nadal sat out two events because of appendicitis.",
      "After seven months off the tour because of his left knee and a stomach virus, Nadal put together a 10-title season that returned him to No. 1.

      "Beat Djokovic for a seventh French Open title. At Wimbledon, lost to Lukas Rosol in the second round while hampered by a left knee problem that sidelined him the rest of the season.",
      "Hurt a left leg muscle at the Australian Open, but was fine by the French Open and tied Bjorn Borg\u2019s career mark for men with a sixth championship, beating Federer in the final. Nadal lost seven of 10 finals that season, with six of those setbacks against Djokovic, including at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.",
      "Stopped during his Australian Open quarterfinal because of an injured right knee, but returned to top form at the French Open: He won his fifth title in Paris and didn\u2019t drop a set, beating Robin Soderling in the final. Won Wimbledon for the second time, then completed a career Grand Slam by beating Djokovic in the U.S. Open final. Finished the year ranked No. 1.",
      "Won his first Australian Open title, defeating Federer in a five-set final, after getting past Fernando Verdasco in a five-set semifinal. Nadal\u2019s 31-match unbeaten run at the French Open ended with a fourth-round loss to Soderling. Nadal was troubled by knee tendinitis and sat out Wimbledon. Dealing with an abdominal issue, he reached the U.S. Open semifinals before losing to champion Juan Martin del Potro.",
      "Topped Federer in the Roland Garros final to collect a fourth consecutive trophy there, making Nadal the first man since Borg in 1978-81 with that long a streak in Paris \u2014 and first since Borg to win the title without dropping a set. Again played Federer in the final at the All England Club, but this time Nadal won 9-7 in the fifth set in fading light. Also won a singles gold medal at the Beijing Olympics and ended the year ranked No. 1, despite dealing with tendinitis in his right knee.",
      "A third consecutive French Open title came via another victory over Federer \u2014 and then Federer beat him in Wimbledon\u2019s final. Nadal\u2019s clay winning streak reached 81 matches before a loss to Federer in Hamburg, Germany.",
      "Earned a second French Open title, beating Federer in the final there before losing to him in Wimbledon\u2019s final. Stretched his clay-court winning streak to a record 62 matches.",
      "Won the title in his French Open debut; his 11 trophies for the year were most in a season for a teenager in ATP history. Moved into the top 10 in April and remained there until March 2023. Finished 2005 ranked No. 2.",
      "Beat then-No. 1 Federer in Miami. Won his first ATP title in Sopot, Poland, on clay. Defeated Andy Roddick to help Spain top the United States and win the Davis Cup.",
      "Reached the third round in his Wimbledon debut at 17, the youngest man to get that far at the All England Club since Boris Becker was 16 in 1984.",
      "At 15 years, 10 months, he earned first ATP match win in his hometown of Mallorca.",

      "A combination of hurricane damage to Tropicana Field and political delays on financing means it is highly unlikely the Tampa Bay Rays\u2019 planned new stadium will be ready for the 2028 season, if at all",
      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- A combination of severe hurricane damage to Tropicana Field and political delays on financing means it is highly unlikely the Tampa Bay Rays' planned new stadium will be ready for the 2028 season, if at all, the team said Tuesday.",
      "Rays top executives said in a letter to the Pinellas County Commission that the team has already spent $50 million for early work on the new $1.3 billion ballpark and cannot proceed further because of delays in approval of bonds for the public share of the costs.",
      "\u201cThe Rays organization is saddened and stunned by this unfortunate turn of events\u201d said the letter, signed by co-presidents Brian Auld and Matt Silverman, who noted that the overall project was previously approved by the County Commission and the City of St. Petersburg.",
      "\u201cAs we have made clear at every step of this process, a 2029 ballpark delivery would result in significantly higher costs that we are not able to absorb alone,\u201d the letter added.",
      "The tumultuous series of events came after Hurricane Milton ripped the roof off Tropicana Field on Oct. 9, forcing the Rays to play the 2025 season at the spring training home of the New York Yankees, 11,000-seat Steinbrenner Field in Tampa. Then, the Pinellas County Commission postponed a planned Oct. 29 vote on the bond issue that the Rays said has thrown the new 30,000-seat ballpark timeline off.",
      "The commission, which now includes two newly elected members, voted Tuesday to delay consideration of the financing bonds until its Dec. 17 meeting.",
      "\u201cThis is a big deal. I\u2019m not an anti-stadium person. I just want to make sure we\u2019re getting the deal done and it's fair,\" said Commissioner Dave Eggers.",
      "That leaves the Rays' future in St. Petersburg in limbo.",
      "\u201cWe know we\u2019re going to be in Steinbrenner in 2025 and we don\u2019t know much beyond that,\" Auld said in an interview.",
      "Asked if Major League Baseball can survive long term in the Tampa Bay area, Rays Principal Owner Stuart Sternberg said the outlook is \"less rosy than it was three weeks ago. We\u2019re going to do all that we can, as we\u2019ve tried for 20 years, to keep the Rays here for generations to come.\u201d",
      "The team's contract with the city of St. Petersburg requires that the Rays play three more seasons at Tropicana Field assuming it is repaired. The cost of fixing the ballpark in time for the 2026 season is pegged at more than $55 million for a building scheduled to be torn down when the new facility is ready.",
      "Under the original plan, Pinellas County would spend about $312.5 million for the new ballpark and the city of St. Petersburg around $417 million including infrastructure improvements. The Rays and their partner, the Hines development company, would cover the remaining costs including any overruns.",
      "It isn't just baseball that is affected. The new Rays ballpark is part of a larger urban renovation project known as the Historic Gas Plant District, which refers to a predominantly Black neighborhood that was forced out by construction of Tropicana Field and an interstate highway spur.",
      "The broader $6.5 billion project would transform an 86-acre (34-hectare) tract in the city\u2019s downtown, with plans in the coming years for a Black history museum, affordable housing, a hotel, green space, entertainment venues, and office and retail space. There\u2019s the promise of thousands of jobs as well.",

    "story": [
      "A New Hampshire company is working to develop a fleet of autonomous helicopters that it hopes can be used to put out fires, spray crops and handle other dangerous jobs",
      "HENNIKER, N.H. -- When Hector Xu was learning to fly a helicopter in college, he recalled having a few \u201cnasty experiences\u201d while trying to navigate at night.",
      "The heart-stopping flights led to his research of unmanned aircraft systems while getting his doctorate degree in aerospace engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Then, he formed Rotor Technologies in 2021 to develop unmanned helicopters.",
      "Rotor has built two autonomous Sprayhawks and aims to have as many as 20 ready for market next year. The company also is developing helicopters that would carry cargo in disaster zones and to offshore oil rigs. The helicopter could also be used to fight wildfires.",
      "For now, Rotor is focused on the agriculture sector, which has embraced automation with drones but sees unmanned helicopters as a better way to spray larger areas with pesticides and fertilizers.",
      "On Wednesday, Rotor plans to conduct a public flight test with its Sprayhawk at an agriculture aviation trade show in Texas.",
      "\u201cPeople would call us up and say, \u2018hey, I want to use this for crop dusting, can I?\u2019 We\u2019d say, OK maybe,\u201d Xu said, adding that they got enough calls to realize it was a huge untapped market. The Associated Press reporters were the first people outside the company to witness a test flight of the Sprayhawk. It hovered, flew forward and sprayed the tarmac before landing.",
      "Rotor's nearly $1 million Sprayhawk helicopter is a Robinson R44, but the four seats have been replaced with flight computers and communications systems allowing it be operated remotely. It has five cameras as well as laser-sensing technology and a radar altimeter that make terrain reading more accurate along with GPS and motion sensors.",
      "At the company's hangar in Nashua, New Hampshire, Xu said this technology means there is better visibility of terrain at night.",
      "One of the big draws of automation in agriculture aviation is safety.",
      "Because crop dusters fly at around 150 mph (240 kph) and only about 10 feet (3 meters) off the ground, there are dozens of accidents each year when planes collide with power lines, cell towers and other planes. Older, poorly maintained planes and pilot fatigue contribute to accidents.",
      "A 2014 report from the National Transportation Safety Board found there were more than 800 agriculture operation accidents between 2001 and 2010 including 81 that were fatal. A separate report from the National Agriculture Aviation Association found nearly 640 accidents from 2014 until this month with 109 fatalities.",
      "\u201cIt is a very, very dangerous, profession and there are multiple fatalities every year,\u201d said Dan Martin, a research engineer with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service. \u201cThey make all their money in those short few months so sometimes it may mean that they fly 10 to 12 hours a day or more.\u201d",
      "Job hazards also include exposure to chemicals.",
      "In recent years, safety concerns and the cheaper cost has led to a proliferation of drones flying above farmers' fields, Martin said, adding that some 10,000 will likely be sold this year alone.",
      "\u201cIt's growing exponentially as a market, super fast,\u201d Martin said.",
      "But the size of the drones and their limited battery power means they only can cover a fraction of the area of a plane and helicopters. That is providing an opening for companies building bigger unmanned aircraft like Rotor and another company Pyka.",
      "California-based Pyka announced in August that it had sold its first autonomous electric aircraft for crop protection to a customer in the United States. Pyka's Pelican Spray, a fixed-wing aircraft, received FAA approval last year to fly commercially for crop protection. The company also sold its Pelican Spray to Dole for use in Honduras and to the Brazilian company, SLC Agr\u00edcola.",
      "Lukas Koch, chief technology officer at Heinen Brothers Agra Services, the company which bought the Pelican Spray in August, has called unmanned aircraft part of a coming \u201crevolution,\" that will save farmers money and improve safety.",
      "The Kansas-based company operates out of airports from Texas to Illinois. Koch doesn't envision the unmanned aircraft replacing all the the company's dozens of pilots but rather taking over the riskiest jobs.",
      "\u201cThe biggest draw is taking the pilot out of the aircraft inside of those most dangerous situations,\u201d Koch said. \u201cThere\u2019s still fields that are surrounded by trees on all borders, or you\u2019ve got big, large power lines or other just dangers, wind turbines, things like that. It can be tough to fly around.\u201d",
      "But Koch acknowledges autonomous aviation systems could introduce new dangers to an already chaotic airspace \u2014 though that is less of a concern in rural areas with plenty of open space and fewer people.",
      "\u201cPutting more systems into the air that don\u2019t have a pilot inside could introduce new dangers to our current existing pilots and make their life even more dangerous,\" he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got this full size helicopter flying beyond the line of sight, how is it going to react when it sees you? What is it going to do? ... That's a giant question mark, one that we take very seriously.\u201d",
      "Companies like Rotor have incorporated built-in in contingencies should something go wrong \u2014 its helicopter features a half-dozen communications systems and, for now, a remote pilot in control.",
      "If the ground team loses contact with the helicopter, Rotor has a system which Xu referred to as a big, red button that ensures the engine can be shut off and the helicopter perform a controlled landing. \u201cThat means that we\u2019ll never have an aircraft fly away event,\" he said.",
      "The safety measures will go a long way to helping the company receive what it expects will be FAA regulatory approval to fly its helicopters commercially. Once they have that, the challenge, as Xu sees it, will be scaling up to meet the demand in the United States but also Brazil which has a huge agriculture market but more relaxed regulatory environment.",
      "\u201cI think 2025 will be production hell as Elon Musk calls it,\u201d Xu said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the difference between building a couple to building tens and hundreds at scale ... These are no longer just like bespoke Rolls-Royces. You want to be stamping these out like you would production automobiles.\""

      "SpaceX has launched another Starship rocket, but passed up catching it with giant mechanical arms",
      "SpaceX on Tuesday launched another Starship rocket, but passed up catching the booster with giant mechanical arms.",
      "Unlike last month\u2019s success, the booster was directed to a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. The catch was called off just four minutes into the test flight from Texas for unspecified reasons, and the booster hit the water three minutes later.",
      "Not all of the criteria for a booster catch was met and so the flight director did not command the booster to return to the launch site, said SpaceX spokesman Dan Huot. He did not specify what went wrong.",
      "At the same time, the empty spacecraft launched from Texas atop Starship soared across the Gulf of Mexico on a near loop around the world similar to October\u2019s test flight. Skimming space, the shiny retro-looking craft descended into the Indian Ocean for a controlled but destructive end to the hourlong demo.",

      "SpaceX kept the same flight path as last time, but changed some steps along the way as well as the time of day. Starship blasted off in late afternoon instead of early morning to ensure daylight to see the spacecraft\u2019s descent.",
      "Among the new objectives that were achieved: igniting one of the spacecraft\u2019s engines in space, which would be necessary when returning from orbit. There were also thermal protection experiments aboard the spacecraft, with some areas stripped of heat tiles to see whether catch mechanisms might work there on future flights. And the spacecraft descended nose-first during the last part of entry, before flipping and splashing down upright into the Indian Ocean. Even more upgrades are planned for the next test flight.",

      "Building the current crop of artificial intelligence chatbots has relied on specialized computer chips pioneered by Nvidia, which dominates the market and made itself the poster child of the AI boom",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Building the current crop of artificial intelligence chatbots has relied on specialized computer chips pioneered by Nvidia, which dominates the market and made itself the poster child of the AI boom.",
      "But the same qualities that make those graphics processor chips, or GPUs, so effective at creating powerful AI systems from scratch make them less efficient at putting AI products to work.",
      "That's opened up the AI chip industry to rivals who think they can compete with Nvidia in selling so-called AI inference chips that are more attuned to the day-to-day running of AI tools and designed to reduce some of the huge computing costs of generative AI.",
      "\u201cThese companies are seeing opportunity for that kind of specialized hardware,\u201d said Jacob Feldgoise, an analyst at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. \u201cThe broader the adoption of these models, the more compute will be needed for inference and the more demand there will be for inference chips.\u201d",
      "It takes a lot of computing power to make an AI chatbot. It starts with a process called training or pretraining \u2014 the \u201cP\u201d in ChatGPT \u2014 that involves AI systems \u201clearning\u201d from the patterns of huge troves of data. GPUs are good at doing that work because they can run many calculations at a time on a network of devices in communication with each other.",
      "However, once trained, a generative AI tool still needs chips to do the work \u2014 such as when you ask a chatbot to compose a document or generate an image. That's where inferencing comes in. A trained AI model must take in new information and make inferences from what it already knows to produce a response.",
      "GPUs can do that work, too. But it can be a bit like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.",
      "\u201cWith training, you\u2019re doing a lot heavier, a lot more work. With inferencing, that\u2019s a lighter weight,\u201d said Forrester analyst Alvin Nguyen.",
      "That's led startups like Cerebras, Groq and d-Matrix as well as Nvidia's traditional chipmaking rivals \u2014 such as AMD and Intel \u2014 to pitch more inference-friendly chips as Nvidia focuses on meeting the huge demand from bigger tech companies for its higher-end hardware.",
      "D-Matrix, which is launching its first product this week, was founded in 2019 \u2014 a bit late to the AI chip game, as CEO Sid Sheth explained during a recent interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in Santa Clara, California, the same Silicon Valley city that's also home to AMD, Intel and Nvidia.",
      "\u201cThere were already 100-plus companies. So when we went out there, the first reaction we got was \u2018you\u2019re too late,\u2019\u201d he said. The pandemic's arrival six months later didn't help as the tech industry pivoted to a focus on software to serve remote work.",
      "Now, however, Sheth sees a big market in AI inferencing, comparing that later stage of machine learning to how human beings apply the knowledge they acquired in school.",
      "\u201cWe spent the first 20 years of our lives going to school, educating ourselves. That\u2019s training, right?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the next 40 years of your life, you kind of go out there and apply that knowledge \u2014 and then you get rewarded for being efficient.\u201d",
      "The product, called Corsair, consists of two chips with four chiplets each, made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company \u2014 the same manufacturer of most of Nvidia's chips \u2014 and packaged together in a way that helps to keep them cool.",
      "The chips are designed in Santa Clara, assembled in Taiwan and then tested back in California. Testing is a long process and can take six months \u2014 if anything is off, it can be sent back to Taiwan.",
      "D-Matrix workers were doing final testing on the chips during a recent visit to a laboratory with blue metal desks covered with cables, motherboards and computers, with a cold server room next door.",
      "While tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have been gobbling up the supply of costly GPUs in a race to outdo each other in AI development, makers of AI inference chips are aiming for a broader clientele.",
      "Forrester's Nguyen said that could include Fortune 500 companies that want to make use of new generative AI technology without having to build their own AI infrastructure. Sheth said he expects a strong interest in AI video generation.",
      "\u201cThe dream of AI for a lot of these enterprise companies is you can use your own enterprise data,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cBuying (AI inference chips) should be cheaper than buying the ultimate GPUs from Nvidia and others. But I think there\u2019s going to be a learning curve in terms of integrating it.\u201d",
      "Feldgoise said that, unlike training-focused chips, AI inference work prioritizes how fast a person will get a chatbot's response.",
      "He said another whole set of companies is developing AI hardware for inference that can run not just in big data centers but locally on desktop computers, laptops and phones.",
      "Better-designed chips could bring down the huge costs of running AI to businesses. That could also affect the environmental and energy costs for everyone else.",
      "Sheth says the big concern right now is, \u201care we going to burn the planet down in our quest for what people call AGI \u2014 human-like intelligence?\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still fuzzy when AI might get to the point of artificial general intelligence \u2014 predictions range from a few years to decades. But, Sheth notes, only a handful of tech giants are on that quest.",

      "Erik Yabor, a spokesperson for Lancaster District Attorney Heather Adams, said Tuesday that Lancaster County prosecutors had no comment about the ongoing investigation.",
      "A spokesperson for Attorney General Michelle Henry's office said the agency was not able to talk about specific tips or reports made to the Safe2Say Something platform, which fields anonymous reports from students and others about safety threats.",

      "LNP said the school indicated on Friday that it had \u201cparted ways\u201d with Micciche and that board president Angela Ang-Alhadeff had stepped down. The Associated Press left phone messages seeking comment with both of them on Tuesday. A letter addressed to the school community Monday by the Lancaster Country Day Board of Trustees said it was working to replace them and was \u201cstill in the process of finalizing the resolution to the case.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we can say is that over the course of the past week the board was made aware of information that led us to the decision to resolve the matter,\u201d the board wrote, including acting \u201cin the best interests of the girls who have been impacted and in the best interest of the school long term.\u201d",
      "The school said counseling has been offered to students and the institution is reviewing reporting procedures, safety practices and other policies regarding student safety."

      "YEMASSEE, S.C. -- Four monkeys remain free nearly two weeks after a group of 43 escaped  from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research, authorities said.",
      "Two more rhesus macaques were trapped Monday outside the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, bringing the total of recovered monkeys to 39, chief executive Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by police in a social media post.",
      "The monkeys caught Monday were in good health, and the others continue to thrive, Westergaard said. Efforts to catch the four remaining escaped monkeys were expected to continue Tuesday, he said. Authorities believe they are probably all together in an area next to the company\u2019s property or very close by.",
      "Forty-three monkeys made a break for it Nov. 6 after an employee at what locals call \u201cthe monkey farm\u201d did not fully lock their enclosure, police said.",
      "There are three gates keeping the monkeys inside their containment area, and a worker is supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecured, allowing the primates to escape, Westergaard told WCSC-TV last week. It appears unintentional, he said.",
      "Alpha Genesis has said efforts to recover all the monkeys will continue for as long as it takes at its compound about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a housecat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "Humans have been using monkeys for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "The monkeys pose no risk to public health, Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police have all said. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers.",
      "If people encounter the monkeys, they are advised to stay away from them and not to fly drones in the area. The company said the monkeys are skittish and might run."

      "President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Howard Lutnick, head of brokerage and investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald and cryptocurrency enthusiast, as his nominee for commerce secretary",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Howard Lutnick, head of brokerage and investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald and cryptocurrency enthusiast, as his nominee for commerce secretary.",
      "The nomination would put Lutnick in charge of a sprawling Cabinet agency that is involved in funding new computer chip factories, imposing trade restrictions, releasing economic data and monitoring the weather. It is also a position in which connections to CEOs and the wider business community are crucial.",
      "Lutnick, a co-chair of Trump\u2019s transition team, along with Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive who previously led Trump\u2019s Small Business Administration, once appeared on Trump\u2019s NBC reality show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\" He has become a part of the president-elect\u2019s inner circle.",
      "Here are things to know about the billionaire who, if confirmed by the Senate, will lead the Commerce Department.",
      "Elon Musk and others in Trump\u2019s orbit called on Trump last week to dump previous front-runner for treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in favor of Lutnick. Musk said in a post that \u201cBessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas @howardlutnick will actually enact change.\u201d",
      "The treasury role has been at the center of an unusual high-profile jockeying within the Trump world. At the same time, the position is closely watched in financial circles, where a disruptive nominee could have immediate negative consequences on the stock market, which Trump watches closely. Trump has yet to decide on one of the top remaining vacancies in his proposed cabinet.",
      "The major remaining nominees for the role are Bessent, former Federal Reserve board governor Kevin Warsh, Apollo Global Management Chief Executive Marc Rowan, and Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty, Trump's former Japan ambassador.",
      "Trump on the campaign trail proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the United States imports. On the campaign trail, Trump portrayed the taxes on imports as both a negotiating tool to hammer out better trade terms and as a way to generate revenue to fund tax cuts elsewhere.",
      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick gave full-throated support for Trump's tariffs plan in a CNBC interview in September. \u201cTariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker,\" he said.",
      "Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.",
      "Lutnick's brother, Gary Lutnick, and 658 of 960 Cantor Fitzgerald employees were killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center. The firm lost two-thirds of its employees that day. Lutnick is a member of the Board of Directors of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, the Partnership for New York City.",
      "After Cantor Fitzgerald settled a wrongful death and personal injuries case against American Airlines and insurance carriers in 2013 for $135 million, Lutnick said: \u201cWe could never, and will never, consider it ordinary. For us, there is no way to describe this compromise with inapt words like ordinary, fair or reasonable. All we can say is that the legal formality of this matter is over.\u201d",

      "\u201cBitcoin is like gold and should be free trade everywhere in the world,\u201d Lutnick said at a bitcoin conference earlier this year. \u201cAnd as the largest wholesaler in the world we\u2019re going to do everything in our power to make it so. Bitcoin should trade the same as gold everywhere in the world without exception and without limitation.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- For two weeks, Donald Trump has welcomed Elon Musk into his world. On Tuesday, it was Musk\u2019s turn to play host to the president-elect.",
      "Trump flew to South Texas to watch as Musk\u2019s SpaceX launched a Starship rocket near the Mexican border. Trump listened intently as the world\u2019s richest man explained how the test would work and demonstrated with a model. And then Trump squinted into the bright sky to watch liftoff.",
      "It didn\u2019t go perfectly -\u2013 the reusable booster did not return to the launch pad as it had done on a previous test last month. Instead, the booster was directed to a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "But Trump\u2019s presence at the launch was a remarkable display of intimacy between the two men, one with implications for American politics, the government, foreign policy and even the possibility of humans reaching Mars.",
      "Musk spent around $200 million to help Trump beat Democrat Kamala Harris in the presidential race, and he's been given unparalleled access. He's counseled Trump on nominees for the new administration, joined the president-elect's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and been tapped to co-chair an advisory panel on cutting the size of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "In addition to political influence, Musk could benefit personally as well. SpaceX, his rocket company, has billions of dollars in government contracts and the goal of eventually starting a colony on Mars. He's also CEO of Tesla, which manufactures electric vehicles, and has battled with regulators over safety concerns involving autonomous driving.",
      "\u201cTrump has the biggest possible regard for people who break the rules and get away with it,\" said William Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank. \"Musk has demonstrated extraordinary accomplishment in doing that.\u201d",
      "To top if off, Musk owns the social media company X, formally known as Twitter, which he has harnessed as an influential perch to promote Trump and his agenda.",
      "\u201cStop the Swamp!\u201d he wrote Tuesday as he shared a warning that entrenched Washington interests are trying to undermine Trump before his inauguration.",
      "Before the election, Musk rejected the idea that he was expecting any favors in return for supporting Trump in the presidential race.",
      "\u201cThere is no quid pro quo,\u201d he posted on X in September. \u201cWith a Trump administration, we can execute major government reform, remove bureaucratic paperwork that is smothering the country and unlock a new age of prosperity.\u201d",
      "However, Trump has hardly gone anywhere without Musk in the two weeks since beating Harris. Musk joined Trump at a meeting with House Republicans in Washington and sat next to him at an Ultimate Fighting Championship match in New York. The trip to Texas for the rocket launch was just Trump's third time outside Florida since the election.",
      "As Trump's protective motorcade left the launch site Tuesday evening to return to the airport, one of Musk's angular, shiny Tesla Cybertrucks was tucked in the middle of the formation of black SUVs.",
      "Much of Trump's activity is happening with little public access for the press. Unlike his predecessors, he has opted against regularly making his travel plans or events open to journalists.",
      "The relationship between Trump and Musk was not always so close.",
      "Two years ago, Trump was mocking Musk in stump speeches and Musk was saying it was time for Trump to \u201chang up his hat & sail into the sunset.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump would be 82 at end of term, which is too old to be chief executive of anything, let alone the United States of America,\u201d Musk wrote on social media.",
      "But Musk swiftly endorsed Trump after the former president survived an assassination attempt in July. He quickly became a central figure in Trump\u2019s orbit, appearing at times more like his running mate than Ohio Sen. JD Vance.",
      "Trump started boasting about Musk's accomplishments at campaign rallies, such as when Starship's reusable rocket booster returned to the launch tower on a previous occasion and was caught by mechanical arms.",
      "\u201cThose arms grab it like you grab your baby, just like you grab your little baby. And it hugged it and just put it down, and there it was,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Musk was with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort on election night and has spent much of the two weeks since there. Trump\u2019s granddaughter Kai Trump posted a photo of her with Musk at one of Trump\u2019s golf resorts, writing that Musk was \"achieving uncle status.\u201d",
      "Last week, Musk appeared in a golden ballroom at Mar-a-Lago, seated in the center of the room as a guest of honor at an event. Trump, in his remarks at the black tie event, said Musk\u2019s IQ is \u201cabout as high as they can get\u201d and praised him as \u201ca really good guy.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe launched a rocket three weeks ago and then he went to Pennsylvania to campaign because he considered this more important than launching rockets that cost billions of dollars,\u201d Trump said.",

      "Eagle lovers around the world who were crushed when the nest of a Minnesota pair and their chick collapsed on live video last year will get a when a new eagle camera goes live this week",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Eagle lovers around the world who were crushed by the live-streamed collapse of a nest housing two birds and their chick will get another viewing opportunity when a new eagle camera goes live on Thursday.",
      "The new camera, operated by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, is in a different location and will show a different nesting pair, the agency announced Tuesday. But the DNR will also keep its old EagleCam running because the old pair built a new nest about a half-mile away and still visit their old territory. They've been seen there as recently as Friday.",
      "The old camera had viewers in 50 states and around 160 countries, in homes, classrooms and nursing homes, according to Lori Naumann, a spokesperson for the DNR's Nongame Wildlife Program, which runs the cameras. The old nest was home to a pair that viewers unofficially nicknamed \u201cNancy and Beau\u201d until it collapsed during a heavy snowstorm on April 2, 2023. The female bird flew off as a branch supporting the 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) nest, which was over 20 years old, gave way. The chick was later found dead.",
      "There was an outpouring of grief in popular Facebook groups that followed the pair, and members of those groups expressed excitement at the news Tuesday.",
      "Naumann told reporters they often had thousands of viewers at any given time before the nest collapse, especially during the pandemic as homebound viewers went online to get their nature fixes. Minnesota has the largest eagle population in the lower 48 states, building nests even in urban areas.",
      "The pair at the new, undisclosed location has nested there for at least four years and has reared several broods of eaglets, Naumann said. Officials aren't sure exactly how long the nest has been there or how many chicks the parents have hatched because they haven't followed them closely yet, she said.",
      "Both cameras will go live around 6 a.m. CST Thursday on the DNR website and on the agency\u2019s YouTube channel.",
      "There isn't a lot of activity at the nest at the moment, though that will change, Naumann said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really breeding season right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe expect them to start bringing new branches and new nesting material into the nest over the next several months, when their courtship behavior will start ramping up. And when that happens, they actively build the nest together, showing their dedication to each other and their worthiness of being a partner.\u201d",
      "The female is expected to lay two or three eggs sometime around February, she said, and they'll take about 35 days to hatch. Both adults typically care for their chicks, constantly bringing them dead fish to satisfy their enormous appetites.",
      "As for \u201cNancy and Beau\u201d \u2014 the DNR doesn't name the animals it follows \u2014 it wasn\u2019t feasible to run power to and install a camera at their new nest, where they successfully raised two chicks last season. So the agency launched an extensive search before settling on the new, more accessible location with a healthy tree. They installed the camera in early October at a total cost of about $5,000. Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy provided the bucket lift truck and other services to set up the new camera at no charge, as it did with the original.",
      "The eagles serve as ambassadors for the Nongame Wildlife Program, which is supported by direct donations and a voluntary checkoff on the state\u2019s personal income tax form. It funds a range of wildlife projects across the state to benefit struggling species. The cameras are going live on Thursday to leverage a statewide charity event, although as a government agency the DNR isn't an official participant."

      "A report released Monday by Pew Research Center says about one in five Americans regularly get their news from so-called news influencers on social media",
      "About one in five Americans \u2013 and a virtually identical share of Republicans and Democrats \u2013 regularly get their news from digital influencers who are more likely to be found on the social media platform X, according to a report released Monday by the Pew Research Center.",
      "The findings, drawn from a survey of more than 10,000 U.S. adults and an analysis of social media posts posted this summer by influencers, provide an indication of how Americans consumed the news during the height of the U.S. presidential campaign that President-elect Donald Trump ultimately won.",
      "The study examined accounts run by people who post and talk regularly about current events - including through podcasts and newsletters - and have more than 100,000 followers on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, X or TikTok. They include people across the political spectrum, such as the progressive podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen and conservative podcaster Ben Shapiro, as well as non-partisan personalities like Chris Cillizza, a former CNN analyst who now runs his own newsletter.",
      "The report found that news influencers posted mostly about politics and the election, followed by social issues like race and abortion and international events, such as the Israel-Hamas war. Most of them \u2013 63% - are men and the majority \u2013 77% - have no affiliation, or background, with a media organization. Pew said about half of the influencers it sampled did not express a clear political orientation. From the ones that did, slightly more of them identified as conservative than as liberal.",
      "During the campaign, both parties and presidential campaigns had courted influencers, including creators who weren't very political, to compete for voters who are increasingly getting most of their news from non-traditional sources.",
      "The Republican and Democratic national conventions had credentialed influencers to cover their events this past summer. Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with Alex Cooper for her \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d podcast and talked a little Bay Area basketball with the fellows on \u201cAll the Smoke.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump hung out with the bros on the \u201cBussin\u2019 With the Boys,\u201d \u201cFlagrant\u201d and the popular podcaster Joe Rogan as part of a series of appearances targeting young male voters.",
      "\u201cThese influencers have really reached new levels of attention and prominence this year amid the presidential election,\u201d Galen Stocking, senior computational social scientist at Pew Research Center, said in a statement. \u201cWe thought it was really important to look at who is behind some of the most popular accounts \u2013 the ones that aren\u2019t news organizations, but actual people.\u201d",

Most of the people surveyed by Pew said news influencers have helped them better understand current events, while roughly a quarter say what they hear has not made much of a difference. A small share \u2014 9% \u2014 say influencers have confused them more.",
      "Media analysts have long been concerned about how influencers - most of whom don't have to abide by editorial standards - could fuel misinformation, or even be used by America's adversaries to churn out content that fits their interests. On social media, though, some influencers have positioned themselves as figures presenting neglected points of view.",
      "Pew, which is doing the study as part of an initiative funded by the Knight Foundation, said 70% of the survey respondents believe the news they get from influencers is somewhat different than what they hear elsewhere. Roughly a quarter said it was \u201cextremely or very different.\u201d",
      "The report found TikTok is the only one of the major platforms where influencers who identify as right-leaning do not outnumber those who are more liberal. Pew said news influencers on the short-form video app were more likely than those on other sites to show support for LGBTQ+ rights or identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. The platform also had the smallest gender gap for news influencers.",

    "story": [
      "A federal bankruptcy judge in Texas is being asked to disqualify a winning bid made by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars",
      "A company affiliated with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones asked a federal judge on Monday to disqualify a bid by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy Jones' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction, alleging fraud and collusion.",
      "The company, First United American Companies, which is affiliated with a Jones website that sells dietary supplements, was the only other bidder at the recent auction, offering $3.5 million. In a filing in federal bankruptcy court in Houston, a lawyer for the company asked the judge to declare it the winning bidder instead of The Onion.",
      "The lawyer, Walter Cicack, claimed that the bankruptcy trustee overseeing the auction improperly colluded with The Onion and families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut in naming The Onion the winning bidder. Cicack also alleged the trustee violated rules for the sale set by the judge, and said the company's cash offer was twice the amount of The Onion's.",
      "The bankruptcy auction was held last week as part of the liquidation of Jones\u2019 assets, including Infowars. Proceeds from the sale will go to Sandy Hook families and other creditors. Jones filed bankruptcy in 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits filed by the families for calling the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion\u2019s parent company, Chicago-based Global Tetrahedron, issued a statement Monday through a spokesperson.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re obviously disappointed he\u2019s lashing out by creating conspiracies, but we\u2019re also not surprised,\u201d he said, referring to Jones.",
      "The bankruptcy trustee appointed to oversee the sale, Christopher Murray, declined to comment Monday. A lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, Christopher Mattei, also declined to comment.",
      "In a response filed in court later Monday, Murray called the allegations \u201cbaseless.\u201d He said the motion by First United American to disqualify The Onion was \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Murray also wrote, \u201cHaving failed in its prior efforts to bully the Trustee and his advisors into accepting its inferior bid, FUAC now alleges, without evidence, collusion and bad faith in an attempt to mislead the Court and disqualify its only competition in the auction.\u201d",
      "Murray filed separate court papers Monday asking the judge to approve the sale of Infowars to The Onion.",
      "Monday's filing by First United American Companies included the formal bid submitted by The Onion, revealing that it offered $1.75 million for Infowars along with certain incentives by Sandy Hook families who won their defamation lawsuit against Jones. The families agreed to forgo up to 100% of their share of the Infowars sale proceeds and give it to other Jones creditors.",
      "With the families' offer, other Jones creditors would get a total of $100,000 more than they would get if First United American Companies bought Infowars, according to The Onion's bidding document.",
      "Murray told the bankruptcy judge during a court hearing Thursday that the families' incentives made it a better offer than the one by the Jones-affiliated company.",
      "\u201cThe creditors ended up significantly better off,\u201d Murray told the judge, adding that one of his responsibilities was to maximize value for creditors.",
      "Judge Christopher Lopez, who said he had questions about the sale process and concerns about transparency, ordered a hearing to see exactly what happened with the auction and how the trustee chose The Onion. The date of the hearing has not been set.",
      "Jones has been criticizing the sale process on his show and social media sites, calling it \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d",
      "Over the weekend, Collins posted a series of comments about the auction on X, formerly known as Twitter.",
      "\u201cLong and short of it: We won the bid and \u2014 you\u2019re not going to believe it \u2014 the previous InfoWars folks aren\u2019t taking it well,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Collins said last week that The Onion planned to turn the Infowars website into a parody site, taking aim at conspiracy theorists and other social media personalities while promoting gun violence prevention efforts.",
      "Cicack also said in Monday's court filing that the trustee improperly changed the auction process \u201cfrom a live auction to a secret process.\u201d Cicack said that after sealed bids were submitted Nov. 8, it was expected that there would be a round of live bidding on Nov. 13.",
      "But instead, he said, Murray decided to ask the two bidders to submit another offer as their final and best proposal, which they did. Murray then chose from those final bids without holding a round of live bidding. He alleged Murray violated the auction rules.",
      "Lopez's 20-page order on the sale procedures, issued in September, made such a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "Cicack called the Sandy Hook families' portion of The Onion's bid \u201cMonopoly\u201d money with no value.",
      "\u201cIt is also the product of impermissible collusion with the Onion in an effort to \u2018rig\u2019 the auction with the goal of achieving a specific result desired by the Connecticut Families,\u201d he wrote."

      "Authorities say only six monkeys are still on the loose after dozens escaped earlier this month from a South Carolina compound that breeds the primates for medical research",
      "YEMASSEE, S.C. -- Six monkeys were still on the loose early Monday after dozens escaped earlier this month from a South Carolina compound that breeds the primates for medical research, according to authorities.",
      "Two more Rhesus macaques were trapped Sunday outside the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, bringing the total of recovered monkeys to 37 of the 43 that escaped, Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by Yemassee Police in a social media post.",
      "Both monkeys recaptured Sunday were examined and were in \u201cexcellent condition,\u201d said Westergaard, who was present when they were recovered.",
      "\u201cI can attest with absolute certainty that their spirits were high and they showed all the outward signs of being happy well-adjusted monkeys,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very pleased that the animals recovered thus far are in such good condition, and that they show no ill effects from their outdoor adventure.\u201d",
      "All the monkeys taken back to the compound have been fed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and monkey biscuits, which are a high protein Purina Monkey Chow that is specially formulated for the rhesus macaques, Westergaard said.",
      "Two other monkeys were spotted near the traps Sunday afternoon and Alpha Genesis planned to begin trapping efforts before dawn Monday and continue through the day.",
      "Forty-three monkeys made a break for it Nov. 6 after an employee at what locals call \u201cthe monkey farm\u201d did not fully lock their enclosure, police said.",
      "There are three gates keeping the monkeys inside their containment area and a worker is supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure allowing the primates to escape, Westergaard told WCSC-TV last week.",
      "Westergaard said it appears the worker made a mistake and did not intentionally leave the gates where the monkeys could escape.",
      "\u201cMy understanding is that immediately after the incident occurred, the employee\u2019s supervisor approached her and stated that she could be terminated if it was determined that there was no structural failure which led to the escape,\u201d Westergaard told the TV station. \u201cI am told at that point the employee walked off the job and has not returned.\u201d",
      "Alpha Genesis has said efforts to recover all the monkeys will continue for as long as it takes at its compound about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "On Monday, a group called Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent another letter to federal officials asking for fines and further inspection of Alpha Genesis for animal mistreatment.",
      "The letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture said a monkey was found dead with its head stuck in a fence and a second strangled in gauze used to secure water bottles. The letter also details several earlier escapes, including one where a monkey had its arm ripped off and another had its arm broken by a tranquilizer dart.",
      "The incidents involved about 30 monkeys and happened in 2022 or earlier. The letter includes emails and other documents from Alpha Genesis given to the group by someone inside the company, wrote Michael Budkie, the group's executive director.",
      "\u201cThis is not animal care, this is neglect and abuse. Though these violations may be back a couple of years ... there is no reason to assume that such a broad set of violations will be totally remedied,\u201d Budkie wrote.",
      "Alpha Genesis did not return a phone call or email asking about the letter.",
      "The USDA has inspected the compound 10 times since 2020. The facility\u2019s most recent federal inspection in May showed there were about 6,700 primates on site and no issues and veterinarians found minor problems in only one of the facility\u2019s past six inspections.",
      "Humans have been using the monkeys for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe Rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "The monkeys pose no risk to public health, Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police have all said. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers.",
      "If people encounter the monkeys, they are advised to stay away from them \u2014 and to not fly drones in the area. The company said they are skittish and might run away from where they are gathered."

      "President-elect Donald Trump has named the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission as the new chairman of the agency tasked with regulating broadcasting, telecommunications and broadband",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday named Brendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission, as the new chairman of the agency tasked with regulating broadcasting, telecommunications and broadband.",
      "Carr is a longtime member of the commission and served previously as the FCC's general counsel. He has been unanimously confirmed by the Senate three times and was nominated by both Trump and President Joe Biden to the commission.",
      "The FCC is an independent agency that is overseen by Congress, but Trump has suggested he wanted to bring it under tighter White House control, in part to use the agency to punish TV networks that cover him in a way he doesn\u2019t like.",
      "Carr has of late embraced Trump's ideas about social media and tech. Carr wrote a section devoted to the FCC in \u201c Project 2025,\u201d a sweeping blueprint for gutting the federal workforce and dismantling federal agencies in a second Trump administration produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation.",
      "Trump has claimed he doesn\u2019t know anything about Project 2025, but many of its themes have aligned with his statements.",
      "Carr said in a statement congratulating Trump on his win that he believed \"the FCC will have an important role to play reining in Big Tech, ensuring that broadcasters operate in the public interest, and unleashing economic growth.\u201d",
      "\u201cCommissioner Carr is a warrior for Free Speech, and has fought against the regulatory Lawfare that has stifled Americans\u2019 Freedoms, and held back our Economy,\u201d Trump said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cHe will end the regulatory onslaught that has been crippling America\u2019s Job Creators and Innovators, and ensure that the FCC delivers for rural America.\u201d",
      "The five-person commission has a 3-2 Democratic majority until next year, when Trump gets to appoint a new member.",
      "Carr has made appearances on Fox News Channel, including when he slammed Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris \u2019 appearance on \u201c Saturday Night Live\u201d the weekend before the election -- charging that the network didn\u2019t offer equal time to Trump.",
      "Also a prolific writer of op-eds, Carr wrote in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last month decrying an FCC decision to revoke a federal award for Elon Musk\u2019s satellite service, Starlink. He said the move couldn\u2019t be explained \"by any objective application of the facts, the law or sound policy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn my view, it amounted to nothing more than regulatory lawfare against one of the left\u2019s top targets: Mr. Musk,\u201d Carr wrote."

    "summary": "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
    "story": [
      "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
      "NEW YORK -- As the International Rescue Committee copes with dramatic increases in displaced people in recent years, the refugee aid organization has looked for efficiencies wherever it can \u2014 including using artificial intelligence.",
      "Since 2015, the IRC has invested in Signpost \u2014 a portfolio of mobile apps and social media channels that answer questions in different languages for people in dangerous situations. The Signpost project, which includes many other organizations, has reached 18 million people so far, but IRC wants to significantly increase its reach by using AI tools \u2014 if they can do so safely.",
      "Conflict, climate emergencies and economic hardship have driven up demand for humanitarian assistance, with more than 117 million people forcibly displaced in 2024, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The turn to artificial intelligence technologies is in part driven by the massive gap between needs and resources.",
      "To meet its goal of reaching half of displaced people within three years, the IRC is testing a network of AI chatbots to see if they can increase the capacity of their humanitarian officers and the local organizations that directly serve people through Signpost. For now, the pilot project operates in El Salvador, Kenya, Greece and Italy and responds in 11 languages. It draws on a combination of large language models from some of the biggest technology companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic and Google.",
      "The chatbot response system also uses customer service software from Zendesk and receives other support from Google and Cisco Systems.",
      "If they decide the tools work, the IRC wants to extend the technical infrastructure to other nonprofit humanitarian organizations at no cost. They hope to create shared technology resources that less technically focused organizations could use without having to negotiate directly with tech companies or manage the risks of deployment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to really be clear about where the legitimate concerns are but lean into the optimism of the opportunities and not also allow the populations we serve to be left behind in solutions that have the potential to scale in a way that human to human or other technology can\u2019t,\" said Jeannie Annan, International Rescue Committee\u2019s Chief Research and Innovation Officer.",
      "The responses and information that Signpost chatbots deliver are vetted by local organizations to be up to date and sensitive to the precarious circumstances people could be in. An example query that IRC shared is of a woman from El Salvador traveling through Mexico to the United States with her son who is looking for shelter and for services for her child. The bot provides a list of providers in the area where she is.",
      "More complex or sensitive queries are escalated for humans to respond.",
      "The most important potential downside of these tools would be that they don't work. For example, what if the situation on the ground changes and the chatbot doesn\u2019t know? It could provide information that's not just wrong, but dangerous.",
      "A second issue is that these tools can amass a valuable honeypot of data about vulnerable people that hostile actors could target. What if a hacker succeeds in accessing data with personal information or if that data is accidentally shared with an oppressive government?",
      "IRC said it's agreed with the tech providers that none of their AI models will be trained on the data that the IRC, the local organizations or the people they are serving are generating. They've also worked to anonymize the data, including removing personal information and location.",
      "As part of the Signpost.AI project, IRC is also testing tools like a digital automated tutor and maps that can integrate many different types of data to help prepare for and respond to crises.",
      "Cathy Petrozzino, who works for the not-for-profit research and development company MITRE, said AI tools do have high potential, but also high risks. To use these tools responsibly, she said, organizations should ask themselves, does the technology work? Is it fair? Are data and privacy protected?",
      "She also emphasized that organizations need to convene a range of people to help govern and design the initiative \u2014 not just technical experts, but people with deep knowledge of the context, legal experts, and representatives from the groups that will use the tools.",
      "\u201cThere are many good models sitting in the AI graveyard,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they weren\u2019t worked out in conjunction and collaboration with the user community.\u201d",
      "For any system that has potentially life-changing impacts, Petrozzino said, groups should bring in outside experts to independently assess their methodologies. Designers of AI tools need to consider the other systems it will interact with, she said, and they need to plan to monitor the model over time.",
      "Consulting with displaced people or others that humanitarian organizations serve may increase the time and effort needed to design these tools, but not having their input raises many safety and ethical problems, said Helen McElhinney, executive director of CDAC Network. It can also unlock local knowledge.",
      "People receiving services from humanitarian organizations should be told if an AI model will analyze any information they hand over, she said, even if the intention is to help the organization respond better. That requires meaningful and informed consent, she said. They should also know if an AI model is making life-changing decisions about resource allocation and where accountability for those decisions lies, she said.",
      "Degan Ali, CEO of Adeso, a nonprofit in Somalia and Kenya, has long been an advocate for changing the power dynamics in international development to give more money and control to local organizations. She asked how IRC and others pursuing these technologies would overcome access issues, pointing to the week-long power outages caused by Hurricane Helene in the U.S. Chatbots won't help when there's no device, internet or electricity, she said.",
      "Ali also warned that few local organizations have the capacity to attend big humanitarian conferences where the ethics of AI are debated. Few have staff both senior enough and knowledgeable enough to really engage with these discussions, she said, though they understand the potential power and impact these technologies may have.",
      "\u201cWe must be extraordinarily careful not to replicate power imbalances and biases through technology,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThe most complex questions are always going to require local, contextual and lived experience to answer in a meaningful way.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A computer expert who stole bitcoin worth billions of dollars at current prices \u2014 and then spent years laundering some of the hacked cryptocurrency with help from his wife \u2014 was sentenced on Thursday to five years in prison.",
      "Ilya Lichtenstein masterminded one of the largest-ever thefts from a virtual currency exchange before he and his wife, Heather Rhiannon Morgan, carried out an elaborate scheme to liquidate the stolen funds, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly told Lichtenstein that his theft was \u201cmeticulously planned\u201d and not an impulsive act.",
      "\u201cIt's important to send a message that you can't commit these crimes with impunity, that there are consequences to them,\u201d she said.",
      "Lichtenstein, who gets credit for the two years and nine months that he has spent in jail since his February 2022 arrest, expressed remorse for \u201cwasting my talents on crime instead of a positive contribution to society.\u201d He said he hopes that he can apply his expertise to fight cybercrime when he gets out of prison.",
      "\u201cI want to take full responsibility for my actions and make amends any way I can,\u201d he said.",
      "The judge is scheduled to sentence Morgan on Monday. Lichtenstein pleaded with the judge to spare his wife from prison, blaming himself for her involvement.",
      "In August 2016, Lichtenstein hacked into a virtual currency exchange, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, and stole approximately 120,000 bitcoin. It was worth approximately $71 million at the time of the hack and would be valued at more than $7.6 billion at current market prices, according to prosecutors.",
      "Several months later, Lichtenstein began moving the stolen bitcoin in a string of complex transactions designed to conceal its path across a series of accounts and platforms. He enlisted his wife\u2019s help in cleaning the stolen funds.",
      "Lichtenstein, an entrepreneur and cryptocurrency investor, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Russia and grew up in a Chicago suburb. Morgan, a business owner and writer, adopted the alter ego \u201c Razzlekhan \u201d for performing rap songs and recording videos for her music.",
      "Lichtenstein and Morgan were living in New York City when they were arrested in February 2022. They had been living in San Francisco around the time of the hack.",
      "Prosecutors recommended a five-year prison sentence for Lichtenstein, who pleaded guilty in August 2023 to one count of money laundering conspiracy. They recommended an 18-month prison sentence for Morgan, who pleaded guilty to the same charge.",
      "\u201cNeither the hack nor the laundering scheme was an impulsive decision. The defendant (Lichtenstein) spent months attempting to gain access to Bitfinex\u2019s infrastructure and get the accesses and permissions he needed in order to orchestrate his hack,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Lichtenstein told his wife about the hack over three years later, but he initially solicited her help in laundering the proceeds \u201cwithout explaining exactly what he was doing,\u201d according to prosecutors.",
      "Morgan \u201cwas certainly a willing participant and bears full responsibility for her actions, but she was a lower-level participant,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "During family trips to Kazakhstan and Ukraine, Lichtenstein met with couriers who delivered him money that he smuggled back into the U.S.",
      "\u201cOver half a decade, the defendant engaged in what IRS agents described as the most complicated money laundering techniques they had seen to date,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, which is digital money that typically isn\u2019t backed by any government or banking institution. Transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "The couple successfully laundered about 21 percent of the funds stolen from Bitfinex. The laundered money was worth at least $14 million at 2016 prices. Its value would have exceeded $1 billion at the time of their 2022 arrest.",
      "Authorities seized the remaining funds, collectively valued at over $6 billion at current prices.",
      "\u201cHe became one of the greatest money launderers that the government has encountered in the cryptocurrency space,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "An attorney for Bitfinex said the hack \u201cdevastated\u201d its finances and its reputation with its customers, with the stolen funds accounting for approximately 36% of the company's assets at the time of theft.",
      "\u201cBitfinex had to take unprecedented and immediate action to ensure that any losses from the Hack would ultimately be borne by Bitfinex and its shareholders alone, not its customers,\u201d the lawyer, Barry Berke, wrote in a letter to the judge.",
      "A prosecutor said Lichtenstein immediately began cooperating with federal authorities after his arrest, helping them with other cybercrime investigations.",
      "Over 96% of the stolen funds have been recovered, with help from Lichtenstein, according to defense attorney Samson Enzer. The \u201cvast bulk\u201d of the stolen money was never spent, the lawyer said.",

      "Momeni testified Lee, 43, suddenly pulled a knife on him after he cracked a \u201cbad joke\u201d suggesting Lee should spend his last night in the city with family instead of trying to visit a strip club. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",
      "His testimony stunned Lee's father, brother and ex-wife, who have been a steadfast presence in the criminal trial. They say Lee was big-hearted and gentle, and close to his two children and ex-wife.",
      "\u201cWhat you have seen is Nima be aggressive on the stand, you\u2019ve seen him just trying to take control of this room, his arrogance and his entitlement are on full display here,\u201d said the victim's brother, Timothy Oliver Lee, speaking with reporters outside the court room Thursday.",
      "\u201cThis is insane,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of this is ridiculous.\u201d",
      "The trial is in its fifth week. Momeni faces 26 years to life if convicted.",
      "Lee\u2019s death stunned the tech community as fellow executives and engineers penned tributes to the charismatic entrepreneur\u2019s generosity and brilliance. He was chief product officer of cryptocurrency platform MobileCoin when he died.",
      "Prosecutors say Momeni planned the April 4 attack after a dispute over his younger sister, Khazar Momeni, with whom Lee was friends. Momeni had picked up his sister from the home of a drug dealer introduced to her by Lee, and she said she may have been sexually assaulted after ingesting a date-rape drug called GHB.",
      "They say Momeni was angry with Lee so he took a knife from his sister\u2019s condo, and after the pair was kicked out of her place at 2 a.m., he drove Lee to a secluded area and stabbed him three times and then fled.",
      "Omid Talai, the assistant district attorney, grilled Momeni on Thursday on details of exactly how the attack unfolded. He asked Momeni why he did not call police after the attack and learning Lee had died, and why he did not respond to his sister's text asking where he had dropped off Lee.",
      "Momeni said he did not learn of Lee\u2019s death until the following day and was puzzled by his sister\u2019s query. He said he thought Lee could have been stabbed by someone else shortly after he saw him walk off, unharmed.",
      "In response to questions, Momeni said he didn't know what the prosecutor was getting at, accused him of misrepresenting his statements and said he had already answered.",
      "At one point, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Alexandra Gordon said that the prosecutor had no obligation to provide him with a printout of the texts he was questioning him about or to put them on the multimedia screen.",
      "\u201cGotcha,\u201d said Momeni, dressed in a blue suit and tie. \u201cThank you for clarifying.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have video showing Lee and Momeni leaving Khazar Momeni's condo after 2 a.m. and driving off together in Momeni\u2019s BMW. Video also shows the two men getting out of the car in an isolated spot by the Bay Bridge.",
      "Prosecutors say that is where Momeni stabbed Lee, while the defense says that is where Lee attacked Momeni, erratic and aggressive from a multi-day bender of cocaine, ketamine and drinking.",
      "A knife recovered from the area where Lee was stabbed showed Momeni's DNA on the handle, but the defense said the handle should have been tested for fingerprints, namely Lee\u2019s.",
      "Momeni said he and Lee were on friendly terms when they left his sister's condo, but prosecutors say the defendant grilled the entrepreneur earlier in the evening about what might have happened to his sister at the drug dealer's apartment.",
      "The prosecutor pointed out multiple times Thursday that Momeni was questioning him the way he grilled Lee.",
      "Nima Momeni was 14 when his mother, Mahnaz Tayarani, took him and Khazar to the U.S., fleeing Iran and a husband who had inflicted years of abuse and violence on the family, she wrote in a letter submitted to the court in support of her son\u2019s pre-trial release.",
      "She has sat on one side of the courtroom while Lee's family members sit on the other."

      "For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven\u2019t lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven't lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday.",
      "At the United Nations climate talks, hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, nations are trying to set new targets to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task.",
      "But Earth remains on a path to be 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists and analysts who study government policies and translate that into projections of warming.",
      "If emissions are still rising and temperature projections are no longer dropping, people should wonder if the United Nations climate negotiations \u2014 known as COP \u2014 are doing any good, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot going on that\u2019s positive here, but on the big picture of actually getting stuff done to reduce emissions ... to me it feels broken,\u201d Hare said.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris. Climate scientists say the atmospheric warming, mainly from human burning of fossil fuels, is causing ever more extreme and damaging weather including droughts, flooding and dangerous heat.",
      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",
      "\u201cThis is driven highly by China,\u201d said Sofia Gonzales-Zuniga of Climate Analytics. Even though China's fast-rising emissions are starting to plateau, they are peaking higher than anticipated, she said.",
      "Another upcoming factor not yet in the calculations is the U.S. elections. A Trump administration that rolls back the climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and carries out the conservative blueprint Project 2025, would add 0.04 degree Celsius (0.07 Fahrenheit) to warming projections, Gonzales-Zuniga said. That's not much, but it could be more if other nations use it as an excuse to do less, she said.",
      "\u201cFossil fuels and emissions are not peaking,\u201d said Sherry Rehman, chair of climate and environment committee in Pakistan\u2019s senate. After 29 years of climate talks, Rehman said countries are \u201cstill talking in bumper stickers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need a transformative solution. We need strong delivery,\u201d Rehman said.",
      "The major battle in Baku is over how much rich nations will pay for developing countries to decarbonize their energy systems, cope with future harms of climate change and pay for damage from warming's extreme weather.",
      "A special independent group of experts commissioned by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued its own estimate of costs and finances on Thursday, calling for a tripling of the old commitment. It said about $1 trillion a year is needed by developing nations from all outside sources, not just government grants.",
      "\u201cAdvanced economies need to demonstrate a credible commitment\u201d to helping poor nations, the report said.",
      "Negotiations on a grand total and structuring the overall amount have taken \u201ca step back\u201d when a draft of just a few pages that was worked on for a year was rejected and the latest proposal with many options has more than 30 pages, said top European negotiator Veronika Bagi of Hungary. European Commission negotiator Jacob Werksman said there\u2019s a \u201cvery significant gap\u2033 between what rich and poor nations propose.",
      "German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said \u201cprivate investment has to be brought to the table\u201d in order to fulfill developing countries needs. But Mariana Paoli of Christian Aid said any number that comes out of negotiations that's not based in publicly-financed grants \u201cwill be meaningless.\u201d",
      "Relying on the private sector means climate cash will not be \u201cneeds based, it will be profit-driven,\" she said, adding that crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and bank bailouts proves that public funds are available.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about fairness, it\u2019s about justice,\u201d she said.",
      "Getting climate cash is personal for many activists from vulnerable nations, like Sandra Leticia Guzman Luna, who is from Mexico and the director of the climate finance group for Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cWe are observing the climate impacts causing a lot of costs, not only economic costs but also human losses,\u201d she said.",
      "Argentina withdrew from the climate talks on Wednesday on the orders of its president, climate skeptic Javier Milei. The Argentine government did not respond to requests from The Associated Press for comment.",
      "Climate activists called the decision regrettable.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand how a climate-vulnerable country like Argentina would cut itself from critical support,\" said Anabella Rosemberg, an Argentina native who works as a senior adviser at Climate Action Network International.",
      "Also Wednesday, France's environment minister, who was set to lead the delegation, pulled out of the talks after Azerbaijan president Ilham Aliyev called out France and the Netherlands for their colonial histories.",
      "Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher called Aliyev\u2019s remarks on France and Europe \u201cunacceptable.\" Speaking at the French Senate on Wednesday, Pannier-Runacher criticized Azerbaijan\u2019s leader for using the fight against climate change \u201cfor a shameful personal agenda.\u201d",

      "Removing certain items, earnings were $1.14 per share. This topped the $1.09 per share that analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research were looking for.",
      "Shares jumped more than 9% before the market open on Thursday.",

      "Operating income for the entertainment segment, which includes its movie studio and parts of its television wing, more than quadrupled to $1.07 billion.",

      "The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday that its direct-to-consumer business, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, reported quarterly operating income of $253 million compared with an operating loss of $420 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 15% to $5.78 billion.",
      "The combined streaming businesses, which includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, achieved profitability for the first time in the third quarter.",

      "Iger was confident about the future of Disney's streaming platform on the company's conference call, noting that whenever Disney has success with a movie, or there's expected success for a movie, like with \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d the viewership for previous films, like \u201cInside Out\u201d and \u201cDeadpool,\u201d spikes significantly on its streaming service.

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 19:01:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A look at how Trump can upend the federal government, including \"deleting\" agencies and ousting workers he sees as unloyal.",
    "story": [
      "With more Trump-appointed judges in the courts, legal challenges could fail.",
      "President Donald Trump's picks to lead the next administration are talking about abolishing entire agencies and firing tens of thousands of federal workers at a time.",
      "But can he and they actually do all that?",
      "Experts believe Trump can get much further on upending the government system this go-around compared to his first term -- in part because the typical checks and balances are expected to lean in his favor.",
      "Next year, the House and Senate are on track to fall under Republican control. Trump also got 226 federal judges and three Supreme Court justices confirmed while he was in office last time -- giving his ideas a sympathetic ear in the courts when he gets sued.",
      "With that in mind, here's a look at how Trump could try to \"break\" the federal government:",
      "Elon Musk, who Trump has picked to co-lead the new outside-of-government \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" has said he wants to cut $2 trillion of the $7 trillion in annual federal spending. His partner, Vivek Ramaswamy, told Fox News that they would achieve this through \"mass reductions\" and that some governmental agencies may be \"deleted outright.\"",
      "The idea seems far-fetched at first because federal agencies are established by federal law. The Department of Education, for example, was created by a 1979 passed by Congress signed by President Jimmy Carter.",
      "Congress would need to pass new legislation to erase or significantly reform the Education Department -- an uphill battle even with a Republican-led Congress.",
      "Enter the 1974 Impoundment Control Act. For much of the country's existence, presidents could, in theory, ignore spending money appropriated by Congress.",
      "President Richard Nixon used the tactic of sitting on -- or impounding -- federal money, essentially leaving funds untouched in U.S. Treasury accounts when he thought the spending was wasteful.",
      "Democrats responded in 1974 by passing a law that requires a president to spend federal money the way Congress intended.",
      "In a campaign video posted last year, Trump said he would challenge the Impoundment Control Act. It's possible too that he could deem the law unconstitutional and try to ignore it -- inviting legal challenges that could take years to resolve.",
      "\"For 200 years under our system of government, it was undisputed that the president had the constitutional power to stop unnecessary spending through what is known as impoundment,\" Trump said in a video during the GOP primaries.",
      "He later added: \"When I returned to the White House, I will do everything I can to challenge the Impoundment Control Act in court, and, if necessary, get Congress to overturn it.\"",
      "Among the ideas Trump is expected to try again this term is to make the lives of some federal workers uncomfortable or to relocate their jobs to remote locations.",
      "In his first administration, Trump temporarily decimated the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management by relocating its Washington headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado. The idea, officials said at the time, was to put leadership closer to the lands and resources they manage. But the vast majority of the workers quit and the office never was able to find employees to replace them.",
      "Another tactic could be to make it harder for workers to file grievances or strip them of legal protections.",
      "In fall of 2020, during the final months of Trump's first administration, he issued an executive order that would have created a new class of employees handling policy-related duties, essentially stripping them from legal protections that kept them in their jobs.",
      "The idea of Schedule F came too late in Trump's first administration to have a significant impact, but it's one expected to be pushed early on this time.",
      "The tactic is risky to taxpayers in the long term. While lawsuits and complaints by federal workers could take years to resolve, the federal government could owe back pay to workers who can prove they were wrongfully terminated.",
      "\"Taking a hatchet to this stuff will have an impact today and for decades to come,\" said Andrew Huddleston, communications director of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal employees that opposed Trump's election.",
      "\"It will be the future generations that pay the price,\" he said.",
      "In order to remake the government, Trump will need to install loyal allies across senior levels of the government and find ways to slow down legal challenges.",
      "Among his proposals is to outsource FBI background checks for appointees to private investigators, a tactic that would enable him to hire people close to him even if there are security flags.",
      "Trump also has called for the use of \"recess appointments\" in the Senate, a common move by past presidents. For Trump though, it could enable his allies to ram through nominations without FBI security checks or financial disclosures so long as the chamber is adjourned for 10 days or longer. Sen. John Thune, the GOP's pick as majority leader, said he hasn't ruled out the idea, even though it would mean ceding the Senate's \"advise and consent\" constitutional confirmation power to the president.",
      "Another Trump tactic for forcing change could be developing his biggest plans in secret, making it harder for opponents to object and mount legal challenges.",
      "Ramaswamy said the new 'Department of Government Efficiency', or DOGE, will operate outside of government as a kind of private advisory group. That means its staff won't be required to submit financial disclosures or report conflicts of interest.",
      "It won't be clear who is doing work for DOGE or how decisions are made. And while Musk has said he wants staff to work for free, it's likely industry lobbyists would eagerly sign up if it means being able to influence how future taxpayer money is spent.",
      "Musk, who owns the rocket company SpaceX, has blamed federal regulations slowing his quest to reach Mars and oversees billions in contracts with the federal government, including military satellites. Ramaswamy founded the biotech firm Roivant Sciences and remains a stakeholder who also could benefit financially depending upon how future federal regulations are written.",
      "At last week's gala hosted by the America First Policy Institute, Trump said Musk and Ramaswamy make the perfect pair to shake up the government.",
      "\"We're going to reduce regulation, waste, fraud, and inefficiency, and these two guys are going to find a lot of it,\" Trump said.",

      "\"The People deeply respect the Office of the President, are mindful of the demands and obligations of the presidency, and acknowledge that Defendant's inauguration will raise unprecedented legal questions. We also deeply respect the fundamental role of the jury in our constitutional system,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Defense lawyers argued that, while Trump is not yet president, presidential immunity equally applies during the transition process and added that their appeal of the case would \"take a year or more\" and possibly reach the Supreme Court, dragging the case well past Inauguration Day.",
      "\"There is no material difference between President Trump's current status after his overwhelming victory in the national election and that of a sitting President following inauguration,\" their filing said.",
      "Judge Merchan will have the final say regarding the next steps in the case.",
      "Since July, Trump's attorneys have been pushing to have the conviction vacated and the case dismissed by arguing that prosecutors filled \"glaring holes in their case\" with evidence of official acts that the Supreme Court recently ruled off limits in its landmark presidential immunity decision.",
      "Trump's lawyers have also argued for a dismissal by citing the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, which urges government officers to take \"lawful steps to avoid or minimize disruptions\" to the presidential transition.",
      "Prosecutors have argued that the Supreme Court's ruling that Trump is entitled to immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts undertaken while in office has no bearing on Trump's conviction.",
      "\"The People agree that these are unprecedented circumstances,\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told the court last week.",
      "Trump was convicted in May of all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels to silence allegations about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election.",
      "His conviction carries a maximum penalty of up to four years in prison, but first-time offenders would normally receive a lesser sentence.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 18:17:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Senate Democrats are expected to dedicate hours of floor time in coming weeks as a last-minute effort to confirm President Joe Biden's nominees to the federal judiciary.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats are expected to work to confirm Biden's nominees.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday called for a halt in confirming President Joe Biden's nominees to the federal judiciary until he takes office, accusing Democrats of \"trying to stack the courts.\"",
      "\"The Democrats are trying to stack the Courts with Radical Left Judges on their way out the door,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, urging Republican senators to \"show up and hold the line.\"",
      "\"No more Judges confirmed before Inauguration Day!\" Trump wrote.",
      "The White House responded to Trump's post, arguing that \"there is no excuse for choosing partisanship over enforcing the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Regardless of party, the American people expect their leaders to fight for the rule of law and to ensure the criminal justice system can function effectively in every state,\" White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement. \"Delaying the confirmation of highly qualified, experienced judges takes a real-life toll on constituents and leads to backlogs of criminal cases -- meaning Senator Thune was correct in 2020 when he said senators have every urgent reason for Republicans and Democrats to continue working together in good faith to staff the federal bench.\"",
      "Bates said during the lame-duck period of Trump's first term in 2020, the then-GOP-led Senate confirmed 55 nominee, including 18 judges.",
      "The directive from the president-elect comes as Senate Democrats are expected to dedicate hours of floor time in the coming weeks as part of a last-minute effort to confirm as many of Biden's nominees before Trump takes over in January. Senate Republicans thwarted their efforts late Monday night, a plan from their soon-to-be leader Sen. John Thune and a reversal from his previous stance on blocking confirmations of qualified judicial nominees.",
      "Senate Republicans rebelled late Monday night, dragging out the floor process by forcing Democrats to hold time-consuming votes on procedural motions that are usually routine and otherwise mundane. Actions that should have taken minutes on the floor instead took hours.",
      "Thune, who takes over as Republican leader of the Senate in January, took credit for the rebellion, saying in a statement that Republicans would not \"roll over\" to appoint Biden's nominees to the federal bench in the \"final weeks of the Democrat majority.\"",
      "\"If Sen. Schumer thought Senate Republicans would just roll over and allow him to quickly confirm multiple Biden-appointed judges to lifetime jobs in the final weeks of the Democrat majority, he thought wrong,\" Thune said in a statement to ABC News.",
      "Thune's statement vowing to obstruct the judicial confirmation process in the final hours of the Biden presidency is a departure from comments he made just a few years ago toward the end of Trump's administration. At the time, Thune touted the importance of confirming judges to the bench, saying it was \"one of our most important responsibilities as senators\" and one of the main reasons he ran for the Senate.",
      "\"Mr. President, confirming good judges is one of our most important responsibilities as senators. And it's a responsibility I take very seriously,\" Thune said during a floor speech on Nov. 18 2020 -- after Biden won the election.",
      "\"After George W. Bush's election, Democrats decided that the president's judicial nominees might not deliver the results Democrats wanted. And so, they decided to adopt a new strategy -- blocking judicial nominees on a regular basis,\" Thune said during his remarks in 2020. \"I was one of the many Americans upset by the blockade of talented, well-qualified nominees. And it was one of the main reasons I ran for the Senate. I promised South Dakotans that if they elected me, I would help put outstanding judges on the bench.\"",
      "\"In fact, one of the main reasons I was first elected to the Senate was to make sure outstanding judicial nominees were confirmed to the federal bench. It's hard to imagine now, but confirming judges used to be a pretty bipartisan affair,\" Thune said at the time.",
      "His comments from 2020 are a notable reversal from his comments this week, as Senate Republicans look to obstruct Democrats as they attempt to do the same for Biden.",
      "Schumer though, doubled down on his efforts Tuesday, and said he expects the Senate to work late into the night again this Wednesday to get the nominees through. Senate Democrats are hoping to confirm as many judges to lifetime appointments as they can while Biden is still president.",
      "\"Members should be prepared for another late night on Wednesday to vote on the nominations I filed last night,\" Schumer warned.",
      "\"Voting on the president's judicial nominees is a core function of the Senate. It's one of our basic responsibilities, and we're going to carry out that responsibility as long as this majority continues. I'm very proud of the judges we've confirmed over the past four years under this administration, they have all been highly qualified individuals, and together, they represent a wide range of experiences and areas of expertise.\"",
      "Schumer touted the quality of judges the Senate has passed under his leadership, noting their many backgrounds and cultures and identities. He said under his watch, the Senate has confirmed a record number of women and people of color to the federal bench.",
      "Republicans have Democrats' record on judicial confirmations beat.",
      "Republicans confirmed 234 of Trump's nominees to the federal courts during his four years in office, and so far the Democrat-controlled Senate has confirmed 216 under Biden's administration.",
      "\"We're not done,\" Schumer said on the floor Tuesday. \"There are more judges to consider and confirm.\"",
      "Schumer vowed to spend the rest of the week -- and the year -- confirming more judges. Every judge confirmed in this lame-duck session of Congress is one fewer vacancy Trump can fill come January.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 09:53:02 -0500",
    "summary": "The United States has seen a significant increase in the use of clean energy over the last few years; however, Chris Wright has claimed otherwise.",
    "story": [
      "\"There is no climate crisis,\" Wright said in 2023.",
      "The United States has seen a significant increase in the use of clean energy over the last few years; however, Chris Wright, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has claimed otherwise.",
      "Wright, chief executive of Liberty Energy -- the world\u2019s second-largest fracking services company -- has made several comments chastising efforts to fight climate change. One example is a video he posted to LinkedIn last year in which he denies the existence of a climate crisis and disputes a global transition to green energy.",
      "\"There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,\" Wright said.",
      "Wright has been an outspoken critic of policies aimed at curbing climate change, including the Department of Energy's goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.",
      "While Wright does not dispute the existence of climate change, he has argued that policies aimed at reducing the impact of climate change are misguided and alarmist, claiming that any negative impacts of climate change are \"clearly overwhelmed by the benefits of increasing energy consumption.\"",
      "But the IPCC, the world\u2019s most authoritative body on climate change, has stated that human-amplified climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe, and this has led to widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people.",
      "And the clean energy momentum the country is experiencing will continue as alternative sources of fuel take more market share in the energy sector, experts told ABC News. That's despite efforts by Republican politicians to bolster the fossil fuel industry in the U.S.",
      "The Department of Energy's website even states, \"A clean energy revolution is taking place across America, underscored by the steady expansion of the U.S. renewable energy sector.\"",
      "And the world now invests almost twice as much in clean energy as it does in fossil fuels. Investment in solar panels now surpasses all other generation technologies combined, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "\"The U.S. is definitely in an energy transition, as is the rest of the globe,\" Lori Bird, U.S. energy program director at the World Resource Institute, told ABC News.",
      "Coal is one of the industries in which the energy transition is most apparent, Bird said.",
      "Coal plants are seeing an average of 10,000 megawatts of capacity closures per year, according to the Institute for the Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Installed U.S. coal-fired generation capacity peaked in 2011 at 317,600 megawatts and has experienced a consistent downward trend ever since, the analysis found. In 2020, during the pandemic, coal\u2019s share of power generation in the U.S. fell below 20% for the first time. In 2024 so far, coal's share of power generation barely topped 16%.",
      "\"Based on current announcements and IEEFA research, we expect operating coal capacity to continue its steady decline for the remainder of the decade,\" the report states.",
      "Accompanying the sharp decrease in coal generation and usage has been the increase in capacity and storage for electricity generation from solar, wind and battery power, Bird said.",
      "A record 31 gigawatts of solar energy capacity was installed in the U.S. in 2023 -- roughly a 55% increase from 2022, according to a report by the World Resource Institute that found that clean energy continues to be the dominant form of new electricity generation in the U.S.",
      "\"Everywhere you look, in every facet of the economy, there are clean technologies ramping up and being brought to bear,\" Julie McNamara, senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told ABC News.",
      "In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act stimulated an \"unprecedented\" slate for the creation of domestic clean energy manufacturing facilities, the report found. Since August 2022, 113 manufacturing facilities or expansions, totaling $421 billion in investments, have been announced, according to American Clean Power.",
      "The Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that came before it includes tax credits for both the home and commercial installation of charging stations for electric vehicles, evidence in the growing market share for EVs, which reached 10% in U.S. automotive sales in the third quarter of 2024, Bird said.",
      "But the federal government isn't the ultimate decider of the energy transition in the U.S., Bird said. While there could be a slowdown in progress during the next administration, the energy transition will continue to be driven by other stakeholders \"who want this to happen,\" she said.",
      "\"It would be impossible to halt the energy transition at this stage,\" Bird said.",
      "States in the U.S. are also continuing to pass ambitious climate and energy policies, a trend experts expect to continue despite who is living in the White House. State actions are considered critical to ensuring a successful clean energy transition, as federal actions alone are insufficient, according to the WRI. There are 29 states that have renewable electricity standards or clean energy standards in place, and a third of U.S. states have have standards to shift to 100% clean electricity, Bird said.",
      "At the beginning of 2023, Minnesota adopted a 100% clean energy standard, while Michigan did the same later that year, joining states like California and New York in passing permitting reforms intended to make it easier to build clean energy and transmission.",
      "\"While the federal leadership may slow some of this transition, it's being driven by states,\" Bird said.",
      "Another critical piece of the energy transition is tech companies, which are very large users of energy. committing to using sustainable energy to power their data centers, Bird said. One example is Microsoft paying to restart one of the nuclear reactors at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania to power the company's AI data center.",
      "\"Those companies that are driving a lot of this want clean energy,\" Bird said. \"That's not going to go away. They're committed.\"",
      "Throughout the 2024 election, Republicans stuck to party lines when it comes to rhetoric about the fossil fuel industry, which invests heavily into GOP politicians and candidates, David Konisky, a professor of environmental politics at Indiana University's O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, told ABC News in August. The rhetoric often includes misrepresentations on clean energy solutions rather than all-out climate denial, experts told ABC News.",
      "The fossil fuel industry, through its lobbying in government, has attempted to slow any efforts at the energy transition, McNamara said.",
      "\"The only reason to say there's no energy transition underway is to attempt to solidify policies and incentives that that anchor short-term profits for fossil fuel interests,\" McNamara said.",
      "Misinformation and disinformation about the climate crisis is \"not helpful to the situation,\" especially given that people all over the world are already experiencing the impacts of a warming climate in the form of extreme weather events, Bird said, adding that bipartisan support will be crucial going forward.",
      "\"We're hopeful that with the new administration, that additional progress could be made,\" Bird said.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 10:21:45 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has proposed a plan to eliminate the Department of Education to \u201csend all education work and needs back to the States.\"",
    "story": [
      "The DOE collects education data and funds schools nationwide.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has proposed a plan to eliminate the Department of Education to \u201csend all education work and needs back to the states,\u201d according to his Agenda47 policy platform.",
      "According to education experts, an end to the Department of Education could leave billions of funds, scholarships, grants and more hanging in the balance for the millions of K-12 and college students attending schools in the U.S.",
      "Critics of the department argue that federal education spending has ballooned since its founding -- costing $23 billion to date in the 2025 fiscal year, about 4% of government spending so far -- but measures of student success like reading and math scores have fallen in recent years.",
      "What does the Department of Education do?",
      "The DOE was established as a Cabinet-level agency in 1979 under then-President Jimmy Carter, but was initially created in the late 1800s to collect data on what is working effectively in education for policymakers and educators.",
      "The education agency facilitated the expansion of federal support for schooling over the years. After World War II, the GI Bill expanded education assistance for war veterans. After the Soviet Union launched Sputnik into space, the agency led to the expansion of science, math and foreign language instruction in elementary and secondary schools and supported vocational-technical training.",
      "In the 1960s and 1970s, anti-poverty and anti-discrimination efforts shaped the Department of Education\u2019s mission to provide equal access to education nationwide. This led to the founding of Title I funding to reduce educational achievement gaps between low-income and rural students and non-low-income schools.",
      "The DOE also holds schools accountable for enforcing non-discrimination laws like Title IX based on gender, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Americans with Disabilities Act based on disability and Title VI based on race.",
      "Federal Student Aid, awarding more than $120 billion a year in grants, work-study funds, and low-interest loans to approximately 13 million students, is also backed by the Department of Education.",
      "The Department also holds schools accountable under the Every Student Succeeds Act, which requires each state to provide data on subject performance, graduation rates, suspensions, absenteeism, teacher qualifications, and more.",
      "The department states on its website that it does not develop school curricula, set requirements for enrollment and graduation, or establish or accredit schools or universities.",
      "However, it has played a major role in school funding for decades, particularly as state investment in K-12 schools worsened amid the 2008 Great Recession.",
      "According to the Education Law Center, U.S. students lost almost $600 billion from states' disinvestment in their public schools in the decade following the Great Recession.",
      "The complicated nature of a department closure includes administering the billions of DOE funds directly to the individual states, according to higher education expert Clare McCann. McCann said doling out the money is something skilled employees at the DOE would be equipped to do.",
      "\u201cThere's a reason the Department of Education was created and it was to have this kind of in-house expertise and policy background on these [education] issues,\u201d McCann told ABC News, adding, \u201cThe civil servants who work at the Department of Education are true experts in the field.\u201d",
      "Education Analyst Neal McCluskey at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, argues that dismantling the department could be as simple as giving states the funding, but allowing them to decide how it's administered.",
      "\"What I've seen most often, and I've written about myself, is you could, for instance, take all the K-12 money, Title One, IDEA [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act] etc. -- You would, of course, have to change the law, but one of the things you could do is block grant it; You'd say, 'we're going to fund these things, but we're going to give it to the state so they can decide how it's administered,'\" he told ABC News.",
      "Some education experts like Wendy A. Paterson, a professor and dean at Buffalo State University's School of Education, told ABC News in an interview that she \"could not see how serving families and children under the offices of the Department of Education could continue\" without a federal department.",
      "Paterson said that if funding itself is changed, it will likely worsen the national teacher shortage and impact the targeted communities the Department of Education specializes in -- including low-income, disabled or FAFSA-seeking students.",
      "\"There's an intimate relationship between our schools and the society that we create and that we pass along to our children, and it's that important,\" said Paterson. \"So if we don't have a federal organization that acknowledges the importance of schools and post-secondary education and the right of all children to have access to education, what are we saying about democracy?\"",
      "Why does Trump want to get rid of the Department of Education?",
      "In a 2023 statement on his plans for schools, Donald Trump said that \u201cone thing I\u2019ll be doing very early in the administration is closing up the Department of Education in Washington, D.C., and sending all education and education work and needs back to the states.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe want them to run the education of our children because they'll do a much better job of it,\u201d said Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s Agenda47 does not state how the dismantling of the department would impact the programs the Department of Education runs.",
      "However, on the campaign trail, in interviews with Elon Musk and on \"Fox & Friends,\" Trump has repeatedly said he wants to shutter the agency and instead choose one education department official for his Cabinet, aligning with Trump's goals of dismantling \"government bureaucracy\" and restructuring the government agencies for more efficiency.",
      "Several prominent conservatives and Republican figures have similarly proposed department closures over the years, including Ronald Reagan, Vivek Ramaswamy, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill.",
      "McCluskey said in a recent essay that the department is \"unconstitutional,\" arguing that it exerts too much power over schools above local and state entities.",
      "House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx has also argued that it's not a constitutional requirement to have such a department: \u201cI can't find the word education in there [the Constitution] as one of the duties and responsibilities of Congress or the federal government,\u201d Rep. Foxx, R-North Carolina, told ABC News.",
      "Is it possible to eliminate it?",
      "While possible in theory, education policy experts who spoke with ABC News suggest that would be an extremely chaotic \u2013 and unrealistic \u2014 task on Jan. 20, 2025, Inauguration Day.",
      "The bold initiative won\u2019t happen immediately, but McCluskey told ABC News it could be done through Congress.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Education was created through legislation,\u201d McCluskey told ABC News. \u201cLegislation comes through Congress. If you want to take the Department of Education apart, you have to do that through legislation,\u201d McCluskey added.",
      "At this point, without congressional approval, McCluskey said the campaign trail messaging by the president-elect has no standing.",
      "\u201cI think that what is said on the campaigns and what actually is done have to often be two different things because, in campaigns, politicians say a lot of things that make it seem like it's easy to do what they want to do,\u201d McCluskey said.",
      "\u201cNo president can just fire everybody in the Department of Education and have one person administer those programs,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump's education policy",
      "Trump, however, does list several federal policies he hopes to implement in schools nationwide. This includes instructing a future education department to cease programs that he claims \"promote the concept of sex and gender transition, at any age\" as well as punish teachers or schools who do so.",
      "He hopes to create a credentialing body to certify teachers \"who embrace patriotic values and support the American way of life,\" though he does not further elaborate on what that consists of.",
      "He also would prevent Title IX from allowing transgender women to compete in sports. He said he will create funding preferences and favorable treatment for states and school districts that abolish teacher tenure and adopt merit pay for educators for grades K-12 and allow parents to vote for principals.",

      "Republican lawmakers on Tuesday grilled FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell on her agency's handling of hurricane recovery efforts, including about allegations of political bias.",
      "The two House hearings over seven hours came after FEMA supervisor Marn'i Washington was fired after allegedly directing employees to avoid homes with President-elect Donald Trump campaign signs.",
      "Criswell repeatedly told lawmakers the incident was an isolated act and that FEMA is continuing its investigation, with no additional incidents found beyond Washington's actions.",
      "However, after being asked to launch an inspector general investigation, Criswell said she had formally requested additional assistance.",
      "In the aftermath of Washington's firing, an unidentified FEMA employee claimed the directive came from a superior. Chriswell told lawmakers that, although her agency has questioned other personnel, no evidence has emerged to corroborate the claim.",
      "During the House Oversight Committee hearing, GOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio asked Criswell if Washington was lying when she told journalist Roland Martin on #RolandMartinUnfiltered that it was common practice to avoid \"politically hostile\" homes.",
      "Jordan noted that Criswell had stated that the actions were \"reprehensible\" and \"isolated.\"",
      "\"You said it's reprehensible and isolated. Both statements can't be true, so someone's not giving us the facts, and I'm trying to figure out who's not telling the truth.\" Jordan said.",
      "\"The actions that Miss Washington took were unacceptable,\" Criswell responded.",
      "With regard to Washington's reported claim that her directive was for safety reasons, Criswell said safety training for FEMA workers is all about reacting to perceived threats. \"Never has it been directed to be proactive or to avoid a situation.\"",
      "Jordan cited another anonymous FEMA employee who alleged that Washington received \"very clear guidance from her supervisors.\" Asked if that person was also lying, Criswell maintained the matter was under investigation.",
      "\"FEMA's mission is to help all people,\" Chriswell stated.",
      "During Jordan's questioning, he showed text messages of FEMA employees being told to implement best practices while reaching out to victims. The suggestions included avoiding high-salt diets and coffee, not going anywhere alone, and \"avoid homes advertising Trump.\"",
      "\"We do have the text message itself, but you're still saying, Miss Washington and this other person aren't telling the truth?\" Jordan pressed.",
      "\"Even though it said all those practical things, the part about avoiding Trump homes, that's not a best practice, that's not commonplace, is that what you're saying?\" Jordan asked.",
      "\"That is nowhere in our policy,\" Criswell refuted.",
      "Criswell told lawmakers she had requested an inspector general investigation into the incident and reassured them there would be no cover-up or obstruction.",
      "When asked if she had spoken to the 13 people included on the text message, Criswell said she had not.",
      "\"This is part of a mindset that's in government. This is the scary part, because I think it's broader,\" Jordan said.",
      "The FEMA administrator told lawmakers that the incident occurred in late October, and came to her attention on Nov. 7, she requested additional information and by Nov. 9, she recommended Washington's termination.",
      "When pressed if the incident was part of a larger issue of political bias at FEMA, she told lawmakers, \"I do not believe there is a widespread cultural problem.\"",
      "House Oversight Chairman James Comer reported that a FEMA contractor in Georgia allegedly told an elderly veteran to remove Trump campaign materials or risk losing assistance. The family complied out of fear, Comer said, adding, \"FEMA has not returned to their residence.\"",
      "The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, requested more information about the incident.",
      "Democratic Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico, a former government employee of the Office of Management and Budget, expressed disbelief about her GOP colleagues, saying, \"I just find it bizarre that we're even having this hearing.\"",
      "While acknowledging that Washington's actions were \"totally unacceptable,\" she pointed out that the president-elect had \"deliberately and outspokenly withheld aid from his political rivals -- from the state of California, from Puerto Rico, from communities that he knew did not vote for him.\""

      "The action would be unusual, but not unprecedented. In the 1990s, Democrats repeatedly tried to force the Ethics Committee to divulge information about investigations into then-Speaker Newt Gingrich.",
      "Those efforts came up short because Republicans closed ranks around Gingrich and the majority. But Gaetz is incredibly unpopular on Capitol Hill, and it would only take a handful of Republicans -- along with all Democrats -- to pass the resolution.",

      "Wild said that all members of the committee have access to the report and hopes that \"one or more\" Republicans will vote with Democrats for its release.",
      "Asked if that's a possibility, Wild said, \"I don't know. I haven't talked to all of them. I mean, everybody, everybody on the committee now has the report, so they've got the opportunity to be reviewing it.\"",

      "\"I wouldn't have that conversation with [Gaetz]. Because that's not appropriate for us to do that,\" Johnson said. \"President Trump respects the guardrails of our institution as well, and I'm very guarded about those things. So neither of those gentlemen would breach that.\"",

      "For two weeks, Donald Trump has welcomed Elon Musk into his world",
      "WASHINGTON -- For two weeks, Donald Trump has welcomed Elon Musk into his world. On Tuesday, it was Musk\u2019s turn to play host to the president-elect.",
      "Trump flew to South Texas to watch as Musk\u2019s SpaceX launched a Starship rocket near the Mexican border. Trump listened intently as the world\u2019s richest man explained how the test would work and demonstrated with a model. And then Trump squinted into the bright sky to watch liftoff.",
      "It didn\u2019t go perfectly -\u2013 the reusable booster did not return to the launch pad as it had done on a previous test last month. Instead, the booster was directed to a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "But Trump\u2019s presence at the launch was a remarkable display of intimacy between the two men, one with implications for American politics, the government, foreign policy and even the possibility of humans reaching Mars.",
      "Musk spent around $200 million to help Trump beat Democrat Kamala Harris in the presidential race, and he's been given unparalleled access. He's counseled Trump on nominees for the new administration, joined the president-elect's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and been tapped to co-chair an advisory panel on cutting the size of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "In addition to political influence, Musk could benefit personally as well. SpaceX, his rocket company, has billions of dollars in government contracts and the goal of eventually starting a colony on Mars. He's also CEO of Tesla, which manufactures electric vehicles, and has battled with regulators over safety concerns involving autonomous driving.",
      "\u201cTrump has the biggest possible regard for people who break the rules and get away with it,\" said William Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank. \"Musk has demonstrated extraordinary accomplishment in doing that.\u201d",
      "To top if off, Musk owns the social media company X, formally known as Twitter, which he has harnessed as an influential perch to promote Trump and his agenda.",
      "\u201cStop the Swamp!\u201d he wrote Tuesday as he shared a warning that entrenched Washington interests are trying to undermine Trump before his inauguration.",
      "Before the election, Musk rejected the idea that he was expecting any favors in return for supporting Trump in the presidential race.",
      "\u201cThere is no quid pro quo,\u201d he posted on X in September. \u201cWith a Trump administration, we can execute major government reform, remove bureaucratic paperwork that is smothering the country and unlock a new age of prosperity.\u201d",
      "However, Trump has hardly gone anywhere without Musk in the two weeks since beating Harris. Musk joined Trump at a meeting with House Republicans in Washington and sat next to him at an Ultimate Fighting Championship match in New York. The trip to Texas for the rocket launch was just Trump's third time outside Florida since the election.",
      "As Trump's protective motorcade left the launch site Tuesday evening to return to the airport, one of Musk's angular, shiny Tesla Cybertrucks was tucked in the middle of the formation of black SUVs.",
      "Much of Trump's activity is happening with little public access for the press. Unlike his predecessors, he has opted against regularly making his travel plans or events open to journalists.",
      "The relationship between Trump and Musk was not always so close.",
      "Two years ago, Trump was mocking Musk in stump speeches and Musk was saying it was time for Trump to \u201chang up his hat & sail into the sunset.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump would be 82 at end of term, which is too old to be chief executive of anything, let alone the United States of America,\u201d Musk wrote on social media.",
      "But Musk swiftly endorsed Trump after the former president survived an assassination attempt in July. He quickly became a central figure in Trump\u2019s orbit, appearing at times more like his running mate than Ohio Sen. JD Vance.",
      "Trump started boasting about Musk's accomplishments at campaign rallies, such as when Starship's reusable rocket booster returned to the launch tower on a previous occasion and was caught by mechanical arms.",
      "\u201cThose arms grab it like you grab your baby, just like you grab your little baby. And it hugged it and just put it down, and there it was,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Musk was with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort on election night and has spent much of the two weeks since there. Trump\u2019s granddaughter Kai Trump posted a photo of her with Musk at one of Trump\u2019s golf resorts, writing that Musk was \"achieving uncle status.\u201d",
      "Last week, Musk appeared in a golden ballroom at Mar-a-Lago, seated in the center of the room as a guest of honor at an event. Trump, in his remarks at the black tie event, said Musk\u2019s IQ is \u201cabout as high as they can get\u201d and praised him as \u201ca really good guy.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe launched a rocket three weeks ago and then he went to Pennsylvania to campaign because he considered this more important than launching rockets that cost billions of dollars,\u201d Trump said.",
      "He joked about Musk\u2019s constant presence at Mar-a-Lago, saying: \u201cHe likes this place. I can\u2019t get him out of here.\"",
      "He added, \u201cAnd you know what, I like having him here.\u201d",
      "Musk said of the election results, \u201cThe public has given us a mandate that could not be more clear.\"",

      "Jeffries and the top House Democratic leadership \u2014 a trio of younger generation leaders along with Democratic Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar of California \u2014 all won their reelections in the private balloting of House Democrats.",
      "\u201cWe are prepared to work hard to find bipartisan common ground with our Republican colleagues and the incoming administration on any issue, whenever and wherever possible,\u201d said Jeffries, of New York, flanked by the leadership team at the Capitol.",
      "\u201cBut at the same period of time we will push back against far-right extremism whenever necessary,\u201d Jeffries said.",
      "In line to become the House speaker, Jeffries of New York remains the highest ranking Black elected official in Congress, and the first to hold the job of party leader.",
      "He fell short of being in place to win the gavel after Republicans swept to power alongside President-elect Donald Trump, winning control of the White House, the Senate and the House.",
      "While the Democratic leader will be the party\u2019s nominee for House speaker when the new Congress convenes in January, the gavel is expected to go to Speaker Mike Johnson as Republicans continue to hold the majority in the new year.",
      "Jeffries and the House Democratic leadership team took over when Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi stepped aside from leadership two years ago, and the other top leaders also made way for the new era.",
      "The Democratic leaders campaigned across the nation in the run-up to the November elections, Jeffries and the others raising tens of millions of dollars and rallying volunteers to get out the vote for their candidates.",
      "House Democrats picked up a few seats in hard-fought regions, including Jeffries\u2019 home state of New York and in California. But they also lost seats elsewhere and failed to topple some GOP incumbents, and overall there was little change in the House.",
      "Jeffries said despite the GOP\u2019s claims of a sweeping mandate to govern, their numbers in the House are essentially at a draw with Democrats.",
      "\u201cThis notion of some mandate to make massive, far right, extreme policy changes, it doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 it doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Jeffries said.",
      "The trio of leaders ran unopposed in Tuesday's closed-door elections that also filled other leadership positions, including Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado as the Assistant Democratic Leader, Rep. Ted Lieu of California as the vice chair of the caucus.",
      "In the other contests, members were elected as co-chairs of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee \u2014 Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois, Rep. Laurie Trahan of Massachusetts and Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida. The DPCC's chair of the co-chairs went to longtime Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan, who pushed past a challenge from rising newcomer Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas.",
      "Republicans under Johnson are left holding the majority by a so-slim margin \u2014 their numbers diminishing in the new year as Trump has tapped three GOP lawmakersElise Stefanik, Mike Waltz and Matt Gaetz to serve in his administration. Some need to be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Those tight numbers in the House, with some races still uncalled, give Jeffries and the Democrats enormous sway to deliver the votes needed to ensure bills are passed, if Johnson finds he is unable to govern with his slim majority, as happened in the past two years of a chaotic Congress.",

    "story": [
      "Trump tried to distance himself from the controversial plan during his campaign.",
      "During his campaign for president, Donald Trump and his advisers worked to vehemently distance themselves from Project 2025, the controversial plan to overhaul the federal government proposed by a closely aligned conservative group. But several individuals connected to the plan have already received posts in the new administration, and one of the plan's top architects is under consideration for a top position, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.",
      "Russ Vought, who authored a chapter on \"Executive Office of the President\" for Project 2025's \"Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise,\" which Project 2025 describes as \"a comprehensive policy guide for the next conservative U.S. president,\" is under consideration for a cabinet-level position in the next administration and has been vetted by Trump's transition team, sources said.",
      "Vought not only authored a chapter in the 922-page Project 2025 plan, but he was also deeply involved in drafting Project 2025's playbook for the first 180 days of a new Trump administration. His Center for Renewing America is also listed as a member of Project 2025's advisory board, according to the plan's website.",
      "Vought -- who has been seen at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in recent days meeting with Trump's top advisers -- served in Trump's first administration as the director of the Office of Management and Budget, and has been in active discussions to return to the next administration, sources familiar with the matter said.",
      "It's not clear what position Vought could ultimately get, but he's been discussed as a candidate for his previous job or for a top White House post that focuses on economic policy, the sources said.",
      "When asked for comment, the Trump transition team pointed to Trump's comments in his debate with Kamala Harris when he stated, \"This was a group of people that got together, they came up with some ideas, I guess some good, some bad, but it makes no difference. I have nothing to do [with it].\"",
      "During his run for the White House, Trump claimed he knew \"nothing\" about Project 2025 and his campaign advisers fiercely worked to distance the campaign from it.",
      "Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick told the Financial Times last month that Project 2025 \"is an absolute zero for the Trump-Vance transition.\"",
      "\"You can use another term -- radioactive,\" Lutnick said.",
      "While personnel decisions are not final until Trump announces them, sources told ABC News that Trump's transition team has considered several other individuals with ties to the plan, including Project 2025 authors as well as several contributors to the document.",
      "Gene Hamilton, the author of the Department of Justice chapter, is among those being considered for a top legal role in Trump's administration, according to sources. In his Project 2025 chapter, Hamilton criticizes the DOJ, claiming it has been \"captured by an unaccountable bureaucratic managerial class and radical Left ideologues who have embedded themselves throughout its offices and components.\"",
      "Hamilton calls for a sweeping \"top-to-bottom overhaul\" of the Justice Department, as well as an internal review of \"all major active FBI investigations,\" recommending the termination of any that are deemed unlawful or contrary to national interests.",
      "Another name that has been floated for a potential position in the Trump administration is Reed Rubinstein, who contributed to Project 2025 and is under consideration for the next general counsel for the Department of Treasury, according to one potential personnel list reviewed by ABC News.",
      "In recent days, Trump has announced other selections to fill out the coming administration who also have ties to Project 2025, marking a stark reversal from how he campaigned.",
      "On Sunday, Trump's team said that Brendan Carr will serve as the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission -- a selection that places one of tech billionaire Elon Musk's active defenders in charge of regulating the nation's airwaves. Carr, who has used his position to defend Musk's companies, authored the chapter of Project 2025 that detailed how he intended to run the agency.",
      "Former ICE Director Tom Homan has been picked to serve as \"border czar\" for the incoming administration, overseeing the mass deportations that have been promised by Trump throughout his 2024 campaign, and immigration hard-liner and top adviser Stephen Miller will serve as Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy. Both Homan and Miller have ties to Project 2025.",
      "Homan is a Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, the Trump-aligned group behind the controversial plan, and is also listed as a contributor to the Project 2025 document. Miller's organization, America First Legal, originally appeared on the list of advisory board members to Project 2025.",
      "ABC News reported in July that Miller asked for his group to be removed from the Project 2025 website's list of advisory board members amid ongoing attacks from Democrats about the plan on the campaign trail.",
      "A major part of Project 2025's agenda is to expand presidential power and drastically cut federal agencies like the Department of Education -- moves that Trump, on the campaign trail, has supported.",

    "story": [
      "\"We've created something pretty special here in Nebraska,\" Osborn told ABC News.",
      "Dan Osborn, a former union president and Navy veteran who ran an unusually competitive U.S. Senate campaign in deep-red Nebraska as an independent, is launching a new political action committee meant to help working class candidates like himself run for office.",
      "\"At least the idea is to help other people like me, who are teachers, nurses, plumbers, carpenters, bus drivers, to be able to run for office in their particular counties, states, areas, and we can help them accomplish that,\" Osborn told ABC News in an interview by phone on Monday.",
      "\"You know, we've created something pretty special here in Nebraska. And I just want to continue that.\"",
      "The organization, the Working Class Heroes Fund, is a new hybrid political action committee (PAC) that will support working-class candidates and mobilize working class voters, according to an announcement and a PAC spokesperson. The group will also advocate for labor unions, including supporting strike funds, which help union workers cover expenses if they go on strike.",
      "Osborn hopes the PAC's work will help bring more workers' perspectives to government, about how \"people don't want handouts from their government\u2026 they just want to know when you go and you put in your time, you put in your eight hours work for eight hours pay, that your paycheck matters, right?\" Osborn said. \"And going to be able to afford your mortgage and your cars and hopefully set aside money for college and some Christmases.\"",
      "The PAC is a new organization and not a conversion of Osborn's campaign committee, according to a spokesperson. It will vet and consider which working-class candidates to support on a case-by-case basis, and will support candidates across political parties.",
      "Could supporting candidates across party lines lead to pushback? Osborn, who eschewed party labels or support during his Senate bid, feels that doesn't matter.",
      "\"I've never really understood why, if you're a part of a party, that you have to have a specific set of beliefs, and you have to reject the other set of beliefs, and vice versa,\" he said.",
      "Osborn had campaigned explicitly on his labor bonafides, including his work as a steamfitter and mechanic, as well as his insistence that he'd be a truly independent voice in the Senate.",
      "On Election Day, Osborn lost to Fischer by 8 percentage points -- not as thin of a margin as some polls had predicted, but well ahead of the margin between President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris; Harris lost statewide to Trump by 21 points. (Harris did lead Trump in the state's 2nd Congressional District, netting her one Electoral College vote.)",
      "Asked if he was surprised by the margin between him and Fischer, Osborn said, \"Yes, I was, actually -- and it sucked. I suppose if I had to describe it in one word, it sucked.",
      "\"You know, I really thought that the people in Nebraska saw the value in electing a working-class person,\" he said, but a late influx of money into the race supporting his opponent made a difference. \"Does it hurt a little bit? Sure, but again, I think we created something here.\"",
      "His family is \"not taking [the loss] as good as I am,\" Osborn said later with a chuckle. \"Everybody goes back to school and we go back -- I'm going back to work tomorrow, and my wife, she was working the whole entire time to help pay for the endeavor. But, you know, we were all hoping for different results, and we didn't see it.\"",
      "Osborn said he was not surprised by the larger margin between Trump and Harris, given Nebraska's deep Republican lean.",
      "One of the trickier dynamics in the race was that as Osborn tried to maintain an independent image, some national Democrats or Democratic groups indicated that if he was elected to the Senate, he would caucus with Democrats. (Throughout his campaign, Osborn emphasized he would not plan to caucus with either party.)",
      "Did that hurt his campaign? Osborn thinks it made a difference.",
      "\"I can't consult with those people. I don't even know who they are. They're making money off of my name, which is completely ridiculous,\" he said, adding that he wants independent expenditures out of politics more generally.",
      "His own organization, however, is allowed to make independent expenditures, as a hybrid PAC. Asked about that, Osborn acknowledged the irony but said the PAC will support candidates who support campaign finance reform and want an end to how money influences politics.",
      "\"The independent expenditure is part of the problem, and I would love nothing more than our elected officials to get rid of my PAC because it shouldn't exist. You know what I mean? None of this should exist.\"",
      "Even as he launches the PAC, however, Osborn said he is also heading back to work as a steamfitter.",
      "\"The debt collectors do not care that I ran the closest Senate race in the country, unfortunately,\" he told ABC News. (Pre-Election Day polling had found the race among the closest Senate races in the country, although the final results have been closer in other Senate races, such as in Michigan and Pennsylvania.) \"So I got to pay my bills. So yes, I'm going back to work.\"",
      "Would he run again for public office? Osborn said he wouldn't rule it out: \"I'm open to everything that's going to be on the table.\"",
      "\"In my neighborhood, there's a position open: the dogcatcher's open,\" he added, \"So I should probably start there,\" he said, although he immediately clarified, \"That's a joke.\"",

    "story": [
      "Sgt. DeRicko Gaither made the complaint about the tattoo in 2021.",
      "The National Guardsman who in 2021 pegged Pete Hegseth as a potential \"insider threat\" clarified in an interview with ABC News that his complaint targeted\u00a0a \"Deus Vult\" tattoo on the former Fox News host's arm -- not a cross on his chest, as Hegseth has repeatedly claimed.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump last week tapped Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense. He listed Hegseth's experience as a veteran and his media experience as his reasons for the choice.",
      "As\u00a0Reuters\u00a0and The\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0first reported, Sgt. DeRicko Gaither sent an image of the \"Deus Vult\" tattoo to Maj. Gen. William Walker shortly before President Joe Biden's inauguration. The phrase, which translates from Latin to \"God wills it,\" has been co-opted by white nationalist groups, experts have said.",
      "\"This information is quite disturbing, sir,\" Gaither wrote in the email to Walker, who has not responded to ABC News' request for comment. \"This falls along the lines of (an) Insider Threat.\"",
      "Hegseth claimed in his book \"The War on Warriors\" that his \"orders were revoked\" ahead of Biden's inauguration because fellow service members had flagged a tattoo of the Jerusalem Cross on his chest as a white nationalist symbol.\u00a0As a result, Hegseth wrote, he resigned from the military.",
      "But Gaither clarified in a text message to ABC News that his complaint targeted the \"Deus Vult\" tattoo, despite\u00a0\"the narrative that has been out there.\"",
      "\"Just so we are clear. This has NOTHING to do with the Jerusalem Cross tattoo on his chest,\"\u00a0Gaither wrote in the text.\u00a0\"This has everything to do with the 'DEUS VULT' Tattoo on his inner bicep.\"",
      "Gaither\u2019s sensitivity to what he described as the \"disturbing\" imagery in Hegseth's tattoos came at a time when the military was grappling with the fact that\u00a0dozens of active and former\u00a0service members had participated in the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Gaither, who confirmed to ABC News the contents of his complaint -- which he wrote just one week after Jan. 6, emphasized that\u00a0\"this wasn't then and isn't now a personal attack towards Pete Hegseth.\"",
      "\"The information received and [the] email sent on January 14th was the protocol that had to be followed because of the position assignment that I was assigned to,\"\u00a0explained Gaither, who was at the time assigned as the Guards' head of security. \"The protocol was followed and would be followed again if this issue involved any other service member, myself included.\"",
      "As ABC News has reported,\u00a0Hegseth fired back\u00a0at the initial coverage of this matter in The Associated Press by claiming it was \"Anti-Christian bigotry.\"",
      "\"They can target me \u2014 I don\u2019t give a damn \u2014 but this type of targeting of Christians, conservatives, patriots and everyday Americans will stop on DAY ONE at DJT's DoD,\" Hegseth wrote on X.",

    "summary": "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook &ldquo;Europe on 5 Dollars a Day,&rdquo; has died",
    "story": [
      "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by convincing average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\u201cMy father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\u201d",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry\u2019s best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer\u2019s brand, led today by his daughter Pauline, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy \u2014 stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants \u2014 changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\u201d That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn\u2019t hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship. The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn\u2019t visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer\u2019s guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer\u2019s advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks. \"It was really pioneering stuff,\u201d Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \u201cthat would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I\u2019ve got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\u201d",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\" The concept no longer made sense when hotels could not be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire did not disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer \u2014 in a David vs. Goliath triumph \u2014 got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\u201cI never dreamed at my age I\u2019d be working this hard,\u201d he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show. He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony postings. And he coined the phrase \u201cTrump Slump\u201d in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight. Eventually he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe,\" and a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece, distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Eventually Frommer gave up law to write the guides full-time. Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \u201cmost Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. \u2026 And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn\u2019t have to be well-heeled.\u201d",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \u201cI fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\u201d he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap, and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\u201d",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer\u2019s survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren."

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 18:26:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel, stiffer competition from bigger carriers, and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition after working out terms with bondholders. The airline has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The airline said it expects to continue operating normally during the bankruptcy process. Spirit told customers Monday they can book flights and use frequent-flyer points as they ordinarily would, and said employees and vendors would continue getting paid.",
      "The airline said it received commitments for a $350 million equity investment from existing bondholders and will convert $795 million of their debt into stock in the restructured company. The bondholders will also extend a $300 million loan that, combined with Spirit\u2019s remaining cash, will help the airline get through the restructuring.",
      "The airline's shares dropped 25% on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. Spirit, based in Dania Beach, Florida, missed a deadline for filing its third-quarter financial results but announced that its operating margin would indicate a bigger loss than the company had in the same quarter last year.",
      "Those were just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. On Monday, he called the deal with bondholders \u201ca strong vote of confidence in Spirit and our long-term plan.\u201d",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They\u2019re just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they are paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit\u2019s red ink.",
      "It\u2019s not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit\u2019s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2014 sagged this summer because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit\u2019s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. It also dropped cancellation fees after rival Frontier Airlines did so.",
      "Those were huge changes from Spirit\u2019s longtime strategy, which focuses on grabbing customers with rock-bottom fares and then getting them to pay extra for things that are free on many other airlines, such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit planned to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts said should help prop up fares. But that would help rivals more than it would boost Spirit.",
      "Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013."

      "ROME -- The ancient Roman Colosseum will be the venue of gladiator fights \u2014 albeit staged \u2014 for the first time in two millennia under a $1.5 million sponsorship deal with Airbnb that aims to promote \u201ca more conscious tourism.\u201d",
      "But some visitors to the monument Thursday, as well as housing activists, were skeptical about the value of the arrangement, citing ongoing controversies in many cities over the role of short-term rental platforms in fueling overtourism and limiting affordable housing for residents and students.",
      "Under the deal announced by Airbnb and the Colosseum on Wednesday, the sponsorship by the short-term rental giant will cover the renewal of an educational program inside the ancient Roman amphitheater covering the history of the structure and gladiators.",
      "Eight of the platform's users and their plus-ones will be able to participate in faux gladiator fights after the Colosseum's closing time on May 7-8, taking the same underground route used by gladiators in ancient Rome to reach the arena. People can apply for the experience on Nov. 27 at no cost, and the \u201cgladiators\u201d will be chosen by lottery.",
      "The superintendent of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, Alfonsina Russo, told The Associated Press that the deal is in conjunction with the release of Ridley Scott's new film \u201cGladiators II,\" which opened in Italy on Thursday.",
      "Russo characterized the sponsorship arrangement as one of the many such deals to help finance projects at the park.",

      "Airbnb and other platforms offering short-term rentals \u201care literally driving people out of not only the city center, but also the outskirts and suburban neighborhoods,\u201d Campailla said.",
      "Tourists from other European cities grappling with overtourism also took issue with the deal.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that the purpose of the Colosseum today is to be a tourist attraction, but not to create an amusement park within it,\u201d said Jaime Montero, a tourist visiting from Madrid. \u201cIn the end, tourism eats the essence of the cities, here in Rome, as in other capitals.\u201d",
      "Visiting from Naples, Salvatore Di Matteo saw the deal as \u201cyet another takeover of the territory\u201d by big companies.",
      "\"If they start to touch sacred monuments such as the Colosseum here in Rome, it is obviously something that should make us think and is, in any case, a bit worrying,\" he said.",
      "The Colosseum is the most important and largest amphitheater constructed by the ancient Romans. Built in the 1st century, it was the center of popular entertainment, hosting hunts and gladiator games, until the 6th century.",

      "Kansas has promised to provide more hospital beds for mentally ill criminal defendants",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- Kansas has promised to provide more hospital beds for mentally ill criminal defendants to settle a federal lawsuit filed over defendants waiting months for evaluations of whether they were fit for a trial.",
      "The agreement between state officials and representatives of five defendants requires the state to \u201cuse its best efforts\u201d to open a new psychiatric hospital by January 2027 in Wichita, the state's largest city. Officials also must seek funding from the Kansas Legislature to reopen a previously closed 30-bed unit at its psychiatric hospital in Larned in western Kansas, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.",
      "The agreement was announced this week by the two groups pursuing the lawsuit, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and the National Police Accountability Project, based in the Seattle area. The groups sued in 2022 on behalf of attorneys for four defendants and the mother of a fifth. The accused were identified only by their initials.",
      "The state operates two psychiatric hospitals, but only the one in Larned has a unit for evaluating whether mentally ill criminal defendants can understand their cases and participate in their own defense. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Larned State Hospital has had fewer than 80 beds for defendants awaiting evaluation.",
      "The state Department for Aging and Disability Services, which runs the Larned facility, acknowledged before the lawsuit was filed that defendants were waiting an average of about 11 months to be evaluated. The lawsuit said defendants remained in county jails that weren't providing adequate treatment, making the inmates' conditions worse and violating their rights. The lawsuit also said the state was violating the federal Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating against people with mental health problems.",
      "\u201cThis settlement is more than a legal agreement; it\u2019s a lifeline for those who have been lost in the system, a promise that their dignity and humanity will no longer be ignored,\u201d said Lauren Bonds, the police accountability group's executive director.",
      "One of the five defendants covered by the lawsuit had been held in a county jail for 13 months facing criminal threat charges when the lawsuit was filed. That's longer than the maximum prison sentence for a conviction on that charge.",
      "\u201cRemaining in the jail environment is devastating and deeply harmful even for those whose mental health is not in question, and condemning Kansans to languish across the state in their county jails was contradictory to our values of justice,\" said Monica Bennett, the ACLU of Kansas' legal director.",
      "State officials argued that they already had been addressing the long waits. The state began having Larned State Hospital officials operate a mobile evaluation unit in 2019; and in 2022, the Legislature passed a law to allow other qualified hospitals and organizations to examine criminal defendants.",
      "The state and Wichita's home county hope to start construction early next year on a secure, $101.5 million psychiatric hospital with 104 beds, half of them set aside for the state. Federal COVID-19 relief dollars provided part of the funding.",
      "KDADS spokesperson Cara Sloan-Ramos said the department and Gov. Laura Kelly are committed to reducing wait times.",
      "Republican state Rep. Stephen Owens, chair of the House committee handling criminal justice issues, was pleased that the state could settle the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly been aware of this issue and have been working on solutions,\" Owens said Tuesday."

    "story": [
      "The Texas State Board of Education has given initial approval to a Bible-infused curriculum that would be optional for public schools to adopt for lessons from kindergarten through fifth grade",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas' education board on Tuesday advanced a new Bible-infused curriculum that would be optional for schools to incorporate in kindergarten through fifth grades, one of the latest Republican-led efforts in the U.S. to incorporate more religious teaching into classrooms.",
      "The vote moves the Texas State Board of Education one step closer to signing off on what is known as the \u201cBluebonnet\u201d textbook, which drew hours of often emotional testimony from school teachers and parents earlier this week.",
      "The board is expected to hold a final vote on the measure Friday.",
      "The curriculum \u2014 designed by the state's public education agency \u2014 would allow teachings from the Bible such as the Golden Rule and lessons from books such as Genesis into classrooms. Under the plan, it would be optional for schools to adopt the curriculum though they would receive additional funding if they did so.",
      "Educators, parents and advocates weighed in Monday at the State Board of Education\u2019s final meeting of the year, where many opponents argued that the proposal\u2019s emphasis on Christian teachings would alienate students of other faith backgrounds. Those in favor testified that it\u2019ll give students a more holistic educational foundation.",
      "Educator Megan Tessler testified Monday that the plan contradicts the public school mission.",
      "\u201cThis curriculum fails to meet the standard of an honest, secular one,\u201d Tessler said. \u201cPublic schools are meant to educate, not indoctrinate.\u201d",
      "Others strongly backed the idea.",
      "\u201cParents and teachers want a return to excellence,\u201d said Cindy Asmussen, testifying Monday. \u201cStories and concepts in the Bible have been common for hundreds of years,\" and that, she said, is a core part of classical learning.",
      "Religious experts and the Texas Freedom Network, a left-leaning watchdog group that monitors the state\u2019s education board, said the curriculum proposal focuses too much on Christianity and also dances around the history of slavery.",
      "The program was designed by the Texas Education Agency earlier this year after passage of a law giving it a mandate to create its own free textbook. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has publicly supported the new materials.",
      "Republican lawmakers in Texas have also proposed displaying the Ten Commandments in classrooms and are likely to revisit the issue next year.",
      "The proposal to incorporate religious teaching in Texas public schools mirrors similar efforts around the country, which are also drawing court challenges.",
      "In Oklahoma, state officials are seeking to include the Bible in public school lesson plans. But a group of students' parents, teachers and others recently filed suit, seeking to stop Oklahoma's top education official from carrying out the plan intended for students in grades 5 through 12. The lawsuit before the Oklahoma Supreme Court also asks the court to stop the Republican state superintendent from spending $3 million to purchase Bibles in support of the plan.",
      "In Louisiana, a new state law sought to have the Ten Commandments displayed in all public classrooms, but a federal judge recently quashed that requirement. U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles in Baton Rouge said last week that the Louisiana law had an \u201covertly religious\u201d purpose, and rejected state officials\u2019 claims that the government can mandate the posting of the Ten Commandments because they hold historical significance to the foundation of U.S. law. His opinion noted that no other foundational documents \u2014 including the Constitution or the Bill of Rights \u2014 must be posted.",

      "The narrowly trailing Republican candidate in the race for a North Carolina Supreme Court seat has formally requested a statewide recount",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- The narrowly trailing Republican candidate in the race for a North Carolina Supreme Court seat formally requested a recount on Tuesday, with barely 600 votes separating him from the Democratic incumbent.",
      "Jefferson Griffin, a Court of Appeals judge, sent the request before a noon deadline, marking the lone statewide race where a recount is poised to occur. Recounts for several single- or multi-county races also have been requested, including five General Assembly races. Ballots will be run again through tabulator machines.",
      "Associate Justice Allison Riggs led Tuesday by 625 votes over Griffin, as election officials in all but two small counties from the state's 100 counties have finalized their work from last Friday's count meetings.",
      "Griffin led after election night by roughly 10,000 votes, but the margin dwindled last week as county election boards reviewed tens of thousands of provisional and absentee ballots and added voting choices of those that qualified for counting to the totals. More than 5.5 million ballots have been cast in the Riggs-Griffin race.",
      "The State Board of Elections said in a news release that most of the 100 counties will begin their recounts on Wednesday and should be completed by Nov. 27. The board is slated to meet Nov. 26 to consider final counts and certify results, but a Supreme Court race certification could be considered at a later date, spokesperson Pat Gannon said.",
      "Griffin on Tuesday also filed election protests challenging the validity of more than 60,000 ballots statewide, according to a state Republican Party news release. The protests focus on what the release calls \u201cspecific irregularities and discrepancies in the handling and counting of ballots.\u201d It did not provide more details.",
      "\u201cThese protests are about one fundamental principle: ensuring every legal vote is counted,\u201d Griffin said in the release.",
      "If the current leaders in the General Assembly races where recounts have been requested keep their advantages, Republicans will lose in January the veto-proof majority that they have held for the past two years at the General Assembly.",
      "Republicans have won 71 of the 120 House seats \u2014 one seat shy of the veto-proof majority in that chamber.",
      "The GOP would keep that supermajority if it could win a state House race where Republican Rep. Frank Sossamon trails Democrat Bryan Cohn by 233 votes from over 43,000 ballots cast in the race covering Granville County and part of Vance County.",
      "Republicans have won the 30 seats necessary to retain a chamber supermajority in the 50-seat Senate. But Democratic Gov.-elect Josh Stein would be better able to block permanently GOP bills he opposed with his veto stamp if Republicans are unable to retain a three-fifths majority in the House.",
      "Candidates in legislative races who are trailing the top vote-getter by 1 percentage point or less can seek a recount."

      "In October, prosecutors submitted a recommendation for the brothers\u2019 resentencing on the murder conviction in the 1989 killings of their parents in their Beverly Hills home.

      "The Los Angeles City Council has voted to enact an ordinance to prohibit city resources from being used for immigration enforcement in anticipation of potential mass deportations under President-elect Donald Trump",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved a so-called \u201csanctuary city\u201d ordinance that bars city resources from being used for immigration enforcement and city departments from sharing information on people without legal status with federal immigration authorities, in anticipation of potential mass deportations under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Councilmembers voted unanimously on the measure, joining more than a dozen cities across the United States with similar provisions. Sanctuary cities or states are not legal terms but have come to symbolize a pledge to protect and support immigrant communities and decline to voluntarily supply information to immigration enforcement officials. Advocates say they are havens for immigrants to feel safe and be able to report crime without fear of deportation.",
      "The measure will come back to the council for a second vote as a formality. Mayor Karen Bass, who has the power to veto it, has said she supports the ordinance.",
      "With Trump's promises of a vast immigration crackdown upon his return to the White House in January, immigration advocates urged Los Angeles council members to move swiftly.",
      "\u201cWe're going to send a very clear message that the city of Los Angeles will not cooperate with ICE in any way,\u201d said councilmember Hugo Soto-Martinez, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. \u201cWe want people to feel protected and be able to have faith in their government and that women can report domestic violence, crimes.\u201d",
      "Soto-Martinez, one of the councilmembers who introduced the initial motion last year, said his parents and many of his constituents are immigrants without legal status. They are \u201cembedded in the larger community,\u201d from cooking and cleaning houses to working as nannies, he said.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear how much will change under the ordinance since the city already does not cooperate with federal immigration authorities.",
      "The Los Angeles Police Department has a policy mandating that officers not inquire about a person's immigration status or make arrests based on legal status. Its new police chief Jim McDonnell has also pledged not to cooperate with mass deportations work or federal agencies on immigration enforcement issues.",
      "Former Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti issued an executive directive in 2019 that offered protections to immigrants, but Tuesday\u2019s ordinance would codify those protections into city law.",
      "The state of California has similar protections. Former California Gov. Jerry Brown signed sanctuary state legislation in 2017 to bar police from asking people about their immigration status or participating in federal immigration enforcement activities.",
      "Then-President Trump responded by attempting to withhold funding from sanctuary cities and favor cities that pledge to cooperate with immigration enforcement for federal grants.",
      "Cities from New York to San Francisco have long-standing policies to support immigrants, but criticism of those measures grew with the influx of migrants. Some of the backlash occurred after Republican governors in Texas and Florida began bussing migrants to Democratic-led \u201csanctuary cities\u201d last year in what critics have called political stunts.",
      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams has since called for expanded cooperation between local police and federal immigration authorities, attacking the current city policies limiting such communication as detrimental to public safety.",
      "Migrants were also bused to Los Angeles, though in smaller numbers.",
      "More than 100 people gathered on the steps of city hall Tuesday morning ahead of the vote to urge the city council to enact the ordinance.",
      "Martha Ar\u00e9valo, executive director of the Central American Resource Center in LA, called the law \u201clong overdue.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is Trump 2.0 where he ran on a platform of hate and division and separating families and mass deportations,\u201d Arevalo said. \u201cIt's traumatic to the immigrant community. There's a lot of trauma, there's a lot of fear.\u201d",
      "Supporters of the sanctuary city ordinance, many of whom are people without legal status themselves, spoke on their personal experiences with the threat of deportation.",
      "\u201cI grew up in the shadows, constantly fearing separation from my loved ones and being sent back to a place we had fought so hard to escape,\u201d said Jesus Carreon, a current student at Harvard Law School and graduate of University of Southern California, asking the council to vote in favor of the sanctuary policy.",
      "Some brought up concerns that it could encourage more migrants without legal status to come to the city and take resources away from addressing homelessness.",
      "\u201cI'm sure there's millions of people that want to come to LA and we can't be a sanctuary city for everybody,\u201d Charles Brister told the city council before the vote. \u201cWe have people in this city who don't have beds, American citizens who are homeless.\u201d",
      "Mayor Bass said recently \u201cthis moment demands urgency. Immigrant protections make our communities stronger and our city better.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The U.N. nuclear watchdog says Iran has defied international demands to rein in its nuclear program and has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels",
      "VIENNA -- Iran has defied international demands to rein in its nuclear program and has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report by the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog seen Tuesday by The Associated Press.",
      "The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency said that as of Oct. 26, Iran has 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) since the last report in August.",
      "Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.",
      "The IAEA also estimated in its quarterly report that as of Oct. 26, Iran\u2019s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,604.4 kilograms (14,560 pounds), an increase of 852.6 kilograms (1,879.6 pounds) since August. Under the IAEA\u2019s definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% purity is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible \u2014 if the material is enriched further, to 90%.",
      "The reports come at a critical time as Israel and Iran have traded missile attacks in recent months after more than a year of war in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas, a group supported by Iran.",
      "Adding to the complexity, Donald Trump\u2019s reelection raises questions about whether and how the incoming administration and Iran may engage.",
      "Trump\u2019s first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period, when he pursued a policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d against Tehran. He unilaterally withdrew America from Iran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling the economy and ordered the killing of the country\u2019s top general.",
      "Iran last week offered not to expand its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60%, during a visit to Tehran by the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi.",
      "The IAEA said during the meetings that \u201cthe possibility of Iran not further expanding its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% U-235 was discussed, including technical verification measures necessary for the Agency to confirm this, if implemented.\u201d",
      "The report said that one day after Grossi left Iran, on Nov. 16, IAEA inspectors verified that \u201cIran had begun implementation of preparatory measures aimed at stopping the increase of its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60 % U-235\u201d at its underground nuclear sites in Fordow and Natanz.",
      "The reports come ahead of this week\u2019s regular IAEA Board of Governors meeting in Vienna.",
      "A senior western diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, confirmed to the AP that the United Kingdom, France and Germany, with the support from the U.S., are going ahead with a resolution at this week\u2019s IAEA Board of Governors meeting, censuring Iran for its lack of cooperation, leading to potential confrontation with Iran ahead of Trump\u2019s return to the White House.",
      "\u201cWe remain tightly coordinated with our E3 partners (France, Germany and UK) in advance of the IAEA Board of Governors meeting. And, we strongly support efforts to hold Iran accountable,\u201d U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters Tuesday in Washington.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian regime continues to amass a growing stockpile of highly enriched uranium for which there is no credible civilian purpose and they continue to not cooperate fully with the IAEA,\u201d he added.",
      "A senior diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said it is possible that the commitments made by Iran during the IAEA\u2019s chief visit may not stand in case a resolution is passed. In the past, Iran has responded to resolutions by the IAEA Board of Governors by further enhancing its nuclear program.",
      "Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but Grossi has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make \u201cseveral\u201d nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran\u2019s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment.",
      "Iran\u2019s mission at the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The IAEA also reported that Iran has failed to take concrete steps as of now to improve cooperation, despite pleas by Grossi, who held talks last week with Mohammad Eslami of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and Iran\u2019s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian.",
      "However, Tuesday\u2019s confidential report also said that during Grossi\u2019s visit to Iran on Nov. 14, \u201cIran agreed to respond to the Agency\u2019s concerns related to Iran\u2019s withdrawal of the designation of several experienced Agency inspectors by considering the acceptance of the designation of four additional experienced inspectors.\u201d",
      "In September 2023, Iran barred some of the Vienna-based agency\u2019s most experienced inspectors.",
      "The report also said there was no progress thus far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data comes from IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in Isfahan in May 2023 \u2014 although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data and inspectors have not been able to service the cameras.",
      "Last week, Eslami warned that Iran could retaliate if challenged at the upcoming IAEA board meeting. Grossi acknowledged some nations were considering taking action against Iran.",
      "In an effort to ensure Iran could not develop atomic weapons, world powers struck a deal with Tehran in 2015 under which it agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program",
      "Under the original 2015 nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, can maintain a stockpile of uranium of 300 kilograms and is permitted to use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges, machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes.",
      "A year after the U.S. withdrawal from the deal under Trump, Iran started to gradually abandon all limits the deal put on its program and began enriching uranium to up to 60% purity."

      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump's first stint in the White House proved to be a chaotic ride for the District of Columbia.",
      "Now with Trump set to return to power \u2014 backed by a Republican-controlled Congress and the momentum of a sweeping electoral win \u2014 local officials in the nation's capital are trying to sound conciliatory while preparing for the worst.",
      "\u201cWe have been discussing and planning for many months in the case that the District has to defend itself and its values,\u201d said Mayor Muriel Bowser. Her office had \u201ccommunicated with (Trump's) team and indicated we would like to speak,\u201d she said on Nov. 12, but hadn't heard back.",
      "Bowser downplayed the myriad differences between the two sides and emphasized a search for common ground. But those commonalities may be hard to come by, given the open mutual animosity that has defined Trump's relationship with the District.",
      "During Trump\u2019s turbulent first four years in office, he and the local government publicly sparred multiple times \u2014 in tones ranging from playful to deeply personal. When Trump floated the idea of a massive July 4 military parade complete with tanks rolling through the streets, the D.C. Council publicly mocked him.",
      "When mass protests broke out in the summer of 2020 over the death of George Floyd and wider police brutality and racial issues, Trump accused Bowser of losing control of her city. he eventually declared his own multi-agency lockdown that included low-flying helicopters buzzing protesters. Bowser responded by having \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d painted on the street in giant letters one block from the White House.",
      "During the last four years, with Trump as an aggrieved private citizen, his feelings toward Washington have remained intense. On the campaign trail, he repeatedly vowed to \u201ctake over\u201d the city and usurp the authority of the local government. In August 2023, when he briefly came to town to plead not guilty on charges of trying to overturn his 2020 electoral loss to President Joe Biden, Trump blasted the capital city on social media, calling it a \u201cfilthy and crime ridden embarrassment to our nation.\u201d",
      "Now Bowser and the D.C. Council are bracing for what could be several years of playing defense against opponents who wield significant power over Washington's affairs.",
      "\u201cWe just have to do our best and hold on for another few years. We have to figure out how to make it work,\u201d said Councilmember Christina Henderson. \u201cUnlike millions of voters around the country, I actually believe the man when he speaks. He said what he\u2019s going to do.\u201d",
      "Henderson, a former staffer for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., points out that Trump has already experienced what she called \u201cthe trifecta\u201d \u2014 Republican control of the White House and both houses of Congress \u2014 during his first two years in office and the District managed to get through it. She also notes that Republican control of the House of Representatives will be up for grabs again in just two more years.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t predict what they're going to try to do to us,\" she said. \"I can just prepare to respond.\u201d",
      "But responding to the intentions of an antagonistic White House and Congress is difficult, given the nature of the District's limited autonomy. Under terms of the city's Home Rule authority, Congress essentially vets all D.C. laws and can outright overturn them.",
      "Even when Trump was out of the White House, activist Republicans on the House Oversight Committee repeatedly summoned Bowser and members of the D.C. Council \u2014 often to publicly grill them about local crime rates.",
      "And by far the most extensive modern congressional encroachment on the District's authority came with Democrats controlling both the Senate and the White House. In 2023, a sweeping rewrite of the D.C. criminal code was branded as soft on crime by House Republicans; in a major setback for the council, both Senate Democrats and President Biden agreed and the law was effectively canceled.",
      "\u201cWe know that the District can always be a convenient foil to some of these folks,\" said Councilmember Charles Allen. \"Without statehood, without autonomy, our laws are always more at risk than any other Americans.\u201d",
      "Both councilmembers predict a wave of budget riders on the annual appropriations bill \u2014 designed to alter District laws in ways big and small. These riders have been a longtime source of resentment for local lawmakers, who charge Congress members with tinkering with the District in a manner they could never get away with at home.",
      "\"They want to do something to the District because they feel they can. They would never do that to their own state,\u201d Allen said.",
      "He highlights the infamous \u201cHarris rider\u201d named for Maryland Rep. Andy Harris. A staunch opponent of legalized marijuana, Harris has for years used a budget rider to prevent the local government from creating any sort of regulatory framework for taxing or controlling sales. Meanwhile, Maryland has since legalized recreational marijuana use.",
      "\u201cHe can\u2019t implement it in his home state, but he can do it to us,\u201d Allen said.",
      "Last year's appropriations bill initially included riders that would have banned all traffic speed cameras in the nation's capital and prevented the District government from banning right turns on red lights. Those proposals eventually faded during the negotiation process, but Allen feels that the coming Congress \"won't have Democrats in the same position to help negotiate away many of the most objectionable budget riders.\u201d",
      "Other congressional Republicans have sought to make more fundamental changes to the way Washington operates. Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia has proposed completely repealing the Home Rule Act, while Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee has talked publicly of abolishing the office of D.C. mayor. Neither Ogles' nor Clyde's office responded to Associated Press requests for comment on their future intentions.",
      "Despite the looming battles, Bowser's search for common ground with Trump and congressional Republicans may not be completely hopeless. Bowser actually vetoed the criminal code rewrite but was overridden by the D.C. Council; her opposition was frequently cited by congressional Republicans as proof of how far the council had strayed from mainstream Democratic policy.",
      "And Bowser, Trump and Republicans in Congress have all agreed for years on one particular issue: the need to end post-pandemic teleworking and bring all federal employees back to their offices five days a week. She said she looked forward to discussing that with Trump."

      "The Associated Press has found numerous instances of completed mail ballots from around the country being sent to election offices in the wrong state",
      "HELENA, Mont. -- Terry Thompson had an election to run for voters in Cascade County, Montana. Why then, she thought, was her office in Great Falls being sent mailed ballots completed by voters in places such as Wasilla, Alaska, Vancouver, Washington, and Tampa, Florida?",
      "It was only about a dozen ballots total from voters in other states. But she said it still raised concerns about the ability of the U.S. Postal Service to deliver election mail and whether the errant ballots would ever be counted.",
      "\u201cI mean, I would have had to been doing FedEx overnight envelopes to all these states to try to get them where they needed to go,\u201d said Thompson, the county's election administrator.",
      "She received about a half dozen others that should have gone to county election offices in other parts of Montana. For those, she said she \u201cjust had to hope and pray\u201d they made it back on time.",
      "While a stray ballot ending up in the wrong place can happen during election season, the number of ballots destined for other states and counties that ended up at Thompson's office is unusual. The Associated Press found it wasn't an anomaly. Election offices in California, Louisiana, New Mexico and elsewhere also reported receiving completed ballots in the mail that should have gone to other states.",
      "To some election officials, it confirms concerns they raised before the Nov. 5 presidential election about the U.S. Postal Service's performance and ability to handle a crush of mail ballots, as early voting has become increasingly popular with voters.",
      "State election officials warned in September that problems with the nation\u2019s mail delivery system threatened to disenfranchise voters in the upcoming presidential election. In a letter to U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, the election officials noted problems during the primaries that included mailed ballots postmarked on time but received too late be counted and instances of properly addressed election mail returned as undeliverable.",
      "In Louisiana, state election officials said some 40 to 50 ballots destined for 10 other states ended up being delivered to local election offices, mostly in Orleans Parish. Deputy Secretary of State Joel Watson Jr. said the Secretary of State\u2019s Office had \u201cextraordinary frustration\u201d for the Postal Service\u2019s continued \u201cinconsistencies\u201d and \u201clack of accountability.\u201d",
      "Dozens of mail ballots from inside the state also were delivered to the wrong local election office, Watson said.",
      "\u201cThere were many instances where our staff had to physically take these ballots and drive them to another parish to get them there on time to make sure those votes count,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe had to use time and resources in the hours and days immediately preceding the biggest election we hold to make sure these ballots were delivered to the right places.\u201d",
      "Louisiana law does not permit ballot drop boxes, and Watson indicated his office does not support moving in that direction and would continue to encourage voters to cast their ballots in person. He cited security concerns such as the arson attacks on drop boxes in Washington and Oregon ahead of the Nov. 5 election in which ballots were damaged.",
      "The U.S. Postal Service said in a statement that it had been working closely with local election officials to resolve concerns, but did not address specific questions regarding the misdirected ballots.",
      "\u201cThe United States Postal Service is fully committed to fulfilling our role in the electoral process when policy makers choose to utilize us as a part of their election system, and to delivering election mail in a timely manner,\u201d Rod Spurgeon, a USPS spokesman, said in an email.",
      "Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, said ballot monitors identified some problems inside facilities during the election season but said they were resolved.",
      "\u201cWhile we are waiting on the final statistics from the Postal Service, all indications show that vote-by-mail was a success in the 2024 general election,\u201d he said in an emailed statement Tuesday.",
      "Still, state and local election officials reported numerous cases of ballots ending up in the wrong place.",
      "In New Mexico\u2019s Santa Fe County, County Clerk Katharine Clark said seven ballots bound for her office were instead delivered to Los Angeles County in Southern California. Those ballots were redirected, Clark said, but did not arrive at her office before the state\u2019s deadline to be counted, which is 7 p.m. on Election Day.",
      "\u201cIt does mean that person got denied the right to vote, because the ballots from Los Angeles County -- even though they were sent (to Santa Fe) with a four- or five-day lead time -- they didn\u2019t get to us in time to count,\u201d she said.",
      "In addition, Clark said her office received two ballots destined for Los Angeles County and one for Maricopa County in Arizona that she sent back to the U.S. Postal Service. Nine ballots should have been delivered to other counties within New Mexico.",
      "In addition to the Santa Fe County ballots, Los Angeles County election officials said they also received two ballots that should have been mailed to Torrance County, New Mexico. That county's clerk, Linda Jaramillo, said she did not recall receiving the ballots from Los Angeles County but expressed faith in the nation's mail service.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a few,\u201d Jaramillo said. \"You can\u2019t have perfection.\u201d",
      "The California Secretary of State\u2019s office said about 150 mail ballots from Oregon voters were misdirected to California before being sent back. Officials at the state election office in Springfield, Illinois, somehow ended up with a ballot intended for Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cYeah, I have no idea how that happens,\u201d said Matt Dietrich, spokesperson for the Illinois State Board of Elections.",
      "Amy Cohen, executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors, called the incidents \u201cdisappointing and heartbreaking.\"",
      "\u201cElection officials don\u2019t ever want to see misdelivered ballots, but it does happen for variety of reasons, not all of which are USPS\u2019s fault,\u201d Cohen said, noting that voters can sometimes forget to use the outer envelope that contains important address information.",
      "But Cohen said the examples from this past presidential election seem to reflect the issues that election officials had been worried about since 2023 and were highlighted in their September letter to U.S. Postal Service leadership.",
      "\u201cWe hope they will get to the bottom of what went wrong to prevent it from happening again in the future and that they will be responsive to the issues escalated by the election community,\u201d Cohen said.",
      "In Kansas, Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a Republican, was so frustrated after the August primary with hundreds of mail ballots arriving after the deadline for counting them that he posted on social media, \u201cThe Pony Express is more efficient at this point.\u201d Schwab, unlike other Republicans, has touted the use of drop boxes.",
      "There were no reports of ballots misdirected from or to other states, but Schwab said in a statement this week: \u201cI still encourage voters to not use the USPS to mail their ballot unless there is no other option.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- After almost a year of testimony in a sweeping gang and racketeering indictment against Young Thug and an initial 27 defendants, prosecutors rested their case Tuesday in the longest trial in Georgia's history.",
      "Both Deamonte Kendrick, also known as Yak Gotti, and Shannon Stillwell told the judge Tuesday they would not testify in their own defense. Both earlier rejected plea offers after over a week of negotiation.",
      "Defense lawyers indicated that they would ask Fulton County Superior Court Judge Paige Reese Whitaker to direct the jury to issue a verdict of not guilty against Kendrick and Stillwell on Wednesday, which requires the lawyers to argue that no reasonable person could find that the state had proved Kendrick and Stillwell guilty.",
      "If Whitaker rejects the request for a directed verdict, lawyers are also likely Wednesday to argue about instructions to jurors about what they must find to convict Kendrick and Stillwell.",
      "Jurors will return on Thursday and could begin deliberation before the end of the week.",
      "Young Thug, the 33-year-old Atlanta-born Grammy winning artist whose given name is Jeffery Williams, pleaded guilty to gang, drug and gun charges in October after negotiations with prosecutors broke down. That left the sentence up to Whitaker, who gave him a 40-year sentence that let him walk free on probation with hefty restrictions, including a ban from the metro Atlanta area for the first 10 years except for certain occasions.",
      "The slow-moving trial has been fraught with problems from the start. Jury selection took nearly 10 months, and Fulton County Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville, the original judge, was removed from the case in July after defense attorneys filed a recusal motion based on a secretive meeting he held with prosecutors and a state witness.",
      "Whitaker took over the case and often lost patience with prosecutors for what she once called \u201cpoor lawyering.\u201d She and defense attorneys scolded prosecutors for not sharing evidence in advance.",
      "More than 175 witnesses testified throughout the trial. Prosecutors alleged that Young Thug and two others co-founded a violent criminal street gang in 2012 called Young Slime Life, or YSL, which they say is affiliated with the national Bloods gang.",
      "At Young Thug's plea hearing, defense attorney Brian Steel said that Young Thug was \u201cfalsely accused\" and the evidence against him was weak. He also condemned the use of rap lyrics during the trial.",
      "Steel said he thought they were winning the trial and wanted to stick it out to a jury verdict, but Young Thug wanted to go home to his family instead of sitting through the rest of the trial, which felt like \u201chell.\u201d",
      "Nine people charged in the indictment, including Atlanta rapper Gunna, whose real name is Sergio Kitchens, accepted plea deals before the trial began. Twelve others are to be tried separately. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case."

      "Federal wildlife officials say they're reviewing the removal of a bald eagle nest at the site of a planned subdivision in the east Alabama city of Auburn, following an outcry",
      "AUBURN, Ala. -- Federal wildlife officials are reviewing the removal of a bald eagle nest at the site of a planned subdivision in the east Alabama city of Auburn following an outcry by some local residents, the agency announced Tuesday.",
      "Agents with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which issued a permit to the subdivision developer to remove the nest, are reviewing the removal at the request of city officials to make sure the developer followed the terms and conditions of the permit, the agency said.",
      "The tree containing the nest was chopped down over the weekend, upsetting nearby residents who had hoped to stop the nest\u2019s removal.",
      "\u201cWe understand the deep emotional bond many residents have with these birds and aim to clarify the situation,\u201d Rafael Gonzales, the Southeast Region\u2019s Acting Assistant Regional Director of Migratory Birds and Science Applications, said in a statement.",
      "The federal agency has said bald eagles, the national symbol that once teetered on the brink of extinction, have rebounded in recent years after decades of habitat destruction, illegal shooting and the impact of the since-banned insecticide DDT, growing to more than 71,400 nesting pairs and an estimated 316,700 individual birds by 2021.",
      "Bald eagles were removed from the endangered species list in August 2007 because their populations recovered sufficiently, and their population has continued to grow in the years since, it says.",
      "Nonetheless, bald eagle nests cannot be disturbed without a federal permit.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said it issued the permit after it was determined that the removal of the nest would not negatively impact the overall eagle population. The permit holder was responsible for confirming the nest was empty of eggs or young before taking it down, the agency said.",
      "The nest was removed Friday, the agency said. The move upset nearby residents who had hoped to stop the removal of the nest where they said a bonded pair of bald eagles had resided for several years.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re smart and beautiful. They deserve to be protected,\u201d neighbor Jason Haynie told WRBL. The station published photos of the eagles circling above the area where their nest used to stand.",
      "Developer Hughston Homes, the business granted the federal permit to remove the nest, said in a statement to WSFA that it had followed guidance from the Fish and Wildlife Service in the removal. The developer said it believed the \u201cnest in question is likely an alternate nest\u201d for the eagles.",
      "\u201cPlease know that this decision was made with respect for the environment and the welfare of these magnificent birds,\u201d the developer added.",
      "The city of Auburn issued a statement over the weekend saying City Council members were disappointed by the removal. City officials had hoped to meet with the developer this week to discuss options for preserving the nest, according to its statement.",
      "Bald eagle nests can typically reach around five feet (1.5 meters) in diameter and sometimes larger, weighing up to two tons, and mating pairs can use the same nest year after year, birding experts say.",
      "Auburn is the home of Auburn University. The tiger is the school\u2019s mascot though the university\u2019s battle cry is \u201cWar Eagle.\u201d"

      "Victims and family of those killed in the mass shooting at an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs in 2022 filed lawsuits Sunday against the El Paso County commissioners and former sheriff",
      "DENVER -- Victims and mothers of those killed in the mass shooting at an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs in 2022 have filed lawsuits alleging that the murders could've been prevented if the sheriff's office used the state's red flag law after clear warning signs that the gunman intended to commit violence.",
      "The plaintiffs in the two lawsuits, filed Sunday, include survivor Barrett Hudson, who still has three bullets in his body from that night, and other victims and relatives. They are scheduled to speak about the legal action at a news conference Tuesday \u2014 which is the two year anniversary of the shooting at the nightclub, Club Q.",
      "Families and victims also accuse the nightclub\u2019s owners in the lawsuit of winnowing Club Q\u2019s security detail from five or more people to just one in the years leading up to the shooting, prioritizing profits over the safety.",
      "\u201cClub Q advertised itself as a \u2018safe place\u2019 for LGBTQIA+ individuals. But that was a fa\u00e7ade,\u201d read both the complaints, which allege negligence among other allegations.",
      "A central focus of both lawsuits was the El Paso County commissioners' and the then sheriff's refusal to enforce Colorado's red flag law passed in 2019, which allows law enforcement to temporary take someone's firearm if they are deemed a threat to themselves or others.",
      "Natalie Sosa, a spokesperson for El Paso County, said it does not comment on pending litigation.",
      "The county commissioners and sheriff saw the red flag law as an encroachment on gun rights, and passed a resolution to be a \u201cSecond Amendment preservation county\" and, alongside the then sheriff, vowed to \u201cactively resist\u201d the bill, according to court documents.",
      "The lawsuits argue that authorities should have used the red flag law after the arrest of the gunman, Anderson Aldrich, a year before he would walk into Club Q firing indiscriminately.",
      "Those killed in the shooting were Raymond Green Vance, Kelly Loving, Daniel Aston, Derrick Rump and Ashley Paugh.",
      "In 2021, Aldrich was arrested for allegedly kidnapping and threatening to kill his grandparents, reportedly saying he would become the \u201cnext mass killer\" and collecting ammunition, bomb-making materials, firearms and body armor, according to court documents.",
      "\u201cYou clearly have been planning for something else,\u201d a judge told Aldrich in an 2021 hearing, according to documents previously obtained by The Associated Press. \"It was saving all these firearms and trying to make this bomb and making statements about other people being involved in some sort of shootout and a huge thing.\"",
      "The judge later dismissed all charges for \u201cfailure to prosecute\u201d during a four-minute hearing, partly because the prosecution hadn't been able serve subpoenas to key victims, according to documents obtained by the AP.",
      "Authorities did not attempt to remove Aldrich's weapons, the lawsuits allege, and \u201cThis deliberate inaction allowed the shooter continued access to firearms, directly enabling the attack on Club Q.\u201d",
      "The suits separately allege negligence and wrongful death against the El Paso County commissioners and former sheriff.",
      "Aldrich, now 24, pled guilty to five counts of murder and 46 counts of attempted murder and was sentenced to a life in prison in 2023 in state court. A year later, Aldrich pled guilty in a federal court to hate crimes and was sentenced to an additional 55 life terms in prison.",

    "story": [
      "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by convincing average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\u201cMy father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\u201d",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry\u2019s best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer\u2019s brand, led today by his daughter Pauline, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy \u2014 stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants \u2014 changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\u201d That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn\u2019t hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship. The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn\u2019t visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer\u2019s guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer\u2019s advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks. \"It was really pioneering stuff,\u201d Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \u201cthat would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I\u2019ve got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\u201d",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\" The concept no longer made sense when hotels could not be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire did not disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer \u2014 in a David vs. Goliath triumph \u2014 got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\u201cI never dreamed at my age I\u2019d be working this hard,\u201d he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show. He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony postings. And he coined the phrase \u201cTrump Slump\u201d in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight. Eventually he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe,\" and a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece, distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Eventually Frommer gave up law to write the guides full-time. Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \u201cmost Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. \u2026 And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn\u2019t have to be well-heeled.\u201d",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \u201cI fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\u201d he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap, and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\u201d",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer\u2019s survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren."

      "Walmart ratcheted up sales and profits again in the third quarter with its comparatively low prices proving a powerful draw for shoppers seeking to cut spending where they could",
      "NEW YORK -- Walmart is heading into the official start of the holiday shopping season with strong tailwinds after ratcheting up better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter sales in many items including toys, home goods and groceries.",
      "The robust results, announced Tuesday, underscore how Walmart's comparatively low prices have become a powerful draw for shoppers seeking to cut spending where they could in a still inflationary environment.",
      "The nation\u2019s largest retailer, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, also raised its outlook. The company's shares rose more than 4%, or $3.67, to $87.75 in morning trading, after reaching an all-time high of $88.29 earlier.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged by the steady momentum building across the business,\u201d Walmart's Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told analysts during Tuesday's earnings call.",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailer to report quarterly results and provides a peek into how Americans are feeling as they head into the holiday season. Rainey told The Associated Press during a call on Tuesday that shoppers are spending more on food than general merchandise, and they're becoming more discerning when it comes to big-ticket items like TVs.",
      "One of the most challenging parts of the business has been the clothing business, dragged down by unseasonably warm weather that has made it hard to sell sweaters and coats, Rainey said.",
      "Industry analysts expect consumers to show up in force, though sales may not meet last year spending levels by Americans.",
      "A post-pandemic inflation spike sent prices about 20% higher overall compared with three years ago and it soured Americans\u2019 outlook on the economy, a key reason given by voters for sending Donald Trump back to the White House.",
      "Yet even as many complained of how costs have strained household budgets, strong consumer spending continues to drive steady growth in the U.S. economy. Retail sales rose 0.4% from September to October, the Commerce Department said Friday, a solid increase though it was half of the previous month\u2019s jump.",
      "Walmart reported net income of $4.58 billion, or 57 cents per share, in the three months ended Oct. 31. That compares with $4.53 billion, or 6 cents per share, in the year-ago period.",
      "Adjusted earnings were 58 cents per share, 5 cents better than Wall Street had expected, according to a survey by FactSet.",
      "Sales rose 5.5% to $169.59 billion, up from $160.8 billion in the year-ago period, and also easily beat analyst projections.",
      "Comparable store sales \u2014 which include online and stores open for the past 12 months \u2014 rose 5.3% in the U.S. That is an acceleration from the 4.2% jump in the U.S. in the second quarter and 3.8% in the first quarter.",
      "Sales reflect broad-based strength across all product categories and physical and digital channels, the company said.",
      "The number of transactions and the average amount customers spent during each of those transactions was higher in this quarter than it was during the same three months last year. Walmart said its market share gain continues to be driven by higher income households making more than $100,000 a year.",
      "Global e-commerce sales rose 27%, compared with 21% in the fiscal second and first quarter.",
      "Analysts are also sifting through Walmart\u2019s results and other retailers' results regarding Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs. Trump has vowed that he\u2019ll put a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the United States imports.",
      "Companies have already rerouted some production away from China, but an aggressive trade policy could accelerate those plans. Rainey told The Associated Press that the company over the past few weeks has moved up some imports to brace for any new tariffs or potential port strikes in January. Rainey noted that two-thirds of what Walmart sells is made or grown in the U.S., but it will feel pressure to raise prices if Trump's tariffs are implemented.",

      "The annual figures are rounded to the nearest 50,000. Kendall said this meant \"small variations in the underlying numbers impacted can lead to much larger changes in the rounded headline numbers\".",

      "A person is considered to be living in relative poverty if they have less than 60% of the median income.",
      "In her letter, Kendall said the work and pensions department had written to 120,000 pensioners to encourage them to claim the pension credit to which they may be entitled.",
      "She added that the decision to cut the winter fuel payments was \"not a decision this government wanted or expected to take\".",
      "\"However, we were forced to take difficult decisions to balance the books in light of the \u00a322bn black hole we inherited.",

      "\"Their winter fuel payment cuts are going to plunge 100,000 pensioners into poverty in the next few years.",

      "Tesco, Amazon, Greggs, Next and dozens of other chains are urging the Treasury to reconsider some of the measures.",
      "In a letter to Chancellor Rachel Reeves, they said the \"cumulative burden\" of the Budget changes and other policies already in the pipeline will add billions in costs to a sector with a 3% to 5% profit margin.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said it had had to \"make difficult choices to fix the foundations of the country\", while one union called the letter \"pathetic\".",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the Treasury Committee on Tuesday he had seen the letter and it was \"right\" to say jobs could be affected.",
      "He said the employer National Insurance (NI) tax rise from the Budget could mean higher inflation, lower wage growth, or higher unemployment, adding in written evidence to the committee the Bank will be \"gradual\" on interest rate cuts as a result.",
      "Measures in the Budget, in particular the employer NI increase, have been met with a tide of criticism from business, who argue it will hold back growth.",
      "But concerns have been loudest among retailers and hospitality businesses, where many young people find their first jobs. Firms in those sectors are also facing higher costs from next year's rise in the minimum wage.",
      "Though many individual retailers have already spoken out, this letter marks the first time so many have done so together.",
      "The 81 signatories of the letter range from big British retailers - such as Aldi, Asda, Boots, Currys, John Lewis, Lidl, Marks & Spencer, Primark and Sainsbury's - to charity shop group the British Heart Foundation and trade group Associated Independent Stores.",
      "The government has defended its tax rises as necessary to avoid cuts to public services, and the rise in the minimum wage, with a bigger boost for younger workers and apprentices, has been welcomed by trades unions.",
      "The letter from the businesses belonging to the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said: \"The sheer scale of new costs and the speed with which they occur create a cumulative burden that will make job losses inevitable, and higher prices a certainty.\"",
      "It calculated the changes would add over \u00a37bn a year in costs, adding it would \"not be possible to absorb such significant cost increases over such a short timescale\".",
      "\"The effect will be to increase inflation, slow pay growth, cause shop closures, and reduce jobs, especially at the entry level.\"",
      "However, Nadine Houghton, GMB Union national officer, said larger businesses \"pleading poverty\" was \"utterly pathetic\".",
      "\u201cMost of these companies\u2019 fortunes are already subsidised by the taxpayer. They pay very low wages which then have to be topped up by in-work benefits,\" she added.",

      "The rise in the minimum wage from April is set to cost the sector a further \u00a32.73bn, the BRC letter said.",
      "In addition, from October 2025 a new packaging levy comes into force.",
      "Introduced by the previous government, the extended producer responsibility (EPR) scheme shifts the cost of recycling from local councils onto the companies that use the packaging.

      "Mr Stowe, who signed the BRC letter, said the sector was being forced into things which run counter to the government's growth agenda.",
      "Mark Neale, the boss of outdoor retailer Mountain Warehouse, who also signed the letter, told the BBC he would \"prefer to pay more tax by growing the business\".",
      "The letter from the retailers calls for the government to phase in the introduction of the NI changes and delay the start of the EPR.",
      "It urges the government to reduce business rates, a property-related tax which the BRC says will cost retailers an additional \u00a3140m a year after next April, though there is a 40% relief available for 250,000 premises.",
      "The Treasury said that thanks to exemptions for smaller businesses, \"more than half of employers will either see a cut or no change in their national insurance bills [and] there will be \u00a322.6bn more for the NHS\".",
      "A business update from Begbies Traynor on Monday gave some weight to the BRC's warnings. The consultancy predicted more firms in financial difficulty would need its insolvency advice due to both the NI change and higher interest rates."

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has named investor Howard Lutnick, the co-chair of his transition team, to lead the US commerce department.",
      "In his announcement, Trump said Lutnick, the chief executive of financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald, would spearhead the administration's \"tariff and trade agenda\".",
      "Lutnick had also been in the running for treasury secretary, a more high-profile role.",
      "Trump has yet to make a decision about that closely watched post, which has sweeping authority in areas such as economic and tax policy.",
      "The fight over whom to pick has spilled into public view. Over the weekend,  billionaire Elon Musk promoted Lutnick for the position and criticised one of the alternative candidates, Scott Bessent, as too \"business as usual\".",
      "Lutnick, a self-described \"strong capitalist\", has praised Trump for offering a \"competitive growth model\".",

      "Lutnick, a native of Long Island, New York, is a long-time Republican and supporter of Trump, with whom he overlapped in the New York social scene. He appeared on Trump's reality TV show, The Apprentice, in 2008, according to the online film and television database imdb.",
      "He joined Cantor Fitzgerald right after his 1983 graduation from Haverford College, which he attended on scholarship. He lost both of his parents as a teenager - his mother to cancer and his father to a medical mistake.",
      "Within 10 years, he rose to be president and chief executive of the firm. It is known today in part for its investments in crypto and its affiliate in the property industry, the Newmark brokerage.",

      "His farming career began in the 1970s when he inherited a rubber plantation in the the southern Indian state of Kerala , which he managed alongside his career as a doctor.",
      "It was a bad time to inherit a rubber plantation, falling rubber prices meant it kept losing money. So, 10 years ago Dr Matthew decided to experiment with cocoa trees, hoping they would generate some funds to support the rest of the farm.",
      "He bought some saplings and planted them. It didn't go well.",
      "\"It was not that successful - most of the saplings died,\" he says.",
      "Squirrels appeared to be making the situation worse by grabbing cocoa bean pods and eating them.",
      "But those raids had an unexpected benefit -  cocoa seeds were spread all over the farm.",
      "\"All the scattered seeds soon grew in to plants and they were much healthier and stronger than the saplings I had planted,\" says Dr Matthew.",
      "\"The trick was in sowing the seeds,\" he realised.",
      "Today Mr Matthews has 6,000 cocoa trees on his 50 acres of land.",
      "\"I think it was the best decision I have made,\" he says.",
      "Despite having several regions with weather conditions suitable for cocoa trees, India only accounts for 1% of the world's cocoa bean production.",
      "Global production is currently dominated by West Africa, where C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana between them produce more than half of the world's annual output.",
      "Indian growers can only supply a quarter of the beans needed by Indian makers of chocolate and other confectionary.",
      "\"The challenge is that it is grown in very fragmented small holdings, so it does not get the kind of attention cocoa should get,\" says Renny Jacob, chairman of India Cocoa, a private company that has been growing and processing cocoa beans for more than 30 years.",
      "In particular he says that Indian farmers are poor at handling beans after they have been harvested. Once removed from their pods, beans go through a fermentation process at the farm, which can make a huge difference to their flavour.",
      "\"Cocoa fermentation is a critical process in the production of chocolate, transforming raw cocoa beans into a form suitable for chocolate making,\" says Sarin Partrick, chief executive of India Cocoa.",

      "Government research suggests that an average farm last year made a profit of about \u00a345,300 - although that figure may be overstated as it is based on a survey that excluded farms that bring in the least money.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:01:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Spray foam insulation was previously subsidised in England under the government's Green Homes Grant scheme.",
    "story": [
      "Homeowners with spray foam insulation are struggling to sell or remortgage as some major lenders are rejecting properties with it fitted, the BBC has found.",
      "A quarter of the UK's biggest mortgage providers will not lend against homes with spray foam in the roof, our research suggests.",
      "It is estimated as many as 250,000 homes in the UK have this type of insulation, with much of it installed under the previous government's Green Homes Grant scheme.",
      "\"We were blissfully unaware of any issues to do with it until we put the house on the market,\" said Wendy Rowe, whose family struggled to sell her late father\u2019s home and paid thousands to have the insulation removed.",
      "Some mortgage firms are reluctant to deal with homes with spray foam insulation due to concerns over poor fitting leaving moisture trapped and roof timbers at risk of decay.",
      "But the Insulation Manufacturers Association said spray foam can be beneficial if properly installed, and it was worried homeowners could be needlessly driven to \"cowboy\" removals companies.",
      "Ms Rowe told the BBC that when her father Alan Chawner was offered spray foam insulation in his loft, he thought it would make his ex-council property in Leicester  warmer and cut his energy bills.",
      "As a pensioner who claimed the attendance allowance, the entire \u00a34,331 cost of the  installation was covered by the Green Homes Grant scheme, which ran in England until 31 March 2021.",
      "'Left high and dry'",
      "However, the work was not up to scratch, according to a report by Stephen Hodgson, the former boss of the Property Care Association (PCA) who now inspects properties with spray foam and trains surveyors.",
      "After sales stalled and difficult conversations with lenders, Ms Rowe agreed to replace the roof entirely, splitting the cost of nearly \u00a310,000 with new buyers.",
      "She said it has cost the family thousands more in surveyors' and administration fees and utility bills.",
      "The firm that installed the spray foam, SealSixty, gave the family \u00a3400 as a gesture of goodwill and said the work met all the requirements set out by the Green Homes Grant scheme at the time.",
      "Ms Rowe said that her family had been \"left high and dry\".",
      "\"It was installed under a government initiative, and you really don\u2019t expect them to turn their back,\" she said.",
      "What is spray foam insulation?",
      "Spray foam insulation has been used to stop heat escaping from roofs, lofts and attics for decades and comes in two forms.",
      "Closed cell spray foam is rigid once set. It is a better thermal insulator and was previously sold to stabilise failing roofs. But if it has been used inappropriately or installed poorly, it might put stress on timbers, restrict air circulation and put them at risk of decaying.",
      "Open cell spray foam remains soft once set and is only used for insulation. It is more breathable but is often installed where a highly-resistant underlay like bitumen felt is already present, stopping vapour from escaping.",
      "While a recent report by the Health and Safety Executive highlighted situations where using open cell was low-risk, it cautioned against applying it directly to roof tiles.",
      "Homes insulated in government scheme go mouldy",
      "'It cost me \u00a34,500 to repair foam insulation damage'",
      "The nature of spray foam can make it tricky for valuers acting on behalf of lenders to inspect the condition of roof timbers.",
      "When the BBC contacted the 20 largest lenders in the UK, five of them, TSB Bank, Skipton Building Society, Co-operative Bank, Principality and equity release lender Aviva - said they did not lend against properties where spray foam is found in the roof space.",
      "The Yorkshire Building Society and Metro Bank said they would not usually lend where there is a significant amount of spray foam.",
      "Equity release provider More 2 Life told the BBC it will only lend on properties with spray foam where it was fitted as part of an authorised new build and has the necessary documentation.",
      "Other lenders such as Lloyds, Nationwide, Barclays, the NatWest Group and Santander have said they consider applications on a case-by-case basis, and will take a valuer's report into account.",
      "They may, however, ask homeowners for documentation showing it has been installed correctly or for a specialist report to be carried out.",
      "In 2023, the PCA published an inspection protocol in a bid to help surveyors and lenders assess any potential risk in pitched roofs.",
      "But homeowners like Gary Wright feel like they have been \"left in limbo\".",
      "When his two-year fixed-rate mortgage was up for renewal, he hoped to find a better rate.",
      "But when he applied he was shocked to discover open cell spray foam had been installed in 2009. It had not come up during surveys when he had bought the house.",
      "He decided to remove most of the foam in the loft himself, after receiving several expensive quotes.",
      "A surveyor still recommended a full roof report and Mr Wright felt he had to renew his mortgage with his current lender at a less preferable rate.",
      "\"We know that in the next two years, we need to get this fixed, and I can\u2019t afford to right now,\" he said.",
      "\"This phrase 'spray foam' has created fear [among lenders] based on a lack of knowledge,\" Simon Storer, chief executive of the Insulation Manufacturers Association, told the BBC.",
      "He suggested \"hares were set running\" by previous industry guidance that has since been withdrawn.",
      "\"Insulating is a very good thing,\" he said, adding: \"But as with any building work, it needs to be done correctly\".",
      "He said the organisation was also concerned about unregulated companies targeting older, potentially vulnerable, homeowners pushing them to pay for an overpriced removal service during cold calls.",

      "Spirit, which has not recorded a full-year profit since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, is the first US airline to file for bankruptcy in more than a decade. American Airlines declared bankruptcy in 2011 to cut labour costs during a period of high fuel prices.",

      "The NNPC swaps Nigeria\u2019s crude oil for the refined products, including petrol, which are shipped back home.",
      "Exactly how much money changes hands and who benefits from these \"oil swaps\" is just one of the unknowns in these deals.",
      "\"No-one has been able to nail down who exactly has benefited. It\u2019s almost like a beer parlour gossip about who is getting what,\" says Toyin Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "The NNPC began subsidising the price of petrol in the 1970s to cushion the blow when global prices soared. Every year it clawed this money back by depositing lower royalty payments - the money it received for every barrel pumped out of the ground - with the Nigerian treasury.",
      "In 2022 the subsidy cost the government $10bn, more than 40% of the total money it collected in taxes.",
      "On his second day in office Nigeria\u2019s Vice-President Kashim Shettima referred to \"the fuel subsidy scam\" being \"an albatross around the neck of the economy\".",
      "Nigerian oil expert Kelvin Emmanuel says in 2019 the country\u2019s official petrol consumption \"jumped by 284% to 70m litres per day without empirical evidence to justify such a sharp increase in demand\".",
      "Parliament has previously reported that - at least on paper - importers were being paid to bring in far more petrol than the country consumed. There was a lot of money to be made exporting some of the subsidised petrol to neighbouring countries where prices were far higher.",
      "The NNPC earned billions of dollars a year from the crude oil production. But for many years, under previous governments, some of its profits never reached the treasury as it was accused by state governors and federal lawmakers of including these inflated subsidy costs on its balance sheet.",
      "The NNPC did not respond to a request for an interview or a response to these allegations but in June denied it had ever \"inflated its subsidy claims with the federal government\".",
      "It may have been the main source of revenue for successive governments but for decades, until 2020, the board did not disclose its audited accounts. Its press release from March this year promised more transparency and accountability.",
      "After coming to power in May 2023, President Bola Tinubu said the subsidy was unsustainable and suddenly cut it - pump prices immediately tripled.",
      "He also stopped the policy of artificially propping up the value of the local currency, the naira, and let market forces determine its value.",
      "When he took over, the exchange rate was 460 naira to the US dollar. In November 2024 it was over 1,600.",
      "The triple shock of higher fuel prices, sporadic shortages of supply and a depreciating currency has been a tough body blow for people across the country, many of whom are forced to run generators to keep the lights on and phones charged.",
      "\"Beyond the financial burden, the uncertainty and stress of constantly dealing with fuel shortages have added a layer of anxiety to everyday tasks,\" is how one Lagos resident summed it up.",
      "\"I feel like I\u2019m always navigating through crisis mode. It\u2019s exhausting.\"",
      "As the naira plunged and pump prices increased several times, the government, aware of the potential danger of protests, continued to pipette some medicine to the masses.",
      "In a move which could be likened to swallowing half a paracetamol for acute appendicitis, the government made sure people were paying slightly less than the market rate for a litre of petrol.",
      "In other words, the NNPC was selling at a loss and the subsidy was still alive.",
      "But with two recent increases in October, Nigerians are now paying market prices for fuel for the first time in three decades. In the main city Lagos it went up from 858 naira ($0.52) to 1,025 naira per litre.",
      "One of the major factors in Nigeria\u2019s economic crisis has been a limited supply of foreign currency. The country does not export enough products and services to bring in the dollars.",
      "But lots of people, including fuel traders, have been chasing the same limited supply of foreign currency, which leads to the naira losing even more value.",
      "The good news is that Mr Dangote\u2019s facility is going to buy crude and sell refined fuels in Nigeria in the local currency, which will leave more dollars available for everyone else.",
      "The bad news for those hoping this will mean cheaper fuel is that the price Mr Dangote pays for a barrel of local crude will still be the naira equivalent of the international cost in dollars.",
      "So if the price of crude goes up on the world market, Nigerians will still be forced to fork out more naira. Refining locally will mean less freight costs but that\u2019s a relatively small saving.",
      "It is hoped that the arrival of Mr Dangote\u2019s oil refinery will help bring a measure of transparency to the sector.",
      "He knew he would be upsetting some of those who benefit from the murky status quo when the $20bn project began. But, he says, he underestimated the challenge.",
      "\"I knew there would be a fight. But I didn\u2019t know that the mafia in oil, they are stronger than the mafia in drugs,\" Mr Dangote told an investment conference in June.",
      "\"They don\u2019t want the trade to stop. It\u2019s a cartel. Dangote comes along and he\u2019s going to disrupt them entirely. Their business is at risk,\u201d says Mr Emmanuel, the oil expert.",
      "The fact that there have been some public disagreements with the regulator has only fuelled that suspicion.",
      "Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery near Lagos is thirsty, with a capacity of 650,000 barrels of crude a day.",
      "You would have thought being located in Nigeria would make supply easy but then up pops this headline: \"Nigeria\u2019s Dangote buys Brazilian crude\".",
      "It follows a row over supply and pricing. The regulatory authority has complained about Mr Dangote\u2019s negotiating tactics.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s crude oil is low in sulphur and, as one of the most prized in the world, fetches a higher price than many of its competitors.",
      "When discussions over price began, Farouk Ahmed, the chief executive of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), accused Mr Dangote of \"wanting a Lamborghini for the price of a Toyota\".",
      "Mr Dangote has complained of not being allocated as much crude as earlier agreed but even when the price issue is resolved, he will still need to import some crude.",
      "\u201cNNPC doesn\u2019t have enough crude for Dangote. Despite all this instruction to give ample supply of crude to the refinery, NNPC can\u2019t supply Dangote with more than 300,000 barrels per day,\" says Mr Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "He says this is partly because the NNPC has pre-sold millions of barrels of oil for loans.",
      "In August 2023 it secured a $3bn loan from the Afreximbank financial institution. In return it is due to supply 164 million barrels of crude.",
      "In September the NNPC admitted it was significantly in debt. It was reported to be owing its suppliers around $6bn for fuel brought into the country.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s oil production has plummeted in recent years from around 2.1 million barrels per day in 2018 to around 1.3 million barrels per day in 2023.",
      "The NNPC has been stressing oil theft as the number one reason why production has dropped.",
      "It says in just one week - from 28 September to 4 October - there were 161 incidents of oil theft across the Niger Delta and 45 illegal refineries were \"discovered\".",
      "But Ms Anku believes that \"the theft problem is overrated by the NNPC and the oil sector\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a convenient excuse,\u201d she adds.",
      "She points to other contributing factors causing the drop in production, including international oil companies selling their on-shore oil fields - some of which may no longer be viable having pumped oil for 60 years.",
      "The 66-year-old Dangote, who is listed by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as the second wealthiest person in Africa, made his fortune in cement and sugar.",
      "He has always denied the suggestion that his empire benefitted from links to politicians in power who helped ensure he had a monopoly.",
      "Today there are those who are critical of Mr Dangote\u2019s tactics and amid tension with the regulatory authorities, the same accusation has resurfaced when it comes to the supply of fuel in Nigeria.",
      "\"Mr Dangote asked me to stop issuing licences for importation and that everyone should buy from him. To which I said 'No' because it\u2019s not good for the market. We have energy security interests,\" says Mr Ahmed of the regulatory authority.",
      "Mr Dangote has not commented on the accusation but has said it makes business sense for the traders to buy from his refinery rather than from outside.",
      "A feud between the regulator and Mr Dangote over supplies and pricing has rumbled on and morphed into another row with local fuel traders refusing to buy from the new refinery.",
      "The mud slinging has also included allegations that some traders have been buying up substandard fuel from Russia which is then blended with other products before being shipped into Nigeria.",
      "But not everyone is worried or surprised by the disagreements.",
      "Ms Anku points to lessons learnt from US businessmen back in the 19th Century.",
      "\"The JP Morgans and the Stanfords \u2013 they didn\u2019t have it easy either. That\u2019s why they had to go and get government support and subsidies to build their railways and so on.",
      "\"I see the drama as a very normal process as you\u2019re changing the structure of the economy. There are losers, they lash out. There\u2019s no chance they\u2019ll stop the refinery from working or selling its products to the Nigerian markets\u2026 in my view.\"",
      "The modern, local refinery has also led to a debate over the quality of fuel on the market. It is an important issue given the vast number of generators belching out fumes across Nigeria as a result of the woeful power supply.",
      "\"Every day I wake up to the smell of what I\u2019m sure [could] kill me. It\u2019s because of the quality of the diesel,\" says Mr Akinosho.",
      "He sees Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery as a real opportunity for higher quality petroleum products in Nigeria which would be better for both car engines and people\u2019s lungs.",
      "But right now, Nigerians being hit hard in the pocket may find it difficult to be optimistic.",
      "Arguments between officials at the Dangote refinery, the oil marketers and the regulators are batted back and forth in the media. All sides have been accused of hiding some facts and figures which leaves people guessing what is going on inside this still somewhat opaque industry.",
      "\"Everyone is a villain. There are no heroes here,\" concludes Mr Akinosho.",

    "story": [
      "One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.",
      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",
      "Given all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 00:09:24 GMT",
    "summary": "With its rich resources, uranium mining companies want Canada to play a key role in fuelling nuclear reactors worldwide.",
    "story": [
      "Uranium is making a comeback thanks to a renewed focus on nuclear energy as a climate crisis solution. Canada, rich with high-grade deposits, could become a nuclear \u201csuperpower\u201d. But can its potential be realised?",
      "Leigh Curyer had been working in uranium mining for nearly two decades when he noticed a striking shift.",
      "In 2011, the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan badly damaged the world's view of nuclear power, and the price for the heavy metal - a critical component for nuclear fuel - cratered.",
      "But the last five years has seen a reversal, with the global price of uranium spiking by more than 200%, becoming one of this year's top-performing commodities.",
      "Mr Curyer, an Australian-born businessman, credits this to a changing attitude that began soon after Microsoft founder Bill Gates touted nuclear energy as \u201cideal for dealing with climate change\u201d in 2018.",
      "Four years later, then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pushed forward a policy of generating at least 25% of the country\u2019s energy from nuclear.",
      "Shortly after, the European Union voted to declare nuclear energy climate-friendly.",
      "These events were \u201ccatalytic\u201d for the uranium industry and a turning point for Mr Curyer's company NexGen, which is behind the largest in-development uranium mine in Canada.",
      "His phone began to ring with calls from investors worldwide - something that \u201chad never happened in my previous 17 years in the industry\u201d, he said.",
      "NexGen, whose project is located in Canada's remote, uranium-rich Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, is now worth nearly $4bn (\u00a32.98bn), despite the fact that the mine won\u2019t be commercially operational until at least 2028.",
      "If fully cleared by regulators, NexGen\u2019s project alone could push Canada to become the world\u2019s largest producer of uranium over the coming decade, knocking Kazakhstan out of the number one spot.",
      "Other companies have also rushed to Saskatchewan to capitalise on the boom, starting their own exploration projects in the region, while existing players re-opened dormant mines.",
      "With its rich resources, Canada\u2019s mining companies see the country playing a major role in the future of nuclear energy, meeting a demand for uranium that is poised to rise after nearly two dozen countries committed in COP28 climate conference to tripling their nuclear energy output by 2050.",
      "Nuclear energy is often hailed for its low carbon emissions compared to other sources like natural gas or coal.",
      "The World Nuclear Association estimates that 10% of power generated worldwide comes from nuclear sources, while more than 50% is still generated by gas or coal.",
      "At this year's COP29, the focus has been on ramping up funding for nuclear projects in the wake of a recent UN report indicating that current policies and investments fall short of what is needed to slow global temperature rise.",
      "Canada\u2019s role in supplying the commodity is made more urgent by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, particularly for the US, which had relied heavily on Russian-supplied enriched uranium to fire up its commercial nuclear reactors.",
      "Mr Curyer believes his mine could prove to be \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d to America\u2019s nuclear energy future, as the US is now hunting for alternatives to Russia, including by ramping up exploration on its own soil.",
      "Uranium can be found around the world, though it is heavily present in Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan.",
      "But what makes Canada\u2019s Athabasca Region unique is that its uranium is especially high grade, said Markus Piro, a professor of nuclear engineering at McMaster University.",
      "Canada has set strict rules for the sale of its uranium to other countries, Prof Piro said, and mandates it only be used for nuclear power generation.",
      "The country is also referred to as a \u201ctier-one nuclear nation\u201d, he said, due to its capability to produce nuclear fuel from the mining to the manufacturing stage.",
      "Once mined, uranium is milled to produce what is called calcined yellowcake. It can then be enriched, if needed, at facilities overseas to create fuel for nuclear reactors.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a one-stop shop here in Canada, not every nation\u2019s like that,\u201d Prof Piro said.",
      "Canada is currently the world\u2019s second largest producer of uranium, accounting for roughly 13% of the total global output, according to the Canadian government. NexGen anticipates that once its mine is operational, it will boost that to 25%.",
      "Meanwhile, Cameco, which has been mining uranium in Saskatchewan since 1988 that supplies 30 nuclear reactors around the world, re-opened two of its mines in late 2022 to increase output.",
      "CEO Tim Gitzel told the BBC that he believes \u201cCanada could be a nuclear superpower around the world\u201d.",
      "But enthusiasm around nuclear energy is not without its critics.",
      "Some environmental groups worry nuclear projects are too costly and come with timelines that do not meet the urgency of the climate crisis.",
      "Data from the UK-based World Nuclear Association shows that 65 nuclear reactors are under construction across 16 countries, most of them in China, and a further 90 are in the planning stages.",
      "Some are expected to come online this year - others won\u2019t be ready until at least the end of the decade.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 100 nuclear plants have been closed in the last two decades around the world, including the sole nuclear power plant near New York City, which was retired in 2021 due to high operating costs and environmental and safety concerns.",
      "Plants were also shuttered in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Quebec, Canada.",
      "And not all of Canada is on board with the country\u2019s uranium industry.",
      "British Columbia sits on its own supply of uranium but has not allowed any nuclear plants or uranium mines to operate in the province since 1980.",
      "Critics have also expressed concern about radioactive waste nuclear reactors leave behind for future generations.",
      "Others fear another Fukushima-scale disaster, where a tsunami disabled three reactors, causing the release of highly radioactive materials and forcing mass evacuations.",
      "\u201cThe risk is not zero, that is for sure\u201d though it can be reduced, said Prof Piro.",
      "\u201cEven though amongst the general public there are mixed feelings about it, the reality is that it has produced very safe, very reliable and affordable electricity worldwide.\u201d",
      "The industry maintains the technology is both promising and viable.",
      "Mr Gitzel of Cameco said the industry has learned from past safety errors.",
      "\u201cAnd the public is buying on,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you that we have in Canada great public support for nuclear power.\u201d",
      "A 2023 Ipsos poll indicates that 55% of Canadians support nuclear energy.",
      "Still, past uranium booms in Canada have turned into dramatic busts.",
      "North of NexGen\u2019s proposed mine stands Uranium City, once home to 2,500 residents in its mid-20th Century heyday. In 1982, a major local mining firm shuttered operations over high costs and a soft market for uranium.",
      "Now, Uranium City\u2019s population is 91 people.",
      "But investors argue that there is a true global burgeoning demand for the commodity that poses a golden opportunity for Canada.",
      "NexGen anticipates that construction on its mine - which is awaiting clearance from Canada\u2019s federal nuclear regulator - will begin early next year.",
      "Mr Gitzel says around 100 other companies are now actively exploring Saskatchewan for deposits.",
      "As to when it will be on the market remains unclear.",
      "Mr Gitzel cautioned that some companies have started explorations in the past that never reached production stage. The timeline to get mining projects approved in Canada can also be lengthy.",
      "\u201cBuilding a mine is going to take five to 10 years, and so far, the only ones in operation are ours, so we will wait and see how it plays out,\u201d he said.",
      "For Mr Curyer, it is crucial that his project and others are realised in the next four years, for both Canada and the world.",
      "\u201cOtherwise, there is going to be a shortage in uranium, and that will subsequently impact power prices,\u201d he said.",

      "\"She had leukaemia, when I was making the movie The Boxer with Daniel Day Lewis, three weeks from the end I had to leave because she'd been diagnosed with leukaemia, they thought she wasn't going to get better but she fought back and she won it,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:49:51 GMT",
    "summary": "The romcom king returns with a Christmas movie but this time it's an animation.",
    "story": [
      "As we hurtle towards Mariah Carey's most lucrative holiday, families all over the UK will be pressing play on Christmas films such as Love Actually to get themselves into the festive spirit.",
      "The 2003 movie was one of a string of hits from writer-director Richard Curtis which dominated the box office at the turn of the millennium, alongside Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary and Four Weddings and a Funeral.",
      "Curtis is returning to the Christmas theme for his latest film, but this time around he has moved away from the traditional romcom and taken on his first animated project.",
      "\"The thing for me is, it's been a long time since I was, as it were, on the dating market,\" he tells BBC News. \"But I've been a dad for the last 25 years, so it was a real joy for me to be able to write about kids.\"",
      "The film-maker has described working on animation as \"a huge treat and revelation for me\", adding that the \"whole process is so different from the other movies I\u2019ve worked on\".",
      "That Christmas, released on Netflix on 4 December, is adapted from the book of short stories Curtis published in 2021.",
      "Set in the fictional coastal town of Wellington-on-Sea, the film follows a handful of families gearing up for Christmas Day. When a blizzard hits the town and leaves the parents separated from the children, their carefully planned celebrations are thrown into chaos.",
      "The theme of Christmas gone wrong was highly relatable to Swiss director Simon Otto, who has previously worked as an animator on How to Train Your Dragon and Enchanted.",
      "\"I know from my own family growing up, we had such a clear idea of the timeline of how Christmas or any tradition will unfold,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"And I can count more times where it didn't happen the way you expect and somehow something got messed up.",
      "\"We all have a Christmas memory where something goes wrong, those are the Christmases you remember the most, and at the end of that experience you always feel like, 'My god, we were able to be together for this time, and the realisation that that's what it's really all about.\"",
      "He adds: \"I thought there was a beautiful poetry in that which we really wanted to bring out in the film, and make it as familiar to people as we can, but also contemporary and real.\"",
      "The 90-minute film features the voices of Curtis regulars such as Bill Nighy, alongside Fiona Shaw, Jodie Whittaker, Lolly Adefope and Brian Cox as Santa Claus.",
      "That Christmas premiered at the London Film Festival in October, where it received broadly positive reviews from critics.",
      "\"It can be easy to sneer at the arrival of a new Christmas movie,\" noted the Hollywood Reporter's Lovia Gyarkye.",
      "\"Genuine holiday cheer is tough to conjure and, if you\u2019re not the intended audience for Hallmark-type saccharinity, the festive fare likely inspires more exasperation than joy.",
      "\"But this one slyly avoids the usual mawkishness by grounding its whimsical story in the real and prickly emotions of life.\"",
      "Next Best Picture's Philip Bagnall suggested the film is \"engineered to keep the kids busy around 4pm on Christmas Day while mum and dad sip their third Irish coffee in peace\".",
      "\"This is unlikely to become a festive classic,\" cautioned Screen Daily's Wendy Ide. \"But the message is a persuasive one: that Christmas comes in many shapes and forms and, ultimately, the only holiday tradition that is non-negotiable is goodwill to all.\"",
      "The film sees the children of the town left to fend for themselves, providing an opportunity to design the kind of Christmas Day they dreamed of, rather than the one planned by their parents which observed various family traditions.",
      "In one scene, the kids attempt to watch a Christmas film as their parents had suggested, but they get so bored they turn it off within moments. In a cheeky twist, the film they dismiss is Curtis's own Love Actually.",
      "Otto says he planted this joke in the movie without Curtis knowing. When the writer finally saw it, he jokes he found it \"very hurtful\".",
      "\"No, not really,\" he laughs. \"It reminded me of course that, when you say 'boring old Christmas movie', I think of Miracle on 34th Street or whatever, but when you say it to a young person, they say Love Actually. It was 20 years ago!\"",
      "One of the film's central questions is whether families should stick to traditions or be open to new experiences.",
      "\"The truth is that it shouldn't be all traditions nor a complete reinvention,\" Otto reflects, \"because some traditions are there for a reason, and we love them. We talk about Santa to our kids for a reason, because there's something magical.\"",
      "One striking thing about the film is how contemporary and diverse it feels. Curtis's earlier films were made in a different era, and he has said in recent years his approach to casting would be different today.",
      "But That Christmas does its best to make up for lost ground. As Ide noted in her review, the film \"unfolds in a fictional Suffolk seaside town... but the wide mix of accents and ethnicities suggests that the filmmakers have tried to cram the whole of Great Britain into this single tiny village\".",
      "It's not only the mixed-race family at the centre of the film which make it feel of the times. The children in the movie are concerned about climate change, and one has chronic anxiety.",
      "There are lighter modern flourishes too - the father in one family christens his van Beyonc\u00e9, smartphones play a big part in the plot, and the soundtrack features Dua Lipa and Ed Sheeran.",
      "Curtis acknowledges the conscious effort to make the film feel current. \"I started my career on a show called Not The Nine O'Clock News,\" he recalls, \"which was contemporary sketches, and I think always in my films I've tried to write jokes that make me laugh now, rather than traditional jokes.",
      "\"And the thing about being a parent is you spend most of your life in the real world of your kids, so I love the fact that it does feel modern, because life as it comes at you these days just is modern.\"",
      "Otto picks up: \"It felt true to me. If you take a snapshot of who lives [in the UK], it varies from region to region of course, but it's such a diverse, interesting, eclectic mix of people.",
      "\"It feels to me like that's the world we live in, and certainly we didn't want to create a world we lived in 10 years ago. If anything, we wanted to create a world we might live in 10 years from now, so more forward looking.\"",
      "The film is being released in a healthy year for animation, with The Wild Robot, Inside Out 2 and Flow among those competing in this year's awards race.",
      "But there is still a certain snobbery towards animated films, and only three have ever scored a best picture nomination - Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story 3 and Up.",
      "Director Guillermo del Toro has previously championed it as its own craft, commenting: \"Animation is not a genre for kids. It's a medium for art.\"",
      "Curtis agrees: \"I feel quite strongly about that at this moment, because for me, the two Spider-Verse movies are the most remarkable movies of the last 10 years.",
      "\"I watch them and I think, 'they must have taken 300 years to make, they're so extraordinary'. In the same way it's turned out that much pop music, which used to be looked down on, is really great, I think every genre can be great, and there are some amazing works of art in the world of animation.\"",

      "But the singer, who quit the band in 1995, took issue with the assertions, posting a lengthy message on Instagram on Sunday.",
      "BBC News has approached Martin-Smith for a comment.",
      "In the documentary, Martin-Smith said Williams had made him out to be \"evil\" and had blamed him for some of his behaviour, including his drug-taking.",
      "Responding specifically to that point, Williams told his former manager: \u201cAllow me to respond to your assertion. My drug taking was never your fault.",
      "\"My response to the warped world that surrounded me is solely my own. How I chose to self-medicate is and was something that I will be monitoring and dealing with for the whole of my life.",

      "\"That was the last time I saw you. I hope I have more grace and understanding when and if any of my own four children at such a vulnerable age behave in the same manner.\"",
      "Williams, who has since forged a successful solo career, also used his post to speak more generally about the pressures of being in a boyband.",
      "\"Nearly all members of boybands it seems have at some point a mental breakdown,\" he said.",
      "\"Your young charge at this time in his life was experiencing his first. You didn't excel in man management and it was here that, instead of a stern word and a pointed finger, an arm around the shoulder and a kind word would have been the best tact.\"",
      "He added: \u201cIf you are following the story closely, you can\u2019t help but notice a pattern emerge. Boys join a boyband. The band becomes huge. Boys get sick.",
      "\"Some are fortunate through a series of self-examinations and help to overcome their experience. Some never quite manage to untangle the mess of the wreckage of the past.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not breaking anyone\u2019s anonymity by sharing the side effects of boyband dysphoria that relate to just us lads.\"",
      "He outlined the struggles his bandmates have had in the past, including Gary Barlow's battles with an eating disorder and Mark Owen's struggles with alcohol abuse.",
      "Returning to his former manager, he told him he had \"deep admiration\" for his work and his ability to take big risks.",
      "But he added: \u201cNige, you continue to not come across as a relatable character and could do with a glow-up where redeemable features are concerned. Therefore you play into the narrative you don\u2019t want for yourself.\u201d",
      "He went on to urge Martin-Smith to take accountability and to \"admit your shortcomings\".",
      "The documentary, which reaches its conclusion this week, focuses on some of the biggest boybands to grace the charts during the 1990s and early 2000s."

    "summary": "But the streaming giant's first foray into live boxing was beset with technical glitches.",
    "story": [
      "Netflix says 60 million households worldwide tuned in live to see Mike Tyson take on Jake Paul, in the streaming giant's first foray into live boxing.",
      "The event, which was free for subscribers, is being hailed by the tech giant as a \"record breaking night\".",
      "However, fans hoping to watch have expressed their anger and disappointment after some reported Netflix crashed repeatedly throughout the fight.",
      "But there was also criticism from those who were able to tune in, with many saying they found the boxing match lacklustre.",
      "In the bout, which took place at the AT&T Stadium in Texas, former world heavyweight champion Tyson, 58, was beaten by YouTuber-turned-fighter Paul, 27.",
      "The fight attracted a huge amount of media coverage. Tyson is one of the most famous boxers on the planet, while Paul drew in a younger audience.",
      "There was a star-studded ringside audience including Charlize Theron, Ralph Macchio, Joe Jonas and Hasan Minhaj.",
      "Paul says 120 million viewers watched it live globally on Netflix, while the tech firm later stated \"60 million households\" around the world tuned in. It said it will reveal further viewing figures early next week.",
      "But some viewers reported experiencing buffering issues on the site, and some said they simply couldn't get onto it.",
      "The fight was \"unwatchable,\" wrote one X user. Another said she was \"furious\", while a third complained he \"did an all-nighter for nothing\".",
      "Netflix declined to comment on the technical glitches.",
      "Brendan Ashford, who lives in Devon, told BBC News he stayed up late to watch the fight, which took place in the early hours of Saturday morning UK time.",
      "\"I was interested to see how Mike Tyson, at 58, would perform against a much younger guy,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not in the habit of staying up late, but I thought it was worth it.\"",
      "He tried signing in on Netflix at around 04:00 GMT, and says initially it loaded 25%, and then it got to 75%, but after that it got stuck.",
      "\"I knew I had a good connection, so then I looked on social media and saw others were also experiencing issues,\" he said.",
      "\"It was really disappointing. I kept trying for a good hour before I gave up.\"",
      "Mr Ashford said it made him wonder how Netflix would fare with future live sports events, given the problems people encountered this time.",
      "\"It can't be good for their reputation,\" he said.",
      "On social media, there was a similar reaction from fans, who vented their frustrations.",
      "Many also posted pictures and videos of the fight failing to load, while some said the service failed at the key moments during the event.",
      "\"Had all my friends over to watch the Tyson vs. Paul fight. Not loading,\" wrote one X user.",
      "\"Shame on Netflix for not being able to handle the streaming of the Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul fight,\" wrote another.",
      "\"The lagging is so bad the fights are unwatchable to long time subscribers like me and other people I know at home with friends, family, snacks, and drinks but no fights.\"",
      "Another person simply asked, \"did Netflix not have enough time to prepare for the Tyson / Paul fight?\"",
      "'It needs to get this fixed'",
      "This isn't the first time Netflix has had issues with live streaming.",
      "Last year, it apologised after a much-publicised livestream of its hit dating show, the Love is Blind reunion, was delayed due to a glitch.",
      "The technical reason for the delay was unclear but the streaming giant said it was \"incredibly sorry\".",
      "No reason has been given for these latest issues, but Chris Stokel-Walker, a tech reporter, said that the huge demand to watch the fight was \"Netflix's undoing\".",
      "\"Netflix has done live broadcasting before,\" he said.",
      "\"What's different, was that this fight was so hyped.",
      "\"There were so many viewers that were wanting to watch this, given the personalities involved - Jake Paul with his huge following, Mike Tyson returning to the ring for the first time in decades.",
      "\"Even people who aren't major boxing fans wanted to tune in because of all the coverage.",
      "\"As a result, there was additional demand well above and beyond your average live event, like a comedy special, or the live golf tournament they previously broadcast.\"",
      "Mr Stokel-Walker said that with Netflix intending to move towards more live sports in future, including a new deal with WWE from next year, it \"needs to get this fixed\".",
      "\"They have to expect that if they're going to get into this world, they're going to have to get used to this volume of people coming,\" he said.",
      "\"The Tyson vs Paul fight was one of the most high profile examples of an event they\u2019ve done live, so it's really not ideal.",
      "\"People will be watching this and wondering can they cope.\"",

      "But she indicated we may hear more from her ex in due course, saying: \u201cI do think that he will talk about things eventually. I do think that when he\u2019s ready, like, maybe more will be said. But I think that\u2019s for him to do on his terms.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s gossip, it\u2019s real life and it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s a really deep situation. It\u2019s really sad.\"",

    "title": "Silent Men film asks why so many still struggle to open up",
    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 17:59:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Scottish filmmaker Duncan Cowles set out to ask why men tend to bottle up their emotions.",
    "story": [
      "Male mental health is back in the spotlight ahead of International Men's Day on Tuesday (19 November). The subject has received much more prominence in the last decade - something many would argue is long overdue.",
      "But while the high rates of male suicide have put the topic firmly on the national agenda - huge numbers of men still find it difficult to be openly vulnerable and discuss their feelings.",
      "With suicide the biggest killer of men under 50 in the UK, a new film explores why many men still bottle up their emotions, and asks whether such ingrained, systemic behaviour can be changed.",
      "Duncan Cowles, who directs Silent Men, is the first to admit his own struggles to open up emotionally to those closest to him, joking that tackling the subject for the documentary was \"like dragging myself backwards through a hedge\".",
      "Speaking at the Sheffield Documentary Festival earlier this year, he told BBC News it was an important journey to go on because the risks of ignoring your emotions are far scarier.",
      "\"I think there's still a lot of societal pressure around those traditional masculine traits,\" Cowles says. \"Being strong and things associated with being a leader or this stable, reliable, dependable figure.",
      "\"There's maybe something still seductive about that idea of that old-fashioned man, that James Bond character that a lot of us maybe grew up with. I think it's still quite sought-after by a lot of people.",
      "\"Whereas my experience is when you're a bit more open and vulnerable, that can actually lead to stronger relationships, and therefore more joy, connection and fulfilment. And yet still we're drawn to being closed off.\"",
      "If you are affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has information about services that can provide support and advice.",
      "If you are affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has information about services that can provide support and advice.",
      "The idea of men suffering in silence is nothing new. It was 1854 when Henry David Thoreau wrote: \"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.\"",
      "The fact that the essayist's most famous observation has survived for 170 years and is still quoted so widely today is a testament to its relatability - but also of how little progress has been made.",
      "Thoreau tapped into a feeling many men have, both then and now, of being unfulfilled - whether that's in their career, relationships or for reasons they can't quite put their finger on.",
      "Overwhelmed by the commitments or mundanity of day-to-day life, while simultaneously unwilling or unable to voice their emotions, men often find it hard to cope.",
      "Blue blanket theory",
      "\"I suppose it's always been something I've struggled with, opening up and showing emotions around family,\" Cowles says of his reasons for making the film.",
      "\"While I was at university, I'd done a little film which investigated that, but it always felt like this thing that I hadn't fully resolved in my life.\"",
      "Setting out to explore the subject further at the start of the film, Cowles posts an advert online, looking for men to speak to for the documentary. He then goes to interview some of those who reply.",
      "He travels around the country and speaks to men from different walks of life over several years. At one point, he attends a retreat where men gather for a weekend to do group therapy.",
      "\"I wanted to go on my own journey, parallel to speaking to men as part of the film. But it turned into a more personal film than I expected,\" he explains.",
      "The Scottish filmmaker interviews members of his own family and studies how their personalities shaped his own. \"My dad likes drilling holes in the wall, and his stamps, but he's not big on verbal communication,\" Cowles notes early on - painting a picture of fathers many will recognise.",
      "One trauma specialist interviewed for the film cites a study which found that babies in blue blankets - and therefore assumed to be boys - were touched for significantly less time than girls.",
      "\"So that's really interesting, what are we doing in our culture about socialising boys to not be touched as much, not be seen as vulnerable, not need emotional support as much as girls?\" she asks.",
      "\"The toughening up - 'be a brave boy, big boys don't cry' - that process of making you into a man, where someone has told you that that's what a man is, that a man has got to be emotionally strong.",
      "\"There are all these social constructs that kind of trap you, which is causing huge numbers of mental health issues for guys. We've got a big problem on our hands.\"",
      "Silent Men is Cowles' first feature documentary, but he previously won a Bafta Scotland award for his short film Isabella.",
      "Asked if it was difficult to get the men featured in the film to talk about their feelings, Cowles replies: \"Strangely not, because there's something about speaking to a stranger that can sometimes feel a lot easier than speaking to someone who's in your own family. I guess it's because you've less to lose.\"",
      "The insights from other men make for interesting viewing. One contributor, Ainslie, says his outlook changed after having a baby. But not necessarily in the way you might think - he says the responsibility of being a father actually meant there was less time and opportunity to find room for expressing his own emotions.",
      "Another man, Dom, tells his young son constantly how much he loves him, and says he hated the thought of anybody close to him dying without knowing how much they meant to him.",
      "One of the film's most affecting - and funniest - moments comes when the microphone Cowles' brother is using cuts out after the battery dies, and he uses that exact moment, when he can't fully be heard, to tell Duncan: \"I love you.\"",
      "Despite all the heavy talk, the film is peppered with moments of levity - the director occasionally cuts away abruptly from tough conversations to run footage of soothing shorelines and bumble bees on flowers.",
      "\"One thing I really wanted to do with this film is make it feel accessible, not all mental health based, but [to] also contain humour and leave people with a smile on their face,\" he says.",
      "The documentary builds towards a conclusion as Cowles sits down with his parents to tell them he loves them.",
      "While both are receptive, his father is somewhat dismissive of the \"airy-fairy\" nature of showing emotions, suggesting it's \"not a normal thing for a man\".",
      "Therefore, his father argues, if somebody isn't opening up, that's actually a good sign, as not feeling the need to be vulnerable means they are generally feeling content.",
      "Reflecting on his father's comments now, Cowles says: \"He comes from a generation where he doesn't want to see someone visibly upset, so if you're showing nothing, then that's a good thing [to him] because it means you're OK. I know what he means.",
      "\"Younger people seem to have a different opinion on these kinds of things, and they are more willing to open up,\" he notes. \"There's that awareness of the issue.\"",
      "Cowles admits on camera his worry that he will pretend to have made progress for the purposes of giving the film a happy ending, when in reality there may not have been any significant change.",
      "But several months after filming wrapped, Cowles says making the film \"definitely has\" altered his behaviour.",
      "\"I wouldn't say it's a Hollywood transformation,\" he laughs. \"It's been quite a gradual thing, and I wouldn't say I'm perfect by any means.",
      "\"But compared to what I was like before, my partner is very appreciative that I've changed, that I'm more conscious of it and able to recognise when I should open up a bit more.\"",
      "Silent Men is screened at Sheffield DocFest in June and is released in UK cinemas on 19 November."

      "But John Lewis has hit a \"more traditional\" feel, she added, after last year\u2019s advert  proved divisive.",
      "Its 2023 commercial featured a giant Venus flytrap. It left some viewers perplexed, as they questioned what a bloodthirsty plant had to do with Christmas.",

      "She falls through a rack of dresses and finds herself in a fantastical world, where she revisits moments in her life - from childhood through to teenage years and adulthood.",
      "There are no recognisable celebrities in the advert, something Charlotte Lock, customer director at John Lewis, told the BBC was deliberate.",
      "\"We get contacted every year by A-listers who want to be in our ad,\" she said.",

      "Ms Lock said they felt people wanted \"a bit of emotion and sentimentality\" after \"a tough year, with global conflict and an economic crisis\".",
      "\"The cost of living is still on people's minds, and people are concerned about the cost of Christmas,\" she said.",

      "Elsewhere, Greggs has enlisted Nigella Lawson to star in its first ever Christmas advert.",

    "title": "Glastonbury 2025: 11 tips for getting festival tickets",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 12:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Tickets go on sale this week, so here are some tips to maximise your chances of securing entry.",
    "story": [
      "Tickets for the Glastonbury Festival go on sale this week, with millions of fans expected to fight it out for a chance to attend the event, which will run from 25-29 June 2025.",
      "No headliners have been announced yet, but demand is expected to be higher than ever because the festival will take a year off in 2026.",
      "Last year, all 210,000 tickets sold out in just 58 minutes as more than 2.5 million people tried to log on and secure a place.",
      "\"There aren't enough tickets for everybody,\" organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC's Sidetracked podcast earlier this year. \"It's one of the worst parts of the job [because] we can't do anything about it. We definitely can't do two weekends.",
      "\"But a lot of the time,\" she added, \"people who really, really want to come often get tickets through volunteering or through competitions.\"",
      "So there's always hope... But if you're brave enough to run the gauntlet of the online ticketing system, here are a few tips that might (might) help improve your chances.",
      "READ NEXT: Glastonbury 2025 tickets go on sale",
      "1) Check your registration",
      "As part of an ongoing (and successful) campaign to stop touts, anyone who wants to attend Glastonbury has to be registered in advance.",
      "The registration window closed on Monday, 11 November - so if you're not on the list already, it's too late.",
      "Everyone else is urged to check their details in advance, to make sure everything is up to date.",
      "You will need to have the registration number and postcode for each person you are buying a ticket for when the sale begins.",
      "2) Decide between coach or general entry",
      "Glastonbury tickets come in two flavours - standard weekend tickets and coach weekend tickets.",
      "Weekend tickets mean you can arrive under your own steam by train or car - although beware Glastonbury's legendary tailbacks, and how depleted your energy levels might be on the way home.",
      "Coach tickets are more environmentally friendly and, according to some, increase your chances of success, depending on how remote your starting point is. However, it's important to note that festival tickets are distributed on the coach itself, so you can't cheat the system.",
      "Ticket and coach packages will go on sale at 18:00 GMT on Thursday, 14 November.",
      "General admission tickets will go on sale at 09:00 on Sunday, 17 November.",
      "3) Team up with your friends",
      "You can purchase up to six tickets once you reach the booking stage, as long as you have the registration details for each attendee.",
      "Logically, the more people trying for tickets, the better the chances are of securing a space - so make sure all six of you are trying to log on when tickets go on sale (NB not in the same house... see below for why).",
      "Your syndicate doesn't have to be formed of people you're physically going to the festival with. It can be friends, colleagues, aunts, uncles, neighbours or Chris Martin from Coldplay. The point is that you're working together.",
      "Make a group chat so you can co-ordinate your efforts and, most importantly, put all of your registration numbers and postcodes in a shared document so the first person to reach the front of the queue is ready.",
      "4) Don't fall for scam websites",
      "The demand for Glastonbury tickets inevitably attracts scam artists and fraudsters, who prey on people's desperation to separate them from their money.",
      "Tickets are sold exclusively at glastonbury.seetickets.com. Avoid the temptation of buying from elsewhere.",
      "5) Log on early",
      "This year, Glastonbury has introduced a new queueing system that requires you to log on in advance.",
      "That way, when the ticket sale starts, you will be randomly assigned a place in the queue.",
      "People who join later will automatically be placed at the back of the line, so it pays to be punctual.",
      "Also, 09:00 on Sunday isn't the most sociable time of the week. Set an alarm. Set multiple alarms. Get an insomniac friend to come over to your house and poke you with a stick. Whatever works.",
      "If it's possible (and I apologise for this in advance), you could even drag yourself into work. No matter how good your wifi is at home, a work computer could have a more stable connection.",
      "6) Don't use multiple devices",
      "Using multiple devices and browser tabs can result in errors and may even get you kicked out of the queue, which you definitely don't want.",
      "Sticking to one device per household also makes the process more fair, according to the Glastonbury website.",
      "\"Whilst we understand that everyone wants to have the best possible chance of booking a ticket, running multiple devices simultaneously to attempt to access the website is a waste of valuable resources, and doesn\u2019t reflect the ethos of the festival.",
      "\"Please stick to one device and one tab, so that you can focus on entering your details without confusing your browser and help us make the ticket sale as quick and stress free as possible for all.\"",
      "7) Familiarise yourself with the booking process",
      "A limited number of people will be given access to the booking system at any one time. Before that, you will be held in a queue.",
      "When (or if) you get through, you will be asked to enter the registration number and postcode for the lead booker and up to five other people. Copy and paste them, instead of entering manually, to avoid errors.",
      "When you proceed, the next page will summarise the details you entered. Check them carefully because they cannot be changed.",
      "If you are booking a coach package, the next step will be to choose the time, date and place you will depart from. It is only possible to book tickets from one departure town in a single transaction.",
      "Once that's all confirmed, you will be asked to enter payment details.",
      "8) Have your payment information ready",
      "This year, Glastonbury tickets cost \u00a3375.50 each plus a \u00a35 booking fee - but at the check-out you will only pay a deposit of \u00a375, with the balance due in the first week of April. (Children aged 12 and under go free, and do not need to be registered.)",
      "Make sure you have enough money in your account (\u00a3450 if you're buying for six people) and, crucially, keep your card details to hand.",
      "When the time comes, enter these details exactly as you see them because a mistake could result in the purchase being declined. In some cases, that could leave your registration details being frozen for up to 10 minutes.",
      "Finally, make sure your phone is charged and notifications aren't silenced, in case your bank contacts you for verification.",
      "9) Check your email",
      "Once you've made the booking, be sure to check your email for confirmation - including the junk folder.",
      "If you don't receive an email within three hours, ticket-holders are urged to contact See Tickets on their customer service portal.",
      "10) Don't despair",
      "If you're not one of the lucky ones, there's still hope.",
      "It's possible to get into the festival as a volunteer - typically working three eight-hour shifts in return for a ticket.",
      "And in April, a number of returned or unwanted tickets will be put up for sale. At which point, you can go through the stress of applying all over again.",
      "11) Indulge in wild speculation about the line-up",
      "This won't help you get tickets, but is an essential part of the annual routine.",
      "Nobody except Emily Eavis knows who'll be headlining next year - but rumours are rumours, and everybody enjoys speculating about the line-up.",
      "Oasis, whose reunion tour takes place next summer, have already ruled themselves out. But current contenders for the top slots include Sam Fender, who put on an incredible Pyramid Stage performance two years ago; and Olivia Rodrigo, who's already headlining the BST Festival in London on Glastonbury weekend.",
      "Eminem and Rihanna are among the perennial will-they/won't-they headliners, while Billy Joel and Stevie Wonder are supposedly in the running for the legend slot.",
      "In previous years, piecemeal confirmation of the line-up has started in November, but the full rundown is typically kept under wraps until March.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:58:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Around 630,000 women are waiting for gynaecology appointments as waiting lists double in four years.",
    "story": [
      "Waiting lists for gynaecology appointments across the UK have more than doubled since February 2020, BBC research reveals.",
      "Records show around three-quarters of a million (755,046) women's health appointments are waiting to happen - up from 360,400 just before the pandemic.",
      "This would suggest around 630,000 people - at the very least - are on the list to be seen for problems that range from fibroids and endometriosis to incontinence and menopause care.",
      "Health ministers across the UK say they are working on plans to improve the situation, but health leaders say that women are being let down.",
      "'The illness controls my whole life'",
      "Anna Cooper, 31, from near Wrexham in North Wales, has had severe endometriosis since her teens.",
      "The condition - where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows outside it  - has  left her with permanent organ damage.",
      "She has had to have 17 operations, including a hysterectomy to remove her womb.",
      "She also has two stomas in place for life because much of her bladder and bowel have had to be removed. She lives with her partner and young daughter.",
      "\"The disease controls my social life, my work life and my ability to function every day.",
      "\"It is not just a period problem - it is a whole body problem. It ripples through your body,\" she says.",
      "The BBC spoke to her in 2023 about setting up her own charity, Menstrual Health Project.",
      "A year on, she says she is still in pain and is on the NHS waiting list yet again because she has experienced bleeding after her hysterectomy.",
      "Anna wears a morphine patch to help deal with pain every day.",
      "But for years, she says medics did not listen to her, and told her the pain was \"in her head\" and that she had to \"just get used to it\".",
      "She feels getting a diagnosis sooner would have changed her life: \"The delay in my care has cost me some of my major organs.",
      "\"Doctors have told me that if they'd caught it sooner, I wouldn't have ended up the way I am, living with two stomas and being in early menopause at the age of 31.\"",
      "In the last three years she made the decision to spend \u00a325,000 on private operations, borrowing money to help.",
      "She counts herself lucky to get private care but feels she was \"almost left with no choice\" because the waiting lists are so long: \"I can be a mum who isn't just in her bed constantly because she is crippled with pain.\"",
      "Endometriosis has \"mentally tormented\" her for the most of her adult life.",
      "\"It is really difficult dealing with a condition where I look absolutely fine from the outside, but internally, I'm just in despair.\"",
      "'Lack of priority'",
      "\"Women are being let down\" and change is \"urgently needed,\" says Dr Ranee Thakar, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG).",
      "The college's new report looks at the impact on people waiting for care.",
      "\"Gynaecology is the only elective speciality that solely treats women and has one of the worst waiting lists across the UK.",
      "\"This reflects the persistent lack of priority given to women and women\u2019s health, \" Dr Thakar says.",
      "\"Women are suffering. We know it is affecting their mental health. They are not able to go to work, they are not able to socialize.\"",
      "Dr Thakar adds that if the women had been treated earlier, their conditions wouldn't have progressed as much, and they would continue to contribute to society.",
      "A recent report led by the NHS Confederation suggests being absent from work because of heavy periods, endometriosis, fibroids and ovarian cysts costs the UK economy nearly \u00a311 billion each year.",
      "The RCOG is calling for governments to commit more long-term funding, to ensure people get the help they need.",
      "There are some signs that waiting lists are starting to improve.",
      "Waits have not been rising as steeply this year and NHS England's latest figures show there has been a drop in numbers on the waiting list of over 4,700 compared to the month before.",
      "But the situation is still much worse than pre-pandemic. In Feb 2020 there were 66 gynaecology  waits of more than a year. Now there are more than 22,000.",
      "Women on gynae waiting lists 'feel abandoned'",
      "Dr Sue Mann, NHS England's national clinical director for women\u2019s health, acknowledged  some women wait too long for crucial gynaecology appointments, despite staff working hard to see more patients.",
      "She says one way of helping is specialist teams working outside of hospitals.",
      "\u201cSome of these conditions can be managed very well by specialist healthcare teams in the community, which is why we are expanding neighbourhood women\u2019s health hubs in every local care system across the country.\"",
      "In Wales, the government plans to publish a women's health plan next month.",
      "\u201cA 10-year Women\u2019s Health Plan is being developed to drive the improvement needed to provide good quality health services to women throughout their lifetime,\"  a Welsh Government spokesperson said.",
      "Regions in Northern Ireland are working on plans to improve gynaecology services, taking on the 20 recommendations made in a recent report.",
      "The department of health says some will require \"additional funding and lead-in time.\"",
      "Scotland's Women\u2019s Health Minister Jenni Minto said excessively long waits were not acceptable and more money was going towards women's health.",
      "\"That is why one of the initial priorities of the women\u2019s health plan is to improve access for women to appropriate support, diagnosis and treatment.\"",
      "Anna Cooper is hoping ministers \"follow through with their words\".",
      "When governments say they are going to prioritize women's health, then they need to show they are doing just that, she says.",
      "\"Currently they are not showing it, and this is people's lives we are rolling the dice on... And having a daughter, I really fear for young girls' and women's futures.\"",
      "How we arrived at the figures",
      "To estimate the size of the gynaecology waiting list for the UK we added together the most recent figures available for all four nations, as tracked by the RCOG.",
      "This includes waits for gynaecology appointments and planned procedures and excludes urgent appointments for things like suspected cancer.",
      "It tells you how big the waiting list is, but some patients may need more than one appointment.",
      "Our estimate for the number of people waiting is at least 634,239  - and it  could be considerably more.",
      "We worked this out by looking at data from the NHS in England that suggests across waiting lists there is around a 16% difference between the number of appointments and people waiting.",
      "We have applied this to the gynaecology waiting list.",
      "It could underestimate the size of the problem, as gynaecology patients are less likely to be waiting for two appointments than patients in some other specialities.",

      "Aviva's TPN was made in St Thomas' hospital's pharmacy - which is known as a \"Section 10\" setting. Hospital pharmacists will typically make bespoke medicines for highly dependent patients with niche needs.",
      "Such medicines are not subject to the same regulatory process as those produced by private manufacturers. This means that any problems with them do not need to be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) or to other trusts.",

      "He added: \"There may be times when section 10 entities reach conclusions which would assist the wider industry and help to assist both other trusts and commercial organisations.\"",
      "Dr Morris also highlighted that Bacillus cereus is resistant to some cleaning methods and that sporicides - disinfectants that kill microbial spores - can be required to achieve decontamination.",
      "He said St Thomas' Hospital knew this prior to the outbreak later that year but did not pass on its findings.",
      "ITH Pharma was fined \u00a31.2m by a crown court in 2022 after providing TPN from which 19 premature babies became infected across nine hospitals in 2014, including Oscar and Yousef.",

    "summary": "The new measures aim to stop private care home providers benefiting excessively from a stretched system.",
    "story": [
      "Plans aimed at preventing companies that run children's homes in England from making excessive profits will be set out by the government on Monday.",
      "It says it will bring forward new measures that will require large providers to disclose their finances. If they do not limit their profits voluntarily, they will face a legal limit on how much they can make.",
      "The government also intends to strengthen the powers regulator Ofsted has to investigate and fine \"exploitative\" children's home providers that prey on a stretched care system.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said \"thousands of children have been failed\" within the care system.",
      "\"Frankly some of the accommodation and placements are deeply, deeply shocking,\" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that this was due to both the conditions and the \"terrible outcomes\" for some of the most vulnerable children in the country.",
      "The changes are part of a major overhaul of the children\u2019s social care system, which supports and protects vulnerable young people.",
      "The measures come as council-run children's services are struggling with rising demand, complex cases and spiralling costs.",
      "Local authorities say there were more than 1,500 children in 2023 for whom councils were paying more than \u00a3500,000 a year to be placed in residential homes, with a lack of other options being the most common reason.",
      "Meanwhile, a 2022 report by the Competition and Markets Authority found the 15 largest children's home providers make an average 23% profit per year.",
      "The government will set out legislation in Parliament on Monday that will require major care home providers to share their finances with the government, so it can challenge what it describes as profiteering.",
      "This will also include a \"backstop\" law that would place a limit on those profits, which the government can put into effect if the companies do not do so voluntarily.",
      "The government says the measure will also allow it to ensure that the largest providers do not suddenly collapse into administration, leaving children homeless.",
      "But Andrew Rome, an accountant and leading analyst in the field, said the 10 largest providers only account for 26% of all children's homes in England, with many providers being much smaller.",
      "He told the BBC that this measure will miss \"smaller opportunists who are charging the extraordinary prices for unregulated [or] unregistered services\".",
      "Mr Rome also said gaining oversight of large providers' finances would be difficult as they often operate through a network of companies, while smaller firms may only have to disclose limited financial information.",
      "He added that a \"backstop\" law to limit profits was \"close to impossible to design and police\".",
      "The government also intends to give Ofsted the power to issue private providers, including unregistered homes, with civil fines to \"deter unscrupulous behaviour\".",
      "It accused some providers of \"siphoning off money that should be going towards vulnerable children\" from homes that \"don\u2019t meet the right standards of care\".",
      "In September, a court in Liverpool heard that unregistered children's homes were demanding up to \u00a320,000 per child a week from a local authority. The council said it was forced to agree to such fees because it could not find anywhere else to place the children - despite it being unlawful to send them there.",
      "Ofsted will also be empowered to investigate multiple homes being run by the same company.",
      "The government says it is acting on the recommendation of a child safeguarding panel, which reviewed allegations of abuse at three children's homes in Doncaster run by the Hesley Group.",
      "In 2023, the BBC revealed that more than 100 reports concerning abuse and neglect were logged at the sites between 2018 and 2021. Children were allegedly beaten, locked outside naked in the cold and had vinegar poured on cuts.",
      "At the time, Hesley made a 16% profit from the sites it ran.",
      "Ofsted received 108 reports about the sites, which housed children with disabilities and complex health needs, but still rated them as \"good\". The regulator and the Hesley Group have both since apologised for the failings, and the three homes have been closed.",
      "An expert panel tasked to review the incidents said a \"major overhaul\" of the safeguarding system was needed.",

      "The vitamin folate, also known as vitamin B9, is found in everyday foods such as beans and some green vegetables, meaning most people receive a sufficient dose  from eating a regular, healthy diet.",

      "It is not just a business, but an identity, a belonging, a geographical rootedness \u2013 and the prospect of not being able to pass it on generates huge anger and emotion.",
      "That is a big part of the explanation for why this argument has got so noisy, so quickly.",
      "Secondly, contested notions of fairness are so often central to the most contentious political arguments, and this one is no different.",
      "The government argues existing inheritance tax isn\u2019t fair or sustainable \u2013 as everyone else sufficiently well off to pay it is charged 40% and farmers are charged nothing.",
      "Ministers also argue the exemptions have tempted rich folk to buy up farm land \u2013 pushing up its value \u2013 primarily to avoid inheritance tax.",
      "And, as they are at pains to point out over and over again, they insist the vast majority of family farms will be unaffected and those that are will be charged 20%, half the rate charged to anyone else caught within its grasp.",
      "Plus, they say, schools and hospitals desperately need more money.",
      "Others say the farmers are a noisy, well-organised lobby group seeking to shield their often considerable wealth and perpetuate a privilege to the exclusion of others.",

      "\u201cA good way of thinking about it is how child benefit currently operates,\u201d the Scottish Labour leader told BBC Scotland.",

      "'Tough' decision",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously defended his \"tough\" decision to cut winter fuel payments.",
      "He also issued a \"guarantee\" that an increase in the state pension - which is set to rise by \u00a3460 per year in April - would \"outstrip\" losses for those who will not receive the winter fuel payment, which is either \u00a3200 or \u00a3300.",

      "Remember the context here: there's a Holyrood election in 2026, and Scottish Labour won't want to be associated with any UK Labour unpopularity around that time.",

      "Plans aimed at preventing companies that run children's homes in England from making excessive profits will be set out by the government on Monday.",
      "It says it will bring forward new measures that will require large providers to disclose their finances. If they do not limit their profits voluntarily, they will face a legal limit on how much they can make.",
      "The government also intends to strengthen the powers regulator Ofsted has to investigate and fine \"exploitative\" children's home providers that prey on a stretched care system.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said \"thousands of children have been failed\" within the care system.",
      "\"Frankly some of the accommodation and placements are deeply, deeply shocking,\" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that this was due to both the conditions and the \"terrible outcomes\" for some of the most vulnerable children in the country.",
      "The changes are part of a major overhaul of the children\u2019s social care system, which supports and protects vulnerable young people.",
      "The measures come as council-run children's services are struggling with rising demand, complex cases and spiralling costs.",
      "Local authorities say there were more than 1,500 children in 2023 for whom councils were paying more than \u00a3500,000 a year to be placed in residential homes, with a lack of other options being the most common reason.",
      "Meanwhile, a 2022 report by the Competition and Markets Authority found the 15 largest children's home providers make an average 23% profit per year.",

      "The government says the measure will also allow it to ensure that the largest providers do not suddenly collapse into administration, leaving children homeless.",

      "He told the BBC that this measure will miss \"smaller opportunists who are charging the extraordinary prices for unregulated [or] unregistered services\".",
      "Mr Rome also said gaining oversight of large providers' finances would be difficult as they often operate through a network of companies, while smaller firms may only have to disclose limited financial information.",
      "He added that a \"backstop\" law to limit profits was \"close to impossible to design and police\".",
      "The government also intends to give Ofsted the power to issue private providers, including unregistered homes, with civil fines to \"deter unscrupulous behaviour\".",
      "It accused some providers of \"siphoning off money that should be going towards vulnerable children\" from homes that \"don\u2019t meet the right standards of care\".",
      "In September, a court in Liverpool heard that unregistered children's homes were demanding up to \u00a320,000 per child a week from a local authority. The council said it was forced to agree to such fees because it could not find anywhere else to place the children - despite it being unlawful to send them there.",

      "At the time, Hesley made a 16% profit from the sites it ran.",
      "Ofsted received 108 reports about the sites, which housed children with disabilities and complex health needs, but still rated them as \"good\". The regulator and the Hesley Group have both since apologised for the failings, and the three homes have been closed.",
      "An expert panel tasked to review the incidents said a \"major overhaul\" of the safeguarding system was needed.",

      "Now 86, Mr Morris is one of the last few of 22,000 personnel who witnessed the UK\u2019s nuclear bomb tests - and those that are able to are still fighting to find out what it did their bodies.",
      "A BBC film, to be broadcast this Wednesday, details their battles for what the dwindling band of men believe is a hidden truth: that the UK\u2019s military knew at the time it was subjecting them to radiation that would damage them and their descendants forever.",
      "Thousands of the men have suffered cancers and other conditions that other nuclear states have recognised as probably linked to the now-banned testing.",

      "For years, the UK\u2019s relationship with China has been poor, dominated by rows about democracy in Hong Kong, human rights in Xinjiang and cyber threats against UK bodies.",

    "summary": "Starmer's farmer-alarmer in the Budget could crystalise anger over ministers\u2019 perceived ignorance about agricultural life.",
    "story": [
      "The government is preparing to face the biggest protest yet over its domestic policy agenda since Labour won the general election.",
      "It is the week where farmers are heading for Westminster - and bringing some noisy and influential friends with them.",
      "Among those expected outside Parliament on Tuesday is the country\u2019s most well known but relatively new-ish farmer, Jeremy Clarkson.",
      "Guesswork about how many people will turn up at a protest before it has happened is exactly that, guesswork, but some reckon it could be between 10,000 and 40,000 people.",
      "Nearly three weeks on from the Budget, when the plan to charge some farms inheritance tax was first announced, the anger seems to be growing, rather than easing.",
      "There is a huge row about precisely how many people might be affected.",
      "BBC Verify had a go here at working its way through the numbers.",
      "But beneath that is a simmering anger about ministers\u2019 perceived ignorance about the countryside - and a sense from many farmers of being persistently let down, by this government and its predecessors.",
      "Indeed, speaking on The Westminster Hour on BBC Radio 4,  Baroness Mallalieu, a Labour peer and the president of the Countryside Alliance, said the government\u2019s changes to inheritance tax relief \u201csmell of incompetence\u201d and that a \"large part of our party has become urban... divorced from a big section of the community\".",
      "Two things strike me about all this: firstly, the absolute insistence from ministers from Sir Keir Starmer down that they are not going to change their minds.",
      "And secondly, the beginnings of a parallel, perhaps, with the rows Labour had with many in rural Britain the last time it was in power.",
      "Twenty-two years ago, around 400,000 people from across the country marched through central London to highlight the needs of rural communities.",
      "The initial source of anger then was the ban on fox hunting.",
      "Could this inheritance tax change prove equally totemic?",
      "As farmers head for Westminster, the prime minister has been heading for South America - he is at the G20 Summit of the world\u2019s biggest economies in Brazil for the next few days.",
      "But the issue followed him into the skies of the south Atlantic, where he said he was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d that the \u201cvast majority of farms and farmers\u201d would not be affected by the changes.",
      "\u201cIt's important for us to keep communicating how that works\u201d he said.",
      "The truth is they have been trying to communicate how it would work ever since the Budget.  I asked Sir Keir about it the day after - but the explanations have done little to dampen the anger.",
      "Asked whether he accepted that farmers felt betrayed over the changes, Sir Keir said \u201cit's very important that we support farmers.\u201d",
      "He then made an argument we can expect to hear the Environment Secretary Steve Reed and others make in the next few days, about the wider support the government insists it is offering farmers and the countryside.",
      "\"We\u2019ve put \u00a35bn in the Budget for the next two years into farming. That is not to be overlooked. That is the single biggest sum of money in a Budget over a two-year period that has ever been put down in relation to farming.",
      "\"On top of that, there\u2019s \u00a350m in relation to flooding, which is hugely important and \u00a3200m in relation to the outbreak of disease and infection which can be absolutely devastating.\u201d",
      "Bunkum say people in agriculture, suggesting this a creative spinning of the numbers and the money around now is comparable with when the UK left the European Union.",
      "Incidentally, one government source even pointed to the planned changes to bus services in England  as an example of how their ideas can help people in rural areas.",
      "It shows their desire to attempt to mend fences with a swathe of the country some privately fear could turn against them if they don\u2019t handle this well.",
      "So why has this row become so noisy so quickly?",
      "From the conversations I have had, I think there are three main reasons.",
      "Bid to soften farm tax change rejected by Treasury",
      "Most farmers won't pay inheritance tax, PM insists",
      "Tax change 'is existential threat to farmers'",
      "Firstly, inheritance tax, perhaps like no other tax, has an outsized emotive tug on so, so many people - in fact a far greater number of people than are ever likely to end up paying it.",
      "The House of Commons Library, citing opinion polling, has described it as \u201cthe most unpopular tax in the UK\u201d, even though just 3.7% of deaths led to an inheritance tax bill in 2020-21.",
      "Some argue it is unfair as it represents double taxation; being taxed on money that has already been taxed.",
      "For others, their opposition is much more deeply seated, a sense that it seeks to dilute the most human of all human emotions, to provide for your children when you are gone.",
      "Secondly, throw into the mix a political rule first invented by The Economist magazine: \u201cNever pick a fight with a profession that appears in a children\u2019s book.\u201d",
      "Trades that are universally understood, at least in broad brush terms, and provide for our most essential needs can be very effective lobby groups, the argument goes.",
      "Think doctors and nurses, but also farmers and food.",
      "Thirdly, I am told it is worth seeing this row about inheritance tax in a wider context.",
      "\u201cIt is the straw that has broken the camel\u2019s back,\u201d is how one farming source put it to me.",
      "There was the new trade deal with Australia, which many farmers think undermines them.",
      "There are the adjustments to farm subsidies being made after Brexit.",
      "And there has been the seemingly never-ending chopping and changing of farming ministers as various prime ministers have come and gone. There have been five farming ministers in the last five years.",

    "summary": "Multiple sources say the Treasury is deeply nervous about the cost of fixing social care, and that the PM is yet to decide how to proceed.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first five months have produced little sign of a plan for Labour\u2019s promised National Care Service \u2013 and now I\u2019m told there is a \u201cgenuine impasse\u201d at the top of government over what to do about social care.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting publicly acknowledges \u201cwe can\u2019t solve the NHS crisis\u201d without improving what a government source describes as an \u201cappalling\u201d situation, in a system that\u2019s meant to look after vulnerable and elderly adults in England.",
      "But multiple sources tell me the Treasury is deeply nervous about the cost and that the prime minister is yet to make a decision on how to proceed.",
      "Talks have so far failed to decide even whether to hold another review of the system. \u201cDither, dither, dither,\u201d said one insider involved in the discussions.",
      "But another source said: \u201cEveryone wants to fix it but we don\u2019t want to embark on something that then doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d",
      "I understand the prime minister, health secretary and the Chancellor Rachel Reeves are due to meet a week on Monday to try to make some progress.",
      "What options do they have?",
      "There is little controversy about the scale of the problem in social care, the system that helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing, getting out of bed, eating and medication.",
      "There are as many as 500,000 people waiting for care. Council budgets are stretched, some teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, in part because of care costs. As the population ages, thousands upon thousands of people are stuck without the care they need, and thousands more stuck in hospital because there isn\u2019t the support they need at home.",
      "Labour has given little detail on what its National Care Service would look like, but long-term reform would likely aim to address the shortage of care, the length of waiting lists, and the costs for people who don't qualify for free care, which can be crippling for families.",
      "Why Starmer\u2019s NHS reforms may give you a sense of deja-vu",
      "No extra NHS funding without reform, says PM",
      "Ministers are considering whether to create a Royal Commission to look at the issue or a government-backed independent review, tipped to be led by the straight-talking Whitehall troubleshooter Dame Louise Casey.",
      "The advantage of a Royal Commission? It\u2019s not party political, so theoretically can bind every politician to back its solutions and make the warring parties work together.",
      "The downside? It could take two or three years, pushing possible fixes to the urgent problems until after the next election.",
      "An independent review of a year to 18 months could change things quicker. Without the kudos of the King, any plans would be easier for opposition politicians to reject \u2013 but Labour has a once-in-a-generation majority to vote through big reforms.",
      "There are nerves, however, at the top of government about what any review might recommend. If it suggests an expensive new system quickly, then that would need billions in extra tax. Does the government have a mandate for that in this parliamentary term, having ruled out changes to the main tax rates?",
      "If a review process took longer, would any political party want to go into the next election asking voters to pay more - even for the best of reasons, a shiny new social care system?",
      "\u2018Same old stalemate\u2019",
      "In truth, conversations about the process are only a symbol of the actual dilemma \u2013 not just what to do, but how to pay.",
      "The Department of Health wants to get on with the process. The Treasury agrees that it\u2019s a very serious problem that the government ought to fix (and people caught up in the system, often stuck in hospital, are costly to the whole NHS too). Yet the chancellor is understood to be nervous about the cost of any fix, which would run to many billions.",
      "One source told me: \u201cThe Treasury is the block.\u201d But a department insider rejects that characterisation, and says: \u201cNo one doubts the issue is huge, but any solution is expensive \u2013 everything is a trade-off.\u201d",
      "Others suggest Reeves wants reform but also wants to be sure of a full political backing from the neighbours at No 10. So it\u2019s suggested both Streeting and Reeves are looking to Sir Keir.",
      "A No 10 source told me the prime minister is \u201canimated by solving the issue and is keen to proceed\u201d, hence the meeting planned with the health secretary and chancellor in the next fortnight. The source denies the accusation of \u201cdither\u201d, saying it takes time to work out the right moves.",
      "There is no suggestion this is a bruising split between ministers.",
      "But another source familiar with the process told me: \"As soon as the election was out of the way we went back into the same old stalemate.\" In other words, the Department of Health says please, the Treasury says no, and No 10 wants more time to think.",
      "\u2018It\u2019s almost too late\u2019",
      "Inside the care sector itself, one leader says people are \u201cworn\u201d by the debate between different parts of government when the need for change is urgent. Another care source tells me \u201cit\u2019s already almost too late\u201d and is upset at how the industry has been treated so far.",
      "They say existing government plans and the decisions in the Budget have made life harder. Asking care providers to pay the extra costs of employers\u2019 national insurance means that, effectively, \u201cpublic services are charged to pay for a black hole in (you guessed it) public services\u201d, they say.",
      "The NHS itself will be exempt from those increased costs but, as things stand, not-for-profit organisations including some care charities providing public services will have to pay.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "A group of them have written to the chancellor as part of a grassroots campaign called Providers Unite, warning the increased payments could top \u00a31bn. They have asked Reeves to look again at the changes or face \u201ca systematic collapse of community care services across Britain\u201d.",
      "The chancellor told us after the Budget she is \u201cnot immune\u201d to pleas from particular sectors, but there is no chance of her reversing the whole policy.",
      "On top of charging more National Insurance, ministers are creating a negotiating body to improve pay and conditions for care staff. While the industry is broadly supportive of that aim, it will increase costs, and many believe they just can\u2019t cover it without extra funding.",
      "There is an obvious eagerness for the government to get on with the conversation about how to fix the system that cares for the most vulnerable adults in the long term. But, wearily, a source told me conversation in the industry is \u201cso dominated by funding emergencies now, [long-term reform] is second order\u201d.",
      "Pressure builds for a decision",
      "When the prime minister, Streeting and Reeves sit down to consider what to do about social care in a week or so, don\u2019t expect a sudden revelation or a shiny new plan. One source told me \u2013 in a line worthy of the sitcom Yes Minister \u2013 that the trio might \u201cdecide to decide, decide to delay deciding, or\u2026 decide not to decide\u201d.",
      "But the pressure is building on them to make a call.",
      "While the Conservatives promised then failed multiple times to follow through with big changes to the system, the newly emboldened Lib Dems put social care right at the centre of their successful election campaign.",
      "It\u2019s the party\u2019s signature issue, and rarely a day goes by without them pursuing a political opportunity to press the case. The Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who will join me on tomorrow's show, said that any investment in the NHS would be an \"expensive failure\" without social care reform.",
      "\"Ministers need to get a grip, and quickly,\" he said. \"The cross-party talks we've been campaigning for should start now, but there are urgent actions the government should take regardless,\" such as a higher minimum wage for care workers.",
      "And a spokesperson for the Conservatives said: \"The Labour Party are piling on costs for social care providers and charities. The Local Government Association has warned that any extra funding will be consumed by the costs as a result of Labour\u2019s budget.\"",
      "Few in government would deny that a solution for social care is long overdue. Few in government would deny that patients are being let down, and families are being left without the support they need. And few in government would deny that Sir Keir\u2019s mission to sort out the NHS is hampered by a lack of action.",
      "A source familiar with the dilemmas told me it \u201cbeggars belief\u201d that minsters can talk about giving the NHS extra billions and promising reform without doing the same for social care.",
      "Yet nobody wants to repeat previous governments\u2019 pattern, where plans were drawn up, pitched to the public, then ditched (the Scottish Government has again shelved plans for its promised National Care Service).",

    "summary": "The chancellor says she wants to \u201cfire up the UK\u2019s economy\u201d with a \"Canadian-style\" pensions model.",
    "story": [
      "Plans for a major shake-up of pension funds have been announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.",
      "She wants to create pension \"megafunds\" by merging the UK's 86 council schemes, using the set-up in Canada and Australia as a model.",
      "Other proposals suggest pension schemes need to reach a certain size or pool together. Larger funds could then be invested in UK infrastructure projects, the government says.",
      "So, will this affect people with pension savings?",
      "Which pension funds are involved?",
      "The government says the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) can get more from investments - while tackling a \u00a32bn bill for fees - by joining together.",
      "There are 86 local government pension funds in England and Wales, which are mainly paid into by local government workers.",
      "These individually managed funds are divided by local authority, making it more costly, because each fund is paying its own management and administration fees.",
      "Between them, they have 6.5 million members and manage assets worth \u00a3354bn.",
      "The schemes are all part of the LGPS which is the seventh-largest in the world, according to the UK government.",
      "Most of its participants are low-paid women.",
      "Under Reeves\u2019 plans, the funds would be consolidated in some way, although at present it is unclear exactly how.",
      "She may ask them to pool their assets and resources, or she may ask them to merge with one another to create a smaller number of larger funds, which would benefit from greater financial firepower and fewer costs.",
      "The LGPS is a defined benefit scheme which means that, when it is time to draw their pensions, its savers get an agreed amount based on their salary, no matter what the fund is worth at the time.",
      "So drawing scheme into \"megafunds\" will make little, or no, difference to what they receive.",
      "That is different to private pension pots, which rise and fall in value depending on how investments perform.",
      "Why copy Canada and Australia?",
      "The \u201cMaple 8\u201d is a group of vast Canadian pension funds, including the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which manages assets worth C$247.5bn (\u00a3141.8bn), and the Canada Pension Plan, whose assets are worth C$409.6bn.",
      "While UK pension schemes tend to invest more in assets like equities and bonds, their Canadian rivals focus more on private markets.",
      "The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, for example, only has 7% of its assets in listed equities, compared with 60% for traditional pension funds.",
      "Instead, it skews its investments towards private markets, including infrastructure (including a 25% stake in British energy giant SSE), real estate and private equity deals.",
      "This kind of model is not without risk, however.",
      "The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System is the largest investor in the troubled Thames Water, which has been highlighted by those questioning Reeves' plans.",
      "Why is bigger supposed to be better?",
      "Individually, the UK\u2019s 86 local government pension schemes vary in size, from Greater Manchester\u2019s massive \u00a330bn fund all the way down to several schemes which are \u201csub-\u00a31bn\u201d, according to Joanne Donnelly, board secretary at the Local Government Pension Scheme Advisory Board.",
      "Running these schemes costs money. Each one must pay administration, governance and management costs, which can build up \u2013 last year, they increased by \u00a328m.",
      "Like her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, who also announced plans for a Canadian-style model, the chancellor believes consolidation would save money.",
      "That would in turn \u201cdeliver better returns for savers and unlock billions of pounds of investment\u201d.",
      "Other chancellors have aimed to make similar moves, including George Osborne who, in 2015, set out plans for local government schemes to pool resources,",
      "Does everyone agree with the idea?",
      "Tracy Blackwell, chief executive of Pension Insurance Corporation, told the BBC: \"I think by having the scale and the right expertise internally to invest in a wide range of assets, they'll be able to invest in a lot more than what they can invest in now.\"",
      "However, some argue megafunds would not invest so much in smaller projects while some claim the changes could bring risks for pension savers.",
      "\"Conflating a government goal of driving investment in the UK and people\u2019s retirement outcomes brings a danger because the risks are all taken with members\u2019 money,\" said Tom Selby at investment platform AJ Bell.",
      "He said the current system encourages trustees to deliver the best outcome for members rather than focus on UK-wide economic growth, which might mean investing outside the UK.",
      "Others question whether there are enough big UK projects to invest in.",
      "\"Large funds need substantial, reliable projects to generate returns, but the market may struggle to offer enough of these opportunities, especially in the infrastructure sector,\" said Jon Greer, head of retirement policy at wealth manager Quilter."

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 13:02:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Estimates of the number of farms affected range from 100 to 70,000.",
    "story": [
      "There has been an outcry from many farmers following the changes to inheritance tax for farms announced in the Budget. Farmers have travelled to London and are taking part in a rally near Parliament to highlight their concerns.",
      "From April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will have to pay inheritance tax at 20% - half the usual rate.",
      "There have been different claims about how many farms will be affected.",
      "These vary from as many as 70,000 to as few as 500.",
      "Where does the 70,000 figure come from?",
      "It comes from the Country Land and Business Association whose president, Victoria Vyvyan said: \"We estimate that capping agricultural property relief at \u00a31m could harm 70,000 UK farms, damaging family businesses and destabilising food security.\"",
      "It was also used by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who said the government needed to \"listen to rural communities\" and reverse the change.",
      "It is not a figure for the number of estates that will have to pay inheritance tax each year, it is an estimate of the total number of farms worth enough to pay.",
      "There are a couple of ways to get to that.",
      "Yiorgos Gadanakis, associate professor of agricultural business management at the University of Reading, pointed to various sources, including Defra's Farm Business Survey, which suggest that between about 30 and 35% of farms in the UK could be valued at over \u00a31m.",
      "As there are about 209,000 farm holdings in the UK, that gives an estimate of between 62,700 and 73,150.",
      "Another way is to look at the number of farms that are bigger than about 200 acres (81 hectares), because at average land prices that would be enough to mean inheritance tax was due. That figure comes out at about 70,000.",
      "But of course a farm will only be affected once it is inherited, so 70,000 is not necessarily the right number to use.",
      "Where does the 500 figure come from?",
      "It comes from the Treasury, which says it expects 500 estates to be affected by the changes each year.",
      "There were a total of 462 inherited farms valued above \u00a31m in 2021-22, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC):",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m37 above \u00a35m",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m",
      "80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m",
      "37 above \u00a35m",
      "Under the new rules, those 462 farms would be affected by the 20% inheritance tax on any value above \u00a31m (not on the whole value). The normal rate of inheritance tax is 40%.",
      "However, as Dan Neidle - founder of the independent Tax Policy Associates - points out, like for the rest of the population, there is no inheritance tax to be paid on the value of property up to \u00a3325,000, bringing the untaxed total to \u00a31.325m.",
      "If a farmer is married, his or her spouse would be able to pass on another \u00a31.325m tax free, taking the total untaxed amount to \u00a32.65m.",
      "There were 117 farms valued above \u00a32.5m in 2021-22, according to the HMRC figures.",
      "In addition, there is a \u00a3175,000 tax-free allowance on a main residence when it is  being passed on to children or grandchildren. This brings the total untaxed amount for a farming couple to up to \u00a33m.",
      "Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an independent economy think-tank, told Sky News: \"The changes will affect a remarkably small number of some of the most valuable farms.\"",
      "He added: \"[Farms are] still more generously treated, actually, than farms used to be in decades past.\"",
      "Steve Reed, the secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, confirmed the \"vast majority\" of farmers will not be affected by changes. Writing in the Telegraph, he said \"only the richest estates will be asked to pay\".",
      "He also wrote: \"It\u2019s become the most effective way for the super-rich to avoid paying their inheritance tax.\"",
      "Analysis by the property consultants Strutt & Parker found that 40% of farms that were sold last year in England were bought by investors while 45% were bought by working farmers.",
      "Farmers 'betrayed' by \u00a31m inheritance tax relief cap",
      "Farmers mull selling or protests over tax change",
      "Who pays inheritance tax?",
      "How much could be raised?",
      "The chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, has said that the inheritance tax exemptions currently cost \"about \u00a31bn a year for taxpayers\".",
      "The Treasury expects that the changes to inheritance tax , as well as changes to Business Tax Relief, will raise \u00a3230m in 2026-27, the first year of their introduction. This rises to \u00a3520m by the end of the forecast in 2029-30.",
      "But the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warns that there is high uncertainty around these figures.",
      "Is the tax affordable?",
      "Sam Kirkham, who specialises in agriculture at Albert Goodman accountants, says \"people look at the value of farms and think the farmers must be wealthy\".",
      "But she says if the farm passes down to the next generation to continue to produce food, they never get to realise that capital.",
      "And she adds farm profits are too low to meet the additional cost of inheritance tax.",
      "Government research suggests that an average farm last year made a profit of about \u00a345,300, although that may be overstated as it is based on a survey that excluded farms that bring in the least money.",
      "Other government figures suggest that the average return on capital for farms (the amount of value farmers can extract from things like farmland and machinery by growing crops for example) is only about 0.5%, which is low compared with other businesses.",
      "The government points out that people inheriting farmland would have 10 years to pay the inheritance tax bill interest-free, unlike other inheritance tax, which needs to be paid immediately.",
      "UPDATE 4 November: The unit on a measure of area was corrected from hectares to acres. A sentence was added detailing the residence nil-rate band rate of inheritance tax.",

      "Hearing her speak in this way gives me a glimpse of a toughness that belies her well-spoken, gentle demeanour. When Jane Goodall began observing and studying chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania, she was a trailblazer. Her research, now considered groundbreaking, was controversial.",
      "She was the first person to witness and document chimpanzees making and using tools \u2013 the primates prepared sticks to fish for termites. Prior to her observations, that was a trait that was thought to be uniquely human.",
      "She revealed that the animals form strong family bonds - and even that they engage in warfare over territory.",
      "But her approach \u2013 associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as \u201cmy friends\u201d was scoffed at by some (mostly male) scientists.",
      "Her supervisor and mentor, Professor Louis Leakey, though, saw the value in her technique: \u201cHe wanted somebody whose mind wasn't messed up by the reductionist attitude of science to animals,\u201d Dr Goodall explains.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a dog, a cat, a rabbit, a horse and not give them a name. It's the same as when I studied squirrels in my garden as a little girl - they all had names.\u201d",
      "Her methods \u2013 and her sense of closeness to the primates she has dedicated her life to \u2013 have given her a unique perspective.",
      "She tells me about a \u201cwonderful moment\u201d with a chimpanzee she named David Greybeard, the male chimp who she first witnessed making and using tools to catch termites. \u201cHe was the first to lose his fear of me,\u201d she recalls.",
      "\u201cI sat down near him and, lying on the ground, was the ripe red fruit of an oil palm. I held it out towards him and he turned his head away. Then I put my hand closer and he turned and looked into my eyes, reached out and very gently squeezed my fingers.",
      "\u201cThat is how chimpanzees reassure each other. We understood each other perfectly - with a gestural language that obviously predates human speech.\u201d",
      "\u2018We need to get tougher\u2019",
      "Dr Goodall\u2019s career has often been challenging. She has written about the early years of her work for Professor Leakey, who was a renowned scientist, and who had enormous influence over her career. He repeatedly declared his love for her, putting pressure on her in a way that, today, might be viewed as sexual harassment.",
      "But she spurned his advances and kept her focus on her work and her beloved chimpanzees. Now, having turned 90 this year, she does not appear to be slowing down.",

      "There was a star-studded ringside audience including Charlize Theron, Ralph Macchio, Joe Jonas and Hasan Minhaj.",
      "Paul says 120 million viewers watched it live globally on Netflix, while the tech firm later stated \"60 million households\" around the world tuned in. It said it will reveal further viewing figures early next week.",
      "But some viewers reported experiencing buffering issues on the site, and some said they simply couldn't get onto it.",
      "The fight was \"unwatchable,\" wrote one X user. Another said she was \"furious\", while a third complained he \"did an all-nighter for nothing\".",
      "Netflix declined to comment on the technical glitches.",

      "\"I'm not in the habit of staying up late, but I thought it was worth it.\"",

      "\"It was really disappointing. I kept trying for a good hour before I gave up.\"",

      "\"It can't be good for their reputation,\" he said.",
      "On social media, there was a similar reaction from fans, who vented their frustrations.",
      "Many also posted pictures and videos of the fight failing to load, while some said the service failed at the key moments during the event.",
      "\"Had all my friends over to watch the Tyson vs. Paul fight. Not loading,\" wrote one X user.",
      "\"Shame on Netflix for not being able to handle the streaming of the Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul fight,\" wrote another.",
      "\"The lagging is so bad the fights are unwatchable to long time subscribers like me and other people I know at home with friends, family, snacks, and drinks but no fights.\"",
      "Another person simply asked, \"did Netflix not have enough time to prepare for the Tyson / Paul fight?\"",

      "Last year, it apologised after a much-publicised livestream of its hit dating show, the Love is Blind reunion, was delayed due to a glitch.",
      "The technical reason for the delay was unclear but the streaming giant said it was \"incredibly sorry\".",

      "\"Even people who aren't major boxing fans wanted to tune in because of all the coverage.",
      "\"As a result, there was additional demand well above and beyond your average live event, like a comedy special, or the live golf tournament they previously broadcast.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 16:37:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Bluesky is picking up one million new users every day at its current rate.",
    "story": [
      "You may have seen the word \"Bluesky\" popping up on your social media pages recently and wondered what people are talking about.",
      "It is an alternative platform to Elon Musk's X and in terms of its colour and logo, it looks quite similar.",
      "Bluesky is growing rapidly and is currently picking up around one million new sign-ups a day.",
      "It had 16.7m users at the time of writing, but that figure will likely be outdated by the time you read this.",
      "So what is it - and why are so many people joining?",
      "What is Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky describes itself as \"social media as it should be\", although it looks similar to other sites.",
      "Visually, a bar to the left of the page shows everything you might expect - search, notifications, a homepage and so on.",
      "People using the platform can post, comment, repost and like their favourite things.",
      "To put it simply, it looks how X, formerly known as Twitter, used to look.",
      "The main difference is Bluesky is decentralised - a complicated term which basically means users can host their data on servers other than those owned by the company.",
      "This means that rather than being limited to having a specific account named after Bluesky, people can (if they like) sign up using an account they themselves own.",
      "But it is worth stating that the vast majority of people don't do that and a new joiner will most likely have a \".bsky.social\" at the end of their username.",
      "Who owns Bluesky?",
      "If you think it feels a lot like X, you won't be surprised to learn why. The former head of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, created it.",
      "He even once said he wanted Bluesky to be a decentralised version of Twitter that no single person or entity owns.",
      "But Mr Dorsey is no longer part of the team behind it, having stepped down from the board in May 2024.",
      "He deleted his account altogether in September.",
      "It is now run and predominantly owned by chief executive Jay Graber as a US public benefit corporation.",
      "Why is it gaining in popularity?",
      "Bluesky has been around since 2019, but it was invitation-only until February of this year.",
      "That let the developers deal with all the kinks behind-the-scenes, to try and stabilise it before opening the doors to the wider public.",
      "The plan has worked, somewhat. But the flurry of new users has been so significant in November that there continue to be issues with outages.",
      "It is no coincidence that the number of new Bluesky users spiked following Donald Trump's success in the US elections in November.",
      "X's owner, Mr Musk, was a big backer of Trump during his campaign, and will be heavily involved in his administration.",
      "Inevitably, this has led to a political division, with some people leaving X in protest.",
      "But others have cited different reasons, such as the Guardian newspaper which has chosen to stop posting there as it called X \"a toxic media platform\".",
      "Meanwhile, Bluesky's app continues to pick up significant downloads worldwide and on Thursday was the top free app in the Apple App Store in the UK.",
      "Several celebrities, from pop singer Lizzo to Taskmaster's Greg Davies, have announced they are joining the platform and limiting their use of - or in some cases leaving altogether - X.",
      "Other names you might recognise include Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis and Patton Oswalt.",
      "But this growth, while significant, will have to continue for a long time before Bluesky is able to mount a true challenge to its microblogging rival.",
      "X does not share its total user numbers but it is understood to be measured in the hundreds of millions, with Elon Musk previously saying the platform had 250 million users each day.",
      "How does Bluesky make money?",
      "It is the million dollar question, quite literally.",
      "Bluesky started off with funding from investors and venture capital firms and has raised tens of millions of dollars through these means.",
      "But with so many new users, it is going to have to find a way to pay the bills.",
      "Back in Twitter's heyday, the site made the vast majority of its money through advertising.",
      "Bluesky has said it wants to avoid this. Instead, it said it will continue to look into paid services, such as having people pay for custom domains in their username.",
      "That sounds complicated but it basically comes down to a person's username being even more personalised.",
      "For example, it may mean my username - @twgerken.bsky.social - could in the future be more official-sounding, such as @twgerken.bbc.co.uk.",
      "Proponents of this idea say it doubles-up as a form of verification as the organisation which owns the website would have to clear its use.",
      "If Bluesky's owners continue to avoid advertising, they may inevitably have to look to other broader options, such as subscription features, as a way of keeping the lights on.",
      "But if it is not making very much money, that would not be unusual for tech startups.",
      "In fact, Twitter, before it was purchased by Mr Musk in 2022, only made a profit twice in its eight years of being publicly traded.",
      "And we all know how that ended - a massive payday for investors when the world's richest man paid $44bn (\u00a334.7bn) for the privilege of owning it.",
      "For now, the future of Bluesky remains unknown, but if its growth continues, anything is possible.",

      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",

      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",

      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",

      "His farming career began in the 1970s when he inherited a rubber plantation in the the southern Indian state of Kerala , which he managed alongside his career as a doctor.",
      "It was a bad time to inherit a rubber plantation, falling rubber prices meant it kept losing money. So, 10 years ago Dr Matthew decided to experiment with cocoa trees, hoping they would generate some funds to support the rest of the farm.",
      "He bought some saplings and planted them. It didn't go well.",
      "\"It was not that successful - most of the saplings died,\" he says.",
      "Squirrels appeared to be making the situation worse by grabbing cocoa bean pods and eating them.",
      "But those raids had an unexpected benefit -  cocoa seeds were spread all over the farm.",
      "\"All the scattered seeds soon grew in to plants and they were much healthier and stronger than the saplings I had planted,\" says Dr Matthew.",
      "\"The trick was in sowing the seeds,\" he realised.",
      "Today Mr Matthews has 6,000 cocoa trees on his 50 acres of land.",
      "\"I think it was the best decision I have made,\" he says.",
      "Despite having several regions with weather conditions suitable for cocoa trees, India only accounts for 1% of the world's cocoa bean production.",
      "Global production is currently dominated by West Africa, where C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana between them produce more than half of the world's annual output.",
      "Indian growers can only supply a quarter of the beans needed by Indian makers of chocolate and other confectionary.",
      "\"The challenge is that it is grown in very fragmented small holdings, so it does not get the kind of attention cocoa should get,\" says Renny Jacob, chairman of India Cocoa, a private company that has been growing and processing cocoa beans for more than 30 years.",
      "In particular he says that Indian farmers are poor at handling beans after they have been harvested. Once removed from their pods, beans go through a fermentation process at the farm, which can make a huge difference to their flavour.",
      "\"Cocoa fermentation is a critical process in the production of chocolate, transforming raw cocoa beans into a form suitable for chocolate making,\" says Sarin Partrick, chief executive of India Cocoa.",

      "\"In Kerala, we get 2.5 kilograms per year per tree. In Andhra and Telangana, we are even getting a yield of four or five kilograms per tree per year,\" she says.",
      "India's production of cocoa beans has risen significantly. This year it hit 110,000 tonnes, up 40% from 2015. But it's still not enough to meet demand from local chocolate and confectionary makers.",
      "India's Cocoa Board estimates the demand from industry is rising at 15% per year.",
      "Founded in 2019, Kocoatrait is one of a new generation of Indian chocolate makers.",
      "Based in the east coast city of Chennai, the company only uses Indian cocoa beans.",
      "One reason for that is that locally sourced beans have a much smaller carbon footprint than beans that have been shipped from another continent.",

      "Trump, who will be sworn in in two months, has promised mass deportations once he returns to the White House. His chosen \"border czar\", Tim Homan, has urged sanctuary cities to \"get the hell out of the way\" of federal immigration crackdowns.",
      "The term \"sanctuary city\" has been popular in the US for more than a decade to describe places that limit their assistance to federal immigration authorities. Since it is not a legal term, cities have taken a variety of approaches to becoming \"sanctuaries\", such as setting policies in laws or simply changing local policing practices.",
      "Aimed at making a 2019 executive order into city law, the city council's sanctuary city ordinance prohibits using city resources for immigration enforcement, including cooperating with federal immigration agents, NBC News Los Angeles reports.",
      "The ordinance will \"prevent federal immigration enforcement from being able to access city facilities or to use city resources in the pursuit of immigration enforcement\", council member Nithya Raman told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, ahead of the vote.",

      "The Los Angeles school district - roughly 140 miles (225km) from the country's southern border with Mexico - also voted on a series of emergency resolutions explicitly aimed at combatting what the board's president, Jackie Goldberg, has described as an anti-immigrant and LGBTQ sentiment from the incoming president.",
      "As well as restating a sanctuary policy for students and families within the school district, the resolution also calls for training for teachers and staff about how they should communicate with immigration authorities.",
      "\"We're not going to be running in fear,\" she said in quotes cited by the LA Times ahead of the resolution's passing. \"We're going to fight you, every inch of the way.\"",

      "It started impacting the region Tuesday and is expected to worsen through the end of the week, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "Beyond wind, rain and snow, the storm could also bring flash flooding, rock slides and debris flows as well as heavy mountain snow and blizzard conditions in areas of high elevation.",

      "The weather could bring whiteout conditions that will make travel difficult, according to NOAA. There could be 10-20in (25-50cm) of snow in spots.",

      "They are referred to as 'bomb' cyclones due to the explosive power of these storms caused by the rapid fall in pressure.",
      "The storm brings with it an array of weather, ranging from blizzards to severe thunderstorms to heavy precipitation.",
      "BBC Weather forecaster Helen Rossington has said that the bomb cyclone will first deliver strong winds, rain and snow to the north-west coast before the region is walloped by a prolonged spell of heavy rain, mountain snow and flood risk.",
      "These weather events are not unusual for this time of year.",
      "Similar atmospheric river events - when small regions of moisture travel outside tropical regions - have occurred throughout North America over the last few weeks.",

      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot has denounced the mass rape case of 51 men as a \"trial of cowardice\", and said it is high time that France's \"macho, patriarchal society\" which \"trivialises rape\" changes.",
      "Her ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, has admitted recruiting dozens of men online to rape her while she was drugged and unconscious over the course of almost a decade at their home in Mazan.",
      "During a dramatic day in court there was uproar when a defence lawyer accused her of still being under her ex-husband's control and of being unable to condemn him fully.",
      "Ms Pelicot has attended the mass rape trial from its start in September. She has waived her right to anonymity so the entire trial can be heard in court in Avignon in the full glare of publicity.",

      "Tuesday's session was the last chance that lawyers for the men on trial for rape might have to convince the judges that her ex-husband Dominique Pelicot had somehow tricked them into raping her while she was unconscious.",
      "About 15 defendants sat in the defendants' box while Dominique Pelicot sat in another box, resting his chin on his hand. A handful of the 50 admit raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, but the majority do not.",
      "Dominique Pelicot was asked whether he accepted that he had manipulated the other defendants into raping his wife or if he had drugged them, he said firmly: \"Absolutely not.\"",
      "He suggested they had used that defence \"to save themselves\".",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's lawyer also asked him what he had to say to his family, especially his daughter Caroline.",
      "Partially naked images of Caroline were found on Dominique Pelicot's laptop, and when asked about the file he had called \"my naked daughter\", he addressed her across the room: \"I have watched her fall apart... Caroline, I never touched you.\"",
      "She shouted across the court: \"You are lying; I am sick of your lies, you're alone in your lie, you will die lying.\"",
      "There was complete silence as they looked at each other and Dominique Pelicot then held his head in his hands.",
      "The rest of the family, their faces filled with anguish, stared at him, while Gis\u00e8le Pelicot herself did not react.",
      "Not long before Ms Pelicot took the stand, the last of the 50 defendants, Philippe L, said he had been \"surprised\" by the situation when Dominique Pelicot had welcomed him into his home and insisted that he penetrate Gis\u00e8le Pelicot.",
      "He also denies rape, arguing he put his conscience aside and \"was thinking with my penis instead of my brain\".",
      "After Philippe L left the dock, Ms Pelicot told the court that by giving up her right to a trial behind closed doors she \"knew what I was signing up for\", although she conceded \"today I can feel the tiredness\".",
      "Asked whether she thought there was a difference between those who had admitted to raping her and those who had not, Ms Pelicot said that \"all came to rape me... all committed a crime\".",
      "But she emphasised that when the accused had admitted to rape in the dock \"I looked them in the eye\".",
      "\"I've seen individuals who deny rape parade before the court,\" she said. \"I want to tell these men: at which moment when you enter that bedroom did Ms Pelicot give you consent?\"",
      "\"I've heard 'I was manipulated', I've heard 'I drank a glass of water, I was drugged'. But at what point did they not realise?\"",
      "Ms Pelicot was also asked why she continued to use her ex-husband's name when her own children had been using other names.",
      "The room was hushed as she responded calmly that when she had first gone into the court in Avignon her children were ashamed of the name, but that her grandchildren were still called Pelicot.",
      "\"Today I want them to be proud of their grandmother,\" she declared.",
      "\"My name is known across the world now. They shouldn't be ashamed of carrying that name. Today we will remember Gis\u00e8le Pelicot.\"",
      "The atmosphere in the courtroom became heated when Ms Pelicot was questioned by defence lawyer Nadia El-Bouroumi, who suggested she had used \"harsh words\" towards the other defendants, but not her husband.",
      "\"Looking at you - and I'm sorry to say this - I wondered whether we'd ever see you cry,\" El-Bouroumi asked at one point.",
      "The lawyer's combative and sometimes aggressive tone elicited gasps from the public and the media inside the courtroom, and several people shook their heads in disbelief.",
      "Ms Pelicot rejected suggestions that looking back she might have \"seen the signs\" that something might not have been right on the mornings after being drugged: \"I would wake up with my usual pyjamas on, so no.\"",
      "She spoke of losing 10 years of her life through medical worries caused by the drugs her former husband had given her without her knowledge.",
      "\"I thought I'd either die or end up in a mental hospital,\" she reflected. \"I am 72 now and I don't know how much time I have left.\"",
      "Defence lawyers also asked her about the images on Dominique Pelicot's laptop of their daughter Caroline.",
      "The Pelicots' children then stormed out of the courtroom and did not come back for some time, while Gis\u00e8le Pelicot said later that it \"isn't a family trial\".",
      "When a defence lawyer put it to Ms Pelicot that she was still under her ex-husband's control and could not bring herself to condemn him fully, she stood silently in court as the lawyers from both sides shouted at each other.",
      "The presiding judge had to intervene to bring the argument to an end.",
      "Later in the day the court heard a statement from Dominique Pelicot given to police in November 2020, two months after he was caught filming under women's skirts by a supermarket security guard.",
      "That eventually led police to find thousands of videos that he had filmed of men having sex with his wife while she was unconscious. She had no idea of what had gone on and realised he had been drugging her from 2011 to 2020.",

      "\u201cMy Treaty Principles Bill says that I, like everybody else, whether their ancestors came here a thousand years ago, like some of mine did, or just got off the plane at Auckland International Airport this morning to begin their journey as New Zealanders, have the same basic rights and dignity,\u201d Seymour, who has M\u0101ori ancestry, told the BBC.",
      "\u201cYour starting point is to take a human being and ask, what's your ancestry? What kind of human are you? That used to be called prejudice. It used to be called bigotry. It used to be called profiling and discrimination. Now you're trying to make a virtue of it. I think that's a big mistake.\u201d",

      "Benny Tai, 60, and Joshua Wong, 28, were among the so-called Hong Kong 47 group of activists and lawmakers who were involved in a plan to pick opposition candidates for local elections.",
      "Tai received 10 years while Wong received more than four years. A total of 45 people were jailed for conspiring to commit subversion. Two of the defendants were acquitted in May.",
      "This was the biggest trial under the national security law (NSL) which China imposed on the city shortly after explosive pro-democracy protests in 2019.",
      "Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in a months-long standoff against Beijing. Triggered by a proposed government treaty that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, the protests quickly grew to reflect wider demands for democratic reform.",
      "Observers say the NSL and the trial's outcome have significantly weakened the city\u2019s pro-democracy movement and rule of law, allowing China to cement its control of the former British colony.",
      "Who are the activists jailed in Hong Kong's largest national security trial?",
      "What is Hong Kong's national security law?",
      "Beijing and Hong Kong\u2019s government deny this, arguing instead that the NSL is necessary to maintain stability. They also say these sentences serve as a warning for those trying to undermine China\u2019s national security.",
      "\"No one can engage in illegal activities in the name of democracy and attempt to escape justice,\" China's foreign ministry said on Tuesday. It also said that it was \"firmly opposed\" to Western countries \"undermining the rule of law in Hong Kong\".",
      "'Their families are devastated'",
      "The city's pro-democracy campaigners reacted to the sentences with disappointment and sadness.",
      "\"We are very distressed and their families are devastated,\" Emily Lau, former chair of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong, told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "She added that she and many others were not able to enter the courtroom because it was full. Tuesday's hearing attracted huge interest from Hongkongers, dozens of whom queued up outside days before to secure a spot in the public gallery.",
      "Many of the 45 people on trial were icons of Hong Kong's protest movement. Tai, a law professor, shot to fame as a key leader back in 2014, Wong was still a teenager when he took to activism, and Gwyneth Ho, a young former journalist,  was admitted to hospital after a mob attack during the 2019 protests.",
      "Veteran former lawmakers such as Claudia Mo and Leung Kwok-hung, also known as Long Hair, spent much of their careers fighting for a freer Hong Kong, and first-time activists such as Owen Chou and Tiffany Yuen stormed the legislative council in what was a defining moment for the protests.",
      "All of them were in court in a rare public appearance as many have been in jail since their arrest in early 2021 because pre-trial detention is common under the NSL.",
      "Standing in line on Tuesday was Lee Yue-shun, one of the two defendants acquitted. He told reporters he wanted to urge Hongkongers to \"raise questions\" about the case, as \"everyone has a chance to be affected\" by its outcome.",
      "There were several activists waiting to enter court. Bobo Lam, who was once arrested under the NSL, said he was showing up to support friends who are now in jail and \"let them know, that there are still many HongKongers who haven't forgotten them\". Others seemed heartened by how many people had showed up, suggesting they \"remember what happened\".",
      "An elderly woman, Regina Fung, chanted \"everybody hang in there, stand for Hong Kong\" before the hearing. \"It's very sad, even the weather in Hong Kong is miserable today,\" she said.",
      "Inside the courtroom, family members and friends waved from the public gallery to the defendants, who appeared calm as they sat in the dock. Some in the gallery had tears in their eyes as the sentences, ranging from four to 10 years, were read out.",
      "Tai, a former law professor who came up with the plan for the unofficial primary, received the longest sentence with judges saying he had \"advocated for a revolution\".",
      "Wong had his sentence reduced by a third after he pleaded guilty. But unlike some other defendants, he was not given further reductions as judges \"did not consider him to be a person of good character\". At the time of the arrests, Wong was already in jail for participating in protests.",
      "In court, Wong shouted \"I love Hong Kong\" before he left the dock.",
      "As Leung's wife, activist Chan Po-ying, walked out of the court at the end of the hearing, she was heard chanting a protest against his jail term.",
      "The 'illegal' primary",
      "The UK government said those sentenced had been \"exercising their right to freedom of speech, of assembly and of political participation\".",
      "\"Today\u2019s sentencing is a clear demonstration of the Hong Kong authorities\u2019 use of the NSL to criminalise political dissent,\" a UK government statement said.",
      "The US has described the trial as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. Australia said it had \"strong objections\" to the use of the NSL and it was \"gravely concerned\" by the sentencing of one of its citizens, Gordon Ng.",
      "The ruling comes a day after UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer met with China's Xi Jinping at the G20 summit - a meeting which saw him raise the case of Jimmy Lai, the billionaire pro-democracy activist on trial for treason.",
      "Asked directly about Tuesday's ruling, he defended pursuing closer ties with Beijing, saying that while it was \"important\" to be \"open... and talk about our disagreements\", it was also in the \"national interest\" to have a\" serious and pragmatic relationship\" with China.",
      "\"I certainly hope the British government, the prime minister, will stand up for the rights that they promised the Hong Kong people. All these promises, these rights and rule of law are evaporating,\" Ms Lau told the BBC. She asked why organising an election should warrant jail time.",
      "After the 2019 protests dwindled with the Covid pandemic, the defendants organised an unofficial primary for the Legislative Council election as a way to continue the pro-democracy movement.",
      "Their aim was to increase the opposition\u2019s chances of blocking the pro-Beijing government\u2019s bills. More than half a million Hongkongers turned out to vote in the primary held in July 2020.",
      "Organisers argued at the time that their actions were allowed under Hong Kong's Basic Law - a mini-constitution that allows certain freedoms.",
      "But it alarmed Beijing and Hong Kong officials, who warned that the move could breach the NSL, which came into effect days before the primary. They accused the activists of attempting to \u201coverthrow\u201d the government, and arrested them in early 2021.",
      "The trial judges agreed with the prosecution\u2019s argument that the plan would have created a constitutional crisis.",
      "'National security is the priority'",
      "\"Central authorities are using the trial to re-educate the Hong Kong people,\" said John P Burns, emeritus professor at the University of Hong Kong. The lesson being \"national security is the country\u2019s top priority; don\u2019t challenge us on national security\u2019\u201d.",
      "\"The case is significant because it provides clues to the health of Hong Kong\u2019s legal system,\" he told the BBC. \"How can it be illegal to follow processes laid down in the Basic Law?\"",
      "A Human Rights Watch spokesperson said that China and Hong Kong \"have now significantly raised the costs for promoting democracy in Hong Kong\".",
      "Stephan Ortmann, assistant professor of politics at the Hong Kong Metropolitan University, agreed. Tuesday's sentencing \"set a precedent for the severity of punishments for political dissent under the NSL\", adding that \"self-censorship has become the norm\".",
      "But this isn't a win for Beijing, said Sunny Cheung, an activist who ran in the 2020 primary but has since fled to the US. \"They might be happy in a way because the entire opposition is being wiped out... but they don\u2019t have the trust of the people.\u201d",
      "Others, like Ms Lau, said the city had already lost more than a generation of pro-democracy campaigners.",
      "There has been \"no permission for marches and demonstrations in the past few years - it's very, very quiet, very peaceful,\" she said.",

      "\u201cI like Trump, but he\u2019s unstable. Who knows what he might do?\u201d says the 74-year-old pensioner, whose name has been withheld.",

      "Marco Rubio, his pick for Secretary of State, has called Beijing \u201cthe threat that will define this century\u201d. He is also sanctioned by Beijing. Trump\u2019s choice for National Security Adviser, Mike Waltz, wrote earlier this month that the US should \u201curgently\u201d bring the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East to an end so it can \u201cfinally focus strategy attention where it should be: countering the greater threat from the Chinese Communist Party\u201d.",

      "Beijing\u2019s \u201ccold war\u201d warning to Washington",
      "The competition between the two nations has been ramping up for some time, long before Trump won the election. It turned especially tense during the Biden administration because of tariffs and geopolitical disagreements ranging from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine to the future of Taiwan.",
      "Yet there was dialogue, with several senior US officials making trips to Beijing.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed to work with the incoming Trump administration, but he also used his last meeting with President Joe Biden to warn Washington that a \u201cnew cold war should not be fought and cannot be won\u201d.",
      "He added that \u201ccontaining China is unwise, unacceptable and bound to fail\u201d.",
      "Beijing has long accused the US and its allies of trying to contain China \u2013 they see tariffs targeting Chinese-made imports, laws restricting the country\u2019s access to advanced AI chips and military alliances in the South China Sea and beyond as part of this approach.",
      "And Trump\u2019s decision to pick Rubio and Waltz suggests his administration will \u201ctake a much harsher, muscular approach with China,\u201d says Lyle Morris from the Asia Society\u2019s Centre for China Analysis.",
      "\u201cWhile Trump views his personal relationship with Xi Jinping as an avenue for negotiation, he will likely lean on Waltz and Rubio in fashioning a more aggressive, uncompromising policy towards China.\u201d",
      "They are far from the only voices in Washington that see China as a threat to US security and its economy \u2013 a view that surprises the average person in Beijing.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re much better off here than in the US right now,\u201d says the 74-year-old in the park before heading off to stretch.",
      "From Covid blame to nuclear competition",
      "Just north of the Temple of Heaven is the Forbidden City, where Chinese emperors lived for almost 500 years. It was here, in 2017, that Xi hosted Trump, bestowing on his guest an honour not granted to any US president since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.",
      "Xi shut down the area and took Trump on a tour of the imperial quarters, every moment broadcast live on state TV. He was served kung pao chicken for dinner, and in turn brought a video of his granddaughter, Arabella Kushner, singing a Chinese song which went viral on social media.",
      "It was billed by both as a high point in US-China relations, but that quickly soured after the Covid pandemic broke out in Wuhan in 2019 and spread globally in 2020. Trump repeatedly called it the \u201cChinese virus\u201d and blamed the outbreak on Beijing. He also kicked off a tit-for-tat trade war, with tariffs still in place on more than $300bn (\u00a3238bn) of goods.",
      "When Trump starts his second term, he will be encountering a stronger Xi, who has cemented his position at China\u2019s helm with a historic third term \u2013 and the possibility of remaining in power for life.",
      "Given it has the world\u2019s largest army and navy, Washington is now concerned that the country is building a bigger nuclear arsenal.",
      "Even as Trump was unveiling his new cabinet, Chinese state media published videos from the country\u2019s biggest airshow of a new stealth fighter jet \u2013 the J35-A \u2013 flying vertically and upside-down. China is only the second country to boast two stealth fighters in its inventory. The other is the US. The world\u2019s first two-seat stealth fighter, the J20-S, was also on display.",
      "Last week, researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California found satellite images that indicate China is working on nuclear propulsion for a new aircraft carrier.",
      "The studies have \u201csparked serious concerns over Beijing\u2019s potential adoption of a first-use strategy and increased nuclear threats, fuelling strong support to significantly boost US nuclear capabilities in response,\u201d says Tong Zhao from think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\u201cUnless Trump personally intervenes, which seems unlikely, it appears the two nations are on the brink of a much more intense nuclear competition with far-reaching implications for international stability.\u201d",
      "The Taiwan question",
      "Under Xi\u2019s leadership in recent years, China has also become more assertive in its territorial claims over Taiwan and the South China Sea.",
      "One worry is that Beijing is ramping up militarily to invade Taiwan, which it sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under its control. Under Trump and his cabinet, would the US be willing to defend Taiwan?",
      "It\u2019s a question asked of every US president. Trump has dodged it, saying he wouldn\u2019t have to use military force because Xi knew he was \u201ccrazy\u201d, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on Chinese imports if that happened.",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s unwillingness to participate in foreign wars, most experts expect Washington to continue providing military assistance to Taipei. For one, it is bound by law to sell defensive weapons to the island. Two, the Trump administration sold more arms to Taiwan than any other.",
      "\u201cThere is strong bipartisan support for continuing military aid to Taiwan. I don\u2019t expect Trump to significantly change course on arms sales to Taiwan,\u201d Mr Morris says.",
      "What Trump really thinks of Xi",
      "These glaring differences aside, Trump does seem to admire Xi\u2019s strongman image.",
      "In 2020 he declared that he and Xi Jinping \u201clove each other\u201d, even in the midst of a bitter trade war with China.",
      "\u201cI had a very strong relationship with him,\u201d he confirmed in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal.",
      "It\u2019s hard to know what Xi thinks \u2013 he has said very little about their relationship and barely mentions Trump by name.",
      "In 2018, Chinese state media CGTN took direct aim at the American leader, and released an unflattering video with the sarcastic title: \u201cThanks Mr Trump, you are great!\u201d It was later taken down by censors.",
      "But what we do know is both leaders project a type of muscular nationalism. Xi\u2019s dream is the \"great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\" and Trump believes only he can \u201cmake America great again\u201d. Both promise that they are working towards a new golden age for their countries.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cgolden age\u201d for America includes 60% tariffs on Chinese-made goods.",
      "But Beijing is in no mood for a second trade war. It has troubles of its own.",
      "A sluggish economy vs the Musk factor",
      "President Xi\u2019s dream of prosperity is in jeopardy. China\u2019s economy is sluggish, its property sector is sinking, nearly 20% of its young people are struggling to find jobs and it has one of the world\u2019s fastest growing ageing populations.",
      "Some of this economic pain is clear at the Temple of Heaven. We join the throngs of Chinese tour groups walking through white marble gates. It has become fashionable for young people to dress up in Qing dynasty costumes although their long silk robes often fail to hide the other big trend \u2013 chunky white trainers.",
      "Dozens of school groups are listening attentively to guides about their city\u2019s colourful history while a queue forms around the altar to make a wish. I watch as a middle-aged woman dressed in black takes her turn. She turns three times, clasps her hands, closes her eyes and looks toward the sky. Later we ask what she hoped for. She says many people come here and ask for their children to get jobs or to get into a good school.",
      "\u201cWe wish for better lives and prospects,\u201d she says. While China claims to have eradicated extreme poverty, millions of labourers and factory workers across the country, those who contributed to China\u2019s rise, will worry what about what\u2019s to come.",
      "Her future and the future of China\u2019s economy may partly depend on just how serious Trump is about his tariffs. This time, Beijing is prepared, according to Yu Jie.",
      "\u201cChina has already begun to diversify its sources of agricultural imports (notably from Brazil, Argentina and Russia) and increased the volumes of its exports in non-US allied countries. At a domestic level, the recent local government debt recapitalisation is also paving the way to offset the negative impacts on the likely trade war with the Trump Administration.\u201d",
      "Beijing may also have another hope. Billionaire Elon Musk now appears to have Trump\u2019s ear. His company, Tesla, depends on China for production - about half of all its EVs are made in the country. Chinese leaders may ask if Musk can temper Trump\u2019s trade impulses.",
      "But the great power struggle of the 21st century is not just over trade. Xi\u2019s dream also involves making China the world\u2019s dominant power.",
      "Some experts believe this is where another Trump presidency may offer Beijing an opportunity.",
      "China\u2019s place on the world stage",
      "\u201cChinese leaders will reinforce the narrative that the US is the single and most disruptive source of global instability, while portraying China as a responsible and confident world power,\u201d says Yu Jie.",
      "Biden spent four years building up friendships across Asia with the likes of South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam - all in an effort to contain China.",
      "In the past, Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica-first\u201d doctrine isolated and weakened these US alliances. He opted for deals over delicate diplomacy and often put a price tag on America\u2019s friendships. In 2018, for instance, he demanded more money from South Korea to continue keeping US troops in the country.",
      "Beijing has already built up alliances with emerging economies. It is also trying to repair its relationship with the UK and Europe, while mending historical grievances with Asian neighbours, South Korea and Japan.",

    "summary": "It is not clear if Biden's decision will be endorsed by Donald Trump who has promised to end the Ukraine war.",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden's apparent green light for Ukraine to strike Russia with US-made long-range missiles has caused consternation among some of Donald Trump's allies.",
      "Trump himself has not commented, but he won the election after promising to end the war - and several people close to him have condemned the move as dangerous escalation.",
      "Biden has committed tens of billions of dollars to Kyiv's war effort, and at the weekend he reportedly ditched a long-standing red line on Ukraine's use of American weaponry to launch attacks deep into Russia.",
      "Donald Trump Jr tweeted that the president was trying to \"get World War Three going\" before his father took office.",
      "Biden's decision has not been formally confirmed and it may never be.",
      "When asked about how typical it would be for a presidential administration to take such a significant policy decision in its final months, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that Biden was \"elected to a four year-term, not a term of three years and 10 months.\"",
      "\"We will use every day of our term to pursue policy interests that we believe are in the interests of the American people,\" he said. \"If the incoming administration wants to take a different view, that is, of course, their right to do so.\"",
      "\"There's one president at a time,\" he added. \"When the next president takes office, he can make his own decisions.\"",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said no such announcement was forthcoming - \"missiles will speak for themselves\".",
      "Trump's camp is not pleased",
      "Trump swept to victory on 5 November and is due to be back in the White House for a second term from 20 January next year.",
      "Trump has campaigned on a promise to end the US involvement in wars and instead use taxpayers' money to improve Americans' lives.",
      "He has said he will bring the Russia-Ukraine war to an end within 24 hours, without saying how.",
      "One thing is certain, though: Trump has always seen himself as a dealmaker and will not want Biden to take any such credit.",
      "His son, Donald Trump Jr, was among the first Republicans to respond.",
      "\"The military industrial complex seems to want to make sure they get World War Three going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives,\" he said.",
      "Another vocal Trump supporter, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, condemned Biden, too.",
      "\"The American people gave a mandate on Nov 5th against these exact America last decisions and do NOT want to fund or fight foreign wars. We want to fix our own problems,\" she wrote on X.",
      "Not all of Trump's allies, including some who advised him on national security affairs during his first term, shared this view - though they were critical of the Biden administration's approach.",
      "James Gilmore, who served as Trump's ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, told the BBC that the main issue with Biden's decision to provide Ukraine this new capability is that it came so late in the war.",
      "\"My criticism of Biden is the same as every other conservative and supporter of Trump - which is that the Biden administration slow walked this,\" he said.",
      "Gilmore said he did not know what the president-elect would choose to do regarding Ukraine once he entered office. \"I don't believe that he's a man that usually walks away,\" he said.",
      "Polls suggest a large number of Republicans want US support for Ukraine to stop - 62% told a poll by Pew Research the US had no responsibility to support the country against Russia.",
      "Senator JD Vance, who will be Trump's vice-president, has regularly objected to providing arms to Ukraine. He argued that the US lacks the manufacturing capacity to continue providing weapons like the missile systems that Kyiv will use to strike within Russia.",
      "Gilmore, however, said the US was able to backfill and upgrade its weapon systems through this process, but he said the US's European allies would need to take on a bigger role.",
      "\"President Trump is exactly right about this - the alliance is stronger when Western European countries step up to the plate,\" he said. \"The United States cannot continue to act alone. The taxpayer won't permit it, the next administration won't permit it, and I wouldn't, either.\"",
      "Putin is also silent",
      "Since launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia's president has been railing against the US-led Nato alliance - and described every pledge of military support by the Western allies for Ukraine as a direct involvement and warned of retribution.",
      "His spokesman said on Monday that the US was \"adding fuel to the fire\".",
      "At times, Putin has mooted the possibility of using nuclear weapons, too.",
      "Few believe this may come to pass as, under the mutual-destruction doctrine established during the Cold War when nuclear arsenals were built up, Putin knows their use would bring untold suffering to all, including Russians.",

      "Live: Reaction to the US decision",

      "Former US envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, said Biden's decision would enable Ukraine \"to go after airfields, the ammunition depots and the fuels supplies, logistics that Russia has, which right now are in a sanctuary zone in Russia\".",
      "Biden's decision will cause Russia to be more cautious, Volker told the BBC.",
      "Dismissing Putin's threats, he said the Russian leader \"should have anticipated that there would be efforts by Ukraine to fire back\".",
      "Ukraine has had ATACMS as well as UK and French Storm Shadow missiles of similar range for some time, though the numbers are not known. But it has not been allowed to use them inside Russia.",
      "France and the UK are expected to follow the US lead and issue the same authorisation to Ukraine. So far, they have not commented.",
      "White House officials are emphasising to US media that Biden's change of heart is in response to Russia\u2019s deployment of North Korean troops - a signal to Pyongyang not to send any more.",
      "Gilmore, Trump's OSCE ambassador, told the BBC that he believes it is \"Putin who has escalated the war\" by deploying North Korean soldiers, and the US cannot \"just stand aside and let this dictator go ahead and conquer Ukraine\".",
      "\"I don't like it and I take it all very seriously, but the decision is not ours. The decision is being forced upon us by Putin - by the dictator,\" he said.",

      "On Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, another devoted Trump loyalist, called Gaetz an \"accomplished attorney\".",

Joe Biden\u2019s attorney general, Merrick Garland, was a senior federal appellate court judge. Trump in his first term picked US Senator Jeff Sessions, and later Bill Barr, who had decades of experience in Republican presidential administrations.",
      "The Senate will be responsible for confirming Gaetz\u2019s nomination, and the Florida congressman has ruffled more then a few feathers in that chamber \u2013 including among Republicans. While his party has a majority, it would only take four \u201cno\u201d votes, joined by unified Democratic opposition, to sink his chances.",
      "Gaetz himself said last year that he would love to be attorney general while acknowledging it was unlikely.",
      "\u201cThe world is not ready, probably,\u201d he told Newsmax in an interview. \u201cCertainly Senate confirmation wouldn\u2019t be, but you know, a boy can dream.\u201d",
      "For the moment, however, Trump\u2019s closest supporters are celebrating his pick.",
      "\u201cThe hammer of justice is coming,\u201d Elon Musk posted about Gaetz on X.",
      "Regardless of the ultimate outcome of Gaetz\u2019s bid to be attorney general, Trump has fired a warning shot across the bow of US government. While his second term in office may be more organised than his first, it may end up being even more confrontational.",

      "For now, Mike Huckabee seems to be keeping his cards close to his chest.",
      "Shortly after being announced as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for US ambassador to Israel, the former Republican governor of Arkansas said: \u201cI won't make the policy. I will carry out the policy of the president.\u201d",
      "But he did give an indication of what he expected that policy to be, citing the previous Trump administration\u2019s decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem and to recognise the occupied Golan Heights as Israeli territory \u2013 decisions as warmly welcomed by the Israeli right wing as they were categorically rejected by Palestinians.",
      "\u201cNo-one has done more,\u201d he told an Israeli radio station. \u201cPresident Trump and I fully expect that will continue.\u201d",
      "What approach Trump will take to the Israel-Gaza war is still unclear. But the right wing of Israeli politics has welcomed the president-elect\u2019s appointment of Huckabee, seeing it as predicting another term of American policy highly favourable to their longstanding aims of holding on to territory in the West Bank and expanding settlements.",
      "The appointment was greeted with joy by two far-right ministers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. On the social media platform X, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich messaged his congratulations to \u201ca consistent and loyal friend\", while Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, wrote \"Mike Huckabee\" with heart emojis.",

      "Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "Smotrich and Ben-Gvir have reason to be cheered by Huckabee\u2019s appointment. He has been a consistent supporter of many Israelis\u2019 ambitions to expand into territories that would form part of any future Palestinian state.",
      "Holding a press conference in 2017, shortly after a cornerstone-laying ceremony at one of the biggest Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Huckabee said: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a settlement. They\u2019re communities, they\u2019re neighbourhoods, they\u2019re cities.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an occupation.\u201d",
      "The following year, he said: \u201cI think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,\u201d using the name used by many in Israel for the area which became the occupied West Bank when it was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.",
      "The previous Trump administration declared in 2019 that it did not consider Israeli settlements illegal under international law, contradicting decades of US policy. Other decisions, including a 2020 peace plan greenlighting the annexation of Israeli settlements, were seen as more favourable to the settlers than any previous administration.",
      "The Israeli far right has indicated that it sees Huckabee\u2019s appointment as a sign that it will be able to further advance its agenda, including annexation of the West Bank, during the next Trump term.",
      "On Monday, Smotrich said that 2025 would be \"the year of sovereignty\" in the West Bank, adding that he had instructed Israeli authorities to begin preparatory work for annexation of the occupied territory.",
      "That happening is a genuine fear for Mustafa Barghouti, a West Bank-based veteran Palestinian politician who is leader of the Palestinian National Initiative political movement.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine the reaction of other powerful countries in the world would be, when the idea of annexing occupied territories, obtained by war, becomes legal and acceptable,\" he says. \"So it's not just about Palestinians and our suffering, it's about the international order.\u201d",
      "Whether Smotrich will get his wish remains to be seen. Tal Schneider, a political correspondent at the Times of Israel, says it is not a foregone conclusion that a pro-settler US ambassador will result in pro-settler policies in Washington.",
      "\u201cFour years ago, some of the people that surrounded Trump were very much pro-settlements and pro-annexing, but it didn't work like that last time. I predict it's not going to work like that this time around.\u201d",
      "Huckabee was not the only appointee announced on Tuesday. The president-elect also said Steve Witkoff would serve as his special envoy to the Middle East.",
      "As well as being a real estate developer, Witkoff is also a longtime golf buddy of Trump\u2019s. The pair were playing together at the time of a second failed assassination attempt in September.",
      "It is not clear what foreign policy experience Witkoff brings to the role, but he has previously praised Trump\u2019s dealings with Israel.",
      "In July, he argued that Trump\u2019s \u201cleadership was good for Israel and the entire region\u201d.",
      "\u201cWith President Trump, the Middle East experienced historic levels of peace and stability. Strength prevents wars. Iran\u2019s money was cut off which prevented their funding of global terror,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s decision to nominate a hardline settler leader for Israeli ambassador to Washington three days after Trump\u2019s election also indicates that the prime minister believes the next administration will be receptive to right-wing arguments.",
      "US-born Yechiel Leiter, who was Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff when he was finance minister, supports the annexation of the West Bank. According to the Haaretz newspaper, he was once active in the US-based Jewish Defence League, the organisation founded by far-right rabbi Meir Kahane. His son was killed fighting in Gaza.",
      "He was also reported to support the Abraham Accords, Trump\u2019s efforts to normalise relations between Israel and Arab states, which had some success. However, advancing that process has been derailed by the ongoing war in Gaza and Arab anger over the suffering of the Palestinians.",
      "Palestinians, already disillusioned with the US over Joe Biden\u2019s support for Israel during the war in Gaza, say Trump\u2019s pick for ambassador suggests the next president will make the prospect of an eventual two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict even more remote.",

      "Donald Trump has moved speedily since winning the US presidential election to set the foundations of his second term in the White House.",
      "He has made his early priorities clear - and stunned some in Washington and around the world while doing so.",
      "Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned from his rollercoaster first week as president-elect.",
      "1) He\u2019s building a loyal team to shake up government",
      "Trump started building his top team almost immediately, nominating cabinet picks for Senate approval and appointing White House advisers and other senior aides.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t tell the full story.",
      "His selections make clear that he plans a radical shake up of government, eschewing more conventional and experienced picks for those who are loyal to him and share his vision for a second term that will upend the status quo in Washington.",
      "His choice for defence secretary, for example, has called for a purge of military chiefs enacting \u201cwoke\u201d policies. His nominee for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has said he wants to \u201cclear out corruption\u201d at America\u2019s health agencies and cut \u201centire departments\u201d at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
      "And that\u2019s not to mention a promised \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201c helmed by advisers Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, which Trump says will focus on slashing regulations and historic cost-cutting.",
      "The bigger picture is that Trump\u2019s proposed team is almost universally loyal, and favour overhauling their respective government departments.",
      "You can take a deeper look at who\u2019s in the frame for his top team here.",
      "2) He\u2019ll have a friendly Congress on his side",
      "Republicans have won control of the House as well as the Senate, giving the party a crucial (albeit narrow) majority in both chambers for at least the next two years, when there will be the usual midterm elections.",
      "This is a major boost to Trump\u2019s agenda. It means he will be more easily able to pass legislation and gives his policy priorities a friendly path to becoming law.",
      "The Democratic Party will, naturally, be less able to block and resist his agenda too. And Trump should for now be able to avoid the kind of congressional investigations he faced in the second half of his first term.",
      "Ultimately, Republican control of Congress could prove key in pushing through his big pledges such as mass deportations, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "It won\u2019t always be smooth sailing for Trump in Congress, however, as our correspondent Gary O\u2019Donoghue explains here.",
      "3) But Senate Republicans won\u2019t always roll over",
      "Trump\u2019s influence was put to the test earlier this week when Republicans in the Senate picked their new leader.",
      "While he did not weigh-in on the race directly, there had been a concerted effort from the president-elect\u2019s most vocal allies as well as favourable \u2018Maga\u2019 media outlets to get hard-line Trump loyalist Rick Scott elected.",
      "But he was defeated in the first round and Republicans opted for a more orthodox pick in John Thune, who has had a more rocky relationship with Trump.",
      "It\u2019s worth noting that this was a secret ballot, so it was far from a public repudiation of Trumpworld.",
      "There will be sterner tests of Trump\u2019s power on Capitol Hill to come, notably when confirmation hearings are held for his more divisive cabinet picks.",
      "Some Senate Republicans, for example, have already signalled their opposition to Trump's shock choice of Matt Gaetz to lead the justice department.",
      "4) Trump's criminal conviction could soon be wiped",
      "While much of the focus was on the president-elect\u2019s nominations and appointments, we also had a reminder that his legal troubles have been upended by his victory.",
      "In New York specifically, his criminal fraud conviction in the hush-money case lives on for at least a few more days.",
      "But it could soon be consigned to history. Earlier this week a judge delayed his decision as to whether Trump\u2019s conviction should be thrown out because of a Supreme Court ruling in the summer that expanded presidential immunity.",
      "That decision is now expected to come next week. And while it\u2019s not clear whether the conviction will be tossed out, Trump\u2019s scheduled sentencing on 26 November is likely to be delayed regardless.",
      "Here\u2019s a reminder of how Trump\u2019s election win impacts his cases.",
      "What are recess appointments and how will Trump administration picks be vetted?",
      "Trump's pick of Huckabee and Witkoff a clue to Middle East policy",

      "Who has joined Trump's team so far?",
      "5) He has China firmly in his sights",
      "It\u2019s no secret that Trump views the world differently to Biden, and could drastically shift US foreign policy over the next few years.",
      "One clear theme that's emerged in recent days is the prominence of China hawks in his proposed team - those who believe Beijing poses a serious threat to US economic and military dominance and want to challenge this more forcefully.",
      "And they are present from the top down.",
      "His nomination for secretary of state - America\u2019s most senior diplomat - Marco Rubio, has described China as the \u201cmost advanced adversary America has ever faced\u201d.",
      "Mike Waltz, his national security adviser, has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China. Other nominees such as his proposed ambassador to the UN, Elise Stefanik, have directly accused China of election interference.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first administration, relations with Beijing were tense, and they barely warmed under Biden. With tariffs, export controls and pointed rhetoric, the president-elect appears ready to take an even tougher stance this time around."

      "These hearings can sometimes be contentious. They allow members from both political parties to question nominees about their backgrounds and plans for the post.",
      "After the hearing, the committee votes on the nomination. If it approves the candidate, the full Senate then votes on the nominee.",
      "Historically, the upper chamber has approved cabinet positions quickly - sometimes with little or no debate. But \"political and partisan conflicts between the president and senators have at times produced dramatic fights over cabinet nominees and led to their ultimate withdrawal or rejection\", the Senate's historical website notes.",

      "There is, however, an exception to this process - recess appointments - which Trump appears intent to use to ensure his appointments are able to take office.",
      "Basically, the process says that when Congress is in recess - meaning it's not in session for a duration of time - the president can make appointments temporarily without congressional approval or vetting.",
      "Sen Thune warned on Fox that while recess appointments are an option for nominees, it is also not a certainty. First, all senators would need to vote to recess, he said, adding that the same senators with concerns about a nominee might also oppose a recess.",
      "The recess process was created when Congress didn't meet as often as it does today, and was to be used in emergencies so presidents would be able to fill positions without delay.",
      "It is also supposed to be a temporary appointment and expires at the end of a congressional session - so at most, one year.",
      "Trump recently said the Senate \"must agree\" to recess appointments, otherwise \"we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner\". He noted that in his past administration, some of his nominees took multiple years to be confirmed.",
      "Trump's plan to use recess appointments, along with the announcement that Republican senators' support bypassing the Senate vetting process, is not without precedent.",

      "In 2020, during a pandemic briefing, Trump said that he would \"exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress\u201d to make recess appointments if his nominees before Congress were not approved.",
      "Professor Chafetz stressed that this route has never been used before in US history, and so \"no-one is quite sure how it would work\".",

      "If Trump wishes for the Senate to recess for a period longer than 10 days, he would require the unanimous consent of all 100 lawmakers.",
      "But the chamber includes 47 Democrats, all or most of whom will vote to block the change.",
      "In order to override that blockade, Republicans need a 60-vote majority, which means winning support from all 53 of their members and at least seven Democrats.",
      "With Republicans unlikely to reach that threshold, they will be faced with rolling back a procedural tool known as the filibuster. Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune, like his predecessor Mitch McConnell, has already indicated he does not support setting such a precedent.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 21:49:14 GMT",
    "summary": "The tour unfolded during India's independence and partition, with cricketers facing turmoil.",
    "story": [
      "India's forthcoming cricket tour of Australia continues a historic rivalry that has evolved since 1947-48. This fierce competition is now as keenly awaited as the Ashes. But the inaugural tour unfolded against the harrowing backdrop of India's independence and partition, with cricketers confronting turmoil and communal strife at home, as they prepared to face Australia\u2019s legendary Donald Bradman and his \u201cInvincibles\".",
      "In 1947, as India prepared for its first cricket tour of Australia, the nation was in the midst of unprecedented upheaval.",
      "Independence had come with the painful partition that created Pakistan, sparking one of history's largest and bloodiest migrations. Amidst this chaos and as millions crossed borders, religious violence spread with Hindus and Sikhs on one side, and Muslims on the other. India's 16-member cricket squad - selected months earlier -  also had to deal with both personal and national turmoil as they readied themselves for a landmark series.",
      "Anthony De Mello, the president of Board of Control for Cricket in India, announced the team with a backdrop of a map of undivided India, proclaiming that the team would represent all of India.",
      "Until then, the Indian cricket team \u2013 known as \"All India\" \u2013 had only toured three times for official Test matches to England between 1932 and 1946, losing the series on every occasion.",
      "But in 1946 future Australian captain Lindsay Hassett brought an Australian Services team to India to celebrate the Allies\u2019 victory in World War Two. India won the unofficial series of three matches 1-0 and Hassett reported back to the Australian cricket authorities that the Indians were worthy of an official Test series.",
      "Excitement and anticipation ran high in Indian cricket circles as the team was expected to face the mighty Australians, led by legendary batsman Donald Bradman. His team was later dubbed \"Bradman's Invincibles\" after returning undefeated from England in 1948.",
      "De Mello\u2019s India squad was led by ace opening batsman Vijay Merchant, with his reliable partner Mushtaq Ali serving as deputy.",
      "Both had been exceptional on the English tours of 1936 and 1946, cementing their leadership roles. The squad also boasted elegant batter Rusi Modi and promising debutant fast bowler Fazal Mahmood, adding a dynamic mix of experience and fresh talent.",
      "But both Merchant and Modi withdrew from the tour on medical grounds. Ali also withdrew following the death of his elder brother, leaving him with family responsibilities.",
      "As a result, Lala Amarnath was announced as the new captain and Vijay Hazare his deputy.",
      "However, the violence that erupted following partition nearly prevented Amarnath from reaching Australia. According to a 2004 biography by his son Rajender Amarnath, Lala Amarnath narrowly escaped a sectarian mob in Patiala in Indian Punjab. His home in Lahore, now in Pakistan, along with its priceless artefacts, was lost forever.",
      "He also encountered danger during a train journey to Delhi.",
      "At a station in Indian Punjab, a police official recognised Amarnath and gave him a kada - a steel bangle worn by Sikhs and many Hindus as a religious symbol. Later, a mob at the station spared the cricketer because of the kada - it probably led them to believe he shared their faith.",
      "On the other side of the religious divide, pace bowler Mahmood found himself facing a deadly mob on a train.",
      "The team had scheduled two weeks of training in Pune (then Poona) from 15 August - though it was not known then, that was the day India was partitioned.",
      "Despite restrictions, Mahmood reached Poona for the training camp. Afterwards, he travelled to Bombay (now Mumbai) en route to Lahore. He writes in his 2003 autobiography that on the train, two men threatened him, but former Indian captain CK Nayudu intervened, bat in hand, and warned them off.",
      "Once he reached curfew-bound Lahore, Mahmood was horrified by the bloodshed he witnessed there and decided to stay back in Pakistan and not tour Australia. He later became part of the Pakistani cricket team and made his Test debut in 1952-53 against India.",
      "Two other members of India\u2019s squad for the Australia tour \u2013 Gul Mohammad and Amir Elahi \u2013 also later moved to Pakistan and played against India in the 1952-53 series.",
      "Despite these setbacks, India\u2019s tour went ahead, though a weakened India faced Australia without four of its leading players and lost the series 4-0.",
      "The two countries now play each other almost every two years. The miracle, however, is that the inaugural tour of 1947-48 happened at all, given the tumult at home.",

    "title": "Russian gains accelerate as Ukraine's Kursk gamble falters",
    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 22:11:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Moscow's forces have taken more ground since September than they did over the course of 2023, analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Russian military is accelerating its gains along the front line in Ukraine at a crucial time for the conflict.",
      "Data from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) shows that Russia has gained almost six times as much territory in 2024 as it did in 2023, and is advancing towards key Ukrainian logistical hubs in the eastern Donbas region.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukraine's surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region is faltering. Russian troops have pushed Kyiv's offensive backwards. Experts have questioned the success of the offensive, with one calling it a \"strategic catastrophe\" given manpower shortages faced by Ukraine.",
      "These developments come at a time of heightened uncertainty with a second Donald Trump administration looming. The US president-elect has vowed to bring the war to a close when he takes office in January, with some fearing he could cut future military aid to Ukraine.",
      "Russia advances in eastern Ukraine",
      "In the first few months of the war the front line moved quickly, with Russia gaining ground quickly before being pushed back by a Ukrainian counteroffensive. But in 2023 neither side made any major gains - with the conflict largely sliding into a stalemate.",
      "But new figures from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) suggest that the story in 2024 is more favourable for Russia. The ISW bases its analysis on confirmed social media footage and reports of troop movements.",
      "The ISW data shows Moscow\u2019s forces have seized around 2,700 sq km of Ukrainian territory so far this year, compared with just 465 sq km in the whole of 2023, a near six-fold increase.",
      "Dr Marina Miron, a defence researcher at Kings College London, suggested to the BBC that there was a possibility the Ukrainian eastern front \u201cmight actually collapse\u201d if Russia continues to advance at pace.",
      "More than 1000 sq km was taken between 1 September and 3 November, suggesting that the push has accelerated in recent months. Two areas bearing the brunt of these advances are Kupiansk in Kharkiv region, and Kurakhove, a stepping stone to the key logistical hub of Pokrovsk in Donetsk region.",
      "Kupiansk and areas to the east of the Oskil river were liberated in the Kharkiv offensive of 2022, but Russia has progressively retaken the latter area. In a recent intelligence update, the UK's Ministry of Defence said that Russian forces were trying to breach the north-eastern outskirts of the city.",
      "Footage posted on 13 November, and verified by the BBC is consistent with this analysis. The video shows a convoy of Russian armour being repelled after making it to within 4km of the key bridge at Kupiansk, the last major road crossing in the area.",
      "While these reports do not necessarily translate to control of an area, it is indicative of how stretched Ukraine\u2019s defensive line has become.",
      "Elsewhere, since retaking the city of Vuhledar in October - an elevated position which sits above key supply lines and which Moscow spent two years fighting for - Russia has thrown resources at Kurakhove.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s forces defending the city have so far repelled attacks to the south and east. But the front line creeps ever closer, with Russia also threatening to encircle defenders from the north and west.",
      "Col Yevgeny Sasyko, a former head of strategic communications with Ukraine\u2019s general staff, said Russia places \u201cpowerful jaws\u201d around the flanks of a city that slowly \u201cgrind though\u201d defences until they collapse.",
      "Footage from the city verified by the BBC showed massive destruction, with residential buildings heavily damaged.",
      "The ISW concludes Moscow now holds a total of 110,649 sq km in Ukraine. For comparison, Ukrainian forces seized just over 1,171 sq km in the first month of its incursion into Kursk - though Russian forces have now retaken nearly half of that territory.",
      "Despite its territorial gains, Russia's advance has come at a huge cost.",
      "An analysis carried out by BBC Russian confirmed that at least 78,329 troops have been killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, with Moscow\u2019s losses from September to November this year more than one-and-a-half times greater than the same period in 2023.",
      "The losses are compounded by the \u201cmeat grinder\u201d approach said to be favoured by Russian commanders - describing the waves of recruits thrown towards Ukrainian positions in a bid to exhaust troops.",
      "Despite the Russian advances, some experts have noted that the actual speed of the offensive is still slow. David Handelman, a military analyst, suggested Ukrainian troops in the east were slowly withdrawing to preserve manpower and resources, rather than suffering from a broader collapse.",
      "The Kursk gambit",
      "Ukraine launched its shock incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region in August. It is unclear why Russia took so long to respond to the operation, which saw Kyiv\u2019s troops quickly gain control over a number of border communities.",
      "Dr Miron suggested that while the Kremlin would suffer a domestic political cost for as long as the incursion continued, Russia\u2019s general staff had been keen to keep Ukraine\u2019s forces tied down in Kursk as its forces made gains elsewhere along the front line.",
      "But Moscow is now clearly intent on reclaiming the territory lost on its own soil. Some 50,000 troops have been deployed to the region.",
      "Verified videos from the Kursk region show fierce fighting is taking place - and that Russia is suffering considerable losses in terms of manpower and equipment. But the data clearly shows Ukraine\u2019s control of the region is shrinking.",
      "Since the start of October, Russian counter-attacks have regained some 593 sq km worth of territory in the border region, ISW figures showed.",
      "The Kursk incursion was initially a major boon for Ukraine in terms of morale at a time of serious setbacks, and the audacity of the operation was a reminder of its ability to surprise and harm its enemy.",
      "But Dr Miron said while the Kursk incursion was a moment of \u201ctactical brilliance\u201d it has also been a \u201cstrategic catastrophe\u201d for Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThe whole idea was to maybe gain some political leverage in potential negotiations, but militarily to draw the Russian forces away from the Donbas in order to liberate Kursk. And what we're seeing instead is that Ukrainian units are tied down there.\u201d",
      "Some of Kyiv\u2019s most experienced and effective units are known to be fighting in Kursk. Mechanised units equipped with state-of-the-art Western armour are also involved in the offensive.",
      "Ukrainian leaders had hinted that they hoped the incursion would force Moscow to redirect some of its forces from eastern Ukraine, slowing the Russian advance there. Instead, experts say most reinforcements were moved to Kursk from parts in Ukraine where the fighting is not as intense.",
      "\u201cAccording to Ukrainian soldiers from different parts of the front, the Russian troops reinforcing Kursk were mainly pulled from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia,\u201d Yurri Clavilier, a land analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the BBC.",
      "\u201cThe fighting there is not as intense as it is in the East. Some Russian units attacking Kharkiv were also redirected to Kursk as Ukraine managed to stall the Russian onslaught there,\u201d he added.",
      "The importance of territory to both sides is the strength it lends to their position in any potential negotiations. Although no peace negotiations have been discussed, US President-elect Trump has claimed he could end the war within 24 hours, without saying exactly how.",
      "\u200b\u200bOn Tuesday, Ukraine fired US-supplied long-range missiles into Russia for the first time - a day after Washington gave it permission to do so.\u200b\u200b It is thought that the decision was made in part to help Ukraine hold on to part of the Kursk region, to use as a bargaining chip in future negotiations.",
      "But Dr Miron told the BBC that Russia\u2019s advance has handed them a stronger negotiating position as Trump\u2019s new foreign policy team prepare to take office.",
      "\u201cWhat they're controlling right now, it does give them a certain advantage\u201d she said. \u201cIf it came to negotiations, I'm sure that as the Russian side has been stressing, \u2018we will do it based on the battlefield configuration\u2019.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom a Russian perspective, they have much better cards than the Ukrainians.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:05:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Mahama's colourful story involves a historic coup, a stay in Moscow and a surprise dancehall hit.",
    "story": [
      "John Dramani Mahama has been Ghana's president once before - and now he is back for another punt at the top job.",
      "The 65-year-old led Ghana from 2012 to 2017 and is one of the West African country's most experienced politicians. He has served at all levels of office, as an MP, deputy minister, minister, vice-president and president.",
      "Long before it became a career, politics played a significant role in Mahama's childhood. When Mahama was just seven, his father, a government minister, was jailed during a military coup and later went into exile.",
      "Personal trials like this appear in Mahama's acclaimed writing - he has been published by a number of international news outlets and his memoir, My First Coup D'etat, won praise from two African literary greats, Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Chinua Achebe.",
      "When penning his manifesto for this year's elections, Mahama told voters Ghana \"is headed in the wrong direction and needs to be rescued\".",
      "But critics argue he may not be the right man for the job, given that his administration was hit by economic problems and a string of corruption scandals.",
      "Mahama's journey began in 1958, when he was born in the northern town of Damongo. After a few years he moved to the capital, Accra, to live with his father, Emmanuel Adama Mahama.",
      "In My First Coup d'Etat, Mahama Jr describes himself as \"an observant child with an active imagination and an unbounded curiosity\".",
      "He was also relatively privileged. The family had another home in the town of Bole, which at the time was not on the national grid. Mahama's parents were able to invest in a diesel generator for their six-bedroom house, meaning theirs was the only house in the town with lights.",
      "Local residents would gather outside the house when night fell, captivated by the curious orange glow.",
      "The future president attended Achimota boarding school, a prestigious institution known for educating heads of state like Ghana's Jerry John Rawlings, Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe and Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana's first prime minister after it gained independence from the UK.",
      "It was at Achimota, in 1966, that Mahama heard there had been a coup. Military and police personnel had stormed Ghana's government buildings, seizing power from Nkrumah, who was away on a foreign trip.",
      "As updates trickled in, Mahama became increasingly anxious - he had heard no word from his father. Seven-year-old Mahama feared his father had been killed because of his proximity to Nkrumah.",
      "It turned out his father had been imprisoned - he would remain in jail for approximately a year.",
      "In 1981, after a second military coup, Mahama's father fled the country for Nigeria.",
      "Meanwhile, Mahama spent his twenties and thirties studying - he got a Communication Studies degree from the University of Ghana before studying at Moscow's Institute of Social Sciences.",
      "Mahama noted that his stay in Russia, then part of the Soviet Union, alerted him to \"the imperfections of the socialist system\".",
      "After returning to Ghana in 1996, Mahama followed his father's footsteps into politics.",
      "He was elected as a Member of Parliament for the National Democratic Congress (NDC) party and from there, scaled the political ranks. He zeroed in on the NDC's messaging, taking up roles as the parliamentary spokesperson and minister for communication.",
      "In 13 years, Mahama worked his way up to become vice-president, second-in-command under President John Atta Mills.",
      "But after just three years in office, Mills died unexpectedly at the age of 68.",
      "Just hours after this tragedy, a 58-year-old Mahama was sworn in as president. In his speech, Mahama described the day as the \"saddest\" in Ghana's history.",
      "General elections were held later that year and voters chose to keep Mahama in office.",
      "So what kind of leader is Mahama? Franklin Cudjoe, a Ghanaian political commentator and head of the Imani Centre for Policy and Education, told the BBC the former president was an \"excellent communicator\".",
      "While political scientist Dr Clement Sefa-Nyarko described Mahama as a \"pragmatist\".",
      "Mahama has the it-factor but only in a climate where \"politics is driven by reality and intelligent communication\", said Dr Sefa-Nyarko, who lectures on African leadership at King's College London.",
      "But in contemporary Ghana, many voters are captivated by overambitious pledges, according to Dr Clement Sefa-Nyarko, which means pragmatic Mahama is \"not able to charm the populace much\".",
      "When campaigning to stay in power ahead of the 2016 elections, Mahama highlighted various infrastructure projects completed under his administration, such as those in the transportation, health, and education sectors.",
      "But under his watch, Ghanaians also experienced an ailing economy and widespread power cuts. Mahama was nicknamed \"Mr Dumsor\" in reference to the blackouts - \"dum\" means off and \"sor\" means on in the local Twi language.",
      "His term was also blighted by corruption scandals. For instance, a UK court found that aviation giant Airbus had used bribes to secure contracts with Ghana for military planes between 2009 and 2015 - but Ghana's Office of the Special Prosecutor concluded there was no evidence that Mahama was involved in any corrupt activities himself.",
      "There are \"lingering issues\" surrounding these graft scandals - ones that the current electorate will \"remember\", Mr Cudjoe said.",
      "But he also points out that, according to Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), corruption became worse under Nana Akufo-Addo, who beat Mahama in the 2016 elections.",
      "Ghana averaged 45.8 under Mahama but dropped to 42 under Akufo-Addo in the CPI ranking where zero equates to \"highly corrupt\" and 100 is \"very clean\".",
      "Mahama attempted to win his old job back in 2020, but lost out to Akufo-Addo once again.",
      "Despite these defeats, Mahama has remained in the political sphere - he is currently leader of the opposition.",
      "He also enjoys a busy life away from politics - he has seven children and spends time with his wife, Lordina.",
      "Mahama is also a prolific writer. Asides from his memoir, he has written for media outlets like The New York Times, leading African-American magazine Ebony and Ghana's state-owned Daily Graphic.",
      "Mahama has also expressed his passion for music, saying Nigerian Afrobeat icon Fela Kuti helped him form \"political consciousness\" and that Michael Jackson is \"one of the greatest artistes that ever lived\".",
      "And in a full-circle moment, the former president was immortalised in Mahama Paper, a song by Ghanaian dancehall star Shatta Wale. Wale said the title was a reference to the Ghanaian banknotes printed during Mahama's administration.",
      "Naturally, Mahama has used the hit in his current campaign, pointing out that under  Akufo-Addo, Ghana has plummeted into its worst economic crisis in years.",
      "He has also been reminding Ghanaians of his extensive political experience but the fact remains - he was voted out of power once before as the public felt his performance wasn't good enough.",
      "Mahama is seeking to persuade voters this time will be different - a communications whizz hoping his message is clear enough to win him a second chance in Ghana's highest office.",

      "They were charged in 2021 under a controversial national security law (NSL) imposed by China. On Tuesday a court in Hong Kong sentenced 45 of them to jail terms ranging from four to 10 years. Two defendants were acquitted earlier in the year.",
      "Officials accused the eight women and 39 men of trying to overthrow the government by running an unofficial primary to pick opposition candidates for local elections. Most of the defendants either pleaded guilty or were convicted of conspiring to commit subversion.",
      "Some are famous figures like Joshua Wong and Benny Tai, icons of the 2014 pro-democracy protests that rocked Hong Kong.",
      "There are also well-known opposition lawmakers Claudia Mo, Helena Wong,  Kwok ka-ki and Leung Kwok-hung who is also known as Long Hair.",

      "What is Hong Kong's tough new security law?",
      "Then there are those who were not involved in politics but were galvanised by the 2019 protests - social workers like Hendrick Lui, entrepreneurs like Mike Lam and a former nurse, Winnie Yu.",
      "Most of the defendants have been in jail since the arrests in early 2021, as pre-trial detentions have become the norm under the NSL.",
      "Laurence Lau, a barrister and former district councillor, and Lee Yue-shun, also a former district councillor, were acquitted in May.",
      "The professor - Benny Tai",
      "One of the main organisers of the 2020 primary, Tai has been labelled by China as a \u201chardcore troublemaker\u201d for allegedly advocating Hong Kong independence and describing the Communist Party\u2019s rule as a \u201cdictatorship\u201d.",
      "A scholar and law professor, Tai first rose to prominence in 2014 when he founded the pro-democracy Occupy Central movement along with two others.",
      "It was a historic civil disobedience campaign that called for fair and free elections in Hong Kong, and saw hundreds of thousands take to the streets.",
      "In 2019, Tai was sentenced to prison for his role in the Occupy Central protests.",
      "A year later, after the NSL was imposed, he was fired from his tenured job at the prestigious University of Hong Kong (HKU) over his criminal conviction.",
      "Tai accused the university of bowing to Chinese pressure and called it the \u201cend of academic freedom\u201d in the city.",

      "Arguably Hong Kong\u2019s most famous pro-democracy activist, Wong\u2019s journey into activism started when he was just 14.",
      "By 2014, he had become the face of the Umbrella Movement, a mass student protest with the umbrella as a symbol, which sprang up alongside the Occupy Central sit-in.",
      "He was just 20 when his activism landed him in jail, the first of what would be several convictions.",
      "In 2019, Hong Kong erupted in months-long protests as hundreds of thousands marched against a hugely controversial extradition bill that would allow Hongkongers to be sent to mainland China to face trial.",
      "Wong was among thousands who held a 15-hour siege of police headquarters in the Wan Chai district, pelting the building with eggs and spraying graffiti on its walls, in June that year.",
      "While the demonstrations at that time were widely seen as a spontaneous \u201cleaderless\" movement, prosecutors said he led that particular protest, pointing to a video of him calling for the crowd to \"completely besiege police headquarters\u201d.",
      "He was jailed for his role in them, and placed in solitary confinement.",
      "But he remained defiant after pleading guilty: \u201cPerhaps the authorities wish me to stay in prison one term after another. But I am persuaded that neither prison bars, nor election ban, nor any other arbitrary powers would stop us from activism.\u201d",
      "He was still serving his sentence when he was charged with subversion under the NSL.",

      "Former opposition lawmaker Leung Kwok-hung, better known as Long Hair for his coiffure, once described himself as a \u201cMarxist revolutionary\u201d.",
      "The 68-year-old was known for his political theatrics - one of his signature moves involved hurling bananas as a sign of protest. When he was sworn in again as a lawmaker in 2016, he released a balloon with a political banner and held a yellow umbrella, declaring that the \u201cUmbrella Movement would never end\u201d.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:35:57 GMT",
    "summary": "The Nagas want to bring home human remains which colonial administrators had removed from the country.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, Ellen Konyak was shocked to discover that a 19th-Century skull from the north-eastern Indian state of Nagaland was up for auction in the UK.",
      "The horned skull of a Naga tribesman was among thousands of items that European colonial administrators had collected from the state.",
      "Konyak, a member of the Naga Forum for Reconciliation (NFR) which is making efforts to bring these human remains back home, says the news of the auction disturbed her.",
      "\u201cTo see that people are still auctioning our ancestral human remains in the 21st Century was shocking,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was very insensitive and deeply hurtful.\u201d",
      "The Swan at Tetsworth, the UK-based antique centre that put the skull on auction, advertised it as part of their \u201cCurious Collector Sale\u201d, valued between \u00a33,500 ($4,490) and \u00a34,000 ($5,132). Alongside the skull - which is from a Belgian collection \u2013 the sale listed shrunken heads from the Jivaro people of South America and skulls from the Ekoi people of West Africa.",
      "Naga scholars and experts protested against the sale. The chief minister of Nagaland, Konyak\u2019s home state, wrote a letter to the Indian foreign ministry describing the act as \u201cdehumanising\u201d and \u201ccontinued colonial violence upon our people\u201d.",
      "The auction house withdrew the sale following the outcry, but for the Naga people the episode revived memories of their violent past, prompting them to renew calls for the repatriation of their ancestral remains stored or displayed far from their homeland.",
      "Scholars suggest that some of these human remains were bartered items or gifts, but others may have been taken away without the consent of their owners.",
      "Alok Kumar Kanungo, a scholar of Naga culture, estimates that the UK\u2019s public museums and private collections alone hold around 50,000 Naga objects.",
      "Oxford University's Pitt Rivers Museum (PRM), which has the largest Naga collection, features approximately 6,550 items taken from the state, including 41 human remains. The museum also has human remains from several other states of British India.",
      "But in recent years, experts say, with growing ethical concerns about collection, sale and display of human remains, many collectors are reconsidering their approach.",
      "Kanungo says human remains have become \u201cwhite elephants\u201d for museums.",
      "\"They are no longer an object that can be disposed of or possessed by its owners; no longer a source of tourists\u2019 money; can no longer be used to present Naga peoples as \u2018uncivilised\u2019; and of late have become an emotionally and politically charged issue.\u201d",
      "So, museums have started returning human remains from communities such as the Maori tribes of New Zealand, the Mudan warriors of Taiwan, the Aboriginal people of Australia and the Native Hawaiians.",
      "In 2019, PRM told the BBC that it had returned 22 such objects.",
      "A museum spoksperson told the BBC that the figure has now gone up to 35. \"So far these [objects] have all been returned to Australia, New Zealand, US and Canada.\"",
      "As part of an ethical review, the museum removed Naga skulls from public display in 2020 and placed them in storage. This is when FNR demanded their repatriation for the first time.",
      "The museum said it was yet to receive a formal claim from Naga descendants and the processes to return human remains \"can take between 18 months and several years, depending on the complexity of the case\".",
      "Repatriating human remains is more complicated than returning artefacts. It requires extensive research to determine whether the items were collected ethically, to identify descendants and to navigate complex international regulations on movement of human remains.",
      "The Naga forum has formed a group called Recover, Restore and Decolonise under anthropologists Dolly Kikon and Arkotong Longkumer to facilitate returns.",
      "\u201cIt is a bit like detective work,\u201d Longkumer said. \u201cWe have to sift through different layers of information and try to read between the lines to actually find out about the exact nature of the collections and where they are from.\u201d",
      "But for the Naga people, this process is not merely logistical. \u201cWe are dealing with human remains,\u201d said Konyak. \u201cIt\u2019s an international and legal process, but it\u2019s also a spiritual one for us.\u201d",
      "The group has been travelling to villages, meeting Naga elders, organising lectures and distributing educational materials such as comic books and videos to spread awareness.",
      "They are also trying to build consensus around subjects such as the last rites of repatriated remains. Most Nagas now follow Christianity, but their ancestors were animists who followed different birth and death rituals.",
      "The group found that even Naga elders were unaware that their ancestral remains were in foreign land. Anthropologist and archaeologist Tiatoshi Jamir said one elder told him that this could make \u201cthe soul of their ancestors restless\u201d.",
      "Jamir said even he was not aware about the skulls on display in foreign museums until he read about them in a local paper in the early 2000s.",
      "The British took over the Naga areas in 1832 and, in 1873, introduced a special permission for travellers \u2013 called the Inner Line Permit \u2013 to strictly control access to the region.",
      "Historians say the colonial administrators put down any rebellions and often burnt Naga villages to subdue them, in the process erasing much of their important cultural markers such as paintings, engravings and artefacts.",
      "Konyak says she has discovered that one of the human remains in PRM's list is of a person from her village and tribe.",
      "\u201cI am like, \u2018Oh my goodness! It belongs to one of my ancestors',\" she told the BBC.",
      "She is still undecided about how the last rites would be performed once the remains are returned.",
      "\u201cBut we want them back as a mark of respect to our elders,\u201d she said. \u201cTo reclaim our history. To claim our narrative.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:30:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Presidential candidate Mahamudu Bawumia hopes he can silence his critics once more to become Ghana's leader.",
    "story": [
      "Mahamudu Bawumia soared from being a political outsider to become Ghana's second-in-command - and in December he could make history as the country's first Muslim president.",
      "Bawumia, currently Ghana's vice-president, was chosen by the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) as their candidate for the forthcoming general election.",
      "The 61-year-old Tottenham Hotspur supporter has quite the reputation.",
      "He is an intellectual educated at Oxford University, is never seen without his signature slim, rectangular glasses and has been dubbed \"Mr Digital\" thanks to his pledge to whip Ghana into a technological heavyweight.",
      "But because he is head of the government's economic management team, many Ghanaians associate Bawumia with the punishing cost of living crisis they're experiencing.",
      "Should Bawumia overcome the criticism and win the election, he will replace his current boss President Nana Akufo-Addo, who is approaching the end of his two-term limit.",
      "\"Mr Digital\" barrelled onto the political scene in 2008, sparking bemusement and scepticism.",
      "Bawumia was a 44-year-old who had never held public office, yet Akufo-Addo - then a mere presidential candidate - had chosen him as a running mate.",
      "Bawumia's father Alhaji Mumuni had served in Ghana's earliest governments after the country gained independence from Britain in 1957, working closely with revered Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah.",
      "But the younger Bawumia had forged a career in economics and banking - serving as the deputy governor of Ghana's central bank.",
      "To many commentators and NPP insiders, it made no sense for Akufo-Addo to pick Bawumia over seasoned party members.",
      "Akufo-Addo ended up losing the election to John Atta Mills from the National Democratic Congress (NDC) by a tiny margin.",
      "Bawumia lost out on the VP job - but his charismatic campaign had silenced the naysayers.",
      "\"He fired [up] the NPP campaign. I think no-one else could have done a better job, to be honest, in terms of the support he gave to the NPP,\" Ghanaian political scientist Dr Clement Sefa-Nyarko told the BBC.",
      "Akufo-Addo and Bawumia gave the elections another go in 2012. Again, they lost.",
      "The NPP challenged the election results in the Supreme Court, choosing Bawumia as their star witness.",
      "During the proceedings, which were broadcast on national television, Bawumia came across as witty and unflustered by the relentless, days-long cross-examination.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, who is this guy? He's really the guy to root for,\" said Dr Sefa-Nyarko, who lectures on African leadership at King's College London.",
      "Akufo-Addo decided to keep Bawumia on his ticket and in 2016, on their third shot at power, the NPP won with 51.3% of the vote. Bawumia finally became vice-president.",
      "Bawumia's journey to the top began in 1963, when he was born into a large family in the northern city of Tamale.",
      "He was the 12th of his father's 18 children.",
      "After completing primary and secondary school in Ghana, Bawumia moved to the UK for undergraduate study and went on to gain a masters in economics from the prestigious Oxford University.",
      "To support himself during his studies, he took up jobs as a taxi driver and cleaner.",
      "He returned to Ghana in 2000 to work at the central bank, where he worked his way up to become deputy governor.",
      "Bawumia campaigned on this economic know-how during his attempts to become VP. Therefore, he faced heavy criticism when Ghana plummeted into its most severe economic crisis in years under his watch.",
      "Inflation hit a record 54% in December 2022 and the country was forced to take a $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) loan from the International Monetary Fund after government debt soared.",
      "In response to the criticism, Bawumia has said the economic management team he headed had no \"decision-making powers\" and that it merely provided advice to the government.",
      "But for many, this wasn't good enough.",
      "\"In terms of character, in terms of integrity, people started questioning themselves: 'What is this? How did it end up here? We thought you were the best guy, and look at where we've ended up',\" Franklin Cudjoe, a Ghanaian political commentator and head of the Imani Centre for Policy and Education, told the BBC.",
      "Along with his role as an economist, Bawumia has also built the reputation of being a digital visionary.",
      "Ghana's digital ecosystem has seen \"significant growth\" especially in areas such as mobile phone connectivity, Charles Abani, head of the United Nations team in Ghana, remarked last month.",
      "This \"remarkable digital transformation\" was \"spearheaded\" by Bawumia, news website African Business reported, while Ghanaian newspaper The Chronicle hailed Bawumia's \"expertise in global digital transformation\".",
      "Bawumia said he initiated a partnership between Ghana's government and US-based company Zipline, which led to the creation of the world's largest vaccine delivery network.",
      "He said he reached out to Zipline, which uses drones to fly health products to hard-to-reach clinics, after his father died from a loss of blood.",
      "Although this passion for technology is celebrated by some, others are more sceptical.",
      "Mr Cudjoe said Bawumia has been campaigning on digitalisation rather than confronting debates about the government's handling of the economy.",
      "\"Whether Bawumia was in power or not, digitalisation was bound to happen in this country because we had already started it anyway,\" Mr Cudjoe said.",
      "Dr Sefa-Nyarko said of Bawumia: \"What he has been very successful at is to push and also claim all credit for digitalisation outcomes of the current government.\"",
      "Bawumia's personal life has also been a strength in his presidential campaign. His wife of 20 years, Samira, is a former beauty queen who is widely admired for her chic outfits.",
      "The Second Lady is also vocal when it comes to party politics - and has embarked on campaign tours for the NPP.",
      "The couple have four children together. They are proud followers of Islam - a religion practised by roughly one in five Ghanaians.",
      "Most people in Ghana are Christians but there is not much evidence that coming from a religious minority will hinder Bawumia's election chances, Dr Sefa-Nyarko said.",
      "The NPP has given its \"full support\" to Bawumia's candidacy, \"his Muslim faith notwithstanding\", Dr Sefa-Nyarko added.",
      "\"This could translate into widespread support across the country as well.\"",
      "Bawumia's geographical identity might be of greater consequence than his religion. The vice-president hails from northern Ghana, which is one of the NDC's strongest political bases.",
      "By choosing Bawumia as its presidential candidate, the NPP will be hoping to make inroads in the north, while retaining support in its heartland in the south.",
      "Bawumia has been traversing north, south, east and west in what he calls the \"possibilities bus\", a blue and red campaign vehicle emblazoned with the slogan \"it is possible\".",
      "To some, he is the face of economic mismanagement, but the vice-president retains some of the optimism he held when he was a 44-year-old embarking on an eight-year battle for power.",
      "\"I have the courage to accept when things do not go as well as planned,\" he told voters in his manifesto.",
      "\"But I also have a mindset of possibilities, and faith in ourselves, that we can rise and achieve great things in our lifetime.\"",

    "summary": "Having built a $20bn oil refinery, Aliko Dangote is now at the heart of a row in the murky industry.",
    "story": [
      "Petrol production at Nigerian business tycoon Aliko Dangote\u2019s $20bn (\u00a315.5bn) state-of-the-art oil refinery ought to be some of the best business news Nigeria has had in years.",
      "But many Nigerians will judge its success on two key questions - firstly: \"Will I get cheaper petrol?\"",
      "Sorry, but probably no - unless the international price of crude drops.",
      "And secondly: \"Will I still have to spend hours watching my hair turn grey in a hypertension-inducing fuel queue?\"",
      "Hopefully those days are gone but it might partly depend on the behaviour of what Mr Dangote calls \"the oil mafia\".",
      "For much of the time since oil was first discovered in Nigeria in 1956, the downstream sector, which includes the stage when crude is refined into petrol and other products, has been a cesspit of shady deals with successive governments heavily involved.",
      "It has always been impossible to follow the money, but you know there is something dreadfully wrong when the headline \"Nigeria\u2019s state-owned oil firm fails to pay $16bn in oil revenues\", pops up on your news feed, as it did in 2016.",
      "It is only in the last five years that the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) has been publishing accounts.",
      "The Africa head at the Eurasia Group think-tank, Amaka Anku, hails the Dangote refinery, in which the NNPC has a 7% stake, as \"a very significant moment\" for the West African state.",
      "\"What you had in the downstream sector was an inefficient, corrupt monopoly,\" she says.",
      "\"What the local refinery allows you to do is have a truly competitive downstream sector with multiple players who will be more efficient, profit making and they\u2019ll pay taxes.\"",
      "To put it bluntly, the population of this oil-rich nation has been conned on a colossal scale for many years.",
      "Oil revenue accounts for nearly 90% of Nigeria\u2019s export earnings but a relatively small number of business people and politicians have gorged themselves on the oil wealth.",
      "Aspects of the business model have been baffling, including that of Nigeria\u2019s four previously existing oil refineries.",
      "Built in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, they have fallen into disrepair.",
      "Last year Nigeria\u2019s parliament reported that over the previous decade the state had spent a staggering $25bn trying and failing to fix the moribund facilities.",
      "So Africa\u2019s largest oil producer has been exporting its crude which is then refined abroad, much to the delight of some well-connected traders.",
      "It would be like a bakery with a broken oven. But rather than fix it, the owner sends balls of dough to another firm that shoves them in a working oven and sells the loaves back to the baker.",
      "The NNPC swaps Nigeria\u2019s crude oil for the refined products, including petrol, which are shipped back home.",
      "Exactly how much money changes hands and who benefits from these \"oil swaps\" is just one of the unknowns in these deals.",
      "\"No-one has been able to nail down who exactly has benefited. It\u2019s almost like a beer parlour gossip about who is getting what,\" says Toyin Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "The NNPC began subsidising the price of petrol in the 1970s to cushion the blow when global prices soared. Every year it clawed this money back by depositing lower royalty payments - the money it received for every barrel pumped out of the ground - with the Nigerian treasury.",
      "In 2022 the subsidy cost the government $10bn, more than 40% of the total money it collected in taxes.",
      "On his second day in office Nigeria\u2019s Vice-President Kashim Shettima referred to \"the fuel subsidy scam\" being \"an albatross around the neck of the economy\".",
      "Nigerian oil expert Kelvin Emmanuel says in 2019 the country\u2019s official petrol consumption \"jumped by 284% to 70m litres per day without empirical evidence to justify such a sharp increase in demand\".",
      "Parliament has previously reported that - at least on paper - importers were being paid to bring in far more petrol than the country consumed. There was a lot of money to be made exporting some of the subsidised petrol to neighbouring countries where prices were far higher.",
      "The NNPC earned billions of dollars a year from the crude oil production. But for many years, under previous governments, some of its profits never reached the treasury as it was accused by state governors and federal lawmakers of including these inflated subsidy costs on its balance sheet.",
      "The NNPC did not respond to a request for an interview or a response to these allegations but in June denied it had ever \"inflated its subsidy claims with the federal government\".",
      "It may have been the main source of revenue for successive governments but for decades, until 2020, the board did not disclose its audited accounts. Its press release from March this year promised more transparency and accountability.",
      "After coming to power in May 2023, President Bola Tinubu said the subsidy was unsustainable and suddenly cut it - pump prices immediately tripled.",
      "He also stopped the policy of artificially propping up the value of the local currency, the naira, and let market forces determine its value.",
      "When he took over, the exchange rate was 460 naira to the US dollar. In November 2024 it was over 1,600.",
      "The triple shock of higher fuel prices, sporadic shortages of supply and a depreciating currency has been a tough body blow for people across the country, many of whom are forced to run generators to keep the lights on and phones charged.",
      "\"Beyond the financial burden, the uncertainty and stress of constantly dealing with fuel shortages have added a layer of anxiety to everyday tasks,\" is how one Lagos resident summed it up.",
      "\"I feel like I\u2019m always navigating through crisis mode. It\u2019s exhausting.\"",
      "As the naira plunged and pump prices increased several times, the government, aware of the potential danger of protests, continued to pipette some medicine to the masses.",
      "In a move which could be likened to swallowing half a paracetamol for acute appendicitis, the government made sure people were paying slightly less than the market rate for a litre of petrol.",
      "In other words, the NNPC was selling at a loss and the subsidy was still alive.",
      "But with two recent increases in October, Nigerians are now paying market prices for fuel for the first time in three decades. In the main city Lagos it went up from 858 naira ($0.52) to 1,025 naira per litre.",
      "One of the major factors in Nigeria\u2019s economic crisis has been a limited supply of foreign currency. The country does not export enough products and services to bring in the dollars.",
      "But lots of people, including fuel traders, have been chasing the same limited supply of foreign currency, which leads to the naira losing even more value.",
      "The good news is that Mr Dangote\u2019s facility is going to buy crude and sell refined fuels in Nigeria in the local currency, which will leave more dollars available for everyone else.",
      "The bad news for those hoping this will mean cheaper fuel is that the price Mr Dangote pays for a barrel of local crude will still be the naira equivalent of the international cost in dollars.",
      "So if the price of crude goes up on the world market, Nigerians will still be forced to fork out more naira. Refining locally will mean less freight costs but that\u2019s a relatively small saving.",
      "It is hoped that the arrival of Mr Dangote\u2019s oil refinery will help bring a measure of transparency to the sector.",
      "He knew he would be upsetting some of those who benefit from the murky status quo when the $20bn project began. But, he says, he underestimated the challenge.",
      "\"I knew there would be a fight. But I didn\u2019t know that the mafia in oil, they are stronger than the mafia in drugs,\" Mr Dangote told an investment conference in June.",
      "\"They don\u2019t want the trade to stop. It\u2019s a cartel. Dangote comes along and he\u2019s going to disrupt them entirely. Their business is at risk,\u201d says Mr Emmanuel, the oil expert.",
      "The fact that there have been some public disagreements with the regulator has only fuelled that suspicion.",
      "Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery near Lagos is thirsty, with a capacity of 650,000 barrels of crude a day.",
      "You would have thought being located in Nigeria would make supply easy but then up pops this headline: \"Nigeria\u2019s Dangote buys Brazilian crude\".",
      "It follows a row over supply and pricing. The regulatory authority has complained about Mr Dangote\u2019s negotiating tactics.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s crude oil is low in sulphur and, as one of the most prized in the world, fetches a higher price than many of its competitors.",
      "When discussions over price began, Farouk Ahmed, the chief executive of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), accused Mr Dangote of \"wanting a Lamborghini for the price of a Toyota\".",
      "Mr Dangote has complained of not being allocated as much crude as earlier agreed but even when the price issue is resolved, he will still need to import some crude.",
      "\u201cNNPC doesn\u2019t have enough crude for Dangote. Despite all this instruction to give ample supply of crude to the refinery, NNPC can\u2019t supply Dangote with more than 300,000 barrels per day,\" says Mr Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "He says this is partly because the NNPC has pre-sold millions of barrels of oil for loans.",
      "In August 2023 it secured a $3bn loan from the Afreximbank financial institution. In return it is due to supply 164 million barrels of crude.",
      "In September the NNPC admitted it was significantly in debt. It was reported to be owing its suppliers around $6bn for fuel brought into the country.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s oil production has plummeted in recent years from around 2.1 million barrels per day in 2018 to around 1.3 million barrels per day in 2023.",
      "The NNPC has been stressing oil theft as the number one reason why production has dropped.",
      "It says in just one week - from 28 September to 4 October - there were 161 incidents of oil theft across the Niger Delta and 45 illegal refineries were \"discovered\".",
      "But Ms Anku believes that \"the theft problem is overrated by the NNPC and the oil sector\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a convenient excuse,\u201d she adds.",
      "She points to other contributing factors causing the drop in production, including international oil companies selling their on-shore oil fields - some of which may no longer be viable having pumped oil for 60 years.",
      "The 66-year-old Dangote, who is listed by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as the second wealthiest person in Africa, made his fortune in cement and sugar.",
      "He has always denied the suggestion that his empire benefitted from links to politicians in power who helped ensure he had a monopoly.",
      "Today there are those who are critical of Mr Dangote\u2019s tactics and amid tension with the regulatory authorities, the same accusation has resurfaced when it comes to the supply of fuel in Nigeria.",
      "\"Mr Dangote asked me to stop issuing licences for importation and that everyone should buy from him. To which I said 'No' because it\u2019s not good for the market. We have energy security interests,\" says Mr Ahmed of the regulatory authority.",
      "Mr Dangote has not commented on the accusation but has said it makes business sense for the traders to buy from his refinery rather than from outside.",
      "A feud between the regulator and Mr Dangote over supplies and pricing has rumbled on and morphed into another row with local fuel traders refusing to buy from the new refinery.",
      "The mud slinging has also included allegations that some traders have been buying up substandard fuel from Russia which is then blended with other products before being shipped into Nigeria.",
      "But not everyone is worried or surprised by the disagreements.",
      "Ms Anku points to lessons learnt from US businessmen back in the 19th Century.",
      "\"The JP Morgans and the Stanfords \u2013 they didn\u2019t have it easy either. That\u2019s why they had to go and get government support and subsidies to build their railways and so on.",
      "\"I see the drama as a very normal process as you\u2019re changing the structure of the economy. There are losers, they lash out. There\u2019s no chance they\u2019ll stop the refinery from working or selling its products to the Nigerian markets\u2026 in my view.\"",
      "The modern, local refinery has also led to a debate over the quality of fuel on the market. It is an important issue given the vast number of generators belching out fumes across Nigeria as a result of the woeful power supply.",
      "\"Every day I wake up to the smell of what I\u2019m sure [could] kill me. It\u2019s because of the quality of the diesel,\" says Mr Akinosho.",
      "He sees Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery as a real opportunity for higher quality petroleum products in Nigeria which would be better for both car engines and people\u2019s lungs.",
      "But right now, Nigerians being hit hard in the pocket may find it difficult to be optimistic.",
      "Arguments between officials at the Dangote refinery, the oil marketers and the regulators are batted back and forth in the media. All sides have been accused of hiding some facts and figures which leaves people guessing what is going on inside this still somewhat opaque industry.",
      "\"Everyone is a villain. There are no heroes here,\" concludes Mr Akinosho.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:13:49 GMT",
    "summary": "Indians are being stripped of their life savings by savvy scammers putting them under \"digital arrest\".",
    "story": [
      "For a harrowing week in August, Ruchika Tandon, a 44-year-old neurologist at one of India\u2019s top hospitals, was ensnared in what felt like a high-stakes federal crime investigation.",
      "Yet, it was an elaborate scam - a web of deceit spun by scammers who manipulated her every move and drained her and her family\u2019s life savings.",
      "Under the pretence of \u201cdigital arrest\u201d- a term fabricated by her perpetrators - Dr Tandon was coerced to take leave from work, surrender her daily freedoms, and comply with nonstop surveillance and instructions from strangers on the phone, who convinced her she was at the centre of a grave investigation.",
      "The \u201cdigital arrest\u201d scam involves fraudsters impersonating law enforcement officials on video calls, threatening victims with arrest over fake charges, and pressuring them to transfer large sums of money.",
      "In Dr Tandon's case, they stripped her and her family of nearly 25m rupees ($300,000; \u00a3235,000) across bank accounts, mutual funds, pension funds, and life insurance  - years of savings lost in a manufactured nightmare.",
      "She is not alone. Indians lost over 1,200m rupees to \u201cdigital arrest\u201d hoaxes between January and April this year, according to official figures. These figures only scratch the surface, as many victims don\u2019t report such crimes. Stolen funds are often funnelled into overseas accounts or cryptocurrency wallets. More than 40% of the scams have been traced back to Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, according to officials.",
      "Things are so bad that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about the scam in his monthly radio talk in October.",
      "\"Whenever you receive such a call, don\u2019t be scared. You should be aware that no investigative agency ever inquires like this through a phone call or a video call,\" he said.",
      "India faces a range of cyber crimes, from fake investment and trading to dating scams. But the \u201cdigital arrest\u201d scam stands out as especially elaborate and sinister - meticulously planned, relentless, and invasive to every part of a victim's life.",
      "Sometimes scammers reveal themselves during video calls, while other times they remain hidden, relying solely on audio. The plot could be straight out of an outlandish Bollywood thriller - except it is carefully choreographed.",
      "On that fateful first day, scammers posing as officials from India\u2019s telecom regulator called Lucknow-based Dr Tandon, claiming her number would be disconnected due to \u201c22 complaints\u201d of harassing messages sent from it.",
      "Moments later, a man claiming to be a senior police officer took over. He accused her of using a joint bank account with her mother to launder money for women and child trafficking.",
      "In the background, a jarring chorus of voices echoed, \u201cArrest her, arrest her!\u201d",
      "\u201cThe police will be coming in five minutes to arrest you. All police stations have been alerted,\u201d the man warned.",
      "\u201cI was angry and frustrated. I kept saying this can\u2019t be true,\u201d Dr Tandon recalls.",
      "The officer seemed to soften, but with a catch. He said India\u2019s federal detective agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), would take over as it was a \u201cmatter of national secrecy\".",
      "\u201cI will try to talk and persuade them not to put you in physical custody. But you have to be in digital custody,\u201d he insisted.",
      "Dr Tandon used a feature phone that lacked video calling, making it impossible for the scammers to proceed. So they forced her to drive to a store and buy a smartphone.",
      "Over the next six days, three men and a woman, posing as police officers and a judge, kept her under constant surveillance on Skype, with her phone camera running nonstop.",
      "They made her wake up her students at night to buy extra data packs to keep the scam going. She was required to place the phone throughout the house - while cooking, sleeping, and even outside the bathroom - tracking her every move.",
      "She was also forced to lie to her hospital and relatives, claiming she was too ill to work or meet anyone. When an uncle visited, they ordered her to hide under a bed, with the phone camera running.",
      "For a full week, Dr Tandon endured more 700 questions on her life and work, a staged trial, falsified court documents, and promises of a digital \u201cbail\u201d in exchange for her life savings. In the fake court she was ordered to dress in white to \u201cshow respect to the judge\". The callers had switched off their video, leaving only their fake names and authentic-looking badges displayed on blank screens.",
      "At one point, during the ordeal, the scammers even talked to Dr Tandon\u2019s 70-year-old mother, urging her to stay silent \"for her daughter\u2019s sake\".",
      "When the doctor repeatedly broke down on camera, the scammers told her: \u201cTake a deep breath and relax. You have not committed a murder. You have just laundered money.\"",
      "In a desperate bid for freedom, she transferred her entire savings from half-a-dozen different bank accounts to accounts controlled by the scammers, believing she would be refunded after \u201cgovernment verification\". Instead, she lost everything. The callers disconnected the line after transfer was completed.",
      "Back at work after a week, exhaustion drove Dr Tandon to search terms like \u201cdigital custody\u201d and \u201cnew CBI investigation methods\u201d on the internet.",
      "This led to newspaper stories detailing similar \u201cdigital arrest\u201d scams across the country. She still had refused to accept she was a victim of an elaborate hoax, and had rushed to the police station, hoping that \u201cthe police station and officers were real\u201d.",
      "Dr Tandon says she approached the police station, anxious.",
      "\"I've been receiving strange calls for days,\" she started, trying to explain.",
      "Before she could say more, a woman officer interrupted sharply, \"Have you transferred any money?\"",
      "At another police station, \"the moment they heard my case, they began laughing\", Dr Tandon recalls.",
      "\"This is very common now,\u201d a policeman said.",
      "Over 500km (310 miles) away in Delhi, author and journalist Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay narrowly escaped the scam in July.",
      "He endured 28 hours under \"digital arrest,\" as scammers claimed that his defunct bank account had been used to launder money. Mr Mukhopadhyay\u2019s suspicions aroused when a caller asked him why he hadn't redeemed his mutual funds - not a question a police officer would usually ask on the phone.",
      "Mr Mukhopadhyay slipped from his study, where scammers were surveilling him on his desktop, and confided briefly with his wife. Friends, alerted by his message, quickly asked her to disconnect his modem, freeing him from their grip.",
      "\"I became a digital slave until my friends exposed the scam,\" says Mr Mukhopadhyay. \"I had moved my funds into my account, ready to transfer it all to them. I felt like a fool when it was over.\u201d",
      "Progress on catching these scammers remains unclear, with many victims frustrated by slow moving complaint processes.",
      "Dr Tandon, however, has seen some success: police have arrested 18 suspects, including a woman, from across India. About a third of the stolen money has been recovered in cash and seized in different bank accounts.  She has received only 1.2m of the 25m rupees of her looted money so far \u2013 that was the cash recovered.",
      "Investigating officer Deepak Kumar Singh says the scammers were running an elaborate operation.",
      "\"The scammers are educated men and women - fluent in English and various Indian languages - including engineering graduates, cyber security experts, and banking professionals. Most operate through Telegram channels,\" Mr Singh, a senior police official, told the BBC.",
      "The scammers were clever, using targeted information from their victims' social media, investigators believe.",
      "\"They track you, gather personal information, and identify your weaknesses,\" says Mr Singh. \"Then they strike quickly, using a hit-and-run approach with potential victims.\"",
      "The scammers knew Mr Mukhopadhyay was a journalist and writer - author of a biography on Prime Minister Modi. They knew Dr Tandon was a doctor and had attended a conference in Goa. They had their biometric national identity numbers. Mr Mukhopadhyay wonders if they were aware he was among the journalists whose house was raided by Delhi police in October 2023 as part of an investigation into the funding of NewsClick (Critics had deplored the move as an attack on press freedom, a charge the government denied.)",
      "They also made errors. Mr Mukhopadhyay\u2019s caller was unaware of how long it typically took to redeem funds, which raised his suspicions. Dr Tandon\u2019s fake judge, called himself Judge Dhananjay and displayed a fake insignia with a picture of the recently retired Chief Justice Dhananjay Chandrachud. Yet, overwhelmed by the moment, she missed the clue.",
      "Dr Tandon says she still lives in a haze, struggling to separate reality from the nightmare that overtook her life. Even when she filed the police complaint, she wondered, \u201cWas the police station also fake?\u201d",
      "Every phone call stirs fresh anxiety.",

      "\u201cBy the time I came home, people were taking what they could out of their home,\u201d Komal says. She grabbed books, laundry, anything she could carry, but remembers thinking that with their house so far above the water there was no way it could be affected.",
      "That was until they received a phone call from the other side of the valley; their neighbours could see that the water was stripping away the hillside their home stood on.",

      "\u201cThis used to be all a green place,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I visit this place I remember my childhood memories, the time I spent here. But the barren places, they hurt me, they make me feel sad.\u201d",

    "title": "Why it is so difficult to walk in Indian cities",
    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 01:09:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Citizen activists are taking unusual steps to push authorities for better pedestrian infrastructure.",
    "story": [
      "In India, if you ask a pedestrian how many obstacles they've encountered on a footpath, they may not be able to count them - but they'll certainly tell you that most footpaths are in poor condition.",
      "This is what Arun Pai says he learnt when he started asking people about their experience walking on the streets of his city, Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), in southern India.",
      "This month he set up a \"fun challenge\" - called the 'world's longest footpath run' - which invited people to walk or jog on an 11km (8 miles) stretch of footpath and make a note of all the obstacles they encountered, like hawkers, garbage or broken slabs of concrete. Next, they were asked to rate the footpath on a scale of one to five.",
      "\"When you have specifics, it gets easier to ask the authorities to take action. Instead of telling your local politician \"the footpaths are bad\", you can ask him or her \"to fix specific spots on a street,\" Mr Pai says.",
      "Mr Pai, who is the founder of Bangalore Walks, a non-profit that promotes walking, is among several citizen activists who are pushing to make the country's roads more pedestrian-friendly.",
      "In India's capital, a tour company called Delhi by Cycle has been advocating for making the city more cycle-friendly and walkable. These walking-enthusiasts are holding awareness walks, building walking apps and lobbying with politicians to make a change.",
      "Even in India's biggest cities, proper footpaths are few and far between and they are often overrun by hawkers and shops, parked vehicles and even cattle. In some places, they double up as homes for the poor.",
      "Even footpaths that exist are often not built to standard or properly maintained. Navigating roads on foot through crowds and traffic can be a nightmare.",
      "Last month, Walking Project, a citizen's group in India's financial capital, Mumbai, released a 'pedestrian manifesto' ahead of Maharashtra state elections to highlight the poor condition of the city's roads and encourage local politicians to take action.",
      "The manifesto included demands for better parking, designated hawking zones, pedestrian-friendly corridors on arterial roads and to make footpaths more accessible to those with mobility challenges.",
      "\"Government statistics show that almost 50% of the city's population relies on walking, which is far greater than the 11% that uses private transport and the combined 15% that uses tuk-tuks and buses,\" says Vendant Mhatre, convener of Walking Project.",
      "\"And yet, pedestrians are the most ignored group of users when it comes to framing policies around transport or road safety,\" he adds.",
      "According to the latest government estimates on road accidents, pedestrian fatalities were the second-highest after those of two-wheeler riders. In 2022, over 10,000 pedestrians lost their lives on national highways across the country, with around 21,000 more sustaining injuries in accidents.",
      "\"Authorities often resort to band-aid solutions like adding speed bumps or a signal to curb road accidents. But what is really needed is inter-connected footpaths that can accommodate high footfall,\" Mr Mhatre says.",
      "Studies have found that addressing the problems of this forgotten group of road users can reap benefits for multiple stakeholders.",
      "In 2019, researchers in the southern city of Chennai studied the impact the construction of new footpaths on 100km (62 miles) of the city's streets had on the environment, economy and the health and safety of citizens.",
      "They found that the new footpaths encouraged 9% to 27% of the surveyed respondents to walk instead of using motorized transport, which led to a reduction in greenhouse gases and particulate matter. They also learned that the footpaths provided new opportunities for women and lower-income groups, helping them save money as well.",
      "The survey highlighted how people with disabilities and women might have nuanced requirements from footpaths and that tailoring improvements to meet their needs could enhance accessibility and equity.",
      "\"Very often, people don't have a benchmark for footpath quality, especially if they haven't travelled abroad or been exposed to places that have good facilities for pedestrians,\" Mr Mhatre says. He reasons that that's why there isn't enough outrage about the quality or absence of footpaths in the country.",
      "He also points out that most people see walking as an activity performed for leisure or exercise. And so, the infrastructure they associate with walking stops at gardens or walking tracks. In reality, however, people walk to various destinations daily, so the scope of walking infrastructure is far broader.",
      "\"Walking is the most economical and environment-friendly way to navigate one's city and it's high time our leaders paid as much attention to walking infrastructure as they do to public transport,\" Mr Mhatre says.",
      "Geetam Tiwari, a professor of civil engineering, says that the main problem is that too much focus is given to solving the problem of car congestion on roads.",
      "\"To improve the flow of traffic, authorities often narrow down footpaths or eliminate them entirely,\" she says. Ms Tiwari says that this approach is problematic because doing so makes it difficult for pedestrians to access public transport systems, like buses and metros, which can take the pressure off the roads.",
      "\"It might seem counter-intuitive, but allowing the congestion to persist and focussing on improving infrastructure for pedestrians will help solve the traffic problem in the long run,\" she says.",
      "Ms Tiwari also says that the federal government should make it mandatory for states to implement the guidelines issued by the Indian Road Congress -  a national organisation that lays down designing standards for roads and highways.",
      "She says that cities can also implement their own Non-Motorised Transport Policy (NMTP) to create better infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians.",
      "\"At the moment, only a handful of cities in India have experimented with a NMTP but its time more cities step up to the plate,\" she adds.",

      "It was in April 2024 that the Granny Series really took off - after Ms Kaumba posted a series of photos of her grandmother in a red Adidas dress, several chunky, golden necklaces and a glittering jewelled crown.",
      "\"It surprised me to hear that so many people around the world love me,\" Ms Chola says - who does not know her exact age because she does not have a birth certificate.",

      "\"I had never worn jeans or a wig before - so I was happy, and I was dancing.\"",
      "Ms Kaumba, who has been a stylist since 2012, says that her grandma has \"courage, grace - and nails every look\".",
      "All the looks reflect her maximalist-chic aesthetic - which celebrates the joy of excess, eclectic combinations, the big and the bold, and clashing patterns and colours.",
      "At the heart of it all are eye-catching accessories - bold sunglasses, oversized hats, necklaces, bracelets, pendants, rings, gloves, bags, blonde wigs, crowns.",
      "That influence has come directly from her grandmother, who has \"always been a lover of pearls and bangles\".",
      "In one particularly playful scene called GOAT - short for greatest of all time - Ms Chola appears with a goat - that is decked out in Mbuya\u2019s beloved pearls.",
      "Other accessories also reflect Chola\u2019s personality and story.",
      "In some shots Mbuya is holding the beloved radio that she carries around all day and takes to bed with her.",

      "She is smoking a pipe or holding a metal cup full of tea, and hanging off the edge of the chair arm is an \"mbaula\" or charcoal brazier that Zambians often use for cooking - especially now that the country is plagued by severe power cuts.",
      "Ms Kaumba hopes that the Granny Series will highlight that older people still have a lot to offer - and making memories together is an important way to \"leave footprints for the next generation\".",

      "She urges people to \"always forgive yourself for whatever mistakes you made. You can never change your past - but you can change your future\".",
      "The photo shoots have brought granddaughter and grandmother closer - and through their special bond Ms Kaumba has learnt so much more about her Mbuya\u2019s often difficult life.",
      "Ms Chola was raised by her grandparents, went to school until she was 12 or 13 and then, because of economic reasons, was forced to marry a man in his 30s.",

    "summary": "Mike Tyson, a boxing legend, and Jake Paul, a social media legend, threw down Friday in Dallas. Financially, they both came out winners.",
    "story": [
      "Jake Paul, a former child star and social media influencer who started boxing professionally in 2020, slugged it out with former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson on Friday in a matchup that was livestreamed worldwide on Netflix. Paul won the fight by unanimous decision.",
      "Here's what we know about how much Paul and Tyson were being paid, along with other financial aspects of an event that many consider more spectacle than sport.",
      "How much is Mike Tyson getting paid for the fight?",
      "Regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, 58-year-old Mike Tyson has an estimated net worth of $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That is a modest sum compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars \"Iron Mike,\" as he is known, accumulated in career earnings, including $400 million in fight purses, according\u00a0to\u00a0Forbes. Over the last decade, Tyson has also fought his way back after filing for bankruptcy in 2003.",
      "Though promotors did not reveal exactly how much Tyson earned for Friday's fight, reports from online sources,\u00a0including DraftKings Network, estimate he'll make around $20 million.",
      "Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson: Everything you need to know\u00a0Mike Tyson says he's \"scared to death\" of upcoming Jake Paul fightJake Paul, 27, to fight 57-year-old Mike Tyson live on Netflix: \"Time to put Iron Mike to sleep\"",
      "Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson: Everything you need to know",
      "Mike Tyson says he's \"scared to death\" of upcoming Jake Paul fight",
      "Jake Paul, 27, to fight 57-year-old Mike Tyson live on Netflix: \"Time to put Iron Mike to sleep\"",
      "That's about the same dollar amount Tyson earned in his match against Michael Spinks in 1988, a record purse at the time (worth roughly $53 million today adjusting for inflation). That bout lasted less than two minutes, with Tyson knocking out the previously undefeated Spinks in 91 seconds.",
      "In 1992, Tyson was sent to prison for six years after being convicted of raping a teenage beauty-pageant contestant. He was released on parole after three and a half years, returning to boxing in 1995 in a match against Peter McNeely, who was dispatched by a technical knockout in under 90 seconds.",
      "Tyson would go on to earn $30 million for each of his next four matches, which included an infamous 1997 fight against Evander Holyfield in which Tyson bit off a piece of his opponent's right ear. Tyson was disqualified from the fight, had his boxing license revoked and fined $3 million, but was allowed to keep the purse.",
      "At a news conference on Wednesday, Paul wore a diamond-spiked ear cover, a pointed reference to the incident. But when it comes to making light of the ear biting, Tyson has beat Paul to the punch, having launched ear-shaped marijuana edibles\u00a0(with Holyfield's consent) through his company, Tyson 2.0, a premium cannabis brand he launched in 2021. The brand generated an estimated $150 million in revenue in 2023, according to Forbes Australia.",
      "How much is Jake Paul getting paid for the fight?",
      "Jake Paul, 27, is set to earn $40 million, according to an estimate from DraftKings Network and other sources \u2014 double what Tyson is expected to receive for the fight. A simple explanation for that may be that Paul, a top social influencer with 27 million followers on Instagram alone, is also co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), the company promoting the extravaganza in partnership with Netflix. His net worth is estimated at $80 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.",
      "With a 10-1 fight record, mostly against\u00a0mixed martial artists and other pro-boxing newcomers under his belt, Paul, a former child star and YouTube prankster who began his boxing career in 2018, does not lack confidence \u2014 or showmanship. His cocky attitude earned him his latest nickname \"El Gallo de Dorado\" or the Golden Rooster, coined by fans in Puerto Rico. Before that, he was called \"The Problem Child,\" a fairly self-explanatory moniker based on the online persona he's crafted for himself over the years.",
      "Paul, who went full Gallo at an open training session this week with Tyson at the Toyota Music Factory in Irving, Texas, donning a rooster hat and red-feathered skirt over his boxing trunks, epitomizes social media's melding of Barnumesque entertainment and sports.",
      "In a TikTok video posted Tuesday, a shirtless Paul, slumped on a couch wearing a prosthetic belly to make himself look out of shape, places stacks of money on his protruding stomach while offering \"Mikey, Mikey\" an additional $5 million if the former champion can last more than four rounds with him in the ring. If he doesn't, says Paul in the video, the aging boxer will have to get a tattoo that says \"I love Jake Paul.\"",
      "\"This is why modern boxing is a joke,\"commented one user on Reddit in reaction to the video. \"People get more excited about freak show fights than actual boxing matches.\"",
      "As\u00a0reported by USA Today, \"Tyson and his camp have not publicly responded to the offer.\"",
      "How much is the purse for the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight?",

      "Originally set to take place on July 20, the event was later postponed and rescheduled for November 15 after\u00a0Tyson suffered an ulcer flare-up on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles in May.",
      "As of early Friday evening, gate receipts at AT&T Stadium brought in $17.8 million in revenue, CNBC reported. Promotor MVP told the news outlet it expects more than 70,000 people fill the stadium, home to the Dallas Cowboys, which has a seating capacity of 80,000.",
      "Who do gamblers think will win the fight?",
      "Tyson enters the ring on Friday, nearly 20 years since his last professional fight, as a +160 underdog,\u00a0according\u00a0to the latest betting odds from DraftKings. That means a $100 wager on post-retirement Iron Mike will bring in a $160 profit if he wins. At -200, Paul is the favorite to win. Bettors will have to place a $200 wager to make a $100 profit, should the social influencer prevail over Tyson.",
      "\"There has been a lot of anticipation for this fight, and we have been pleased with the betting volume,\" Johnny Avello, director of sports operations at DraftKings, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect more action to come in the hours leading up to the fight.\"",
      "Although it remains to be seen how much will be wagered in total, the event is attracting some whale-sized bets of $500,000, according to ESPN.",
      "Gamblers are backing Tyson, according to DraftKings, with 69% of all bets currently on the former undisputed world champion to emerge victorious. \"While Tyson is 58-years old now, people see one of the greatest boxers of all time at a favorable price and jump at that opportunity,\" Avello said.",
      "\"While it won't match up to an event like the Super Bowl, it could certainly be our most bet boxing match of the year,\" he added.",
      "Not everyone will be able to place a bet the epic bout. Though the fight is sanctioned by Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, changes in the rules, including\u00a0shorter rounds and bigger gloves, disqualifies the fight from being bet on in at least seven U.S.\u00a0states.",
      "How to watch the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight",
      "For most fans, the best seats will be at home, with Tyson vs. Paul streaming worldwide on Netflix. A standard Netflix subscription plan with ads is $6.99 a month. The platform's broadcast starts at 8 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "As reported by CBS Sports, the fight marks Netflix's biggest bet to date on live sports. Netflix, which has 282 million subscribers in over 190 countries, has recently tested the waters by airing exhibition events in golf and tennis.",

      "It took too long for Cher to get into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. \"I thought, what do I have to do?\" she said. \"I've had number one records in all these decades. I had a song [\"Believe\"] that changed music forever. And so, what is it that I've gotta do?\"",
      "This year she finally made it. At her induction ceremony last month, she said, \"It was easier getting divorced from two men than it was to get into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame!\"",
      "It also took forever for Cher to write her story. This week, \"Cher: The Memoir \u2013 Part One\" finally comes out. Asked what she wanted to say with the book, she replied, \"In the beginning, I didn't wanna say much. And then at some point, I just thought, Cher, do it or give the money back.\"",
      "The book centers on her years with Sonny, and her itinerant childhood with a mother who married at least seven times. She writes of how she had to be a grownup from the beginning: \"One time we were driving in the car and she said, 'Cher, I don't know how we're gonna pay the rent. What do you think?' And I was like, 'Okay, how is this gonna work? How are we gonna do this?'\"",
      "In 1962, Cherilyn Sarkisian met Sonny Bono in a coffee shop. He was wearing a mohair suit and a mustard-colored shirt with a white collar. \"I thought it was like when Tony met Maria,\" she said. \"Everybody disappeared, and it was just the two of us.\"",
      "But she said it was not love at first sight. \"It was something,\" Cher said. \"I never felt it before.\"",
      "Sonny was 27, Cher was 16. \"It wasn't passionate; I just loved him,\" she said.",
      "What did she love about him? \"How he was different than anyone else. And he made me laugh. And we had a dream.\"",
      "That dream came true. By the mid-1960s, Sonny & Cher had five songs in the top 50 at the same time. They had a #1 hit with \"I Got You Babe.\"",
      "In the 1970s, on \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour,\" they'd become America's favorite couple, with their banter, their songs, and that Bob Mackie wardrobe: \"And then, when they started to realize that people were tuning in because of what I was wearing, then they just gave us all the money we needed,\" she said. \"It was so much fun.\"",
      "But Sonny began to change. \"He just started not to care,\" Cher said.",
      "About what? \"About me.\"",
      "He didn't like her going out, or even talking with their band. But one member had his eye on her: A guitarist by the name of Bill. One night Cher met up with him. \"We walked back to this place where the guys used to get high before the show. And then he kissed me, and it was like, Oh, my God.\"",
      "Somehow word got back to Sonny. \"I don't know if I can actually say what happened because it's so personal, and it's so \u2026 it's embarrassing,\" Cher said.",
      "But it's in the book: After Sonny asked her what she wanted to do, Cher writes: \"I said, 'I want to sleep with Bill.' It all seems crazy now. I didn't mean it, but I thought saying those words was the only way that he would let me go.\"",
      "\"I thought if I do this, it's over,\" she said. \"He's not gonna be able to come back. We're not gonna be able to be Sonny & Cher. I just wanna blow it up. But I didn't know I wanted to blow it up until I was blowing it up.\"",
      "They offered her anything to keep up appearances: \"Because everybody was afraid I was gonna blow up the show. They just said, 'What do you want?' And I said, 'Well, I want my own place in Malibu. And I want $5,000 a month. Hello? And I want freedom.'\"",
      "But Sonny & Cher kept up the fa\u00e7ade for two more years, until Cher's new boyfriend, record executive David Geffen, got a copy of her contract, and she learned the shocking truth: \"Sonny owned 95 percent of the company and his lawyer owned five,\" she said. \"And it was called Cher Enterprises, but I own nothing! And we'd worked together for almost 12 years.\"",
      "She confronted Sonny: \"I said, 'When was the moment that you thought this would be a good idea?' And he said, 'I always knew you'd leave me.' And I said, 'That's not a reason! Son, how could you do it? I was there by your side working, all those nights, all those days, through good, through bad.' He didn't have an answer.",
      "\"And we were still friends after that,\" she said.",
      "Even after Cher married Gregg Allman and was pregnant with their son, she rejoined Sonny for a revival of their TV show.",
      "Mason asked, \"Can you explain why it was that up on that stage all the other stuff seemed to go away?\"",
      "\"Because we had fun with each other,\" Cher replied. \"And because on stage, there was no marriage. There was no discord. There was no word for our relationship. And you couldn't cut it with a chainsaw.\"",

      "\"When you go back to bed in the evening, you're like, 'How is he doing this? How is he doing that?'\" he replied. \"Every scene I did with him was never how I expected it to go, which is the dream. It was very thrilling to be five feet in front of his face watching him do that.\"",
      "Mescal has star power of his own, as we saw when we witnessed a sea of people following us when we met at Trinity College, where, not so long ago, he'd studied acting.",
      "He's proving to be a singular actor, at least until a recent look-a-like contest. \"I feel like it's easy to do a parody of me,\" he laughed.",

      "\"Yeah yeah yeah.\"",
      "Those shorts are the uniform of his other love, Gaelic football. For \"Gladiator II,\" this athlete bulked-up, putting on 18 pounds of muscle.",
      "I asked, \"The role is so different. You're often playing these kind of softer, almost tormented, shy characters. It's a major transition for you.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is,\" he replied. \"I think going back to the sport that I played before, there was definitely a desire to make a more physically-informed choice with a character Lucius represented, like, the perfect opportunity for that to happen.\"",
      "\"Normal People,\" his big break, was shot at his alma mater. In it, Mescal portrays the sharp, nuanced emotions of a student: angst, torment, desire. \"I think it exposed an audience to me,\" Mescal said. \"That job essentially allowed me to prove to people that I can act.\"",
      "The series came after he made a commercial for an Irish sausage company: \"Yeah, that covered my rent for the year. I was absolutely delighted by it.\"",
      "He'd started acting at 16, and a high school production of \"Phantom of the Opera\" changed his trajectory. \"I think I'm still chasing that feeling again,\" he said. \"Nothing has ever really come close to that feeling.\"",
      "\"Your high school 'Phantom of the Opera' production vs. 'Gladiator II'?\" I asked.",
      "\"It sounds absolutely bizarre! I think because it felt physically dangerous in my body to be exposed to an audience of people who knew me as somebody who played sports. The adrenaline was, like, extraordinary.\"",
      "His childhood, he says, was pretty standard. His mother was a policewoman, his dad a teacher, both now retired. But he credits that upbringing with helping him navigate today's pressures.",
      "\"This is new for me,\" he said, of fame.",
      "\"But you're used to attention at this point?\"",
      "\"Uh, within reason.\"",
      "On campus, at times this star was as struck as the students.",
      "Mescal is hoping to maintain some distance, some mystery as an actor, to be able to convincingly inhabit such varied roles. \"You don't want an audience to know you innately,\" he said.",
      "And what is his relationship with fame? \"Ever-changing,\" he said.",
      "Perhaps that's because it's all changing so quickly for him. Instead of dispersing during our interview inside, the crowd, we soon discovered, had multiplied. And we got to witness Paul Mescal in a role for which there is no rehearsal, and no script.",
      "\"What the hell?\" he remarked to the assembled hordes. \"I don't know what to say other than, hello! This is f*****g bananas! I have to go finish an interview \u2026 you should all go back to school. See you later!\"",

      "Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson is set to take on YouTube sensation and current professional boxer Jake Paul in a highly anticipated heavyweight fight Friday night at the AT&T Stadium in Dallas. It will mark the first time Tyson (50-6, 44 KOs) has entered the ring for a pro bout since retiring from the sport in 2005.",
      "Paul (10-1, 7 KOs) will be fighting for the third time in 2024 in what is easily his highest-profile bout to date. The match-up between the 58-year-old Tyson and 27-year-old Paul was initially scheduled for July 20 but was rescheduled to give Tyson time to recover from medical issues stemming from a stomach ulcer.",
      "Here's what you need to know about tonight's big fight, including when and how to watch.",
      "What time is the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight tonight?",
      "The Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul televised fight card\u00a0began at 8 p.m. ET (5 p.m. PT) on Netflix. There were three professional boxing fights before Tyson and Paul were set to enter the ring. The main event will occur once those bouts have concluded with the exact timing dependent on the length of the preceding fights.",
      "How many rounds will the Tyson vs. Paul fight have?",
      "The Tyson-Paul fight is scheduled for eight, two-minute rounds. That's slightly shorter than the typical three-minute rounds most professional men's boxing fights are scheduled for. Both men will also wear heavier boxing gloves than heavyweights often do, sporting 14-ounce gloves versus the traditional 10-ounce versions.",
      "How to watch the Tyson vs. Paul fight",
      "The Tyson vs. Paul fight will be broadcast live on Netflix and will be free for subscribers.",
      "What is Mike Tyson's boxing background?",
      "Mike Tyson is one of the most famous \u2014 and infamous \u2014 boxers in sports history. A Hall of Fame inductee, Tyson burst onto the world stage in the 1980s when he became the youngest heavyweight champion in boxing history. Combining speed and power, Tyson possessed an uncanny ability to intimidate opponents before they even entered the ring. He won his first world title in 1986 and became the undisputed champion in the years that followed. He lost his belts to Buster Douglas in 1990 in one of the biggest upsets in sports history and was incarcerated on a rape conviction from 1992 to 1995.",
      "Tyson won the World Boxing Council (WBC) and World Boxing Association (WBA) titles upon his return to the ring in the mid-1990s but then lost to Evander Holyfield in a major upset in November 1996. A highly-anticipated rematch between the two in June 1997 led to Tyson getting disqualified after he bit off a chunk of Holyfield's ear.",
      "His subsequent performances in the ring after that were largely overshadowed by bizarre antics both during the fight and in between matches. He lost his final title fight against then-heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis in June 2002 and he retired following consecutive knockout losses to other opponents in 2004 and 2005. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. He last fought in an exhibition (non-professional) match against former champion Roy Jones Jr. in November 2020.",
      "What is Jake Paul's boxing background?",
      "Jake Paul was best known as a popular YouTuber and former Disney star before he decided to become a professional boxer in 2020. He fought his second professional fight on the undercard of Tyson's fight against Jones but has since promoted himself to main event status. Loquacious and promotable, Paul currently has 27 million followers on Instagram, 18.2 million followers on TikTok and 4.6 million on X.",
      "He's been able to morph that social media success into the boxing ring, entering tonight's fight with just a single loss against 10 wins, with seven of those victories via knockout. The lone loss came against undefeated Tommy Fury, the younger brother of former undisputed heavyweight champion Tyson Fury (who, ironically, was named after Paul's opponent tonight).",
      "Who do experts predict will win the Tyson vs. Paul fight?",
      "Expert predictions for tonight's match-up vary. Former opponents Lewis and Jones are both predicting a Tyson victory as is his namesake, Tyson Fury. Former boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya also likes Tyson but former heavyweight champ Anthony Joshua is going with Paul as is Paul's brother, Logan. Oddsmakers have had Paul as the slight favorite but the betting line has been moving more toward Tyson throughout fight week, according to ESPN.",

      "The new figures come from the CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program, which gathers data on pneumonia-associated emergency room visits from U.S. hospitals.",
      "While cases had been higher in school-age kids compared to other age groups, rates in babies have surged in recent weeks, and are now tied with older kids. According to the latest CDC data, for the week ending Nov. 2, 7.6% of emergency department pneumonia cases for babies 0-1 years old and children ages 5-17 years old resulted in Mycoplasma pneumoniae diagnoses.",
      "\"These diagnoses dropped a little after August, but remained high through early November. Of note, diagnoses among 0\u20131-year-olds have steadily increased throughout the fall without any subsequent decrease,\" CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed said in a statement Tuesday.",

      "But this year's trend has also been unusual, since cases had previously been thought to be common only in school-aged kids, not younger children.",
      "\"While we are seeing right now that it is presenting as a typical respiratory infection, we want to make sure that there isn't something unusual going on with the bacteria itself or the way it's showing up that might give guidance in how to treat and prevent it,\" Dr. Adam Cohen, head of the CDC's pneumonia branch, told Medscape News earlier this month.",
      "According to Reed, while every U.S. region is seeing an increase in Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases, the CDC's data suggests that since at least last month \u2014 when several states first began to raise concerns over the surge \u2014 the ERs of three regions specifically are seeing the highest levels of the bacteria.",

      "Nayak said that around a quarter of tests from the hospital's microbiology lab have come in positive for the bacteria, which she says is unusually high.",
      "The hospital has also seen an increase in patients needing to be hospitalized for the bacteria and who are battling a range of conditions \u2014 from lung issues to more complicated neurological complications \u2014 though they remain a fraction of overall cases.",
      "\"We've definitely seen more kids on the seriously ill side of the spectrum,\" Nayak said. \"Likely not because the bacteria has changed, but because our rates overall are just higher.\"",
      "She cautioned that while the recent increase has been unusual, there has not been a lot of data tracking the disease, so comparisons to previous waves of the bacteria have been challenging.",
      "\"Our tracking of Mycoplasma infections is suboptimal,\" Nayak said. \"This is not something that is reportable to health departments. It has not, until relatively recently, been closely tracked.\"",

      "The next morning, she received a scheduled email: \"Mom, if you're reading this, I'm probably on my way to heaven,\" it said. Her daughter had taken her own life at the age of 44.",
      "\"She did not want to die by suicide. She did not want to die alone,\" Turcott said.",
      "Instead, Meadows had been seeking a medically assisted death \u2014 something Canada legalized in 2016. It had been set to expand last year to patients who were suffering solely from mental illness, but that expansion was delayed, and Meadows ultimately died by suicide.",
      "The delay has been welcomed by some, but condemned by others.",
      "The history of Canada's, still evolving MAID law",
      "In 2016, Canada enacted a law allowing medical assistance in dying, known as MAID, for people whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Under the law, following a process establishing that all eligibility criteria have been met, a physician or nurse either directly administers a substance that induces death or prescribes a drug that the person takes themselves.",
      "Five years later, the law was expanded, no longer requiring a person's death to be reasonably foreseeable as an eligibility criterion for adults with a grievous and irremediable medical condition. Under the changes, individuals suffering solely from mental illness were temporarily excluded for eligibility until March 2023.",
      "Meadows, described by her mother as a proud trans woman, had picked a date and began preparations for the end of her life.",
      "\"It gave me time to accept the fact that my daughter was going to die,\" Turcott said.",
      "A few days before Meadows would potentially have been eligible to seek a medically assisted death, however, the government announced a yearlong delay for the consideration of cases of mental illness. Seven months later, Meadows died by suicide.",
      "The delayed inclusion of patients seeking MAID on the basis of mental illness has been met with apprehension from the start.",
      "Canada's Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness, established to assist in developing the government's approach to the expansion of the law, outlined concerns in a 2022 report, including the daunting task for clinicians asked to make predictions about individual patients and establish incurability and irreversibility despite the difficulties of predicting the evolution of mental disorders.",
      "Another factor was what the report referred to as structural vulnerability, or the risk of factors such as unstable housing or lack of employment opportunities resulting in individuals viewing death as an only option.",
      "The panel offered a number of recommendations in its report for establishing an expanded MAID regime.",
      "The future of the MAID law's expansion, however, is also dependent to some degree on domestic politics, which appear set to shift. Pierre Poilievre, whose Conservative Party is up by a significant margin in polls ahead of national elections set to take place within a year, has vowed to \"revoke entirely\" the expansion of the law to include solely mental health cases, arguing that it blurred a line \"between suicide prevention and suicide  assistance.\"",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to.\"",
      "Since her daughter's death, meanwhile, Turcott has become an advocate for MAID access for those whose sole underlying condition is mental illness.",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to, and because that's what she wanted, that would have been fine with me,\" Turcott said. \"Suicide was not fine with me.\"",
      "In February, the government further postponed MAID eligibility for patients whose sole condition is mental illness until March 2027 \u2014 four years after it was initially slated to go into effect.",
      "Mark Holland, Canada's Minister of Health, said that while \"significant progress has been made in supporting practitioners in assessing MAID eligibility in complex cases,\" the country's health system was \"not yet ready for MAID where the sole underlying condition is mental illness.\"",
      "The delay has been condemned by some MAID advocates. Dying With Dignity Canada, an organization that advocates for end-of-life rights, filed a lawsuit in August alleging discriminatory exclusion in the law against people with mental illness.",
      "An ongoing debate over access to MAID",
      "Others, however, view the delay as a step to ensure necessary safeguards are in place and health care providers are prepared to handle relevant cases. The Canada Mental Health Association said in a January statement that it supported the postponement, citing what it called insufficient time and resources allocated to ensure that people with mental illnesses can access the necessary care.",
      "Some groups oppose the law's expansion outright. In September, Inclusion Canada, a nonprofit group that advocates for Canadians with intellectual disabilities, filed a lawsuit challenging MAID for people with a disability who are not dying or whose death is not \"reasonably foreseeable.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues that MAID Track 2, the 2021 expansion of the law to include patients whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, had already resulted in premature deaths.",
      "\"People are dying. We are witnessing an alarming trend where people with disabilities are seeking assisted suicide due to social deprivation, poverty and lack of essential supports,\" Krista Carr, executive vice-president of Inclusion Canada, said in September.",
      "Compounding CMHA and Inclusion Canada's concerns, an expert committee of professionals from disciplines including ethics, social work and medicine that reviewed MAID deaths in Ontario identified cases in which it said isolation and unmet social needs, such as housing, had fueled several euthanasia recipient's requests.",
      "The committee also found that patients seeking eligibility under the expanded Track 2 criteria were about 8% more likely to reside in areas of the province with high levels of social marginalization than MAID Track 1 recipients.",
      "The committee's report acknowledged that while the deaths discussed were not necessarily representative of frequent reasons for accessing MAID Track 2, or even the majority of MAID Track 2 deaths, the themes identified were \"not uncommon within the MAID review process.\"",
      "Out of 4,644 medically assisted deaths carried out during 2023 under Canada's MAID law, only 116 deaths were Track 2 patients, according to the committee.",
      "But the report's findings don't resonate with everyone, and opposition to the law's proposed inclusion of patients who suffer from only mental illness has been deeply frustrating for some people seeking MAID.",
      "Jason, a Toronto resident who didn't want to be fully identified over concerns that his future MAID review process could be affected, is one of those people.",
      "\"When I first heard that it was delayed, my world came crashing down,\" he said.",
      "Jason told CBS News that he's struggled with depression, anxiety and panic attacks for decades, and has attempted suicide twice. He said he's tried inpatient programs, medication, electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine treatment, among other remedies, to little avail.",
      "\"I would not be alive today if there wasn't the possibility of MAID going through in 2027,\" he said, saying the chance of MAID's expansion was the only reason he hadn't attempted suicide a third time.",
      "The current safeguards for those seeking MAID whose death is not reasonably foreseeable include two independent practitioners \u2014 one of whom must have expertise in the condition affecting the patient \u2014 confirming that all eligibility criteria are met, a minimum period of 90 days for eligibility assessments to be made, and the opportunity for the patient to withdraw consent at any point up until the procedure is carried out.",
      "The patient must also be informed of counseling and palliative care options, support for disabilities and mental health, and be offered consultation with relevant professionals in addition to having discussed with their practitioner \"reasonable and available means to relieve the person's suffering, and agree [with the practitioner] that the person has seriously considered these means.\"",
      "In a poll conducted in 2023 by Dying with Dignity Canada, 78% of respondents said they supported the removal of the \"reasonably foreseeable\" natural death requirement from the MAID law, indicating strong support for the Track 2 expansion. But a 2017 survey gauging the attitudes of Canadian psychiatrists toward medical assistance in death found only a minority of 29.4% supported MAID on the basis of mental illness alone, compared to 71.8% who said other factors should also be present to determine eligibility.",
      "Jason said he understood some doctors' opposition to MAID for mental illness.",
      "\"Doctors are there to make you better,\" he said. But he added that as mental illness isn't something that \"shows up on a screen,\" it can be difficult for people without direct experience to understand the extent of someone else's pain.",
      "\"I don't have the physical pain that someone else has, but the psychological pain is just as bad,\" he said.",
      "In 2022, MAID deaths accounted for 4.1% of overall deaths in Canada, with the average age of MAID patients being 77, according to Canada's fourth and most recent annual report on Medical Assistance in Dying. Since the law was introduced in 2016 there have been a total of 44,958 medically assisted deaths in the country.",
      "Jason said he didn't want to put his family through the trauma of another suicide attempt, and that his brother and mother were helping him explore options abroad. Those options, especially for people suffering mental illness, are limited, and often complicated by varying domestic laws around the world.",
      "Jason said that, like Turcott, his own mother is supportive of his choice to seek MAID.",
      "\"As much as she doesn't want me to do this again, she would rather I die properly with the assistance of a doctor than have it done by suicide,\" he said.",
      "Turcott said she was concerned that the postponement of MAID on the basis of mental health would result in more suicides, leaving families to mourn unexpectedly.",
      "\"I don't want anybody to experience the loss of their child through suicide, and their child being so desperate that they saw no other choice but to take their life,\" she said.",

      "This is different from the B3.13 genotype that has been fueling this year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy and poultry farms and suggests the virus spilled over into the flock in Hawaii from migrating wild birds.",
      "Investigators have not turned up any links so far between the flock and imported animals or travel, a spokesperson for Hawaii's Agriculture Department said. The island has \"strict importing regulations for birds and other animals,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "All the infected birds were housed at the same site, though investigations are ongoing to root out other potential cases. The birds were also not symptomatic until several days after the fair, the state Health Department said, lowering the risk to humans.",
      "\"As the birds were not showing signs of infection at the time of the fair, the likelihood of spreading H5N1 to humans is low. However, out of an abundance of caution, DOH recommends that individuals who attended the fair and touched a duck or goose monitor for influenza-like illness (ILI) and conjunctivitis,\" the state said in a release.",
      "A quarantine order was issued for the property where the birds lived and all will be required to be \"depopulated and the premises cleaned and disinfected,\" the state Agriculture Department said. An order was also issued to prevent any animals from being moved in or out of the site.",
      "At least 10 birds, which included ducks, a goose and a zebra dove, had been reported dead at the property on Nov. 12. Samples from the dead birds were sent to be tested for the virus.",

      "At least 53 cases have been confirmed across seven states so far this year, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0says. Most are linked to the B3.13 version of the virus that has been infecting workers at dairy farms and nearby poultry farms in recent months. None of them are known to have been severely ill.",

      "Shares in Dentsply Sirona, Envista, Henry Schein Patterson Companies, and other providers of dental products are jumping, with Wall Street betting that a potential push by the incoming Trump administration to remove fluoride from the nation's drinking water could spur demand for the companies' services.",
      "Kennedy, tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said on social media just ahead of the November 5 presidential election that Trump would rid fluoride from the public water supply on his first day in office. Kennedy, a noted vaccine skeptic, has described fluoride as an \"industrial waste\" and linked it to arthritis, neurological deficiencies in children and other serious health problems.",

      "Dental experts have largely refuted such claims. Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0on November 13 that there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years showing that fluoride is both safe, and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",

      "Canada's Bestar has agreed to a more than $16 million civil penalty for failing to report\u00a0a defect in its wall beds until after one person was killed and more than a dozen others injured, some seriously, federal officials say.",
      "Starting in September of 2014 and continuing through 2022, Bestar received numbers of reports that the products had detached from the wall. By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The furniture company then engaged with CPSC and Health Canada, but did not tell regulators of an additional five incidents it had become aware of by that time, the document said. In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",
      "Bestar did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",

    "summary": "There is currently no cure for Parkinson's Disease. But some with Parkinson's are finding that an unusual therapy \u2013 rock climbing \u2013 is helping them improve their balance, mobility, strength and cognition.",
    "story": [
      "We were amazed at what we were seeing on a sweltering summer's day, when a group of people with Parkinson's Disease began rock-climbing on the Carderock Cliffs of Maryland. Yes, rock-climbing!",
      "It's all part of their therapy, says Molly Cupka, the no-nonsense instructor and cheerleader for this community of courageous climbers.",
      "She started this program, called UpENDing Parkinsons, as a non-profit twelve years ago.",
      "\"There's a lot of balance involved, mobility involved, strength, cardio, and then there's the cognitive part, where you have to look at the hold, and figure out how to get your body to move to get to that hold,\" she said.",
      "How often do they fall? \"Falling is definitely part of climbing,\" said Cupka. But they never really fall, because they wear a harness that provides a layer of safety. \"You're always on the rope. You fall, but you don't fall far. We always say if you're not falling, you're not trying hard enough!\"",
      "There's no cure for Parkinson's, which usually affects mobility, coordination, balance, and even speech. Jon Lessin was diagnosed in 2003. He was once an all-around athlete. About 12 years ago he retired as a cardiac anesthesiologist because of Parkinson's. His daughter, Brittany, watched his steady decline, until he discovered climbing walls as high as 60 feet!",
      "\"My dad has a hard time walking across the room, but he can make it to the top of this giant wall,\" Brittany said. \"There's a lot that he's had to give up because of his disease. But this is something that he found through it, which is really cool.\"",
      "Jon said, \"I get to the top and I feel like I've conquered something. And I feel like the wall can't beat me. I can beat the wall.\"",
      "Full disclosure: This story is very personal to me. My late husband, Aaron Latham, had Parkinson's, and boxed as a way to fight the symptoms, as he explained on \"Sunday Morning\" in 2015. \"Boxing's just the opposite of Parkinson's,\" said Latham. \"Everything's designed, instead of to shrink you, everything's designed to pump you up.\"",
      "Jon Lessin said Parkinson's \"makes you feel very small. You make small movements, you're hunched over. And [rock climbing] makes you feel like you can accomplish the world.\"",
      "It was Lessin who first had that big idea to use rock climbing as a therapy for Parkinson's. \"I wanted to do big-movement exercise,\" he said. \"And I found Molly at this gym.\"",
      "Lessin proposed the idea to Molly Cupka, who runs the Sportrock Climbing Center in Alexandria, Virginia. She thought it was worth a try, given the sport requires participants to plan ahead, to know where to position their hands and feet. \"I wish I could go into the brain and see what's happening while people climb,\" Cupka said.",
      "Some people with Parkinson's, like Vivek Puri, get dyskinesia (involuntary jerking motions). Puri said he's usually unaware of his. He runs a home building company in the D.C. area, and was only 38 when he found out he had Parkinson's. \"Fine motor skills have kind of really suffered dramatically,\" he said. \"When I don't climb for some periods of time, I get worse.\"",
      "But once he gets on the wall, he calls himself Spider-Man.",
      "\"Honestly, I climb like a monkey,\" he said. \"I get my finger strength moving, which gets my fine motor skills \u2013 maybe not back, but kind of keeps that in motion.\"",
      "There's no evidence climbing slows the progress of Parkinson's, but Cupka joined forces with Marymount University last year to study patients climbing for the first time. \"We have people literally walking and carrying weights, you know, walking and looking, multitasking,\" she said.",
      "The study found that, in so many words, if you climb, you may walk better.",

I'm doing this!' It just makes me feel stronger, and I'm fighting it. I'm doing something about it.\"",
      "Many of the climbers have become friends who climb together several times a week; and they've become a support group, Parkinson's Pals, who encourage each other.",
      "\"When I reach the top, I can turn around and look and wave, and see my wife and my friends, and that's the reward,\" said de Mulder. \"It's really wonderful.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:45:31 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\"We are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\" she said.",

Medical King of Brooklyn, New York, is recalling about 220,000 adult portable bed rails due to entrapment and asphyxia risks. The recall follows the death of a 66-year-old man who became trapped between a mattress and a bed rail in November at a residential care facility in South Carolina.",
      "The recall involves three models of Medical King Bed Assist Rail with Adjustable Heights (model numbers 7007 and 7057) and the Bed Assist Rail Without Legs (model number 7037). The recalled rails sold online for about $40 on Amazon.com, eBay, Kohls.com, medicalkingusa.com and Target Plus from January 2020 through March 2024.",
      "People who purchased the products, which are made in China, should stop using them and contact Medical King for a repair kit or replacement bed rail, depending on the model.",

      "The recall is the ninth issued by the CPSC in the last three years. The recalls and two product warnings impacted more than 3 million units and are associated with serious injuries from head, neck or chest entrapment and 18 deaths, the federal agency stated.",
      "CPSC data shows that 92% of fatalities associated with adult portable bed rails are from entrapment, usually of the head or neck.",
      "The agency issued new mandatory safety standards for adult portable bed rails in January 2023.",
      "Often purchased for sick or frail older people, the side rails or metal bars are used on hospital beds and in home care with the idea of helping patients pull themselves up or to keep them from falling out of bed.

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 10:11:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",
      "Making the enhanced subsidies permanent would cost $335 billion over 10 years,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CBO.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 18:09:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

    "story": [
      "H&R Block and Intuit shares dropped on Tuesday after the Washington Post reported that President-elect Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, which is run by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is looking at developing a free app for people to file their taxes.",
      "The publication cited two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, in reporting that the leaders of the incoming administration's DOGE discussed the idea of crafting a mobile app to file income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "H&R Block shares tumbled 8.2%, while Intuit shed 5.1% on Tuesday. As the dominant players in tax preparation, H&R Block and Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, generate billions in revenue annually by offering online and in-person services.",
      "The Biden Administration in March rolled out a pilot Direct File program through the IRS in 12 states. It allows qualified taxpayers file directly through a federal portal. Additionally, the IRS provides services through its Free File program for those who made an adjusted gross income of $79,000 or less.",
      "More than 100,000 taxpayers used the new Direct File program to file their taxes this year, which marked the first time the system was in operation, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "The DOGE, which has been directed by Trump to slash government spending and cut federal regulations, criticized the complexity of the U.S tax code in a Nov. 16 post on X, the social media service owned by Musk.",
      "\"In 1955, there were less than 1.5 million words in the U.S. Tax Code.   Today, there are more than 16 million words,\" its X account wrote. \"Because of this complexity, Americans collectively spend 6.5 billion hours preparing and filing their taxes each year.\"",
      "Intuit and H&R Block also have free filing options.",
      "That said, the Federal Trade Commission earlier in the year barred Intuit from advertising its popular TurboTax product as free when most people have to pay to use it. The FTC in February filed an administrative complaint against H&R Block, alleging it marketed its tax-prep products as free yet deleted the data as a way to pressure them to pay for pricier services. Both companies said they'd appeal.",

    "story": [
      "Tom's of Maine toothpaste was manufactured with water containing bacteria, while a \"black mold-like substance\" was found in a factory where the product was made, according to a warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
      "The November 5 letter stated that Tom's Simply White Clean Mint toothpaste contained Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a germ that can cause infections in the blood and lungs, the FDA letter said.",
      "The FDA letter also flagged another bacteria, Ralstonia insidiosa, which was found in water sources at the factory and\u00a0has been linked to infections acquired in hospital settings. Another Tom's of Maine product, Wicked Cool! Anticavity Toothpaste, was found to include another type of bacteria, Paracoccus yeei, the letter stated. The latter has been linked to infections such as peritonitis and conjunctivitis.",
      "Tom's of Maine, which markets its products as made with \"safe and hardworking natural ingredients,\" manufactures a host of personal hygiene products, from toothpaste to deodorant. The company was bought by Colgate-Palmolive in 2006.",
      "In a statement emailed to CBS News, Tom's of Maine said that the company is working with the FDA to remedy the issues found during the agency's May inspection of its Sanford, Maine-based manufacturing plant.",
      "\"We have always tested finished goods before they leave our control, and we remain fully confident in the safety and quality of the toothpaste we make,\" Tom's of Maine said in the statement. \"In addition, we have engaged water specialists to evaluate our systems at Sanford, have implemented additional safeguards to ensure compliance with FDA standards, and our water testing shows no issues.\"",
      "Tom's of Maine added that it is making capital investments to upgrade the plant's water system.",
      "What did the FDA find?",
      "The FDA cited an \"inadequate water system\" at the plant, and also said its investigator observed \"a black mold-like substance at the base of the hose reel and behind the water storage tank\" in one area.",
      "\"Water is a major ingredient in many of your OTC drug products,\" the FDA letter said. \"It is essential that you employ a water system that is robustly designed, and that you effectively control, maintain and monitor the system to ensure it consistently produces water suitable for pharmaceutical use.\"",
      "According to the letter, Tom's of Maine determined that the Wicked Cool! toothpaste had P. yeei bacteria \"due to sample contamination,\" and that the batch was released after retesting, but the FDA said that conclusion was \"without sufficient justification.\"",
      "The FDA also noted that although company blamed the \"root cause\" of the P. yeei bacteria was due to a \"laboratory error,\" no lab errors were identified in its initial investigation.",
      "\"Your response is inadequate. It does not include additional supporting evidence or testing results for the finished products,\" the FDA said.",

    "summary": "Trump has picked Howard Lutnick, a crypto enthusiast and the head of brokerage and investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, to be commerce secretary.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll nominate Howard Lutnick, head of brokerage and investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, to be commerce secretary, a position in which he'd have a key role in carrying out Trump's plans to raise and enforce tariffs.",
      "Trump announced his pick Tuesday in a social media post.",
      "Lutnick is a co-chair of Trump's transition team, along with Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive who was the Small Business Administration administrator in Trump's first administration. Both are tasked with putting forward candidates for key roles in the next administration.",
      "Lutnick has also donated millions to the effort to re-elect Trump and other Republicans. He hosted a fundraiser for Trump in August that raised $15 million and also gave $5 million to the Make America Great Again PAC, according to Federal Election Commission records.",
      "As commerce secretary, Lutnick, if confirmed, would be in charge of a sprawling Cabinet agency that is involved in funding new computer chip factories, imposing trade restrictions, releasing economic data and monitoring the weather. It is also a position in which connections to CEOs and the wider business community are crucial.",
      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick told CNBC in September that \"tariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker.\" During his campaign, Trump proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the U.S. imports.",
      "\"I think we'll make a bunch of money on the tariffs,\" Lutnick said, \"but mostly, everybody else is going to negotiate with us, and we will be more fair.\"",
      "Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.",
      "During the campaign, Trump campaign allies, including Lutnick, were asked about Project 2025, the\u00a0multi-pronged initiative\u00a0overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation that includes a detailed\u00a0blueprint\u00a0for the next Republican president to usher in a sweeping overhaul of the executive branch.",
      "Trump and his campaign worked to distance themselves from Project 2025 in the months leading up to Election Day, with the former president going so far as to call some of the proposals \"abysmal.\" Lutnick told CNBC he had read Project 2025 but had not met with any of its authors.",
      "\"I won't touch them. They made themselves nuclear,\" Lutnick said in September.",
      "Lutnick, who's worked on Wall Street for over 30 years, has been with Cantor Fitzgerald since 1983 and became its president and CEO when he was 29 years old, in 1996. On 9/11, Cantor Fitzgerald lost about two-thirds of its New York-based workforce in the terrorist attacks, 658 employees in all, including Lutnick's brother. Lutnick survived the attack because he was late to work that day, dropping off his young son at his first day of school. In the years since the attack, Lutnick and the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund have donated $180 million to 9/11 families, according to Trump's social media post on Lutnick's selection.",
      "Lutnick, who is also a cryptocurrency enthusiast, was also under consideration for treasury secretary, a role that has been at the center of high-profile jockeying within the Trump world. At the same time, the treasury position is closely watched in financial circles, where a disruptive nominee could have immediate negative consequences on the stock market, which Trump watches closely.",
      "Billionaire Elon Musk and others in Trump's orbit were calling on Trump to dump the previous front-runner for treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in favor of Lutnick. Musk said in his post that \"Bessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas @howardlutnick will actually enact change.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 09:45:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by persuading average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
    "story": [
      "New York \u2014\u00a0 Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by persuading average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\"My father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\"",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry's best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer's brand, led today by Pauline Frommer, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy - stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants - changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\" That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn't hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship.",
      "The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn't visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer's guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer's advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks.",
      "\"It was really pioneering stuff,\" Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \"that would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I've got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\"",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\"",
      "Frommer guides reborn",
      "The concept no longer made sense when hotels couldn't be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire didn't disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer - in a David vs. Goliath triumph - got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\"I never dreamed at my age I'd be working this hard,\" he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show.",
      "He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony posts. And he coined the phrase \"Trump Slump\" in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president the first time.",
      "Depression-era roots",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight.",
      "Eventually, he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe\" and, a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece and distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after, he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day,\" was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Frommer eventually gave up law to write the guides full-time.",
      "Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Dispelling false impressions",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \"most Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. ... And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\"",
      "He added: \"We were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn't have to be well-heeled.\"",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \"I fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\" he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \"It's wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\"",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer's survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 20:56:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Spirit's bankruptcy filing will likely mean higher airfares across airlines as it trims schedule, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines, the airline of choice for many budget travelers, filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, raising questions about the viability of no-frills airlines in the post-pandemic era, as consumer preferences shift toward more premium offerings.",
      "Customers with plans to fly on the airline over Thanksgiving and beyond are also concerned about what the filing means for their upcoming trips, as well as airfares generally.",
      "Spirit has entered into a restructuring agreement\u00a0with its bondholders in order to reduce the airline's debt and provide it with increased financial flexibility, Spirit said in an open letter to customers Monday. The longterm aim, Spirit said, is to provide its guests \"with enhanced travel experiences and greater value.\"",
      "The airline, known for its bargain fares, said it expects to emerge from bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2025, \"even better positioned to deliver the best value in the sky.\"",
      "Industry experts attribute Spirit's financial woes in part to changing consumer preferences as they\u00a0demand more amenities while flying.",
      "\"We can clearly see that consumer preferences have changed in favor of a more premium product, and the low-cost airlines are struggling,\" Jungho Suh, management professor at George Washington University School of Business told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They don't want to see any added costs, they want an all-in, full-service offering.\"",
      "What if I am booked on a Spirit flight?",
      "Spirit plainly states that customers with existing reservations can still use their tickets. Their flight credits and loyalty points are also still valid, and can be redeemed as usual. Customers may also make new reservations for future travel.",
      "\"The most important thing to know is that you can continue to book and fly now and in the future,\" the airline said.",
      "Additionally, Spirit customers can still benefit from the airline's Free Spirit loyalty program, as well as accrue and redeem Saver$ Club perks and credit card terms.",
      "Schedule modifications",
      "That said, industry experts advise customers to keep a close eye on their upcoming bookings. That includes updating their contact information so that the airline can reach them with modifications to their flights.",
      "\"Make sure your contact information is up to date, and keep an eagle eye on your reservations,\" Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy \u2014 a site focused on airline deals and travel rewards \u2014 told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There's no need to panic, Kelly said, but the airline is expected to trim its schedule, which could result in your flight time changing, or being canceled.",
      "\"They're not going to stop flying tomorrow, but inevitably they're going to emerge an even smaller airline after this process, so that means there are going to be some hiccups with routes,\" he said.",
      "Aviation industry consultant Robert Mann said some consumers who were accustomed to flying Spirit out of major airports may have to fly out of a smaller hub, as Spirit withdraws from major hubs served by legacy carriers.",
      "\"You could see that happen where Spirit decided to compete, and has now decided it wasn't such a good idea,\" he said.",
      "What will happen to airfares?",
      "Spirit and other low-cost carriers have helped depress airfares, even for consumers who don't fly on budget airlines.",
      "\"Whether you like them or not, having ultra low-cost carriers is good for our overall aviation ecosystem and good for consumers, even if you never buy them,\" Kelly said.",
      "Spirit will emerge a smaller airline, which means there will be fewer low-cost flights on most routes, and airfares could rise across the board.",
      "\"The smaller Spirit is and the less routes they serve, the less pressure there will be on other airlines in those markets, resulting in overall higher fares,\" Kelly said. \"This isn't good for consumers. There's no positive side to this.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 19:41:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The budget carrier Spirit Airlines is trying to recover from the pandemic drop in travel and failed mergers.",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it's filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and failed attempts to sell itself to other carriers.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion over the next year, obligations it was unlikely to be able to meet.",
      "The move was widely expected.",
      "Spirit said it expects to operate as normal as it works its way through a \"prearranged, streamlined\" Chapter 11 bankruptcy process and that customers can continue to book and fly without interruption.",
      "The Chapter 11 process itself won't impact Spirit employee's wages or benefits, the airline said.",
      "Shares of Miramar, Florida-based Spirit dropped 25% on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. It was just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. He called the discussions a priority and said the airline was trying to get the best deal it could as quickly as possible.",
      "\"The chatter in the market about Spirit is notable, but we are not distracted,\" he told investors during an earnings call. \"We are focused on refinancing our debt, improving our overall liquidity position, deploying our new reimagined product into the market, and growing our loyalty programs.\"",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They're just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they're paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit's red ink.",
      "It's not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded.",
      "What's been ailing Spirit",
      "There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit's costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit's budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit's core business \u2014 have sagged because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit's traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. That was a huge change from Spirit's longtime strategy of luring customers with rock-bottom fares and forcing them to pay extra for things such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "Airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt pointed out to CBS News that, on one hand, some people \"are saying, 'You know what? I'm doing better than I thought financially and I can afford maybe to upgrade to an airline that has extra leg room or something like that.' And Spirit has missed that opportunity.\"",
      "On the other hand, Harteveldt notes, lots of Spirit's customers \"haven't been able to afford to fly to the same extent that they used to because of the higher cost of everyday living.\"",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit plans to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20% compared with the same period last year, which analysts say should help prop up fares. But that will help rivals more than it will boost Spirit. Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines that are forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "Spirit said in an October regulatory filing that it had identified about $80 million of cost-cutting measures set to begin early next year, according to\u00a0CBS News Miami. Those cuts will be driven primarily by a \"reduction in workforce,\" the Florida-based airline noted. The carrier also disclosed that it had agreed to sell 23 airplanes to GA Telesis, an aviation services company, for about $519 million.",
      "Mergers didn't materialize",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013.",

      "Shares in Dentsply Sirona, Envista, Henry Schein Patterson Companies, and other providers of dental products are jumping, with Wall Street betting that a potential push by the incoming Trump administration to remove fluoride from the nation's drinking water could spur demand for the companies' services.",
      "Kennedy, tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said on social media just ahead of the November 5 presidential election that Trump would rid fluoride from the public water supply on his first day in office. Kennedy, a noted vaccine skeptic, has described fluoride as an \"industrial waste\" and linked it to arthritis, neurological deficiencies in children and other serious health problems.",

      "Dental experts have largely refuted such claims. Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0on November 13 that there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years showing that fluoride is both safe, and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",
      "According to\u00a0KFF Health News, some studies have linked fluoride exposure among pregnant women to a higher risk of childhood neurobehavioral problems and lower IQs, leading experts to call for further research.",

    "story": [
      "Canada's Bestar has agreed to a more than $16 million civil penalty for failing to report\u00a0a defect in its wall beds until after one person was killed and more than a dozen others injured, some seriously, federal officials say.",
      "Starting in September of 2014 and continuing through 2022, Bestar received numbers of reports that the products had detached from the wall. By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The furniture company then engaged with CPSC and Health Canada, but did not tell regulators of an additional five incidents it had become aware of by that time, the document said. In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",
      "Bestar did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "Bestar purchased Bush Industries in 2020, with both brands now operating under a corporate parent, eSolutions Furniture Group, which was established in 2021 and is based in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.

      "Here's what we know about how much Paul and Tyson were being paid, along with other financial aspects of an event that many consider more spectacle than sport.",
      "How much is Mike Tyson getting paid for the fight?",
      "Regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, 58-year-old Mike Tyson has an estimated net worth of $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That is a modest sum compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars \"Iron Mike,\" as he is known, accumulated in career earnings, including $400 million in fight purses, according\u00a0to\u00a0Forbes. Over the last decade, Tyson has also fought his way back after filing for bankruptcy in 2003.",

      "Jake Paul, 27, to fight 57-year-old Mike Tyson live on Netflix: \"Time to put Iron Mike to sleep\"",
      "That's about the same dollar amount Tyson earned in his match against Michael Spinks in 1988, a record purse at the time (worth roughly $53 million today adjusting for inflation). That bout lasted less than two minutes, with Tyson knocking out the previously undefeated Spinks in 91 seconds.",
      "In 1992, Tyson was sent to prison for six years after being convicted of raping a teenage beauty-pageant contestant. He was released on parole after three and a half years, returning to boxing in 1995 in a match against Peter McNeely, who was dispatched by a technical knockout in under 90 seconds.",

Tyson was disqualified from the fight, had his boxing license revoked and fined $3 million, but was allowed to keep the purse.",
      "At a news conference on Wednesday, Paul wore a diamond-spiked ear cover, a pointed reference to the incident. But when it comes to making light of the ear biting, Tyson has beat Paul to the punch, having launched ear-shaped marijuana edibles\u00a0(with Holyfield's consent) through his company, Tyson 2.0, a premium cannabis brand he launched in 2021. The brand generated an estimated $150 million in revenue in 2023, according to Forbes Australia.",

      "Jake Paul, 27, is set to earn $40 million, according to an estimate from DraftKings Network and other sources \u2014 double what Tyson is expected to receive for the fight. A simple explanation for that may be that Paul, a top social influencer with 27 million followers on Instagram alone, is also co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), the company promoting the extravaganza in partnership with Netflix. His net worth is estimated at $80 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.",
      "With a 10-1 fight record, mostly against\u00a0mixed martial artists and other pro-boxing newcomers under his belt, Paul, a former child star and YouTube prankster who began his boxing career in 2018, does not lack confidence \u2014 or showmanship. His cocky attitude earned him his latest nickname \"El Gallo de Dorado\" or the Golden Rooster, coined by fans in Puerto Rico. Before that, he was called \"The Problem Child,\" a fairly self-explanatory moniker based on the online persona he's crafted for himself over the years.",
      "Paul, who went full Gallo at an open training session this week with Tyson at the Toyota Music Factory in Irving, Texas, donning a rooster hat and red-feathered skirt over his boxing trunks, epitomizes social media's melding of Barnumesque entertainment and sports.",

      "\"There has been a lot of anticipation for this fight, and we have been pleased with the betting volume,\" Johnny Avello, director of sports operations at DraftKings, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect more action to come in the hours leading up to the fight.\"",
      "Although it remains to be seen how much will be wagered in total, the event is attracting some whale-sized bets of $500,000, according to ESPN.",

    "summary": "Americans looking to purchase EVs may want to do so quickly, as the incoming administration is likely to axe a $7,500 tax credit.",
    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump vowing to pull the plug on the $7,500 tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles, one EV maker and its billionaire owner are fully behind the idea and even stand to profit from it.",
      "\"Take away the subsidies, it will only help Tesla,\" Tesla owner Elon Musk posted in July on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "The credit granted to buyers of EVs helped make the case for buying the climate-friendlier vehicles, and when an earlier version of the tax credit was done away with several years ago, Tesla cut prices on its cars by about half of the credit its buyers were no longer receiving.",
      "Tesla is the sole automaker to be generating a profit on its U.S. sales. Manufacturing EVs is a losing proposition for Big Three vehicle makers like Ford and General Motors, who sell a fraction of EVs compared with Tesla.",
      "Once the EV tax credit is vanquished, the price of EVs overall might drop, cutting into Tesla's profits, as opposed to increasing the company's red ink as it could for legacy automakers still working to get a firmer footing in the EV market. Should traditional automakers scale back on their EV production and sales to curtail the losses, EV shoppers would have even fewer options, benefiting Tesla.",
      "As Musk touted his support for axing the EV tax credit, Tesla's auto industry rivals signaled the opposite.",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation urged that the tax credit continue, telling lawmakers in an October letter that U.S. manufacturers count on it as they vie with Chinese EV production. Around the world, vehicle makers have poured billions into transitioning to electric cars.",
      "Further, the Zero Emission Transportation Association on Friday called on Trump to reconsider, saying the tax credit has bolstered employment in states that voted Republican, including Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan and Georgia.",
      "\"If the United States is going to continue to fight to bring those jobs here and actually compete to win against China, there needs to be a demand signal \u2014 like the New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit \u2014 aligned with that goal, otherwise we would be undercutting those investments and hurting American job growth,\" ZETA Executive Director Albert Gore stated on Friday.",
      "\"The potential elimination of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles by the Trump administration \u2014 without another form of incentive to replace it \u2014 could derail the trajectory of EV sales in the United States,\" offered Edmunds analysts.",
      "Trump repeatedly vowed to eliminate what he labeled President Joe Biden's \"EV mandate\" as he campaigned for the White House.",
      "While there is no such mandate in federal law, the Inflation Reduction Act passed during President Biden's term revived the credit for many EV purchases, while also granting low interest loans to manufacturers constructing EV and battery plants.",
      "Trump's transition team intends to knock out the credit as part of a broader tax-reform measure, according to a Thursday report by Reuters, which cited two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.",
      "The president-elect during his first term attempted to repeal the EV tax credit, which was expanded by President Biden in 2022.",
      "Analysts who track Tesla concurred with Musk's view that the credit's demise would only help his company.",
      "\"This is a clear negative for the EV industry at first look and would particularly hurt GM, Ford, Stellantis and Rivian,\" wrote Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives. Conversely, \"this will enable Tesla to further fend off competition from Detroit as pricing/scale/scope is an apples-to-oranges when compared to the rest of the auto industry once the EV tax credit disappears.\"",
      "Americans looking to buy an electric car should do so sooner rather than later, advised Ivan Drury, Edmunds' director Insights.",
      "\"The federal tax credit combined with slashed prices due to slowed sales momentum has contributed to electric vehicles becoming labeled as some of the best deals on the market in 2024. Now, with production cuts shrinking supply and a fresh wave of demand from those seeking a deal while they still can, it can be all but assured that the price for that EV you've been eyeing is going up in the coming months,\" Drury stated.",

    "summary": "The Social Security Fairness Act, which would increase benefits for 2.8 million retirees, has bipartisan support but time running out.",
    "story": [
      "Efforts to get the Senate to vote on a bill to expand Social Security benefits are intensifying, as the House-passed Social Security Fairness Act enjoys rare bipartisan support but has only a short window of time \u2014 six weeks \u2014 to be passed.",
      "\"We're guardedly optimistic,\" Shannon Benton executive director of The Senior Citizens League, or TSCL, an advocacy group devoted to protecting retirement benefits, said. \"There is so much momentum, if it doesn't get passed now, a lot of people will lose hope.\"",
      "Decades in the making, the legislation would eliminate a provision that reduces Social Security payments to some retirees who also collect a pension from jobs that aren't covered by the retirement program, such as state and federal workers including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. It would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Various forms of the measure have been introduced over the years, but like many legislative proposals, they had failed to get enacted.",
      "\"I've been working at the league 25 years, and I don't remember ever not having a version,\" said Benton.",
      "Introduced by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Garret Graves, R-La., the bill was passed by the House in a 327-75 vote late Tuesday night, after a last-ditch effort to derail it by members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus failed.",
      "The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "What happens next to the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "Despite having 62 cosponsors in the Senate, the bill still needs to be brought up for a vote by the chamber's leadership, and soon.",
      "The bill \"dies December 31, at the end of the second session of Congress,\" Benton said. \"Not only would this bill have to start from scratch, but a new person would have to introduce it.\"",
      "The Republican and Democratic lawmakers who introduced the measures in their respective bodies either did not run for reelection or lost their reelection bid, as was the case with Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, who introduced the bill in the Senate.",
      "If the Social Security Fairness Act comes up for a vote in the Senate, it's expected to pass, having already secured 62 co-sponsors \u2014 surpassing the majority needed to send it to President Joe Biden for his signature.",
      "If signed into law, the changes would be effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",
      "What does the Social Security Fairness Act do?",
      "The legislation would cut two provisions that curtail retirement payments for public workers and their surviving spouses and family members, the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which Spanberger and Graves argue are tantamount to theft of those workers' benefits.",
      "\"For more than 40 years, the Social Security trust funds have been artificially propped up by stolen benefits that millions of Americans paid for and that their families deserve,\" they said in a Nov. 13 statement.",
      "As things stand now, the WEP reduces the Social Security benefits of workers who also receive a public pension from a job not covered by Social Security. For instance, that would include teachers who don't earn Social Security through their public school positions but who work part-time or during the summer in jobs that are covered by Social Security, even though they pay into the system over enough quarters to qualify.",
      "The GPO impacts the spousal benefits of people who work for federal, state or local governments \u2014 including police officers, firefighters and teachers \u2014 if the job is not covered by Social Security. The GPO cuts by two-thirds the benefit received by surviving spouses who also collect a government pension, often offsetting benefits entirely.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, someone who receives a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security but who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension would see their Social Security benefit cut by $667. That would leave them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit from Social Security.",
      "Under the Social Security Fairness Act, the same person would receive the entire $900 spousal benefit.",
      "\"Workers should be able to count on the retirement benefits they've earned,\" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, an original cosponsor of the bill. \"It's time to pass the Social Security Fairness Act so government workers and their families and people with disabilities are not punished for earning multiple sources of retirement income.\"",
      "What is the chance of the Social Security Fairness Act passing?",
      "The biggest opposition to the bill is its cost. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would cost upward of $190 billion over a decade.",
      "\"It would hasten the combined trust funds shortfall by six months to a year, when it's already in trouble,\" said Benton, who said TSCL supports reforming Social Security to resolve its projected insolvency in 2033 to 2034.",
      "\"The long-term solvency of Social Security is an issue that Congress must address \u2014 but an issue that is wholly separate from allowing Virginians, Louisianans, and Americans across our country who did their part and contributed their earnings to retire with dignity,\" Graves and Spanberger said in their joint statement.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 11:03:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Pregnant women say health care providers are billing them to deliver their babies earlier than expected. Patient advocates say that's unethical.",
    "story": [
      "In April, just 12 weeks into her pregnancy, Kathleen Clark was standing at the receptionist window of her OB-GYN's office when she was asked to pay $960, the total the office estimated she would owe after she delivered.",
      "Clark, 39, was shocked that she was asked to pay that amount during this second prenatal visit. Normally, patients receive the bill after insurance has paid its part, and for pregnant women that's usually only when the pregnancy ends. It would be months before the office filed the claim with her health insurer.",
      "Clark said she felt stuck. The Cleveland, Tennessee, obstetrics practice was affiliated with a birthing center where she wanted to deliver. Plus, she and her husband had been wanting to have a baby for a long time. And Clark was emotional, because just weeks earlier her mother had died.",
      "\"You're standing there at the window, and there's people all around, and you're trying to be really nice,\" recalled Clark, through tears. \"So, I paid it.\"",
      "On online baby message boards and other social media forums, pregnant women say they are being asked by their providers to pay out-of-pocket fees earlier than expected. The practice is legal, but patient advocacy groups call it unethical. Medical providers argue that asking for payment up front ensures they get compensated for their services.",
      "How frequently this happens is hard to track because it is considered a private transaction between the provider and the patient. Therefore, the payments are not recorded in insurance claims data and are not studied by researchers.",
      "Patients, medical billing experts, and patient advocates say the billing practice causes unexpected anxiety at a time of already heightened stress and financial pressure. Estimates can sometimes be higher than what a patient might ultimately owe and force people to fight for refunds if they miscarry or the amount paid was higher than the final bill.",
      "Up-front payments also create hurdles for women who may want to switch providers if they are unhappy with their care. In some cases, they may cause women to forgo prenatal care altogether, especially in places where few other maternity care options exist.",
      "It's \"holding their treatment hostage,\" said Caitlin Donovan, a senior director at the Patient Advocate Foundation.",
      "Medical billing and women's health experts believe OB-GYN offices adopted the practice to manage the high cost of maternity care and the way it is billed for in the U.S.",
      "When a pregnancy ends, OB-GYNs typically file a single insurance claim for routine prenatal care, labor, delivery, and, often, postpartum care. That practice of bundling all maternity care into one billing code began three decades ago, said Lisa Satterfield, senior director of health and payment policy at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But such bundled billing has become outdated, she said.",
      "Previously, pregnant patients had been subject to copayments for each prenatal visit, which might lead them to skip crucial appointments to save money. But the Affordable Care Act now requires all commercial insurers to fully cover certain prenatal services. Plus, it's become more common for pregnant women to switch providers, or have different providers handle prenatal care, labor, and delivery \u2014 especially in rural areas where patient transfers are common.",
      "Some providers say prepayments allow them to spread out one-time payments over the course of the pregnancy to ensure that they are compensated for the care they do provide, even if they don't ultimately deliver the baby.",
      "\"You have people who, unfortunately, are not getting paid for the work that they do,\" said Pamela Boatner, who works as a midwife in a Georgia hospital.",
      "While she believes women should receive pregnancy care regardless of their ability to pay, she also understands that some providers want to make sure their bill isn't ignored after the baby is delivered. New parents might be overloaded with hospital bills and the costs of caring for a new child, and they may lack income if a parent isn't working, Boatner said.",
      "In the U.S., having a baby can be expensive. People who obtain health insurance through large employers pay an average of nearly $3,000 out-of-pocket for pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker. In addition, many people are opting for high-deductible health insurance plans, leaving them to shoulder a larger share of the costs. Of the 100 million U.S. people with health care debt, 12% attribute at least some of it to maternity care, according to a 2022 KFF poll.",
      "Families need time to save money for the high costs of pregnancy, childbirth, and child care, especially if they lack paid maternity leave, said Joy Burkhard, CEO of the Policy Center for Maternal Mental Health, a Los Angeles-based policy think tank. Asking them to prepay \"is another gut punch,\" she said. \"What if you don't have the money? Do you put it on credit cards and hope your credit card goes through?\"",
      "Calculating the final costs of childbirth depends on multiple factors, such as the timing of the pregnancy, plan benefits, and health complications, said Erin Duffy, a health policy researcher at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics. The final bill for the patient is unclear until a health plan decides how much of the claim it will cover, she said.",
      "But sometimes the option to wait for the insurer is taken away.",
      "During Jamie Daw's first pregnancy in 2020, her OB-GYN accepted her refusal to pay in advance because Daw wanted to see the final bill. But in 2023, during her second pregnancy, a private midwifery practice in New York told her that since she had a high-deductible plan, it was mandatory to pay $2,000 spread out with monthly payments.",
      "Daw, a health policy researcher at Columbia University, delivered in September 2023 and got a refund check that November for $640 to cover the difference between the estimate and the final bill.",
      "\"I study health insurance,\" she said. \"But, as most of us know, it's so complicated when you're really living it.\"",
      "While the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover some prenatal services, it doesn't prohibit providers from sending their final bill to patients early. It would be a challenge politically and practically for state and federal governments to attempt to regulate the timing of the payment request, said Sabrina Corlette, a co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. Medical lobbying groups are powerful and contracts between insurers and medical providers are proprietary.",
      "Because of the legal gray area, Lacy Marshall, an insurance broker at Rapha Health and Life in Texas, advises clients to ask their insurer if they can refuse to prepay their deductible. Some insurance plans prohibit providers in their network from requiring payment up front.",
      "If the insurer says they can refuse to pay up front, Marshall said, she tells clients to get established with a practice before declining to pay, so that the provider can't refuse treatment.",
      "Clark said she met her insurance deductible after paying for genetic testing, extra ultrasounds, and other services out of her health care flexible spending account. Then she called her OB-GYN's office and asked for a refund.",
      "\"I got my spine back,\" said Clark, who had previously worked at a health insurer and a medical office. She got an initial check for about half the $960 she originally paid.",
      "In August, Clark was sent to the hospital after her blood pressure spiked. A high-risk pregnancy specialist \u2014 not her original OB-GYN practice \u2014 delivered her son, Peter, prematurely via emergency cesarean section at 30 weeks.",
      "It was only after she resolved most of the bills from the delivery that she received the rest of her refund from the other OB-GYN practice.",
      "This final check came in October, just days after Clark brought Peter home from the hospital, and after multiple calls to the office. She said it all added stress to an already stressful period.",
      "\"Why am I having to pay the price as a patient?\" she said. \"I'm just trying to have a baby.\"",

      "Jones owes more than $1 billion in defamation judgments to the families for calling the massacre a hoax. In a statement from their attorneys, the families said the purchase is \"putting an end to the misinformation machine that Jones used to defame the families and victims for years.\"",
      "Sealed bids were opened Wednesday at the auction, which had been\u00a0approved by a bankruptcy court earlier this year to allow the Sandy Hook families to receive payments from Jones. The conspiracy theorist and his company filed for bankruptcy in 2022 after losing defamation and emotional distress lawsuits by Sandy Hook families after he repeatedly called the Connecticut school shooting a hoax staged by \"crisis actors.\"",
      "The purchase was confirmed by conspiracy theorist Jones, who posted a video on X saying that The Onion bought his company. \"The Connecticut Democrats with the Onion newspaper bought us,\" he said in the post, describing the bidding as \"competitive.\"",
      "The statement from the Sandy Hook families said the purchase includes Infowars' intellectual property, which includes its website, customer lists and inventory, as well as some social media accounts and production equipment used by Jones to air his shows.",
      "\"The Connecticut families agreed to forgo a portion of their recovery to increase the overall value of The Onion's bid, enabling its success,\" according to the statement.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Postal Service's loss widened in fiscal 2024, although revenue rose slightly after two stamp hikes this year.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Postal Service on Thursday\u00a0said its annual loss widened to almost $10 billion, although revenue rose slightly after two postage rate hikes this year, part of Postmaster Louis DeJoy's plan to get the postal agency on a better financial footing.",
      "The USPS said it lost $9.5 billion in the fiscal year ended September 30, compared with a loss of $6.5 billion a year earlier. The postal service blamed the wider loss on billions spent on noncash contributions to worker compensation.",
      "Excluding that expense as well as what it described as other \"certain expenses that are not controllable by management,\" the USPS said it would have lost $1.8 billion in fiscal 2024, compared with a loss of more than $2.2 billion a year earlier. Revenue rose 1.7% to $79.5 billion in the most recent fiscal year.",
      "The USPS is in the midst of a 10-year overhaul engineered by DeJoy, who has argued that higher postal rates and other changes are essential to staunch the postal service's financial bleeding. Under his original plan, the USPS had aimed to turn a profit in fiscal 2024, but instead, the agency has now reported mounting losses for two consecutive years, raising questions about the effectiveness of the turnaround effort.",
      "DeJoy said the agency is focused on reducing its costs, but that it is also dealing with \"many economic, legislative and regulatory obstacles for us to overcome.\"",
      "The USPS has raised postage rates twice in 2024, with a two-cent per stamp increase in January and a second boost in July, which raised the cost of a Forever stamp to 73 cents.",
      "Fewer deliveries",
      "Mail volume declined in the most recent fiscal year, although revenue increased due to the higher postage rates, the USPS said. It delivered 112 billion pieces of mail, magazines, packages and other items last year, a decline of 3.2% from the prior fiscal year, it said in a financial report.",
      "Keep US Posted, an advocacy group of newspapers, magazines and other companies that rely on the USPS, described the agency's $9.5 billion loss as \"staggering,\" and said it was $3 billion higher than expected. The group also blamed the rate hikes for driving customers away from the USPS, reducing mail volume.",
      "\"The bottom line is that these consistent financial losses are driven by stamp hikes which lead to disastrous mail volume losses, plus the complete failure of USPS to capture parcel market share in already crowded package delivery space,\" said Keep US Posted executive director Kevin Yoder in a statement.",
      "Yoder, a former Republican Congressman from Kansas, also criticized the USPS for focusing on packages rather than traditional mail delivery, which he said remains the largest revenue generator for the postal service.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump claims he can unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports. The reality is more complicated, according to trade experts.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump, who recently described \"tariff\" as\u00a0\"the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" has proposed a range of taxes on imports from other countries. The president-elect's stated aim: to reduce American companies' use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost, a policy he contends would strengthen the U.S.' international trade position and boost job growth at home.",
      "Trump has also claimed that he doesn't need Congress' support to impose sweeping tariffs. The reality is more complicated, according to economists and foreign trade experts.",
      "What has Trump proposed?",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump proposed tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods. He's offered few additional details, however, such as whether the tariffs would apply to all goods or just certain categories of products.",
      "He's also proposed much broader tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imports, including those from key allies and trade partners, and has promised retaliatory levies on any country that imposes taxes on American-made goods.",
      "Can Trump unilaterally impose tariffs?",
      "Once he takes office, President-elect Trump has several possible pathways for implementing tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose tariffs in Article 1, Section 8, which states that \"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties\u2026To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" But Congress can also selectively delegate tariff-setting authority to the president, which it has done for decades.",
      "In his first term as president from 2017-2021, Trump freely exercised this presidential authority to increase tariffs: Total duties paid on U.S. imports doubled from roughly $37 billion in 2015 to $74 billion in 2020, according to the\u00a0Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"Looking at his previous four years in office, he seems to believe he has the authority to impose tariffs,\" said Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a group dedicated to advocating for U.S. companies in international commerce. \"If they decide on day one that they want to use executive authority to put tariffs on Chinese goods, they could probably go ahead and do that.\"",
      "Colvin added that it will be important for the incoming Trump administration to provide businesses with more specifics so that companies can plan accordingly. \"A lot has been proposed in the course of the campaign, so it's important for the administration to give a signal about the path it intends to pursue, for clarity and planning purposes for American businesses,\" he said.",
      "How fast is Trump likely to move?",
      "The president has authority to impose a range of trade restrictions on foreign nations, said Inu Manak, a trade policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"It seems pretty clear that he would pursue tariffs soon after taking office. During his last term, tariffs were a tool of choice in the trade war against China and against allies, too. So I believe that is a strategy he'll replicate in his next term,\" Manak told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Manak added that he would likely be able to do so without support from Congress. \"The president has quite a bit of discretion to do what he wants,\" she said.",
      "Legal powers at Trump's disposal include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the president may impose retaliatory tariffs when \"an act policy, or practice of a foreign country \u2026 violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement, or \u2026 is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.\"",
      "Trump previously\u00a0invoked\u00a0Section 301 to impose tariffs on China in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 many of which have been continued under the Biden administration \u2014 and he could simply expand upon existing tariff actions he's already taken, according to Manak.",
      "\"That would require no action from Congress because they are already in place,\" she said.",
      "What other power Trump does have?",
      "In his previous term as president, he also made use of\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. It grants the president the authority to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are deemed a threat to national security.",
      "There's also the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), although it hasn't used to restrict trade since President Richard Nixon was in office. The act says: \"Any authority granted to the President by ... this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.\"",
      "\"The authorities granted to the President ... may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency ...\" it adds in part.",
      "In other words, in order to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, Trump would have to declare a national emergency through an executive order, claiming that a U.S. trading partner posed a major threat.",
      "Alan Wm. Wolff, former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), is skeptical that Trump has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "\"Can it be used against trade with all countries, our allies and friends in Europe and Asia, in the Americas, not to mention the poorest countries in Africa? That would simply be too large a power grab to have been within what Congress intended in this statute,\" he wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Manak also said Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 could conceivably give the president the authority to unilaterally raise tariffs. The rarely used act allows the president to impose duties of up to 50% of a product's value, and is triggered when a president finds that a foreign country has imposed an unreasonable charge on, or discriminated against, U.S. commerce.",
      "Typically, though, that has to be determine by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). \"But the statute's language is ambiguous in terms of what that would look like, and I would imagine he could pursue this without a final finding from ITC, or pursue it while a finding is being made,\" Manak said.",
      "How would sweeping tariffs affect U.S. consumers?",
      "Some companies have already said they're aiming to move production out of China to avoid Trump's proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden, for example, said last week week it plans to import fewer goods made in China and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "If imposed, the proposed tariffs on imports could lead to consumers losing between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, according to the National Retail Federation.",
      "By another estimate, a 20% general tariff on all imported goods, combined with a 60% tariff on goods imported from China, would cost the typical U.S. households more than $2,600 a year. If Trump instead imposed a 10% across-the-board tariff, that would cost families $1,700 more, according to PIIE.",
      "Experts expect the incoming Trump administration to impose some proposed tariffs quickly, while perhaps phasing in or threatening to apply other levies over time in a bid to gain trade concessions.",
      "\"We would imagine that within a few months of him taking office, we would see the first tranche of tariffs taking effect,\" Manak said.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 19:00:22 -0500",
    "summary": "As he gets ready to retire, GOP Rep. Brad Wenstrup often thinks about the day Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the House Republican leaders, was shot during a baseball practice.",
    "story": [
      "As Rep. Brad Wenstrup prepares for his retirement in six weeks, he often recalls one day in particular. He was prone on the ground, face down in the grass, with a baseball helmet on his head.",
      "The piercing sounds of screaming, gunfire and chaos surrounded him, persisting for several minutes. When it finally quieted, Wenstrup sprang to his feet and ran to his gravely injured colleague, GOP Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House majority whip, a few hundred feet away.",
      "With each stride that day in June 2017, Wenstrup said he was consumed by the memories of Iraq from 12 years earlier. And as Wenstrup, a decorated combat surgeon, made his run along the field to provide help to his colleague, Wenstrup pictured the patient he and his surgical team were not able to save 12 years earlier.",
      "This time would be different, Wenstrup hoped.",
      "He not only helped save the patient, but along with emergency responders, played a key role in heading off a political assassination.",
      "Wenstrup, who was elected to Congress from suburban Cincinnati in 2012, helped treat Scalise, who had been shot by a gunman who opened fire at a House Republican baseball practice just before their 2017 annual congressional baseball game against Democrats.",
      "\"I saw the entry wound from the bullet, but I didn't see an exit wound, so I knew he was in trouble,\" Wenstrup said. \"I had no doubt he was bleeding internally. I knew that if I couldn't stop the bleeding, I at least needed to get him to drink fluids.\" He began applying pressure to slow the bleeding and talking to Scalise to keep him alert and conscious.",
      "Scalise had suffered a shot to his hip. His femur was shattered and his pelvis severely damaged.",
      "Scalise recalled some of the immediate aftermath of the shooting and of Wenstrup's care. He told CBS News, \"He was putting pressure on the spot where the bullet went in. He then ultimately put a tourniquet on. And you know, later, my trauma surgeon told me that tourniquet saved my life.\" Wenstrup had improvised a tourniquet with a belt and bandages to help slow the blood flow until Scalise was ushered away by emergency responders.",
      "After he was airlifted to George Washington University hospital for emergency surgery, Scalise would spend several days unconscious. Grueling rehabilitation and reconstructive surgeries helped Scalise walk again.",
      "With little fanfare last year, Wenstrup announced his retirement from Congress, which takes effect Jan. 3, 2025. Amid a wave of retirements of longtime members of Congress and a sea change in Washington after the 2024 elections, Wenstrup's departure has been overlooked by some.",
      "But not by Scalise or by many of Wenstrup's House colleagues.",
      "\"He's such a man of high integrity,\" Scalise told CBS News. \"He's respected by his colleagues. He's a chairman of a committee. He could have done even more things here in Congress, and his constituents would have elected him overwhelmingly. But he also knew it's time.\"",
      "The man who opened fire on Scalise and his fellow Republicans was killed after an exchange of gunfire with a Capitol Police protective detail assigned to Scalise, who was given an additional protection as a member of House leadership. Gunman James Hodgkinson acted alone and was not connected to terrorism, federal investigators determined. He was carrying an SKS rifle and a 9 mm handgun when he opened fire.",
      "Wenstrup is haunted by thoughts of the carnage that could have ensued if Scalise and the police unit had not been at the practice to protect the group.",
      "\"There were 136 rounds fired. I don't think most people know that,\" Wenstrup said. \"If Steve Scalise wasn't there and didn't take a bullet for all of us, then there's no (security) detail there.\" Wenstrup said the gunman could have killed 20 to 30 members of Congress and staff.\"",
      "As he performed the initial emergency medical triage on Scalise, Wenstrup recalled eerily similar images from 12 years earlier, when he was deployed as a military doctor at Abu Ghraib in Iraq. He served in the U.S. Army Reserves in Iraq in the months before the troop surge. One day, a soldier was grievously wounded nearby and was rushed to Wenstrup's post for surgery.",
      "Wenstrup said the victim was a servicemember who had likely been hit by an improvised explosive device. \u00a0 \"He was badly hit. There was no doubt about it, but he was still alive, and he was intubated and on the table,\" Wenstrup recalled, sitting back in his chair and lowering the volume of his voice as he shared the account.",
      "\"It was a blunt injury. There severed arteries internally and his blood pressure started dropping,\" Wenstrup said, \"We opened him up, went in and there was blood everywhere. And we couldn't stop. We couldn't stop it.\"",
      "\"We were just really distraught after that one,\" Wenstrup said. \"And that was going through my mind when I was with (Scalise) on that field.\"",
      "He urged arriving medics to rush an IV to Scalise, to ensure he stayed hydrated. The flashbacks to Iraq and 2005 continued. But this was different from that patient 12 years earlier, Wenstrup told himself. Scalise had not suffered the same blunt force trauma.",
      "In a 2018 interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" Scalise recalled, \"In a weird way, your body kind of goes numb. You know, as bad as the wounds were, and obviously I know now how severe it was. At the time, I guess my body had been shutting down a lot of the real pain. And I was just thinking about what was going on at the moment.\"",
      "The surgeons who saved Scalise at the hospital would credit Wenstrup with effective care at the shooting site, Scalise said.",
      "Wenstrup's efforts to help save Scalise also had an untold impact on America, averting a would-be assassination and any cascading impact it would have inflicted upon the nation.",
      "Wenstrup said he and Scalise were casual acquaintances before the shooting. They later became friends \u2014 and roommates at a house in Washington, D.C., sharing a living quarters on days when Congress is in session.",
      "\"We are just very, very tight in our friendship,\" Scalise told CBS News. \"I've really gotten to know him and his wife. They're just wonderful people.\"",
      "Wenstrup's congressional career is ending amid uniquely toxic politics in the House. His departure comes as members of Congress complain of a loss of civility and cross-party relationships. Some of his Democratic colleagues told CBS News that Wenstrup's departure will deprive the House of another of its more civil members.",
      "\"People will miss Brad up here, including me,\" Rep. Greg Landsman, an Ohio Democrat told CBS News. \"He leads with his heart and cares about making things happen for the people he serves. I love the guy.\"",
      "But Wenstrup has engaged in some heated political battles, including in the closing months of his career. In June, a House subcommittee chaired by Wenstrup, held a charged and animated hearing questioning Dr. Anthony Fauci, focusing on Fauci's response to the COVID pandemic.",
      "Wenstrup accused Fauci of running an office that was \"unaccountable to the American people.\" Wenstrup's panel pursued Fauci's personal emails and staged a two-day, 14-hour closed door deposition that Wenstrup characterized as \"cordial\" but pressing.",
      "Democrats accused Wenstrup's subcommittee of spreading misinformation about Fauci. The subcommittee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Raul Ruiz of California, said in his opening statement, \"After 15 months, the select subcommittee still does not possess a shred of evidence to substantiate these extreme allegations that Republicans have levied against Dr. Fauci for nearly four years.\"",
      "Sitting at a small table in the lobby of his office suite in the Rayburn House Office Building, Wenstrup recalled his blistering testimony during hearings into the formation of the House Jan. 6 select committee, which investigated the Capitol siege.",
      "Wenstrup criticized Democratic leaders for not including a review of the baseball field shooting in the Jan. 6 committee's work. \"If the shooting killed 20 to 30 members of Congress, it would have changed the balance of power in the House of Representatives against the will of the people. That's an insurrection. You're throwing around that word? That's an insurrection, I said. So, if you're truly interested in protecting this beautiful Capitol and those who work in here, then we should make this part of this commission as well.\"",
      "Many of the other congressional Republicans who were on the field at the 2017 baseball practice shooting have long since departed, including those who were defeated in elections or retired. Gov. Ron DeSantis, who represented Florida, and former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona are among those who have left.",
      "Wenstrup's colleagues gave him a standing ovation on the House floor in September 2017, when Scalise returned to duties at the Capitol.",
      "But Wenstrup's retirement contributes to an unexpected dynamic. Among the officeholders from the shooting spree who are still in the House is the man who was hit. Scalise is expected to serve another term in 2025 as the House majority leader.",

      "The GOFAST video was made public in 2017 and shows what appears to be an object flying at a high speed just above water, but Dr. Jon Kosloski, the director of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, told Congress the object depicted is not actually too unusual.",
      "\"Through a very careful geospatial intelligence analysis and using trigonometry, we assess with high confidence that the object is not actually close to the water, but is rather closer to 13,000 feet,\" Kosloski said.",
      "Kosloski did not identify the object, but he said that a \"trick of the eye\" called parallax made the object appear anomalous \u2014 or out of the ordinary \u2014 when it was not. He said a detailed report on parallax will be available on the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office website.",
      "The \"GOFAST\" video was recorded by a fighter jet from the USS Theodore Roosevelt off the East coast of the U.S. and made public in 2017.",
      "After providing examples to Congress of two other resolved cases the Defense Department calls \"The Puerto Rico Objects\" and \"Mt. Etna,\" Kosloski described cases his office is still actively investigating, notably, an \"orange orb\" and \"a metallic cylinder.\"",
      "These cases are likely part of the 21 cases that the recently released annual unidentified aerial phenomena report said contain enough information and data for the office to actively investigate.",
      "One case was reported by a law enforcement officer \"out West\" who observed \"a large orange orb floating several hundred feet above the ground,\" according to Kosloski.",
      "As the officer approached where he thought the orb would be, he saw \"a blacker than black object\" that was about the size of a Prius. When he reached a distance of 40-60 meters away from the object, it tilted 45 degrees and shot up vertically, traveling faster than any drone he had seen before.",
      "Just as it left his field of view, it emitted bright red and blue lights that lit up the inside of his vehicle \"as brightly as if someone had set off fireworks just outside of his vehicle,\" Kosloski told Congress.",
      "Another case was reported from the southeastern part of the United States after two cars driven by government contractors left a facility around 9 a.m. and saw \"a large metallic cylinder about the size of a commercial airplane.\"",
      "After they observed it for 15-20 seconds, it disappeared.",

      "The agency falls under the Department of Health and Human Services and oversees Medicare, the federal portion of the Medicaid program, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the federal health insurance marketplace. Trump has selected Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services. Both positions require Senate confirmation.",
      "\"America is facing a health care crisis, and there may be no physician more qualified and capable than Dr. Oz to make America healthy again,\" Trump said in a statement. \"He is an eminent physician, heart surgeon, inventor, and world-class communicator, who has been at the forefront of healthy living for decades.\"",
      "The president-elect said Oz will work with Kennedy, if he is confirmed, \"to take on the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake.\" He also indicated there may be cuts to CMS, writing that Oz \"will also cut waste and fraud within our country's most expensive government agency, which is a third of our nation's healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire national budget.\"",

    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

The plan to slow down the confirmations was orchestrated by Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who was elected last week to serve as the next GOP leader, according to Fox News.",
      "\"If Sen. Schumer thought Senate Republicans would just roll over and allow him to quickly confirm multiple Biden-appointed judges to lifetime jobs in the final weeks of the Democrat majority, he thought wrong,\" Thune said in a statement.",
      "Trump is also pushing Senate Republicans to thwart Democrats' efforts to continue approving Mr. Biden's judicial picks.",
      "\"The Democrats are trying to stack the courts with radical left judges on their way out the door,\" he wrote on social media. \"Republican senators need to show up and hold the line \u2014 no more judges confirmed before inauguration day!\"",
      "But Democrats are not breaking new ground by confirming Mr. Biden's judicial nominees during the lame-duck session. In 2020, after Trump lost his bid for reelection, the GOP-led Senate confirmed 19 candidates to the federal bench, including one judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit and four to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.",
      "Among those who won approval in the weeks after the 2020 election was U.S. District Judge Kathryn Mizelle, who at 33 years old was the youngest of Trump's nominees and was deemed \"not qualified\" to serve on the district court by the American Bar Association. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who tossed out the criminal case against Trump for his alleged mishandling of sensitive documents, was also confirmed by the Senate after the 2020 election.",
      "\"Delaying the confirmation of highly qualified, experienced judges takes a real-life toll on constituents and leads to backlogs of criminal cases \u2013 meaning Senator Thune was correct in 2020 when he said senators have every urgent reason to continue working together in good faith to staff the federal bench,\" Andrew Bates, White House spokesperson, said of the efforts to gum-up the confirmation process. \"There is no excuse for choosing partisanship over enforcing the rule of law.\"",
      "Advocacy groups are pressuring Senate Democrats to continue to hold votes to approve all of the president's remaining nominees to the federal bench before Trump takes office in late January and Republicans claim the majority in the Senate.",
      "On Friday, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and 141 groups sent a letter to senators urging them to confirm all pending judicial nominees, calling it \"urgent and enduring.\"",
      "\"We implore you to stay in and do this necessary work,\" the organizations said. \"It is essential that we leave no judges behind.\"",
      "Demand Justice, a progressive judicial advocacy group, also launched a campaign aimed at pressuring senators to green-light Mr. Biden's picks for the federal courts.",
      "\"With only weeks left before the new Congress, it's more urgent than ever that Democratic senators do whatever it takes \u2014 staying late, working weekends \u2014 during the lame duck session to confirm the dozens of remaining fair-minded, qualified judges nominated by President Biden that the American people deserve,\" said Maggie Jo Buchanan, managing director of Demand Justice.",
      "Senate Democrats are unbowed by Republicans' efforts and have indicated they will charge ahead with confirming Mr. Biden's judicial picks.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer stressed Tuesday that Democrats \"are not done yet,\" and said his party will do what it can to \"get as many judges confirmed as we can.\"",
      "\"Everyone should be prepared for another late night on Wednesday to vote on nominations and get as many judges done as possible,\" the New York Democrat said, adding that Republicans \"can try dilatory tactics but we're going to persist, as we showed last night, as we're persisting now.\"",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic whip who also chairs the Judiciary Committee, celebrated the judges brought forward by the committee over the last four years of Democratic control, noting that the vast majority of the judges that the Senate has considered are bipartisan, winning support from Republicans.",
      "But some Republicans didn't see them that way, such as Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, who argued that many of Mr. Biden's nominees \"are not qualified to be on the federal bench\" and called them \"activists.\"",
      "Still, Senate Republicans acknowledge that they can't block the judicial picks across the board as Trump has requested. Sen. Pete Ricketts, a Nebraska Republican, said that although Republicans would like to deliver on Trump's wishes, \"Democrats are in the majority, and even if we have all of our members here, we still can't prevent that, as long as they have all their members.\"",
      "\"So, we'll certainly try,\" Ricketts said.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 15:55:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Martin O'Malley and Ken Martin have both jumped in the race for DNC chair, while others are exploring runs.",
    "story": [
      "Two candidates have officially launched their campaign to be the next chair of the Democratic National Committee, kicking off the race to determine who will lead the party's recovery after widespread losses in 2024.",
      "Martin O'Malley, a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate and former Maryland Governor, became the first notable figure to jump into the race on Monday. Ken Martin, who is the chair of Minnesota's arm of the Democratic party, and a DNC vice chair, announced his campaign Tuesday morning.",
      "Democrats are sifting through the fallout of the 2024 presidential election, where they not only lost the White House and control of the Senate but also failed to win back control of the House. The party finds itself without a clear leader and unified vision for the future, representing both a hurdle for the next DNC chair but also an opportunity to overhaul Democrats' approach with voters across the country in the coming years.",
      "Whoever the party's over 440 members elect to lead the party's national committee will be in charge of the party's top-level infrastructure, organizing and fundraising. And while DNC members tell CBS News that the eventual chair won't determine the widespread policy of the party, that person will serve as a notable mouthpiece to help craft the Democratic message.",
      "While the party itself was locked out of federal control after the elections, fundraising remained strong. As a candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris raked in over $1 billion within the few months she was in the race. Her sum includes money raised by the DNC.",
      "Jamie Harrison, the current DNC chair, has said he would not seek reelection.",
      "The timeline for the election is not yet determined, though it will be addressed in a DNC Rules & Bylaws committee meeting on Dec. 12. DNC members expect the election itself to take place at their widespread member meeting before early spring 2025.",
      "In their launches, O'Malley and Martin both said prioritizing the party's message on the economy is essential. The state of the economy was a big issue that bolstered President-elect Donald Trump's return to office, according to a CBS News exit poll.",
      "\"When I'm traveling around the country, most people I chat with want the same things: to stay ahead on their bills, to give their families a better life and to live in safe and healthy communities. That's exactly what Democrats stand for, but we need to reconnect our ideas,\" Martin said in his campaign video.",
      "Chuck Rocha, a political strategist who worked for Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign and Sen-elect Ruben Gallego's campaign, told CBS News he is \"seriously considering\" a run for chair and has fielded calls from a handful of DNC members and nonprofits.",
      "Rocha said he's still waiting to see how the field develops before jumping in, and \"if there's a better candidate that really stands for what I want to see done with the party.\"",
      "But Rocha has set several action items he would take as chair: eliminate education requirements for senior DNC positions, mandating that state parties \"be more inclusive\" and diverse with consultant hiring, and to focus on building party infrastructure in all 50 states.",
      "Asked about Martin's and O'Malley's campaigns, Rocha called them \"names that are from the institution.\"",
      "\"I think we need somebody from the outside and a strategist to come in and rebuild the party,\" said Rocha, who noted that his non-college background and upbringing in East Texas could be an advantage as the party looks to reconnect with working-class voters.",
      "Other names that could potentially run include Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, who is \"seriously considering\" a run for chair according to a source familiar with his thinking.",
      "Rahm Emanuel, the current U.S. ambassador to Japan and former Chicago Mayor, is also mulling over a run according to Axios. But potentially choosing Emanuel, a polarizing figure in the Democratic party, has been panned by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and progressive groups.",
      "Martin, a DNC member since he became a state party chair in 2011, may be the early favorite. Alan Clendenin, an executive DNC board member who is already supporting Martin, said he has \"a lot of friends in the DNC\" and pointed to relationships built from his time as President of the Association of State Democratic Committees (ASDC). Clendenin said Martin already has support from just under 100 DNC committee members.",
      "\"The party is in a place where we have to have someone who has a really solid understanding of existing party infrastructure. What's there, what's not there. People who have walked the walk. Talked the talk. People who have had to deal with the frustration of what's lacking and be able to understand what it takes to turn things around,\" Clendenin said about Martin and the chair position.",
      "Democrats' lack of success in 2024 could linger over any of the candidates in the race. While Minnesota has been a reliably blue state under Martin's watch, it's not seen as a presidential battleground state. But if Democrats wanted to gravitate towards someone from any of the seven presidential battlegrounds, the fact that the Harris-Walz ticket lost every one of them may prove to be a hindrance for a party incredibly eager to avoid a repeat performance in 2028.",
      "\"We just need to win,\" said one DNC member about the stakes of the chair race. \"We need to know who's coming with the game plan to make it happen\u2026 We don't make policy. We win elections, and we win presidential elections. That's our priority.\"",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's six-year New York criminal odyssey\u00a0might need to continue for at least another four, prosecutors said Tuesday.",
      "Lawyers for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg wrote in a letter to Justice Juan Merchan that Trump should not be sentenced for his crimes until after he completes his second term in office. That would be the year 2029, more than a decade after the investigation into Trump's coverup of a \"hush money\" payment began.",
      "\"Consideration must be given to various non-dismissal options that may address any concerns raised by the pendency of a post-trial criminal proceeding during the presidency, such as deferral of all remaining criminal proceedings until after the end of defendant's upcoming presidential term,\" the filing said.",
      "Merchan had been slated to rule on Nov. 12 on whether presidential immunity should have prevented jurors from seeing certain evidence at Trump's trial this spring, but he postponed his decision. Merchan said he wanted to hear from prosecutors about how to proceed with the case, which entered uncharted terrain when Trump was reelected president.",
      "Prosecutors said in their filings that they intend to oppose any effort by Trump to dismiss his case outright. Trump's lawyers said in a previous letter that they would do so, claiming his election meant the case might cause \"unconstitutional impediments to President Trump's ability to govern.\"",
      "Prosecutors said in the short term, they are also unopposed to delaying Trump's sentencing, currently on the schedule for Nov. 26, while his attorneys awaiting and responding to his motion to dismiss.",
      "Trump is the first person in American history to win the presidency after being convicted of crimes. He was also the first former president to face trial for crimes.",
      "Trump promised minutes after a unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May to fight his conviction. Weeks later, the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts and that evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued the Supreme Court's ruling meant the conviction should be set aside, and his sentencing canceled. They said jurors heard testimony from former White House staff that should have been out of bounds during the trial. The legal team was led by Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who Trump has said he will appoint next year to senior posts in the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "Bragg's office has argued that the material protested by Trump's team was \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence the jury considered \u2013 so small it shouldn't mean tossing aside the jury's decision.",
      "The jury found that Trump committed 34 felonies, largely by authorizing a plan to conceal reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer. Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, days before the 2016 presidential election, in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump. The payment has often been referred to as a \"hush money\" payment.",
      "Trump insists he is not guilty of falsifying business records \u2014 the charge he was convicted on \u2014 and has vehemently denied Daniels' story.",
      "The Manhattan District Attorney's Office, then led by Cyrus Vance Jr., began investigating the \"hush money\" deal in 2018. It soon widened into an expansive probe into Trump's finances. Trump assailed the investigation during his first presidency, fighting a subpoena to the Supreme Court, which in a landmark 2020 decision allowed the office to get Trump's tax returns.",
      "When Bragg took office in 2022, he pared down the investigation, refocusing it on the \"hush money\" deal. A grand jury indicted Trump on March 31, 2023 and his trial began in April of this year.",
      "The seven-week trial ended with his conviction. The jury deliberated for less than two days.",
      "After hearing guilty 34 times, Trump turned around, clasped his son Eric's hand for a moment, and walked out of the courtroom.",
      "Prosecutors were still packing their briefcases as Trump's voice could be heard from just beyond the doors.",
      "He was decrying the case, and campaigning for a return to the White House.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced legislation Monday to change House rules to prohibit transgender women from using women's bathrooms and other facilities on Capitol Hill, a proposal that comes just before the House prepares to swear-in the first openly transgender member of Congress.",
      "Mace's two-page resolution would bar House members, officers and employees from using single-sex facilities in the Capitol or House office buildings that do not correspond with their biological sex. Her proposal claims that allowing biological males into women's restrooms, locker rooms and changing rooms \"jeopardizes the safety and dignity\" of female lawmakers, officers and Capitol Hill employees.",
      "The House sergeant-at-arms would be tasked with enforcing the measure, if approved.",
      "The South Carolina Republican's legislation appears to target Rep.-elect Sarah McBride of Delaware, who became the first openly transgender person elected to Congress when she won the race for the state's only House seat two weeks ago.",
      "McBride called Mace's resolution a \"blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing. We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars.\"",
      "\"Every day Americans go to work with people who have life journeys different than their own and engage with them respectfully, I hope members of Congress can muster that same kindness,\" she wrote on social media.",
      "But Mace attacked the \"radical left\" and claimed they are \"trying to erase women.\"",
      "\"Sarah McBride doesn't get a say in this,\" Mace said. \"This is a biological man trying to force himself into women's spaces, and I'm not going to tolerate.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged on Tuesday that the issue of restroom access for transgender lawmakers is one the lower chamber has not confronted before, but told reporters that the House would address it \"in deliberate fashion with member consensus on it, and we will accommodate the needs of every single person.\"",
      "Johnson said he would not \"engage in silly debates\" when asked whether McBride is a man or a woman.",
      "\"We welcome all new members with open arms who are duly elected representatives of the people,\" Johnson said. \"I believe it's a command that we treat all persons with dignity and respect, and we will, and I'm not going to engage in silly debates about this.\"",
      "He declined to say whether he plans to include Mace's proposal in a package of rules that will govern the next Congress.",
      "\"We don't look down upon anyone. We treat everybody with dignity and respect. That's a principle that I've pursued my whole life,\" he said. \"And we will take care of this issue of first impression for Congress as we will any other thing. We'll provide appropriate accommodation for every member of Congress.\"",
      "Johnson later sought to clarify his response about whether McBride is a man or a woman.",
      "\"A man is a man and a woman is a woman and a man cannot become a woman,\" he said. \"That said, I also believe \u2014 that's what Scripture teaches, what I just said \u2014 but I also believe that we treat everybody with dignity and so we can do and believe all those things at the same time.\"",

      "As commerce secretary, Lutnick, if confirmed, would be in charge of a sprawling Cabinet agency that is involved in funding new computer chip factories, imposing trade restrictions, releasing economic data and monitoring the weather. It is also a position in which connections to CEOs and the wider business community are crucial.",
      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick told CNBC in September that \"tariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker.\" During his campaign, Trump proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the U.S. imports.",
      "\"I think we'll make a bunch of money on the tariffs,\" Lutnick said, \"but mostly, everybody else is going to negotiate with us, and we will be more fair.\"",
      "Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.",
      "During the campaign, Trump campaign allies, including Lutnick, were asked about Project 2025, the\u00a0multi-pronged initiative\u00a0overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation that includes a detailed\u00a0blueprint\u00a0for the next Republican president to usher in a sweeping overhaul of the executive branch.",

      "\"I won't touch them. They made themselves nuclear,\" Lutnick said in September.",
      "Lutnick, who's worked on Wall Street for over 30 years, has been with Cantor Fitzgerald since 1983 and became its president and CEO when he was 29 years old, in 1996. On 9/11, Cantor Fitzgerald lost about two-thirds of its New York-based workforce in the terrorist attacks, 658 employees in all, including Lutnick's brother. Lutnick survived the attack because he was late to work that day, dropping off his young son at his first day of school. In the years since the attack, Lutnick and the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund have donated $180 million to 9/11 families, according to Trump's social media post on Lutnick's selection.",
      "Lutnick, who is also a cryptocurrency enthusiast, was also under consideration for treasury secretary, a role that has been at the center of high-profile jockeying within the Trump world. At the same time, the treasury position is closely watched in financial circles, where a disruptive nominee could have immediate negative consequences on the stock market, which Trump watches closely.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0An \"unknown and unauthorized third party\" has gained access to two dozen depositions of witnesses tied to the various investigations into former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, CBS News has learned.",
      "The leaked materials are part of a civil defamation case filed by Chris Dorworth, a lobbyist who is close to Gaetz. These materials include the sworn deposition of the minor with whom Gaetz allegedly had sex.",
      "According to a source familiar with the matter and an email viewed by CBS News, the person who gained access went by the name \"Altam Beezley.\"",
      "Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing.\u00a0The New York Times first reported on the alleged leak.",
      "Gaetz was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee and Justice Department, though federal prosecutors declined to bring charges against him last year. The Ethics panel was looking into allegations the former congressman engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other accusations. But Gaetz resigned his seat in the House last week after President-elect Donald Trump announced he had selected the Florida Republican to serve as his attorney general.",
      "Because Gaetz is no longer a House member, the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction over him has ended.",
      "Trump's announcement of Gaetz as his pick for attorney general came days before the ethics panel was set to convene to vote on whether to release a potentially damaging report detailing the findings of its investigation into the former congressman.",
      "The committee postponed the meeting, which was set for Friday, though two sources told CBS News that it is now set to gather Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson has cautioned against releasing the report on Gaetz, telling CNN on Sunday that the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction does not extend to non-members of Congress.",
      "But some lawmakers, including in the Senate, have said the public should have access to it. Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania, the top Democrat on the Ethics Committee, told reporters Monday that the panel's report should be made public and released to the Senate, which would vote after Trump takes office on whether to confirm Gaetz as attorney general.",
      "Wild said she believes the committee should vote on whether to disclose the report and estimates there is unanimous support from Democrats on the Ethics Committee to do so. But making the report public would require support from a majority of the panel, so at least one Republican would have to join their Democratic colleagues in voting to give the American people access.",
      "The House Ethics Committee launched into allegations of misconduct against Gaetz in April 2021, but deferred its consideration in response to a request from the Justice Department. It resumed its investigation in May 2023 after federal investigators declined to charge Gaetz following their sex-trafficking and obstruction probe.",
      "In June, the Ethics Committee said \"certain allegations merit continued review\" after it issued more than two dozen subpoenas and spoke with more than a dozen witnesses. The panel said it was looking into claims Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, gave \"special privileges and favors\" to people close to him and sought to obstruct government investigations into his conduct.",
      "The former congressman has denied any wrongdoing and has called the ethics investigation a \"smear.\" Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesman for Trump's transition, said in a statement Monday that \"Matt Gaetz will be the next Attorney General. He's the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration.\"",
      "A lawyer for two women who spoke with the Ethics Committee told CBS News on Monday that they testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and said Venmo transactions for the encounters were obtained by the panel.",
      "The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women told House investigators that Gaetz asked about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties via text messages, which was understood to be code for drugs. One of Leppard's clients testified before the Ethics Committee that she witnessed\u00a0 Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old against a game table during a July 2017 party, months after he was sworn in as a House member.",

      "WASHINGTON, D.C. (KDKA) \u2014 The House task force investigating the July 13\u00a0assassination attempt\u00a0on President-elect Donald Trump issued subpoenas on Monday to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for testimony from two ATF employees regarding the response to the Butler, Pennsylvania, shooting.",
      "The subpoenas follow letters from the task force's chairman, Rep. Mike Kelly, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Ranking Member Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado, seeking documents and testimony on Oct. 3 and Nov. 6.",
      "A shooter opened fire at Trump's July 13th rally in Butler, wounding Trump when a bullet grazed his ear. A rally-goer was killed and two others were wounded before Secret Service snipers shot and killed the gunman, later identified as a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man. Since then, Trump won the presidential election and will be headed to the White House in January.",
      "In a release from Kelly's office, the task force said the ATF had not produced any requested documents or made any personnel available for interviews with the task force, and the ATF made its first set of documents available less than an hour after served the subpoenas for depositions.",
      "One of the two subpoenas for depositions was issued to an agent who participated in the agency's response to the shooting in Butler, the release said. The other is for testimony from a supervisory agent, according to the media release.",
      "Excerpts from Kelly's letters to the two ATF employees stated that the task force \"specifically outlined seventeen requests for document production, even going so far as to note which were the priority items. In addition, the Task Force identified three categories of requests for transcribed interviews with relevant ATF agents.\"",
      "The bipartisan House task force said last month\u00a0that the incident was \"preventable,\" detailing in a report that there were communication and planning shortcomings.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 11:35:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The move by the president to adjourn Congress to make recess appointments would create a new precedent, experts say, affecting the way presidents see presidential power going forward.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has selected for some of the top roles in his administration controversial picks who may not win universal support from Republican senators. He can only afford to lose a few Republicans in the confirmation process, but he's opened the door to the possibility of forgoing the traditional route altogether, utilizing a Constitutional power known as recess appointments to effectively bypass the Senate \u2014 and swiftly approve his nominees.",
      "The possible strategy, raised by Trump in a post on social media last week, has generated mixed reviews among senators, who would stand to forfeit their key advice and consent role. And the president-elect made it something of a litmus test for Senate leadership as Republicans won majority control in the November elections.",
      "What is a recess appointment?",
      "Though the Senate is tasked with an advice and consent role in the confirmation process, the Constitution's Recess Appointment Clause affords the president the ability to temporarily fill vacancies while the Senate is in recess, and appointees may stay in the role until the end of the following session.",
      "The recess appointments power \"was built for a time when the Senate was not meeting year round,\" says Casey Burgat, the director of the Legislative Affairs Program at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.",
      "\"You were coming from all states, travel was a problem, and horses and carriages, and they would be out of session more often than they were in session,\" Burgat says. \" And so to ensure that the government can continue its work, they gave the president appointment power to name, within recess, someone to take the place.\"",
      "More recently, recess appointments have been used by presidents including President George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama \u2014 Bush and Clinton made over 100 recess appointments \u2014 although they were generally used to fill positions below the Cabinet level. In 2014, the Supreme Court weighed in on a challenge to a handful of Obama appointments, giving the Senate more authority to prevent the maneuver and determining that the chamber must be away for 10 days for recess appointments to occur.",
      "In recent years, the Senate has used pro-forma sessions to gavel in even when the chamber is on recess in part to avoid recess appointments. And paired with the elimination of a 60-vote threshold for nominees in 2013 \u2014 making it easier for the majority to make confirmations \u2014 recess appointments haven't been made in about a decade.",
      "But that could change in Trump's second term. Under the Constitution, both chambers have to agree to adjourn for three days or more. And at Trump's urging, House and Senate Republicans, who are set to narrowly control both chambers in the new Congress, may agree to do so.",
      "Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who last week was elected to serve as Senate majority leader in the new Congress, said \"all options are on the table\" to swiftly approve Trump's nominees after he takes office, including recess appointments. He's suggested that while the typical confirmation process is preferred, if Senate Democrats obstruct the confirmation proceedings, Republicans may have to resort to other options.",
      "Still, pushback from just a handful of Republicans who oppose the recess appointment effort \u2014\u00a0 which would undermine their ability to study nominees, request documents and have a hearing \u2014 could block the move to put the chamber in recess. But experts say Trump could move to adjourn Congress anyway.",
      "Could Trump adjourn Congress to make recess appointments?",
      "The Constitution outlines that a president may adjourn the House and Senate in the case of \"Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment.\" So if one chamber approves a resolution to adjourn and the other votes it down, Trump could theoretically weigh in and declare Congress in recess.",
      "But some experts say that what constitutes a disagreement between the chambers could be interpreted differently, due to the unprecedented nature of the approach, questioning whether a simple lack of action from one chamber after the other approves a resolution to adjourn may be viewed as disagreement.",
      "\"It's not clear at all how this would work,\" says Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, noting that the issue is something that almost certainly would result in litigation.",
      "Glassman said in a scenario where the House tries to force the Senate out of session to make recess appointments, \"it's not clear to me the court is going to like the idea of the president and the House conspiring to end run the Senate on nominations.\"",
      "Trump is \"threatening to turn the Constitution's appointment process for Cabinet officers on its head\" with the recess appointments strategy, Edward Whelan, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, warned in an op-ed in the Washington Post. He urged that House Speaker Mike Johnson, who would be a key player in Trump's ability to unilaterally adjourn Congress, \"can and should immediately put an end to this scheme.\"",
      "But Johnson on Sunday left the door open to the strategy, saying on Fox News when asked whether he would take steps to put Congress in recess that a president should be able to \"choose his team,\" and \"if this thing bogs down, it would be a great detriment to the country.\" But he acknowledged that he's \"very hopeful\" the Senate will do its job and move the nominees along.",
      "The move by the president to adjourn Congress to make recess appointments would create a new precedent, experts say, affecting the way presidents see presidential power going forward.",
      "\"When they may see a power deferred to them, they're very reluctant to give it back going forward,\" Burgat says. \"The minute you cross the red line, all of a sudden, that red line looks like it didn't matter at all in the first place.\"",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump announced he selected former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Ethics Committee is set to meet Wednesday as it faces increasing pressure to release a potentially damaging report detailing its investigation into allegations former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, two sources told CBS News.",
      "The movements of the Ethics panel have been under heightened scrutiny since President-elect Donald Trump announced last week that he had selected Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The Florida Republican resigned his seat in the House in the wake of the announcement, which ended the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction over Gaetz since he is now a former member.",
      "The Ethics Committee declined to comment on the upcoming meeting. The panel was supposed to meet Friday to vote on releasing the report, but Trump tapped Gaetz for the nation's top law enforcement officer days earlier. The committee then postponed its meeting.",
      "Gaetz must win Senate confirmation to serve as attorney general, and senators have been calling to see the Ethics Committee's report as they weigh whether to approve his nomination. Any confirmation hearings, which would be conducted by the Senate Judiciary Committee, would not take place until next year after Trump is inaugurated. Republicans will gain control of the upper chamber in the next Congress, which begins Jan. 3.",
      "Ethics Committee chairman Michael Guest told CBS News he spoke with Speaker Mike Johnson about his panel's report, but said Johnson did not try to weigh in on its release.",
      "\"He just wanted to let me know that he made a statement publicly and wanted me to be aware of that. And he reiterated that he believed that the report should not be released,\" Guest, a Republican from Mississippi, said.",
      "The committee's top Democrat, Rep. Susan Wild, said the report should be made public and \"certainly\" released to the Senate.",
      "\"I think it should be released to the public, as we have done with many other investigative reports in the past,\" she told reporters Monday. \"There is precedent for releasing even after a member has resigned.\"",
      "Wild, of Pennsylvania, said she believes the committee should vote on whether to disclose the report and estimates there is unanimous support from Democrats to do so. But making the report public would require support from a majority of the committee, so at least one Republican would have to join their Democratic colleagues in voting to give the American people access.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told reporters last week that he believes senators should have access to the Ethics Committee's findings.",
      "\"I think there should not be any limitations on the Senate Judiciary Committee's investigation, including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated,\" said Cornyn, who sits on the Judiciary Committee.",
      "GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, a Trump ally, similarly told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that he believes the Senate should be able to see the report on Gaetz.",
      "\"Congress has to advise and consent, and Matt Gaetz is going to go through the same scrutiny as every other individual, and I'm going to give him a fair shot, just like every individual, and at the end of the day, the Senate has to confirm him,\" he said.",
      "But House Speaker Mike Johnson has cautioned against the release of the report by the Ethics Committee, warning in an interview Sunday that doing so for someone who is not a current House member \"would be a Pandora's box.\"",
      "\"What I have said with regard to the report is that it should not come out. And why? Because Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress. He is no longer a member,\" Johnson told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"There's a very important protocol and tradition and rule that we maintain that the House Ethics Committee's jurisdiction does not extend to non-members of Congress.\"",
      "The House Ethics Committee first began its investigation into allegations of misconduct against Gaetz in April 2021, but deferred its consideration in response to a request from the Justice Department. It resumed its investigation in May 2023 after federal investigators declined to charge Gaetz following their sex-trafficking and obstruction probe.",
      "Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing and blamed the ethics probe on former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. He has called the investigation a \"smear.\" The Florida congressman helped lead the historic effort to strip McCarthy\u00a0of the speaker's gavel last year.",
      "The ethics panel said in June that it had spoken with more than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas and reviewed thousands of pages of documents as part of its investigation into Gaetz, and determined that \"certain allegations merit continued review.\"",
      "The committee said it was examining accusations Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, gave \"special privileges and favors\" to people close to him and sought to obstruct government investigations into his conduct.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News at the time that four women told the Ethics Committee that they had been paid to go to parties, which Gaetz attended, that included sex and drugs. The panel has the Florida Republican's Venmo transactions that allegedly show payments for the women. One woman who testified to the Ethics Committee said she had sex with Gaetz at a party in 2017, just after he was elected to Congress and when she was 17 years old, sources told CBS News at the time",
      "Her lawyer, John Clune, said on social media last week that she was a high school student and \"there were witnesses.\"",
      "\"We would support the House Ethics Committee immediately releasing their report,\" Clune wrote.",

      "The five-person commission will have a 3-2 Democratic majority until next year, when Trump will get to appoint a new member, The Associated Press points out, adding that Carr has also been the commission's general counsel and was confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times and nominated by both Trump and President Biden to the commission.",

      "Carr opposed that decision. \"In my view, it amounted to nothing more than regulatory lawfare against one of the left's top targets: Mr. Musk,\" he wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion article last month.",
      "Carr was a strong foe of the FCC's reinstatement in April of net neutrality rules that were repealed during the first Trump administration. The Biden administration's FCC rules were in turn put on hold by a federal appeals court.",

The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women testified that Gaetz inquired in text messages about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties, which was understood to be code for drugs.",
      "Leppard, who is based in Orlando, said his clients testified that they attended parties from 2017 to January 2019 where Gaetz was present and sex and drug use took place. In an interview Monday with CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett, Leppard said one of his clients testified before the House Ethics Committee that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old girl against a game table at a July 2017 party. Gaetz was sworn into Congress in January 2017, so all of the events the women allege took place while he was a member of the House.",
      "Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing, including having sex with a minor. After CBS News published its initial\u00a0story and it aired on \"CBS Evening News,\" Trump transition spokesman Alex Pfeiffer said in a statement, \"Matt Gaetz will be the next Attorney General. He's the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration.\"",
      "\"The Biden Justice Department investigated Gaetz for years and cleared him of wrongdoing,\" Pfeiffer added, \"The only people who went to prison over these allegations were those lying about Matt Gaetz.\" Federal prosecutors did investigate Gaetz but ended the probe in 2023 without filing charges.",

      "\"My clients are not political; they didn't vote in the last two elections \u2014 they don't care one way or another,\" Leppard told Garrett. \"But they do want the public to know that they are not lying. They did not come forward willingly \u2014 they have never spoken to anyone without a force of a legal subpoena.\"",

Her account corroborates the testimony of the then-minor, who told the committee that she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17 years old.",
      "At the July 2017 party where his client alleges this occurred, Leppard said she and others were \"at the party in order to provide entertainment, to be happy, to be lively and provide sexual favors for the gentlemen that were present.\"",
      "\"The expectation was that they would have sexual intercourse,\" Leppard said his clients testified about these parties. \"They testified to the House that \u2014 and the House actually had their Venmo transactions, PayPal transactions, of Representative Gaetz.\"",

On at least one occasion, according to Leppard, that was Nestor Galban, a Cuban immigrant who is close to Gaetz and whom Gaetz has referred to as his \"son.\" He said other payments on Gaetz's behalf were made by Gaetz associate Joel Greenberg, who was convicted in 2022 of sex trafficking of a minor and other crimes.",
      "Leppard said his client who testified that she saw Gaetz having sex with the 17-year-old also told the panel she did not believe Gaetz was aware of her age at the time.",
      "\"My client, at least, testified that he did not know her age,\" Leppard said.",
      "Leppard's client testified that she knew the 17-year-old girl and her age, and said the two attended high school together.",
      "His client testified that she had sex with Gaetz after arriving at the July 2017 house party. Later during the party, his client testified, she was walking outside when she saw Gaetz having sex with her friend, the 17-year-old, against the gaming table.",
      "Leppard said one of his clients provided more than 100 texts involving Gaetz to the committee. Frequently, Leppard said, the texts his client provided showed Gaetz would have to be reminded to pay.",
      "\"There was a lot of texts requesting payment, like, 'Hey, when are you going to pay me?'\" Leppard said. \"Or, 'I don't want to be that girl, but can you please go ahead and pay me what we agreed upon?' Text messages along those lines. The texts the House was more interested in was the ones where Representative Gaetz was seemingly requesting that drugs be present.\"",
      "\"So, in my line of work as a criminal defense attorney, no one ever requests, 'Can you give me some drugs, please?'\" Leppard said. \"They usually use code words. And so Representative Gaetz would use terms like, 'Can you make sure that there are party favors present?' Or, 'Who's in charge of party favors?' He used the term 'party favor mecca' when he was referring to another individual who was bringing party favors. He also used the term 'vitamins,' I believe.\"",
      "Still, Leppard's clients told the House panel they could not specifically recall whether they had seen Gaetz use marijuana or other drugs.",
      "The texts also included a \"lot of positive emojis,\" Leppard said, like hearts, and \"positive statements\" back and forth between Gaetz, his clients and others. Leppard characterized the relationship with Gaetz as a complicated one, but also one of friendship, and he also told Garrett that his clients knew Gaetz's girlfriend at the time.",
      "\"At least one of my clients testified that, in a sense, they were required to please Mr. Gaetz before going out and attending their [Electronic Dance Music] show,\" Leppard said of one alleged occasion about which his client testified. \"And that was something that was of particular interest to the House. Representative Gaetz's girlfriend texted them, and they essentially took care of their duties, and later on, they went to see their show.\"",
      "Leppard said his clients have \"been through heck\" and are worried that if they testify before the Senate or anywhere else publicly, \"they might not be safe in their jobs.\"",
      "The House Ethics Committee had planned to vote Friday, Nov. 15, on releasing its report, but the meeting was canceled after Trump announced his intention Wednesday to nominate Gaetz, and then a few hours later, the Florida Republican abruptly resigned from Congress. The panel is now set to meet Wednesday, two sources told CBS News.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday he would \"strongly request\" that the House Ethics Committee withhold the report on its investigation into Gaetz. The committee has equal representation among Democrats and Republicans \u2014 five Democrats and five Republicans.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump said Monday he is naming former Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy as his nominee for transportation secretary, as he continues to roll out picks for his Cabinet.",
      "Duffy is a former reality TV star who was one of Trump's most visible defenders on cable news \u2014 a prime concern for the media-focused president-elect. Duffy served in the House for nearly nine years, was a member of the Financial Services Committee and chairman of the subcommittee on insurance and housing. He left Congress in 2019, and is co-host of \"The Bottom Line\" on Fox Business.",
      "In his announcement, Trump noted that Duffy is married to a Fox News host, calling him \"the husband of a wonderful woman, Rachel Campos-Duffy, a STAR on Fox News.\"",
      "Duffy is so far the second Fox-affiliated television host that Trump has named to his Cabinet. Trump last week announced his choice of Fox News host Pete Hegseth to serve as his defense secretary.",
      "Trump said Duffy would use his experience and relationships built over the years in Congress \"to maintain and rebuild our Nation's Infrastructure, and fulfill our Mission of ushering in The Golden Age of Travel, focusing on Safety, Efficiency, and Innovation. Importantly, he will greatly elevate the Travel Experience for all Americans!\"",
      "Duffy in 2022 ruled out a run for Wisconsin governor despite pleas from Trump to make a bid, saying he needed to care for his nine children, including his youngest child who had a heart condition.",
      "He is a former lumberjack athlete and frequent Fox News contributor. He was featured on MTV's \"The Real World: Boston\" in 1997. He met his wife on the set of MTV's \"Road Rules: All Stars\" in 1998.",
      "A reality television background before politics is not unusual in Trump's world. The former president launched his political career after his hit reality show, \"The Apprentice.\"",
      "Duffy, after his time on reality television, worked as a special prosecutor and Ashland County district attorney. He won election to Congress as part of a tea party wave in 2010.",
      "When he first ran for office, Duffy was largely considered an underdog but attracted national attention for his campaign ads, in which he donned a red flannel shirt and chopped trees. He told voters he came from a \"long line of lumberjacks\" and would bring his axe to Washington.",
      "He served until resigning in 2019.",
      "The Transportation Department oversees the nation's complex transportation system, including pipelines, railroads, cars, trucks, the airlines and mass transit systems as well as federal funding for highways.",
      "If confirmed, Duffy would take over at a time of tremendous change, especially on the nation's highways. Traffic deaths remain near record highs at a time when new technologies are being introduced that could help make the roads safer. Multiple companies are deploying autonomous robotaxis and even driverless semis with no specific federal regulations. And the nascent move from gasoline to electric vehicles presents safety problems of its own, especially with battery fires that can be difficult to extinguish.",
      "The department includes the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates automakers, including Elon Musk's Tesla. The department sets fuel economy standards for cars and trucks and regulates the airline industry through the Federal Aviation Administration, which is grappling with a shortage of air traffic controllers to ensure the safe and orderly flow of air travel.",
      "Nicholas Calio, president and CEO of Airlines for America, said the association was \"thrilled\" by the choice of Duffy.",
      "\"Congressman Duffy has a proven track record for getting things done, and we are eager to collaborate with him on key issues impacting the U.S. airline industry,\" Calio said.",
      "Trump has criticized electric vehicles as expensive and unreliable and called President Joe Biden's policy to promote them \"lunacy. He also has said EV manufacturing will destroy auto industry jobs and has falsely claimed that battery-powered cars don't work in cold weather and are unable to travel long distances.",
      "Trump has softened his rhetoric about electric vehicles in recent months after Musk endorsed him and campaigned heavily for his election.",
      "Even so, industry officials expect Trump to try to slow a shift to electric cars, and a tax credit for EV purchases is reportedly among those the Trump administration may seek to eliminate next year.",
      "Trump, in his statement, said Duffy would \"prioritize Excellence, Competence, Competitiveness and Beauty when rebuilding America's highways, tunnels, bridges and airports.\" Trump, as he campaigned for the White House, would sometimes complain about the state of air travel in particular, lamenting that the nation's \"once-revered airports\" are a \"dirty, crowded mess.\"",

    "summary": "Trump has indicated that the revelations about the accuser and payment have not deterred him from Hegseth's selection as defense secretary.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to serve as defense secretary, paid a confidential financial settlement to a woman who accused him of sexual assault out of concern that the allegation would lead to his firing from the cable news giant, his lawyer told CBS News.",
      "Hegseth's attorney, Timothy Parlatore, said the Army veteran reached a confidential settlement agreement to deter his accuser from going forward with a lawsuit, maintaining that he is innocent and the sexual encounter was consensual. Hegseth denies any wrongdoing.",
      "\"The reality is that, had they filed [a lawsuit], civil process takes quite a while, and so Fox News likely would have fired him based on the allegation,\" said Parlatore, adding that the woman and her attorney \"knew that simply filing it would cause an immediate horror storm for [Hegseth].\"",
      "Fox News Media said in a statement Monday it \"was not made aware of the incident or the settlement.\"",
      "Trump's transition team spoke with Parlatore after Hegseth was named as Trump's nominee defense secretary, the attorney said. He said that he \"explained this fully\" to them but that he did not know what prior conversations Hegseth had with the transition team, or if they had been informed about the sexual assault allegation and settlement agreement before the announcement of his impending nomination for defense secretary.",
      "\"This should have nothing to do with the confirmation process,\" he said.",
      "Trump has indicated that these revelations have not deterred him from Hegseth's selection as defense secretary. After reports surfaced of the sexual assault accusation, Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said, \"President Trump is nominating high-caliber and extremely qualified candidates to serve in his Administration. Mr. Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed.\"",
      "The alleged sexual assault took place after midnight on Oct. 8, 2017, at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa. The woman, whose identity has been kept confidential, filed a complaint with the Monterey Police Department four days later alleging that she had been sexually assaulted by Hegseth. The city of Monterey confirmed the 2017 investigation into Hegseth and said in a statement that investigators found the woman had \"contusions\" on her right thigh. No charges were filed, Parlatore said.",
      "The Washington Post, which first reported the financial payment, obtained what it referred to as a memo that was sent to the Trump transition team by a friend of the accuser alleging Hegseth raped a conservative group staffer in his room after drinking at the hotel bar. According to the Post, the memo states that the day after the incident, the accuser \"had a moment of hazy memory of being raped the night before, and had a panic attack.\"",
      "CBS News has not seen the memo and cannot verify its contents.",
      "Parlatore told CBS News that there is eyewitness testimony and video surveillance footage that allegedly shows the accuser was the \"aggressor\" in a consensual sexual encounter. \"[Hegseth] was intoxicated. She was sober. She was the one grabbing him by the arm and leading him out of the bar to take him upstairs,\" he said.",
      "When asked if CBS News could view the footage, Parlatore said, \"No.\" He also declined to share the names of any eyewitnesses.",
      "CNN reported that it spoke with the alleged victim last week, who \"became visibly distraught at the mention of Hegseth's name.\" CNN says she declined to be interviewed at the time and then stopped responding.",
      "Parlatore would not share the exact timing of the settlement payment to the woman. He said it occurred \"a couple years ago,\" emphasizing that it was \"well before Trump was even nominated [for the presidency], let alone had named Pete to this position.\"",
      "He also declined to disclose the amount of the settlement, only saying it was \"far, far less than what she wanted.\" He characterized it as \"essentially an extortion and blackmail.\"",
      "Two years after the alleged incident, Parlatore said that Hegseth was informed the woman was making what they called \"false claims\" against him and was threatening to sue him. Parlatore said that she had lost her job and claimed she needed money. In February of 2020, he sent her a cease-and-desist letter. She went \"quiet for a year\" before he learned she had found an attorney for her case.",
      "Trump's selection of Hegseth has been plagued with controversy. The announcement that the Fox News personality was his choice for secretary of Defense took many in Washington by surprise. \"Wow,\" responded Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski upon learning he had been picked to lead the Defense Department. \"I just said, wow,\" she repeated when asked for her thoughts.",
      "Even Hegseth's\u00a0tattoos have attracted scrutiny, specifically the \"Deux Vult\" tattoo on his inner bicep. The symbolism of that tattoo, which has been tied to extremist groups and the Christian Crusaders, alarmed a member of Hegseth's National Guard unit, who warned superiors that Hegseth was a potential \"insider threat\" before President Joe Biden's inauguration. He was removed from guarding the inauguration.",
      "After The Associated Press reported Hegseth had been flagged as a threat, Vice President-elect JD Vance defended him on social media, accusing the outlet of \"attacking Pete Hegseth for having a Christian motto tattooed on his arm.\"\u00a0Hegseth then shared Vance's tweet, commenting, \"They can target me \u2014 I don't give a damn \u2014 but this type of targeting of Christians, conservatives, patriots and everyday Americans will stop on DAY ONE at DJT's DoD.\"",
      "The news of Hegseth's financial settlement agreement with a confidentiality clause may ring familiar to Trump. The president-elect's own troubles related to a nondisclosure agreement with adult film star Stormy Daniels led to the New York trial in which he became a convicted felon, as well as the first former (and now future) president to be criminally prosecuted.",
      "Trump was found\u00a0guilty on 34 counts\u00a0of falsifying business records related to an alleged cover-up of the payment to Daniels. He has argued that the verdict should be overturned and the indictment dismissed on the basis, among other things, of the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling.",

      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s concerns about the health effects of fluoride may already be helping some Americans \u2014 investors in dental services companies.",
      "Shares in Dentsply Sirona, Envista, Henry Schein Patterson Companies, and other providers of dental products are jumping, with Wall Street betting that a potential push by the incoming Trump administration to remove fluoride from the nation's drinking water could spur demand for the companies' services.",
      "Kennedy, tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said on social media just ahead of the November 5 presidential election that Trump would rid fluoride from the public water supply on his first day in office. Kennedy, a noted vaccine skeptic, has described fluoride as an \"industrial waste\" and linked it to arthritis, neurological deficiencies in children and other serious health problems.",
      "\"The thought here is RFK will bring to HHS a voice that is in favor of reducing, or eliminating, the amount of fluoridation that is added to drinking water,\" Don Bilson, Gordon Haskett's head of event-driven research, told investors in a report, according to\u00a0NBC News. \"This will, in turn, lead to an acceleration of tooth decay and more dental visits.\"",
      "Dental experts have largely refuted such claims. Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0on November 13 that there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years showing that fluoride is both safe, and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",
      "According to\u00a0KFF Health News, some studies have linked fluoride exposure among pregnant women to a higher risk of childhood neurobehavioral problems and lower IQs, leading experts to call for further research.",

    "summary": "Kennedy insists he is not \"anti-vaccine,\" but he has a long record of false and misleading statements\u200b about their safety and benefits. What could he do as Trump's HHS secretary?",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could wield significant authority to directly affect how and whether Americans get vaccines\u00a0nationwide, current and former federal health officials say, if he is confirmed next year to head the Department of Health and Human Services under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The position would grant Kennedy authority over efforts like the Vaccines for Children program, which is estimated to have saved 1.1 million lives by immunizing children against diseases like polio and measles that are now rare thanks to the shots.",
      "Many public health experts have decried the pick, saying Kennedy's past claims about vaccines are disqualifying.",
      "\"A serious candidate for this position would follow the decades of real-world evidence that shows that vaccines are safe and prevent as many as 5 million deaths each year,\" Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said Monday in a statement.",
      "Is RFK Jr. anti-vaccine?",
      "Kennedy has insisted he is not \"anti-vaccine\" and promised not to try to ban the shots under the Trump administration \u2014 but he has a long record of making misleading statements about vaccines and fanning doubts about their proven benefits and safety.",
      "He wrote a now-retracted article in 2005 falsely claiming autism was linked to a discontinued ingredient in vaccines, and continues to say he thinks vaccines are a cause of autism, which decades of scientific research has thoroughly discredited.",
      "On social media, Kennedy called COVID shots \"a crime against humanity\" and claimed children did not need COVID vaccines. (Research\u00a0estimates\u00a0that COVID vaccines prevented 3.2 million deaths in the U.S. through 2022.)",
      "The group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, has been denounced by experts for being among the most prolific spreaders of misinformation about vaccines.",
      "In recent months, Kennedy has\u00a0said his goal is to \"provide Americans with transparency and access to all the data so they can make informed choices.\" He also wants to clean house at federal health agencies, ousting \"corrupt\" officials he claims have clouded \"their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.\"",
      "The head of the FDA's vaccines program says he hopes Kennedy will \"keep an open mind\" about what the science shows.",
      "\"Perhaps engaging in that dialogue, especially if it's in a public venue, it may help. It may help bring some of the rest of the country along because sometimes as somebody is convinced, perhaps, maybe some of the rest of the country will be,\" Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said earlier this month.",
      "CDC recommendations and covering costs",
      "One of the biggest roles that the CDC plays in vaccinations is in deciding which vaccines health insurers are required to cover. Nearly all plans are required by law to cover routine shots that are recommended by the agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.",
      "Updating that \"schedule\" of routinely recommended vaccines is usually a monthslong process for the committee, which is made up of medical experts who work to publicly analyze and vote on the benefits and risks of different shots.",
      "Those meetings happen at least three times every year, as the committee debates newly approved vaccines, annual updates to routine shots like influenza or COVID-19 and reevaluating the data on older immunizations.",
      "\"They incorporate epidemiology. Which groups are most affected? Are there certain subgroups that it is most effective for? Are there some groups that may not benefit very much from a certain vaccine,\" said Dr. Carolyn Bridges, the CDC's former associate director for adult immunizations.",
      "Bridges, who now works as a consultant on adult vaccinations, praised the \"very public discussion and often very rigorous debate\" among the experts selected to serve on the committee.",
      "The CDC's career civil servants are traditionally able to offer input into which experts are chosen for the panel, and federal law says the committee's membership should be \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view.\"",
      "But, it will be Kennedy's decision alone to decide who sits on the committee. Kennedy's pick to head the CDC would also have the authority to override the panel's votes, as was done in 2021 to roll out some COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "The panel's recommendations have a wide impact beyond insurance coverage, Bridges said, influencing how doctors and local health departments talk about and offer the shots.",
      "Kennedy and his pick to head the CDC could also affect the agency's wide-ranging immunization work in other ways.",
      "For example, the agency is responsible for the Vaccines for Children program that supplies shots to pediatricians nationwide to ensure no-cost access for uninsured children. It also routinely steps in to sort out any confusion among providers over vaccine recommendations.",
      "The CDC also runs the main national data sources tracking immunization rates, vaccine effectiveness for some common shots and ongoing monitoring of vaccine safety.",
      "\"It's really the integration of all of those things. There's a lot that goes into this \u2014 the policy, the monitoring, the coordination, the communication,\" Bridges said.",
      "FDA approvals and regulations",
      "Kennedy and whoever he picks to lead the FDA would also play a big role in both the approval of vaccines and in regulating them after they are on the market.",
      "Decisions on whether to approve or reject applications from vaccine makers are traditionally left up to career scientists working in the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. That is mostly ensured only by norms, not law.",
      "\"It's totally within the law for the president or the HHS secretary to overrule the entire FDA. And so, that could happen. Did it happen to me? No. But I also want to say, I think the view that there's a sharp line between the political and scientific, we got to speak truthfully about this,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said Nov. 11, speaking at an event hosted by the Friends of Cancer Research.",
      "Califf said that \"99.95% of FDA decisions about individual products\" are made by civil servants with scientific expertise in the field. But the commissioner is sometimes forced to step in, like to resolve internal disagreements or appeals from outside the agency.",
      "Kennedy and his FDA commissioner could also influence vaccines in other ways, like through guidance the agency issues to manufacturers seeking approval.",
      "Policy changes recommended by the agency's staff can be stalled or rejected by political leaders. Major changes to FDA's rules are also funneled through the White House, which has the ability to block them.",
      "\"There's so many other aspects of this that are integrated in various ways with politics. And there's just no way around it,\" Califf said.",
      "Communicating risks and benefits",
      "Beyond Kennedy's direct authority over vaccines, another major way he and his picks to head the CDC and FDA could influence public opinion is through how they approach talking to Americans about the risks and benefits of vaccines.",
      "The department funds a number of efforts to survey public confidence in vaccines and study ways to improve it. They also run a number of campaigns to promote recommended shots, like advertising about the annual COVID-19 and flu vaccines or helping health departments respond to backsliding immunization rates in schools.",
      "\"We don't have to remember too far back to see what happens because of vaccination rates, when there aren't requirements and people don't have access,\" said Bridges, citing a polio case that emerged in New York in 2022.",
      "Outbreaks of polio once killed thousands of Americans and left many survivors paralyzed, until the disease was virtually eliminated in the U.S. by vaccines that first rolled out in the 1950s.",
      "The return of polio prompted an investigation by health authorities and a renewed push for vaccinations, though officials acknowledged they struggled to \"meaningfully increase\" immunization coverage.",
      "\"That's just mind-boggling that we can have a polio resurgence, in a country with all of our resources. It doesn't take all that much for diseases still circulating in other places to retake hold,\" said Bridges.",
      "Another way the communications role comes up is in navigating how to explain potential risks flagged by federal vaccine safety systems to doctors and the public.",
      "An example last year came after the FDA and CDC officials worked to craft a bulletin disclosing early concerns that COVID-19 shots might be increasing the risk of stroke for seniors, while also explaining why the preliminary \"safety signal\" did not warrant stopping use of the shots.",
      "Intense scrutiny of the issue by the U.S. and health authorities overseas eventually found \"no evidence of a safety concern,\" though health authorities continue to closely study the issue.",
      "The benefits of the vaccine continue to far outweigh this theoretical risk, the CDC's advisers concluded, especially among seniors who are at higher risk of severe illness or death from COVID.",
      "\"The current evidence does not support the existence of a safety issue. FDA and CDC will continue to evaluate data as they are available and update the public as needed,\" the FDA said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet and senior staff picks are facing an uncertain future as his selections received mixed reviews in recent days even from fellow Republicans \u2014 and a handful sent shockwaves through Washington.",
      "Trump's selection for attorney general in former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a GOP firebrand who was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of sexual misconduct and obstruction, has drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle. And Trump's pick for defense secretary in Pete Hegseth, an Army combat veteran and former Fox News anchor, has also sparked concerns, especially as an investigation into sexual assault allegations against him has been made public. Additionally, former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, doesn't have a background in intelligence and has drawn criticism for her views on Russia and other U.S. adversaries.",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut expressed astonishment about those questioning whether experience is necessary when asked about Gabbard, saying \"of course it's necessary.\"",
      "\"These people are manifestly unqualified, and you know, they're not prepared to run the very complicated organizations they've been asked to run,\" Himes said.",
      "But Himes, the ranking Democrat on the the House Intelligence Committee, said that Gaetz's qualifications should also examined as well as the unreleased House Ethics Committee report.",
      "\"How is it that this is what we're focusing on?\" Himes said. \"Matt Gaetz is, by any standard, completely unqualified to be the Attorney General, and yet we're sort of focused on this, you know, cherry on the cupcake of the Ethics report.\"",
      "Gaetz' resignation from Congress after Trump's announcement came days ahead of a planned meeting and vote by the House Ethics Committee on whether to release a report on its investigation into Gaetz. Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday that he would \"strongly request\" that committee withhold the potentially damaging report.",
      "Rep. French Hill, an Arkansas Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said Johnson makes \"an important point,\" warning that \"we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.\" But he stressed that the decision is the committee's alone, while noting that on Trump's selections, the Senate will exercise its advise and consent role through the confirmation process.",
      "\"President Trump has the prerogative to nominate the people that he thinks can best lead the change that he believes the American people are seeking in each of the agencies of the federal government,\" Hill said.",
      "The Arkansas Republican outlined that when Trump came to office in 2017, there were members of his Cabinet who he had no personal relationship with or working background.",
      "\"He wants to correct that this time by finding people that he has a good working relationship with. He knows how they think, they know how he thinks, because he thinks it will lead to better decision making in his administration,\" Hill said.",
      "For his part, Himes offered some praise to some of Trump's other picks.",
      "\"I actually had a really good day when Marco Rubio was nominated for Secretary of State, when John Ratcliffe was nominated for CIA and when Mike Waltz was nominated to be national security adviser,\" Ratcliffe said. \"Those are good nominations, not necessarily the nominations I would have made if I were president, but these are serious people with real experience.\"",
      "Still, he cautioned Republicans in the Senate as the confirmation process plays out, saying that he understands \"what happens to Republicans who stand up to Donald Trump,\" but \"history is a harsh judge.\"",
      "\"The Republican senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump,\" Himes said.",
      "Sue Gordon, who served as principal deputy director of national intelligence under Trump and also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, stressed that vetting will be critical to the process moving forward, amid a New York Times\u00a0report\u00a0that Trump's team may bypass the typical FBI procedure and instead opt to use a private firm to vet his nominees who would be granted security clearances.",
      "\"It seems expedient, but I think it will ultimately harm the institution,\" Gordon said, noting that a private firm won't have the same standards. \"I know it's inconvenient, but I think it's a bad strategy and risky for America.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that assists with presidential transitions, confirmed to CBS News that the Trump team hasn't signed paperwork that allows for security clearances and background checks, among other things, to occur. Gordon said she can't think of a \"good reason\" for the Trump team to forego the transition paperwork, saying that \"one of the great falsehoods that's been perpetrated on America is that our institutions are malfeasant.\"",
      "\"You're not protecting anybody by not signing those papers, and especially some of the nominees we have that don't have the really deep experience base,\" Gordon said. \"To start your gig without any foundation at all, especially when the institutions are begging to give you that foundation, just seems wrong-headed.\"",

      "Parts of the Great Barrer Reef have suffered the highest coral mortality on record, Australian research showed Tuesday, with scientists fearing the rest of it has suffered a similar fate.",
      "The Australian Institute of Marine Science said surveys of 12 reefs found up to 72 percent coral mortality, thanks to a summer of mass bleaching, two cyclones, and flooding.",
      "In one northern section of the reef, about a third of hard coral had died, the \"largest annual decline\" in 39 years of government monitoring, the agency said.",
      "Often dubbed the world's largest living structure, the Great Barrier Reef is a 1,400-mile expanse of tropical corals that house a stunning array of biodiversity.",
      "But repeated mass bleaching events have threatened to rob the tourist drawcard of its wonder, turning banks of once-vibrant corals into a sickly shade of white.",
      "Bleaching occurs when water temperatures rise and the coral expels microscopic algae, known as zooxanthellae, to survive.",
      "If high temperatures persist, the coral can eventually turn white and die.",
      "This year had already been confirmed as the fifth mass bleaching on the reef in the past eight years.",
      "But this latest survey also found a rapid-growing type of coral -- known as acropora -- had suffered the highest rate of death.",
      "This coral is quick to grow, but one of the first to bleach.",
      "Lead researcher Mike Emslie told public broadcaster ABC the past summer was \"one of the most severe events\" across the Great Barrier Reef, with heat stress levels surpassing previous events.",
      "\"These are serious impacts. These are serious losses,\" he said.",
      "World Wildlife Fund-Australia's head of oceans, Richard Leck, said the initial surveys confirmed his \"worst fears.\"",
      "\"The Great Barrier Reef can bounce back but there are limits to its resilience,\" he said. \"It can't get repeatedly hammered like this. We are fast approaching a tipping point.\"",
      "Leck added the area surveyed was \"relatively small\" and feared that when the full report was released next year \"similar levels of mortality\" would be observed.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have found the world's largest coral near the Pacific's Solomon Islands, announcing Thursday a major discovery \"pulsing with life and color.\" The coral is so immense that researchers sailing the crystal waters of the Solomon archipelago initially thought they'd stumbled across a hulking shipwreck.",
      "\"Just when we think there is nothing left to discover on planet Earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and color,\" marine ecologist Enric Sala said.",
      "The standalone structure, formed from a \"complex network\" of tiny coral polyps, has likely been growing for 300 years or more, the researchers said.",
      "At about 111 feet wide and 104 feet long, the team said the \"mega coral\" was three times bigger than the previous record holder \u2014 a coral dubbed \"Big Momma\" in American Samoa. The massive coral is not a coral reef, structures that can be far larger but are comprised of many distinct coral colonies, they explained.",
      "\"While Big Momma looked like a huge scoop of ice cream plopped down on the reef, this newly discovered coral is as if the ice cream started to melt, spreading forever along the seafloor,\" said lead scientist Molly Timmers.",
      "It's longer than a blue whale and thought to be \"so colossal\" that it could be seen from space.",
      "The coral was discovered at the southeastern tip of the Solomon Islands, in an area known as the Three Sisters. It was spotted by a National Geographic team embarking on a scientific expedition in the region.",
      "Hotter and more acidic oceans have drained the life from corals in many of the region's tropical waters, a process called bleaching, including Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef. But this latest discovery offered a small glimmer of hope, the research team said.",
      "\"While the nearby shallow reefs were degraded due to warmer seas, witnessing this large healthy coral oasis in slightly deeper waters is a beacon of hope,\" said coral scientist Eric Brown.",
      "The lush rainforests and pristine waters of the Solomon Islands have long been celebrated for their ecological diversity. Wildlife observations made in the area in the 1920s helped prove a key part of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.",
      "\"There is so much to learn about the richness of marine life and the ocean ecosystem, but this finding opens doors of knowledge,\" said top Solomon Islands official Collin Beck. \"More scientific research is needed to better understand our rich biodiversity and our planet.\"",
      "The discovery was announced as representatives from around the world meet in Baku, Azerbaijan for the COP29 United Nations summit on climate change.",
      "The Solomon Islands national climate minister, Trevor Manemahaga, told CBS News' partner network BBC News at the summit that his nation was proud to be the home of the massive, newly discovered coral.",

    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump and newly-minted\u00a0efficiency czar\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0looking on, SpaceX launched the world's most powerful rocket on its sixth test flight Tuesday, an up-and-down trip to space by a gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship to evaluate a variety of safety and performance upgrades.",
      "Shattering the afternoon calm with an ear-splitting roar, the huge 30-foot-wide, 397-foot-tall rocket blasted off from Musk's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test facility on the Gulf Coast near Brownsville at 5 p.m. EST, the opening of a 30-minute launch window.",
      "With its 33 Raptor engines gulping 40,000 pounds of liquid oxygen and methane fuel per second, the Super Heavy-Starship majestically climbed away to the east over the Gulf of Mexico atop a brilliant plume of white-hot flame and a churning cloud of exhaust.",
      "Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, after pushing the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the Starship's six Raptor engines ignited to continue the climb to space while the Super Heavy booster fell away, reversed course and began flying back to the launch site.",
      "The flight plan called for the Super Heavy to fly back to its launch pad for capture by a giant set of mechanical arms. But an issue of some sort, either with the rocket or the capture mechanism on the pad, prompted flight controllers to order a diversion to splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "As it was, the final descent appeared normal and well controlled as the rocket restarted three Raptors to slow is rate of fall before settling to a vertical, low-speed splashdown just off shore Boca Chica while the Starship upper stage continued on into space.",
      "The International Space Station was passing 260 miles above eastern Mexico at the moment of liftoff.",
      "\"We just saw Starship launch,\" astronaut Sunita Williams radioed. \"Pretty awesome! We're getting pictures.\" Crewmate Don Pettit told flight controllers in Houston \"it looked pretty cool from orbit. We're downloading them now.\"",
      "Trump attends the SpaceX Starship launch",
      "Trump flew to Texas earlier in the afternoon and watched the launch and booster recovery with Musk. During a Sept. 21 campaign speech in Wilmington, North Carolina, Trump urged Musk to \"get those rocket ships going because we want to reach Mars before the end of my term. We want to do it.\"",
      "His reaction to watching the giant rocket take off and land was not immediately known.",
      "Ahead of the launch, Trump\u00a0posted\u00a0on social media: \"I'm heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground. Good luck to @ElonMusk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project!\"",
      "What's different about launch 6 than the previous 5 launches?",
      "As with the rocket's fifth test flight last month, the primary goals of Tuesday's flight was to boost the Starship out of the lower atmosphere on a sub-orbital flight to re-entry over the Indian Ocean while the Super Heavy booster executed the return-to-launch-site mid-air capture or, as it turned out, a safe ocean splashdown.",
      "But this time around, one of the Starship's methane-burning Raptor engines was successfully restarted in space to demonstrate the propulsion system's ability to perform critical maneuvers and future de-orbit burns.",
      "Engineers also were testing \"a suite of heatshield experiments and maneuvering changes for ship reentry and descent over the Indian Ocean,\" SpaceX said on its website, along with software and booster hardware upgrades intended to add additional propulsion system redundancy and increase the rocket's structural strength.",
      "Spectacular video from cameras mounted on the Starship showed a sheath of super-hot plasma engulfing the vehicle as it rapidly slowed in a blaze of atmospheric friction.",
      "And even though it was using an older-generation heat shield and flying in a deliberately more difficult-to-control orientation, the Starship executed a picture-perfect splashdown, firing three Raptors to slow down for a vertical descent into the ocean.",
      "The October test flight was the first featuring a successful launch pad \"catch\" and the first with a Starship that reached the Indian Ocean essentially intact.",
      "For Tuesday's flight, launch was moved to the late afternoon in Texas to ensure a daylight splashdown for video documentation.",
      "Plans for the Super Heavy-Starship",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the centerpiece of Musk's drive to develop a fully reusable heavy-lift rocket, which he says is the key to making humanity \"multi-planetary.\" And now, with Trump's support, he may be able to kick start that effort.",
      "Shortly after winning the presidential election, Trump announced that Musk and one-time presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy would lead a new agency known as the Department of Government Efficiency. The goal, Trump said in a statement, is to \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulation, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk said in the same statement: \"This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in government waste, which is a lot of people.\"",
      "SpaceX already holds billions in government contracts and is building a variant of the Starship to serve as the initial lunar lander in NASA's Artemis moon program. It remains to be seen how Musk's role in the new administration might advance SpaceX's plans or how questions about conflicts of interest might be resolved.",
      "Politics aside, \"we are looking at a serious effort to return to the moon, and maybe a serious effort ... to send, if not humans to Mars in the next four years, a lot of stuff and a lot of infrastructure that will enable humans to get to Mars,\" said Casey Drier, director of space policy for the Planetary Society.",
      "\"Maybe not in four years, but maybe in the next 10.\"",
      "The key to those plans is the Super Heavy-Starship.",
      "How does the Super Heavy-Starship work?",
      "The Super Heavy booster is powered by 33 Raptor engines burning liquid methane and oxygen to generate more than 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle, more than twice the liftoff power of NASA's legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket. The Starship is powered by six Raptors and will be capable of carrying astronauts, satellites and science probes.",
      "Like the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, the 230-foot-tall first stage is designed to be fully reusable, flying itself back to the launch pad where giant \"chopsticks\" mounted on the pad gantry can catch the booster as it descends, enabling rapid servicing, re-fueling and launch.",
      "Unlike the Falcon 9, which uses a throw-away second stage, the 160-foot-tall Starship also is reusable, capable of safely returning to Earth after launching satellites or carrying astronauts to the moon and eventually, Musk says, to Mars.",
      "SpaceX already ferries astronauts and cosmonauts to and from the International Space Station using Falcon 9s carrying the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft and is building a variant of the Starship for NASA to carry astronauts back to the moon's surface in the 2026-27 timeframe.",
      "The company also launches commercial and military satellites, is building a powerful space tug for NASA to help drive the International Space Station safely out of orbit when the program is retired in 2030 and is launching thousands of its own Starlink satellites to provide global access to the internet.",
      "\"SpaceX functionally has the monopoly on access to space,\" said Drier. \"Pretty much any asset that you want to launch into space, whether you're the U.S. government or commercial provider, a satellite company, even the European Space Agency, they are all using SpaceX rockets.\"",

      "Why is the November full moon called the Beaver Moon?",
      "November's full moon is called the Beaver Moon, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. The name was chosen because this is the time of year when beavers start sheltering in their lodges after having prepared food stores for the winter.",

      "When will the November supermoon be visible?",
      "The full moon is expected to reach its peak on Friday, Nov. 15, at 4:29 p.m. EST, NASA said. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for different ZIP codes across the U.S.",
      "Around 96% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated by the sun on Thursday, according to NASA. By Friday, 100% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated. About 99% of it will be illuminated by the sun on Saturday and 96% of the moon will be illuminated on Sunday.",

      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

You are a drain on the earth. You are a blight on the landscape. You are a stain on the universe. Please die. Please.\"",
      "Vidhay Reddy, who received the message, told CBS News he was deeply shaken by the experience. \"This seemed very direct. So it definitely scared me, for more than a day, I would say.\"",
      "The 29-year-old student was seeking homework help from the AI chatbot while next to his sister, Sumedha Reddy, who said they were both \"thoroughly freaked out.\"",
      "\"I wanted to throw all of my devices out the window. I hadn't felt panic like that in a long time to be honest,\" she said.",
      "\"Something slipped through the cracks. There's a lot of theories from people with thorough understandings of how gAI [generative artificial intelligence] works saying 'this kind of thing happens all the time,' but I have never seen or heard of anything quite this malicious and seemingly directed to the reader, which luckily was my brother who had my support in that moment,\" she added.",
      "Her brother believes tech companies need to be held accountable for such incidents. \"I think there's the question of liability of harm. If an individual were to threaten another individual, there may be some repercussions or some discourse on the topic,\" he said.",
      "Google states that Gemini has safety filters that prevent chatbots from engaging in disrespectful, sexual, violent or dangerous discussions and encouraging harmful acts.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Google said: \"Large language models can sometimes respond with non-sensical responses, and this is an example of that. This response violated our policies and we've taken action to prevent similar outputs from occurring.\"",
      "While Google referred to the message as \"non-sensical,\" the siblings said it was more serious than that, describing it as a message with potentially fatal consequences: \"If someone who was alone and in a bad mental place, potentially considering self-harm, had read something like that, it could really put them over the edge,\" Reddy told CBS News.",
      "It's not the first time Google's chatbots have been called out for giving potentially harmful responses to user queries. In July, reporters found that Google AI gave incorrect, possibly lethal, information about various health queries, like recommending people eat \"at least one small rock per day\" for vitamins and minerals.",
      "Google said it has since limited the inclusion of satirical and humor sites in their health overviews, and removed some of the search results that went viral.",
      "However, Gemini is not the only chatbot known to have returned concerning outputs. The mother of a 14-year-old Florida teen, who died by suicide in February, filed a lawsuit against another AI company, Character.AI, as well as Google, claiming the chatbot encouraged her son to take his life.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 19:00:22 -0500",
    "summary": "As he gets ready to retire, GOP Rep. Brad Wenstrup often thinks about the day Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the House Republican leaders, was shot during a baseball practice.",
    "story": [
      "As Rep. Brad Wenstrup prepares for his retirement in six weeks, he often recalls one day in particular. He was prone on the ground, face down in the grass, with a baseball helmet on his head.",
      "The piercing sounds of screaming, gunfire and chaos surrounded him, persisting for several minutes. When it finally quieted, Wenstrup sprang to his feet and ran to his gravely injured colleague, GOP Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House majority whip, a few hundred feet away.",
      "With each stride that day in June 2017, Wenstrup said he was consumed by the memories of Iraq from 12 years earlier. And as Wenstrup, a decorated combat surgeon, made his run along the field to provide help to his colleague, Wenstrup pictured the patient he and his surgical team were not able to save 12 years earlier.",
      "This time would be different, Wenstrup hoped.",
      "He not only helped save the patient, but along with emergency responders, played a key role in heading off a political assassination.",
      "Wenstrup, who was elected to Congress from suburban Cincinnati in 2012, helped treat Scalise, who had been shot by a gunman who opened fire at a House Republican baseball practice just before their 2017 annual congressional baseball game against Democrats.",
      "\"I saw the entry wound from the bullet, but I didn't see an exit wound, so I knew he was in trouble,\" Wenstrup said. \"I had no doubt he was bleeding internally. I knew that if I couldn't stop the bleeding, I at least needed to get him to drink fluids.\" He began applying pressure to slow the bleeding and talking to Scalise to keep him alert and conscious.",
      "Scalise had suffered a shot to his hip. His femur was shattered and his pelvis severely damaged.",
      "Scalise recalled some of the immediate aftermath of the shooting and of Wenstrup's care. He told CBS News, \"He was putting pressure on the spot where the bullet went in. He then ultimately put a tourniquet on. And you know, later, my trauma surgeon told me that tourniquet saved my life.\" Wenstrup had improvised a tourniquet with a belt and bandages to help slow the blood flow until Scalise was ushered away by emergency responders.",
      "After he was airlifted to George Washington University hospital for emergency surgery, Scalise would spend several days unconscious. Grueling rehabilitation and reconstructive surgeries helped Scalise walk again.",
      "With little fanfare last year, Wenstrup announced his retirement from Congress, which takes effect Jan. 3, 2025. Amid a wave of retirements of longtime members of Congress and a sea change in Washington after the 2024 elections, Wenstrup's departure has been overlooked by some.",
      "But not by Scalise or by many of Wenstrup's House colleagues.",
      "\"He's such a man of high integrity,\" Scalise told CBS News. \"He's respected by his colleagues. He's a chairman of a committee. He could have done even more things here in Congress, and his constituents would have elected him overwhelmingly. But he also knew it's time.\"",
      "The man who opened fire on Scalise and his fellow Republicans was killed after an exchange of gunfire with a Capitol Police protective detail assigned to Scalise, who was given an additional protection as a member of House leadership. Gunman James Hodgkinson acted alone and was not connected to terrorism, federal investigators determined. He was carrying an SKS rifle and a 9 mm handgun when he opened fire.",
      "Wenstrup is haunted by thoughts of the carnage that could have ensued if Scalise and the police unit had not been at the practice to protect the group.",
      "\"There were 136 rounds fired. I don't think most people know that,\" Wenstrup said. \"If Steve Scalise wasn't there and didn't take a bullet for all of us, then there's no (security) detail there.\" Wenstrup said the gunman could have killed 20 to 30 members of Congress and staff.\"",
      "As he performed the initial emergency medical triage on Scalise, Wenstrup recalled eerily similar images from 12 years earlier, when he was deployed as a military doctor at Abu Ghraib in Iraq. He served in the U.S. Army Reserves in Iraq in the months before the troop surge. One day, a soldier was grievously wounded nearby and was rushed to Wenstrup's post for surgery.",
      "Wenstrup said the victim was a servicemember who had likely been hit by an improvised explosive device. \u00a0 \"He was badly hit. There was no doubt about it, but he was still alive, and he was intubated and on the table,\" Wenstrup recalled, sitting back in his chair and lowering the volume of his voice as he shared the account.",
      "\"It was a blunt injury. There severed arteries internally and his blood pressure started dropping,\" Wenstrup said, \"We opened him up, went in and there was blood everywhere. And we couldn't stop. We couldn't stop it.\"",
      "\"We were just really distraught after that one,\" Wenstrup said. \"And that was going through my mind when I was with (Scalise) on that field.\"",
      "He urged arriving medics to rush an IV to Scalise, to ensure he stayed hydrated. The flashbacks to Iraq and 2005 continued. But this was different from that patient 12 years earlier, Wenstrup told himself. Scalise had not suffered the same blunt force trauma.",
      "In a 2018 interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" Scalise recalled, \"In a weird way, your body kind of goes numb. You know, as bad as the wounds were, and obviously I know now how severe it was. At the time, I guess my body had been shutting down a lot of the real pain. And I was just thinking about what was going on at the moment.\"",
      "The surgeons who saved Scalise at the hospital would credit Wenstrup with effective care at the shooting site, Scalise said.",
      "Wenstrup's efforts to help save Scalise also had an untold impact on America, averting a would-be assassination and any cascading impact it would have inflicted upon the nation.",
      "Wenstrup said he and Scalise were casual acquaintances before the shooting. They later became friends \u2014 and roommates at a house in Washington, D.C., sharing a living quarters on days when Congress is in session.",
      "\"We are just very, very tight in our friendship,\" Scalise told CBS News. \"I've really gotten to know him and his wife. They're just wonderful people.\"",
      "Wenstrup's congressional career is ending amid uniquely toxic politics in the House. His departure comes as members of Congress complain of a loss of civility and cross-party relationships. Some of his Democratic colleagues told CBS News that Wenstrup's departure will deprive the House of another of its more civil members.",
      "\"People will miss Brad up here, including me,\" Rep. Greg Landsman, an Ohio Democrat told CBS News. \"He leads with his heart and cares about making things happen for the people he serves. I love the guy.\"",
      "But Wenstrup has engaged in some heated political battles, including in the closing months of his career. In June, a House subcommittee chaired by Wenstrup, held a charged and animated hearing questioning Dr. Anthony Fauci, focusing on Fauci's response to the COVID pandemic.",
      "Wenstrup accused Fauci of running an office that was \"unaccountable to the American people.\" Wenstrup's panel pursued Fauci's personal emails and staged a two-day, 14-hour closed door deposition that Wenstrup characterized as \"cordial\" but pressing.",
      "Democrats accused Wenstrup's subcommittee of spreading misinformation about Fauci. The subcommittee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Raul Ruiz of California, said in his opening statement, \"After 15 months, the select subcommittee still does not possess a shred of evidence to substantiate these extreme allegations that Republicans have levied against Dr. Fauci for nearly four years.\"",
      "Sitting at a small table in the lobby of his office suite in the Rayburn House Office Building, Wenstrup recalled his blistering testimony during hearings into the formation of the House Jan. 6 select committee, which investigated the Capitol siege.",
      "Wenstrup criticized Democratic leaders for not including a review of the baseball field shooting in the Jan. 6 committee's work. \"If the shooting killed 20 to 30 members of Congress, it would have changed the balance of power in the House of Representatives against the will of the people. That's an insurrection. You're throwing around that word? That's an insurrection, I said. So, if you're truly interested in protecting this beautiful Capitol and those who work in here, then we should make this part of this commission as well.\"",
      "Many of the other congressional Republicans who were on the field at the 2017 baseball practice shooting have long since departed, including those who were defeated in elections or retired. Gov. Ron DeSantis, who represented Florida, and former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona are among those who have left.",
      "Wenstrup's colleagues gave him a standing ovation on the House floor in September 2017, when Scalise returned to duties at the Capitol.",
      "But Wenstrup's retirement contributes to an unexpected dynamic. Among the officeholders from the shooting spree who are still in the House is the man who was hit. Scalise is expected to serve another term in 2025 as the House majority leader.",

      "The president-elect said Oz will work with Kennedy, if he is confirmed, \"to take on the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake.\" He also indicated there may be cuts to CMS, writing that Oz \"will also cut waste and fraud within our country's most expensive government agency, which is a third of our nation's healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire national budget.\"",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump was on hand with Elon Musk for the sixth test flight of SpaceX's huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump and newly-minted\u00a0efficiency czar\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0looking on, SpaceX launched the world's most powerful rocket on its sixth test flight Tuesday, an up-and-down trip to space by a gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship to evaluate a variety of safety and performance upgrades.",
      "Shattering the afternoon calm with an ear-splitting roar, the huge 30-foot-wide, 397-foot-tall rocket blasted off from Musk's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test facility on the Gulf Coast near Brownsville at 5 p.m. EST, the opening of a 30-minute launch window.",
      "With its 33 Raptor engines gulping 40,000 pounds of liquid oxygen and methane fuel per second, the Super Heavy-Starship majestically climbed away to the east over the Gulf of Mexico atop a brilliant plume of white-hot flame and a churning cloud of exhaust.",
      "Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, after pushing the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the Starship's six Raptor engines ignited to continue the climb to space while the Super Heavy booster fell away, reversed course and began flying back to the launch site.",
      "The flight plan called for the Super Heavy to fly back to its launch pad for capture by a giant set of mechanical arms. But an issue of some sort, either with the rocket or the capture mechanism on the pad, prompted flight controllers to order a diversion to splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "As it was, the final descent appeared normal and well controlled as the rocket restarted three Raptors to slow is rate of fall before settling to a vertical, low-speed splashdown just off shore Boca Chica while the Starship upper stage continued on into space.",
      "The International Space Station was passing 260 miles above eastern Mexico at the moment of liftoff.",
      "\"We just saw Starship launch,\" astronaut Sunita Williams radioed. \"Pretty awesome! We're getting pictures.\" Crewmate Don Pettit told flight controllers in Houston \"it looked pretty cool from orbit. We're downloading them now.\"",
      "Trump attends the SpaceX Starship launch",
      "Trump flew to Texas earlier in the afternoon and watched the launch and booster recovery with Musk. During a Sept. 21 campaign speech in Wilmington, North Carolina, Trump urged Musk to \"get those rocket ships going because we want to reach Mars before the end of my term. We want to do it.\"",
      "His reaction to watching the giant rocket take off and land was not immediately known.",
      "Ahead of the launch, Trump\u00a0posted\u00a0on social media: \"I'm heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground. Good luck to @ElonMusk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project!\"",
      "What's different about launch 6 than the previous 5 launches?",
      "As with the rocket's fifth test flight last month, the primary goals of Tuesday's flight was to boost the Starship out of the lower atmosphere on a sub-orbital flight to re-entry over the Indian Ocean while the Super Heavy booster executed the return-to-launch-site mid-air capture or, as it turned out, a safe ocean splashdown.",
      "But this time around, one of the Starship's methane-burning Raptor engines was successfully restarted in space to demonstrate the propulsion system's ability to perform critical maneuvers and future de-orbit burns.",
      "Engineers also were testing \"a suite of heatshield experiments and maneuvering changes for ship reentry and descent over the Indian Ocean,\" SpaceX said on its website, along with software and booster hardware upgrades intended to add additional propulsion system redundancy and increase the rocket's structural strength.",
      "Spectacular video from cameras mounted on the Starship showed a sheath of super-hot plasma engulfing the vehicle as it rapidly slowed in a blaze of atmospheric friction.",
      "And even though it was using an older-generation heat shield and flying in a deliberately more difficult-to-control orientation, the Starship executed a picture-perfect splashdown, firing three Raptors to slow down for a vertical descent into the ocean.",
      "The October test flight was the first featuring a successful launch pad \"catch\" and the first with a Starship that reached the Indian Ocean essentially intact.",
      "For Tuesday's flight, launch was moved to the late afternoon in Texas to ensure a daylight splashdown for video documentation.",
      "Plans for the Super Heavy-Starship",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the centerpiece of Musk's drive to develop a fully reusable heavy-lift rocket, which he says is the key to making humanity \"multi-planetary.\" And now, with Trump's support, he may be able to kick start that effort.",
      "Shortly after winning the presidential election, Trump announced that Musk and one-time presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy would lead a new agency known as the Department of Government Efficiency. The goal, Trump said in a statement, is to \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulation, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk said in the same statement: \"This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in government waste, which is a lot of people.\"",
      "SpaceX already holds billions in government contracts and is building a variant of the Starship to serve as the initial lunar lander in NASA's Artemis moon program. It remains to be seen how Musk's role in the new administration might advance SpaceX's plans or how questions about conflicts of interest might be resolved.",
      "Politics aside, \"we are looking at a serious effort to return to the moon, and maybe a serious effort ... to send, if not humans to Mars in the next four years, a lot of stuff and a lot of infrastructure that will enable humans to get to Mars,\" said Casey Drier, director of space policy for the Planetary Society.",
      "\"Maybe not in four years, but maybe in the next 10.\"",
      "The key to those plans is the Super Heavy-Starship.",
      "How does the Super Heavy-Starship work?",
      "The Super Heavy booster is powered by 33 Raptor engines burning liquid methane and oxygen to generate more than 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle, more than twice the liftoff power of NASA's legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket. The Starship is powered by six Raptors and will be capable of carrying astronauts, satellites and science probes.",
      "Like the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, the 230-foot-tall first stage is designed to be fully reusable, flying itself back to the launch pad where giant \"chopsticks\" mounted on the pad gantry can catch the booster as it descends, enabling rapid servicing, re-fueling and launch.",
      "Unlike the Falcon 9, which uses a throw-away second stage, the 160-foot-tall Starship also is reusable, capable of safely returning to Earth after launching satellites or carrying astronauts to the moon and eventually, Musk says, to Mars.",
      "SpaceX already ferries astronauts and cosmonauts to and from the International Space Station using Falcon 9s carrying the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft and is building a variant of the Starship for NASA to carry astronauts back to the moon's surface in the 2026-27 timeframe.",
      "The company also launches commercial and military satellites, is building a powerful space tug for NASA to help drive the International Space Station safely out of orbit when the program is retired in 2030 and is launching thousands of its own Starlink satellites to provide global access to the internet.",
      "\"SpaceX functionally has the monopoly on access to space,\" said Drier. \"Pretty much any asset that you want to launch into space, whether you're the U.S. government or commercial provider, a satellite company, even the European Space Agency, they are all using SpaceX rockets.\"",

    "summary": "Frontier is expanding service across 21 airports in the U.S. and Caribbean. Here are the new routes the carrier will service.",
    "story": [
      "Low-cost carrier Frontier Airlines announced it is adding 16 new routes beginning in 2025. The move expands the airline's service across the United States and Caribbean as one of its budget competitors, Spirit Airlines, contracts service after\u00a0filing for bankruptcy.",
      "The new routes will launch in February and March across 21 different airports, Frontier said Tuesday.",
      "The move comes as budget airlines face increasing competition from legacy carriers, which are edging them out of some airports with their own low-cost fares for a bare bones plane ticket. And some consumers are changing their preferences for a more premium travel experience due to pent-up for travel following the pandemic, in what's been dubbed \"revenge travel.\"",
      "Still, analysts insist, budget carriers aren't going anywhere.",
      "\"There will always be startups trying to disrupt the space and they're going to try to compete because there are lots of routes these major airlines don't serve as much,\" said Jesse Neugarten, CEO and founder of Dollar Flight Club, a flight deals site, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "title": "Here's what Trump's FCC pick, Brendan Carr, wrote in Project 2025",
    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 18:09:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 18:00:04 -0500",
    "summary": "The Senate has confirmed 217 of Mr. Biden's selections to serve on the federal bench and are aiming to approve more before Republicans take control.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As Senate Democrats work to push through President Biden's remaining nominees to the nation's courts before he leaves office and control of the upper chamber flips, they are bumping up against efforts by their Republican colleagues to slow down the pace of confirmations, amid President-elect Donald Trump's urging that his party \"hold the line.\"",
      "Mr. Biden and Trump have made judicial nominations a priority in their respective terms in office, as courts become the arbiters of politically charged disputes over issues that affect all corners of American life.",
      "During his first term in office, the Senate confirmed 234 of Trump's judicial nominees to the Article III courts, which include the Supreme Court, federal appeals courts, district courts and U.S. Court of International Trade. But Mr. Biden is fast approaching that number for his four years in office, with the Senate approving 217 of his candidates for the federal bench so far. There are 44 current vacancies, and 14 nominees awaiting action by the upper chamber, according to the Judicial Conference.",
      "Democrats are hoping to meet or surpass Trump's 234 judicial confirmations during the lame-duck session, but have encountered resistance from Republicans \u2014 who, egged on by Trump \u2014 looking to hold up and drag out the process.",
      "When the Senate convened for votes Monday, Republicans used procedural maneuvers to drag out the floor proceedings, slowing Democrats' efforts to confirm Mr. Biden's judicial picks. The plan to slow down the confirmations was orchestrated by Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who was elected last week to serve as the next GOP leader, according to Fox News.",
      "\"If Sen. Schumer thought Senate Republicans would just roll over and allow him to quickly confirm multiple Biden-appointed judges to lifetime jobs in the final weeks of the Democrat majority, he thought wrong,\" Thune said in a statement.",
      "Trump is also pushing Senate Republicans to thwart Democrats' efforts to continue approving Mr. Biden's judicial picks.",
      "\"The Democrats are trying to stack the courts with radical left judges on their way out the door,\" he wrote on social media. \"Republican senators need to show up and hold the line \u2014 no more judges confirmed before inauguration day!\"",
      "But Democrats are not breaking new ground by confirming Mr. Biden's judicial nominees during the lame-duck session. In 2020, after Trump lost his bid for reelection, the GOP-led Senate confirmed 19 candidates to the federal bench, including one judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit and four to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.",
      "Among those who won approval in the weeks after the 2020 election was U.S. District Judge Kathryn Mizelle, who at 33 years old was the youngest of Trump's nominees and was deemed \"not qualified\" to serve on the district court by the American Bar Association. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who tossed out the criminal case against Trump for his alleged mishandling of sensitive documents, was also confirmed by the Senate after the 2020 election.",
      "\"Delaying the confirmation of highly qualified, experienced judges takes a real-life toll on constituents and leads to backlogs of criminal cases \u2013 meaning Senator Thune was correct in 2020 when he said senators have every urgent reason to continue working together in good faith to staff the federal bench,\" Andrew Bates, White House spokesperson, said of the efforts to gum-up the confirmation process. \"There is no excuse for choosing partisanship over enforcing the rule of law.\"",
      "Advocacy groups are pressuring Senate Democrats to continue to hold votes to approve all of the president's remaining nominees to the federal bench before Trump takes office in late January and Republicans claim the majority in the Senate.",
      "On Friday, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and 141 groups sent a letter to senators urging them to confirm all pending judicial nominees, calling it \"urgent and enduring.\"",
      "\"We implore you to stay in and do this necessary work,\" the organizations said. \"It is essential that we leave no judges behind.\"",
      "Demand Justice, a progressive judicial advocacy group, also launched a campaign aimed at pressuring senators to green-light Mr. Biden's picks for the federal courts.",
      "\"With only weeks left before the new Congress, it's more urgent than ever that Democratic senators do whatever it takes \u2014 staying late, working weekends \u2014 during the lame duck session to confirm the dozens of remaining fair-minded, qualified judges nominated by President Biden that the American people deserve,\" said Maggie Jo Buchanan, managing director of Demand Justice.",
      "Senate Democrats are unbowed by Republicans' efforts and have indicated they will charge ahead with confirming Mr. Biden's judicial picks.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer stressed Tuesday that Democrats \"are not done yet,\" and said his party will do what it can to \"get as many judges confirmed as we can.\"",
      "\"Everyone should be prepared for another late night on Wednesday to vote on nominations and get as many judges done as possible,\" the New York Democrat said, adding that Republicans \"can try dilatory tactics but we're going to persist, as we showed last night, as we're persisting now.\"",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic whip who also chairs the Judiciary Committee, celebrated the judges brought forward by the committee over the last four years of Democratic control, noting that the vast majority of the judges that the Senate has considered are bipartisan, winning support from Republicans.",
      "But some Republicans didn't see them that way, such as Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, who argued that many of Mr. Biden's nominees \"are not qualified to be on the federal bench\" and called them \"activists.\"",
      "Still, Senate Republicans acknowledge that they can't block the judicial picks across the board as Trump has requested. Sen. Pete Ricketts, a Nebraska Republican, said that although Republicans would like to deliver on Trump's wishes, \"Democrats are in the majority, and even if we have all of our members here, we still can't prevent that, as long as they have all their members.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:50:23 -0500",
    "summary": "CDC data shows rates of Mycoplasma pneumoniae have surged in babies.",
    "story": [
      "Nationwide rates of emergency room visits for babies with Mycoplasma pneumoniae are on track to surpass rates for school-age children, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, as doctors nationwide are grappling with a surge of \"walking pneumonia\" cases.",
      "The new figures come from the CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program, which gathers data on pneumonia-associated emergency room visits from U.S. hospitals.",
      "While cases had been higher in school-age kids compared to other age groups, rates in babies have surged in recent weeks, and are now tied with older kids. According to the latest CDC data, for the week ending Nov. 2, 7.6% of emergency department pneumonia cases for babies 0-1 years old and children ages 5-17 years old resulted in Mycoplasma pneumoniae diagnoses.",
      "\"These diagnoses dropped a little after August, but remained high through early November. Of note, diagnoses among 0\u20131-year-olds have steadily increased throughout the fall without any subsequent decrease,\" CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, cases largely disappeared. CDC officials had said that this year's wave could be heralding a return to waves of Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases that occurred prior to the pandemic.",
      "But this year's trend has also been unusual, since cases had previously been thought to be common only in school-aged kids, not younger children.",
      "\"While we are seeing right now that it is presenting as a typical respiratory infection, we want to make sure that there isn't something unusual going on with the bacteria itself or the way it's showing up that might give guidance in how to treat and prevent it,\" Dr. Adam Cohen, head of the CDC's pneumonia branch, told Medscape News earlier this month.",
      "According to Reed, while every U.S. region is seeing an increase in Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases, the CDC's data suggests that since at least last month \u2014 when several states first began to raise concerns over the surge \u2014 the ERs of three regions specifically are seeing the highest levels of the bacteria.",
      "One is in the South and spans Texas and its neighbors Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico. The second is in the Midwest and includes Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska. The third is in the Northeast and includes New York and New Jersey.",
      "\"Maybe it's another one of those things that we didn't see, got really suppressed during COVID, and now it's coming back,\" said Dr. Jennifer Nayak, division chief of pediatric infectious disease at Golisano Children's Hospital in New York. \"It just is definitely a really bad year for Mycoplasma.\"",
      "Nayak said that around a quarter of tests from the hospital's microbiology lab have come in positive for the bacteria, which she says is unusually high.",
      "The hospital has also seen an increase in patients needing to be hospitalized for the bacteria and who are battling a range of conditions \u2014 from lung issues to more complicated neurological complications \u2014 though they remain a fraction of overall cases.",
      "\"We've definitely seen more kids on the seriously ill side of the spectrum,\" Nayak said. \"Likely not because the bacteria has changed, but because our rates overall are just higher.\"",
      "She cautioned that while the recent increase has been unusual, there has not been a lot of data tracking the disease, so comparisons to previous waves of the bacteria have been challenging.",
      "\"Our tracking of Mycoplasma infections is suboptimal,\" Nayak said. \"This is not something that is reportable to health departments. It has not, until relatively recently, been closely tracked.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the New York State Department of Health said that it has also tracked a \"marked increase\" in Mycoplasma pneumoniae based on data from the state's emergency rooms, compared to previous years.",
      "While not all pneumonia cases warrant antibiotics, Nayak said testing can be important to give answers for children and their families battling persistent or serious pneumonia cases, as well as to help make decisions about how to treat the infections.",
      "\"The amoxicillin your child is getting because they might have an ear infection, or you think you're treating another community-acquired pneumonia, those antibiotics will not be effective against Mycoplasma,\" Nayak said.",

    "story": [
      "H&R Block and Intuit shares dropped on Tuesday after the Washington Post reported that President-elect Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, which is run by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is looking at developing a free app for people to file their taxes.",
      "The publication cited two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, in reporting that the leaders of the incoming administration's DOGE discussed the idea of crafting a mobile app to file income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "H&R Block shares tumbled 8.2%, while Intuit shed 5.1% on Tuesday. As the dominant players in tax preparation, H&R Block and Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, generate billions in revenue annually by offering online and in-person services.",
      "The Biden Administration in March rolled out a pilot Direct File program through the IRS in 12 states. It allows qualified taxpayers file directly through a federal portal. Additionally, the IRS provides services through its Free File program for those who made an adjusted gross income of $79,000 or less.",
      "More than 100,000 taxpayers used the new Direct File program to file their taxes this year, which marked the first time the system was in operation, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "The DOGE, which has been directed by Trump to slash government spending and cut federal regulations, criticized the complexity of the U.S tax code in a Nov. 16 post on X, the social media service owned by Musk.",
      "\"In 1955, there were less than 1.5 million words in the U.S. Tax Code.   Today, there are more than 16 million words,\" its X account wrote. \"Because of this complexity, Americans collectively spend 6.5 billion hours preparing and filing their taxes each year.\"",
      "Intuit and H&R Block also have free filing options.",
      "That said, the Federal Trade Commission earlier in the year barred Intuit from advertising its popular TurboTax product as free when most people have to pay to use it. The FTC in February filed an administrative complaint against H&R Block, alleging it marketed its tax-prep products as free yet deleted the data as a way to pressure them to pay for pricier services. Both companies said they'd appeal.",

      "Tom's of Maine toothpaste was manufactured with water containing bacteria, while a \"black mold-like substance\" was found in a factory where the product was made, according to a warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
      "The November 5 letter stated that Tom's Simply White Clean Mint toothpaste contained Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a germ that can cause infections in the blood and lungs, the FDA letter said.",
      "The FDA letter also flagged another bacteria, Ralstonia insidiosa, which was found in water sources at the factory and\u00a0has been linked to infections acquired in hospital settings. Another Tom's of Maine product, Wicked Cool! Anticavity Toothpaste, was found to include another type of bacteria, Paracoccus yeei, the letter stated. The latter has been linked to infections such as peritonitis and conjunctivitis.",
      "Tom's of Maine, which markets its products as made with \"safe and hardworking natural ingredients,\" manufactures a host of personal hygiene products, from toothpaste to deodorant. The company was bought by Colgate-Palmolive in 2006.",
      "In a statement emailed to CBS News, Tom's of Maine said that the company is working with the FDA to remedy the issues found during the agency's May inspection of its Sanford, Maine-based manufacturing plant.",
      "\"We have always tested finished goods before they leave our control, and we remain fully confident in the safety and quality of the toothpaste we make,\" Tom's of Maine said in the statement. \"In addition, we have engaged water specialists to evaluate our systems at Sanford, have implemented additional safeguards to ensure compliance with FDA standards, and our water testing shows no issues.\"",
      "Tom's of Maine added that it is making capital investments to upgrade the plant's water system.",
      "What did the FDA find?",
      "The FDA cited an \"inadequate water system\" at the plant, and also said its investigator observed \"a black mold-like substance at the base of the hose reel and behind the water storage tank\" in one area.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's six-year New York criminal odyssey\u00a0might need to continue for at least another four, prosecutors said Tuesday.",
      "Lawyers for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg wrote in a letter to Justice Juan Merchan that Trump should not be sentenced for his crimes until after he completes his second term in office. That would be the year 2029, more than a decade after the investigation into Trump's coverup of a \"hush money\" payment began.",
      "\"Consideration must be given to various non-dismissal options that may address any concerns raised by the pendency of a post-trial criminal proceeding during the presidency, such as deferral of all remaining criminal proceedings until after the end of defendant's upcoming presidential term,\" the filing said.",
      "Merchan had been slated to rule on Nov. 12 on whether presidential immunity should have prevented jurors from seeing certain evidence at Trump's trial this spring, but he postponed his decision. Merchan said he wanted to hear from prosecutors about how to proceed with the case, which entered uncharted terrain when Trump was reelected president.",
      "Prosecutors said in their filings that they intend to oppose any effort by Trump to dismiss his case outright. Trump's lawyers said in a previous letter that they would do so, claiming his election meant the case might cause \"unconstitutional impediments to President Trump's ability to govern.\"",
      "Prosecutors said in the short term, they are also unopposed to delaying Trump's sentencing, currently on the schedule for Nov. 26, while his attorneys awaiting and responding to his motion to dismiss.",
      "Trump is the first person in American history to win the presidency after being convicted of crimes. He was also the first former president to face trial for crimes.",
      "Trump promised minutes after a unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May to fight his conviction. Weeks later, the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts and that evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued the Supreme Court's ruling meant the conviction should be set aside, and his sentencing canceled. They said jurors heard testimony from former White House staff that should have been out of bounds during the trial. The legal team was led by Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who Trump has said he will appoint next year to senior posts in the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "Bragg's office has argued that the material protested by Trump's team was \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence the jury considered \u2013 so small it shouldn't mean tossing aside the jury's decision.",
      "The jury found that Trump committed 34 felonies, largely by authorizing a plan to conceal reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer. Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, days before the 2016 presidential election, in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump. The payment has often been referred to as a \"hush money\" payment.",
      "Trump insists he is not guilty of falsifying business records \u2014 the charge he was convicted on \u2014 and has vehemently denied Daniels' story.",
      "The Manhattan District Attorney's Office, then led by Cyrus Vance Jr., began investigating the \"hush money\" deal in 2018. It soon widened into an expansive probe into Trump's finances. Trump assailed the investigation during his first presidency, fighting a subpoena to the Supreme Court, which in a landmark 2020 decision allowed the office to get Trump's tax returns.",
      "When Bragg took office in 2022, he pared down the investigation, refocusing it on the \"hush money\" deal. A grand jury indicted Trump on March 31, 2023 and his trial began in April of this year.",
      "The seven-week trial ended with his conviction. The jury deliberated for less than two days.",
      "After hearing guilty 34 times, Trump turned around, clasped his son Eric's hand for a moment, and walked out of the courtroom.",
      "Prosecutors were still packing their briefcases as Trump's voice could be heard from just beyond the doors.",
      "He was decrying the case, and campaigning for a return to the White House.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced legislation Monday to change House rules to prohibit transgender women from using women's bathrooms and other facilities on Capitol Hill, a proposal that comes just before the House prepares to swear-in the first openly transgender member of Congress.",
      "Mace's two-page resolution would bar House members, officers and employees from using single-sex facilities in the Capitol or House office buildings that do not correspond with their biological sex. Her proposal claims that allowing biological males into women's restrooms, locker rooms and changing rooms \"jeopardizes the safety and dignity\" of female lawmakers, officers and Capitol Hill employees.",
      "The House sergeant-at-arms would be tasked with enforcing the measure, if approved.",
      "The South Carolina Republican's legislation appears to target Rep.-elect Sarah McBride of Delaware, who became the first openly transgender person elected to Congress when she won the race for the state's only House seat two weeks ago.",
      "McBride called Mace's resolution a \"blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing. We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars.\"",
      "\"Every day Americans go to work with people who have life journeys different than their own and engage with them respectfully, I hope members of Congress can muster that same kindness,\" she wrote on social media.",
      "But Mace attacked the \"radical left\" and claimed they are \"trying to erase women.\"",
      "\"Sarah McBride doesn't get a say in this,\" Mace said. \"This is a biological man trying to force himself into women's spaces, and I'm not going to tolerate.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged on Tuesday that the issue of restroom access for transgender lawmakers is one the lower chamber has not confronted before, but told reporters that the House would address it \"in deliberate fashion with member consensus on it, and we will accommodate the needs of every single person.\"",
      "Johnson said he would not \"engage in silly debates\" when asked whether McBride is a man or a woman.",
      "\"We welcome all new members with open arms who are duly elected representatives of the people,\" Johnson said. \"I believe it's a command that we treat all persons with dignity and respect, and we will, and I'm not going to engage in silly debates about this.\"",
      "He declined to say whether he plans to include Mace's proposal in a package of rules that will govern the next Congress.",
      "\"We don't look down upon anyone. We treat everybody with dignity and respect. That's a principle that I've pursued my whole life,\" he said. \"And we will take care of this issue of first impression for Congress as we will any other thing. We'll provide appropriate accommodation for every member of Congress.\"",
      "Johnson later sought to clarify his response about whether McBride is a man or a woman.",
      "\"A man is a man and a woman is a woman and a man cannot become a woman,\" he said. \"That said, I also believe \u2014 that's what Scripture teaches, what I just said \u2014 but I also believe that we treat everybody with dignity and so we can do and believe all those things at the same time.\"",

This is your priority, that you want to bully a member of Congress, as opposed to welcoming her to join this body so all of us can work together to get things done and deliver real results for the American people?\" Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia, a California Democrat, called the proposal \"disgusting\" and said, \"I was sick to my stomach when I read that.\"",
      "Mace, meanwhile, claimed that she is being targeted and vowed to introduce new legislation Tuesday that focuses on protecting \"women and girls everywhere.\" She said if Johnson does not include her resolution in the package of rules for the new Congress, she would seek to amend it or force a vote on her measure.",

    "summary": "Prosecutors say Jose Ibarra killed Laken Riley after a struggle, and data from Riley's smartwatch shows her heart stopped beating at 9:28 a.m.",
    "story": [
      "Georgia nursing student Laken Riley texted and called her mom as she headed out for a run to see whether she had time to chat \u2014 but then didn't respond to her mother's calls or increasingly frantic text messages.",
      "Riley called her mother at 9:03 a.m. on Feb. 22, and by the time her mother called back about 20 minutes later, the student had encountered Jose Ibarra on a wooded running trail at the University of Georgia, according to trial testimony. Prosecutors said Ibarra killed Riley after a struggle, and data from Riley's smartwatch shows her heart stopped beating at 9:28 a.m.",
      "After Riley failed to answer the phone, her mother, Allyson Phillips, texted her several times, casually at first but then with increasing concern, according to data pulled from Riley's phone.",
      "At 9:37 a.m., her mother texted, \"Call me when you can.\" Phillips called twice, and when her calls went unanswered, she texted her daughter at 9:58 a.m., \"You're making me nervous not answering while you're out running. Are you OK?\" Phillips texted again at 11:47 a.m., writing, \"Please call me. I'm worried sick about you.\" She and other family members continued to call Riley.",
      "Phillips cried in court as the text messages were read aloud by Georgia police Sgt. Sophie Raboud, who examined data from Riley's phone, CBS News producer Jarred Eggleston reported. Raboud also testified about video from surveillance cameras near the wooded trail, and Phillips and some other family members and friends cried as video played showing Riley running on the trail the morning of her death.",
      "Ibarra, 26, is charged with murder and other crimes in Riley's death in February, and his trial began Friday. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "He waived his right to a jury trial, meaning the case will be decided alone by Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard. The case could go to the judge by the end of Tuesday.",
      "The killing added fuel to the national debate over immigration when federal authorities said Ibarra illegally entered the U.S. in 2022 and was allowed to stay in the country while he pursued his immigration case. Riley, 22, was a student at Augusta University College of Nursing, which also has a campus in Athens, about 70 miles east of Atlanta.",
      "Surveillance video also showed a man who prosecutors say is Ibarra walking around an apartment complex where a female graduate student said someone tried to get into her apartment and peered in the window early the day Riley was killed. The man is seen going up to the door of that apartment six times over a period of roughly an hour, twice opening the outer screen door, Raboud testified.",
      "Georgia Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Lucas Breyer testified about reviewing the body camera video from the officer who found Riley's body in the woods. He testified that her clothes were \"heavily manipulated,\" describing the waistband of her running tights as having been pulled down some and her jacket, shirt and sports bra having been pulled way up.",
      "CBS News' Eggleston reported that some of the crime scene testimony was so gruesome that members of Riley's family left the courtroom.",
      "Prosecutor Sheila Ross said during her opening statement that Ibarra had gone out \"hunting for females\" that morning in February and that he killed Riley after a struggle when she \"refused to be his rape victim.\" Law enforcement officers have testified there was no evidence that Riley was sexually assaulted.",
      "Defense attorney Dustin Kirby said in his opening that Riley's death was a tragedy and called the evidence in the case graphic and disturbing. But he said there is not sufficient evidence to prove that his client killed Riley.",
      "Ross told the judge Monday that she expected to finish calling witnesses Tuesday, and defense attorneys said their witnesses should take half a day at most. Prosecutors had already called nearly two dozen witnesses over the first two days of testimony, Friday and Monday. That included law enforcement officers, Riley's roommates and a woman who lived in the same apartment as Ibarra.",
      "On Monday, prosecutors played a recording of a jail phone call from May between Ibarra and his wife, Layling Franco. FBI specialist Abeisis Ramirez, who translated the call from Spanish, testified that Ibarra told Franco that he had been at the University of Georgia looking for work, and that his wife repeatedly said she was fed up and that she wanted him to tell the truth.",
      "Franco \"continues to ask, 'What happened with the girl?'\" and said Ibarra \"must know something,\" Ramirez said. He responds: \"Layling, enough.\" Ramirez said Franco told Ibarra that it's crazy that police only found his DNA.",
      "Riley's parents, roommates and other friends and family packed the courtroom Friday and again Monday and Tuesday.",
      "Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump, blamed Democratic\u00a0President Joe Biden's border policies\u00a0for her death. As he spoke about border security during his State of the Union address weeks after the killing, Biden mentioned Riley by name.",
      "In March, FBI Director Christopher Wray offered\u00a0unusually expansive comments\u00a0on Riley's murder.",
      "\"I want to tell you how heartbroken I am \u2014 not just for the family, friends, classmates, and staff who are grieving Laken's loss,\" Wray told a group gathered at the University of Georgia. \"I'm saddened to see that sense of peace shattered by Laken's murder and the subsequent arrest of a Venezuelan national who'd illegally entered the country in 2022.\"",
      "He said the FBI was doing \"everything [it] can to help achieve justice for Laken.\"",

    "summary": "The police department has spent $22.6 million in overtime this year for officers working special events \u2014 only about $2 million of which has been reimbursed to the city.",
    "story": [
      "CITY HALL \u2014 The city spent $22.6 million on police overtime for special events this year but has only been reimbursed $2 million, leaving taxpayers to cover the remaining costs.",
      "City law requires special event producers to pay for police services beyond 12 shifts. However, an investigation by Block Club Chicago and CBS Chicago revealed through records requests that the city has not been retroactively charging for those costs.",
      "Chicago hosts hundreds of street festivals each year, with approximately 1,300 events held between 2021 and 2023. During that period, nearly 2,800 Chicago police officers logged a combined total of 27,000 overtime hours to patrol these events, according to a CBS News Data Team analysis of police overtime records and special event permits.",
      "At a Chicago Police budget hearing on Friday, officials confirmed that a significant portion of the overtime associated with special events has gone unreimbursed, attributing the issue to a \"decentralized system.\"",
      "In 2024, the police department spent $22.6 million on special event overtime across various music, street, and neighborhood festivals. About $7.2 million of that is attributed to ticketed events like Lollapalooza, the Chicago Marathon, and NASCAR. However, the city has only been reimbursed for Lollapalooza and the Chase Corporate Challenge, totaling just under $2 million, police officials disclosed on Friday.",
      "The 2024 figures are an increase from 2023, which saw $19.2 million spent in police overtime across all special events, police officials said. It's currently unknown how much of that was reimbursed to the department. Special events include large ticketed festivals, street festivals, athletic events and bar crawls. Chicago hosted 677 special events in 2023, according to records obtained by CBS Chicago.",
      "The revelation aligns with months of unanswered public records requests directed at the Department of Finance, which has been unable to produce invoices for police overtime at street festivals.",
      "While the department did provide invoice data for traffic control aides at events like Riot Fest, Lollapalooza, and several 5Ks, it referred CBS News to the city's Public Safety Administration for police overtime. However, the Public Safety Administration has not responded to records requests for police overtime details and did not return requests for comment.",
      "\"What may make more sense is we can provide all of our historical data about what our costs are, and we can provide that to DCASE, we can provide that to the Department of Finance. We can give a unified city service quote at the front end,\" said Ryan Fitzsimons, Deputy Director at the Chicago Police Department.",
      "During a budget hearing for the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events last week, officials revealed that their department is not involved in the invoicing process for reimbursing police overtime, raising concerns among aldermen that permits are being issued to event producers with outstanding balances.",
      "On Friday, police officials said that despite the lack of reimbursement, they do not have the authority to block special event permits unless there are safety concerns. This lack of enforcement power leads to ongoing accountability issues with invoicing, they noted.",
      "\"We conduct numerous after-action meetings with OEMC and other city agencies. The problem is that, while we identify these reimbursement issues during those meetings, they are not addressed in subsequent permits issued the following year,\" said Chief Duane DeVries, head of the Bureau of Counterterrorism with the Chicago Police Department.",
      "After each permitted special event, the Chicago Police Department generates an \"event evaluation form\" that tracks the number of incidents and officers assigned to the event.",
      "On Friday several aldermen requested event evaluation forms for various Chicago's special events.",
      "In July, the CBS News Data Team and Block Club Chicago requested event evaluation data for various events from 2019 to 2024, including PrideFest, Market Days, Wicker Park Fest, and Lollapalooza. The department said the evaluations were kept on paper. A request for those documents was made in August. As of last week, the department is still working on that request.",
      "All special event producers are required to present security plans to Chicago Police for feedback before the city's events department issues a permit. The amount of private security is determined by various factors, including the event's history, location, current events and crime trends. Event organizers suggest a security plan and the police department approves, denies and makes suggestions.",
      "Because of this, some special event producers have argued that they should not be required to pay for police overtime.",
      "\"It's like someone coming and painting your house and then saying, 'I want you to pay for it.' \u2026 Well, I didn't want you to paint my house,\" Hank Zemola, CEO of Special Events Management, previously said. \"I ordered all this (security) so we wouldn't have to do that.\"",
      "Special Events Management puts on numerous special events including street races and neighborhood street festivals. The company organizes some of the city's most popular street festivals like Pridefest, Ribfest and others.",
      "By city law, street festivals cannot charge an entry fee but can propose suggested donations for entry. With suggested donations in decline, inflation making festivals more expensive to produce and consumers spending less, Zemola estimates that at least 50% of the company's events this year lost money.",
      "Still, with the City Council looking for cost-saving measures aldermen are eager to close the loophole that is hemorrhaging money from this city.",
      "\"I hope that with the information ... your department provides us, we can, from the council side, work on maybe a better process that gives you guys ... a seat at the table ... so that we can better manage and join our resources,\" said Ald. Maria Hadden (49th).",

      "Mani details the grim reality faced by millions of women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule, which drew the attention of Lawrence in 2021.",
      "\"My first reaction when watching that was to do what the Taliban did not want us to do, which was give access and facilities to the people on the ground to capture what was happening on the ground in real-time,\" she said. \"Because obviously the Taliban flourishes in secrecy.\"",
      "Some of the strict limitations imposed on women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule include prohibiting women from working, pursuing education, or even leaving their homes without a male escort. They are also barred from singing, playing music, making films, and, more recently, dining at restaurants or purchasing food in public.",
      "Lawrence and her producing partner, Justine Ciarrocchi, set out to reveal these realities in Afghanistan through the eyes of Afghan women. They enlisted Mani to direct the documentary and Yousafzai joined the project as an executive producer to help amplify its message.",
      "When asked why the Taliban opposes women's education, Yousafzai said, \"We have been trying to figure out an answer to that for the past 30 years\u2026I cannot find any explanation that justifies it to me.

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 11:35:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The move by the president to adjourn Congress to make recess appointments would create a new precedent, experts say, affecting the way presidents see presidential power going forward.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has selected for some of the top roles in his administration controversial picks who may not win universal support from Republican senators. He can only afford to lose a few Republicans in the confirmation process, but he's opened the door to the possibility of forgoing the traditional route altogether, utilizing a Constitutional power known as recess appointments to effectively bypass the Senate \u2014 and swiftly approve his nominees.",
      "The possible strategy, raised by Trump in a post on social media last week, has generated mixed reviews among senators, who would stand to forfeit their key advice and consent role. And the president-elect made it something of a litmus test for Senate leadership as Republicans won majority control in the November elections.",
      "What is a recess appointment?",
      "Though the Senate is tasked with an advice and consent role in the confirmation process, the Constitution's Recess Appointment Clause affords the president the ability to temporarily fill vacancies while the Senate is in recess, and appointees may stay in the role until the end of the following session.",
      "The recess appointments power \"was built for a time when the Senate was not meeting year round,\" says Casey Burgat, the director of the Legislative Affairs Program at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.",
      "\"You were coming from all states, travel was a problem, and horses and carriages, and they would be out of session more often than they were in session,\" Burgat says. \" And so to ensure that the government can continue its work, they gave the president appointment power to name, within recess, someone to take the place.\"",
      "More recently, recess appointments have been used by presidents including President George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama \u2014 Bush and Clinton made over 100 recess appointments \u2014 although they were generally used to fill positions below the Cabinet level. In 2014, the Supreme Court weighed in on a challenge to a handful of Obama appointments, giving the Senate more authority to prevent the maneuver and determining that the chamber must be away for 10 days for recess appointments to occur.",
      "In recent years, the Senate has used pro-forma sessions to gavel in even when the chamber is on recess in part to avoid recess appointments. And paired with the elimination of a 60-vote threshold for nominees in 2013 \u2014 making it easier for the majority to make confirmations \u2014 recess appointments haven't been made in about a decade.",
      "But that could change in Trump's second term. Under the Constitution, both chambers have to agree to adjourn for three days or more. And at Trump's urging, House and Senate Republicans, who are set to narrowly control both chambers in the new Congress, may agree to do so.",
      "Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who last week was elected to serve as Senate majority leader in the new Congress, said \"all options are on the table\" to swiftly approve Trump's nominees after he takes office, including recess appointments. He's suggested that while the typical confirmation process is preferred, if Senate Democrats obstruct the confirmation proceedings, Republicans may have to resort to other options.",
      "Still, pushback from just a handful of Republicans who oppose the recess appointment effort \u2014\u00a0 which would undermine their ability to study nominees, request documents and have a hearing \u2014 could block the move to put the chamber in recess. But experts say Trump could move to adjourn Congress anyway.",
      "Could Trump adjourn Congress to make recess appointments?",
      "The Constitution outlines that a president may adjourn the House and Senate in the case of \"Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment.\" So if one chamber approves a resolution to adjourn and the other votes it down, Trump could theoretically weigh in and declare Congress in recess.",
      "But some experts say that what constitutes a disagreement between the chambers could be interpreted differently, due to the unprecedented nature of the approach, questioning whether a simple lack of action from one chamber after the other approves a resolution to adjourn may be viewed as disagreement.",
      "\"It's not clear at all how this would work,\" says Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, noting that the issue is something that almost certainly would result in litigation.",
      "Glassman said in a scenario where the House tries to force the Senate out of session to make recess appointments, \"it's not clear to me the court is going to like the idea of the president and the House conspiring to end run the Senate on nominations.\"",
      "Trump is \"threatening to turn the Constitution's appointment process for Cabinet officers on its head\" with the recess appointments strategy, Edward Whelan, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, warned in an op-ed in the Washington Post. He urged that House Speaker Mike Johnson, who would be a key player in Trump's ability to unilaterally adjourn Congress, \"can and should immediately put an end to this scheme.\"",
      "But Johnson on Sunday left the door open to the strategy, saying on Fox News when asked whether he would take steps to put Congress in recess that a president should be able to \"choose his team,\" and \"if this thing bogs down, it would be a great detriment to the country.\" But he acknowledged that he's \"very hopeful\" the Senate will do its job and move the nominees along.",
      "The move by the president to adjourn Congress to make recess appointments would create a new precedent, experts say, affecting the way presidents see presidential power going forward.",
      "\"When they may see a power deferred to them, they're very reluctant to give it back going forward,\" Burgat says. \"The minute you cross the red line, all of a sudden, that red line looks like it didn't matter at all in the first place.\"",

    "story": [
      "A so-called \"doomsday fish\" has washed up on a Southern California beach \u2014 typically an extremely rare occurrence, but this is the second time this year it has happened. The rare oarfish found on Grandview Beach in Encinitas measured roughly 9 to 10 feet and was spotted by a doctoral candidate at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, the school wrote on social media.",
      "The doomsday fish got its name because it looks like a mythical sea creature, with a long, ribbon-shaped body that can grow up to 30 feet, according to Ocean Conservancy.",
      "After doctoral candidate Alison Laferriere found the odd-looking fish \u2014 which resembles a larger-than-normal eel with a monstrous face \u2014 Ben Frable, manager of the Scripps Oceanography Marine Vertebrate Collection, contacted the\u00a0NOAA Fisheries Service\u00a0team to bring the animal to its Southwest Fisheries Science Center.",
      "\ud83d\udc1f Just when you thought the oarfish hype had died down \u2026 Look what decided to make another appearance!\n\n\ud83c\udf0a Last week,...",
      "This oarfish is smaller than the one found in La Jolla in August 2024. Researchers are not yet sure why the rare fish has washed up on California beaches recently, and there have been few studies on the species.",
      "Only 20 oarfish have\u00a0washed up in California\u00a0since 1901, according to the Scripps Institute. And these deep-sea dwellers usually only come ashore when they are sick, dying or disoriented, Ocean Conservatory says.",
      "\"It may have to do with changes in ocean conditions and increased numbers of oarfish off our coast,\" Frable said, according to the institute's social media post. \"Many researchers have suggested this as to why deep-water fish strand on beaches. Sometimes it may be linked to broader shifts such as the El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a cycle but this is not always the case. There was a weak El Ni\u00f1o earlier this year. This wash-up coincided with the recent red tide and Santa Ana winds last week but many variables could lead to these strandings.\"",
      "The researchers at Scripps took samples and froze the specimen to further study the oarfish and its biology, anatomy, geonomics and history, according to Frable.",
      "In a comment on the post, the institute cleared up a myth surrounding doomsday fish. \"There have been many questions and comments about the connection between oarfish and earthquakes,\" the comment states. \"While oarfish have a mythical reputation as predictors of natural disasters and earthquakes, experts have debunked this as folklore. A 2019 study found no correlation between oarfish or ribbonfish strandings and earthquakes in Japan.\"",
      "The aforementioned study, published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, looked at reports of oarfish and slender ribbonfish in Japanese newspapers. Japanese folklore says the appearance of these fish means an earthquake is coming, but the researchers found there was hardly a relationship between these fish and the occurrence of earthquakes and that newspapers likely reported the fish sightings \"because rare appearances might attract readers,\" according to the study.",
      "Oarfish typically live in the mesopelagic zone \u2014 the area of the ocean\u00a0least explored\u00a0by scientists.

      "\"These harsh sentences erode confidence in Hong Kong's judicial system and harm the city's international reputation,\" said spokesperson Matthew Miller on Tuesday.",
      "The department said it plans to \"impose new visa restrictions on multiple Hong Kong officials responsible for implementing\" the security law.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 13:22:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Canada legalized medically assisted dying in 2016. It was set to expand to patients suffering solely from mental illness last year, but it hasn't \u2014 yet.",
    "story": [
      "When Savannah Meadows had lunch last October with her mother, Sharon Turcott, Meadows was \"all smiles,\" the mother told CBS News.",
      "\"Maybe she's turned a corner,\" Turcott recalled thinking about her daughter, who had been struggling with serious mental illness.",
      "The next morning, she received a scheduled email: \"Mom, if you're reading this, I'm probably on my way to heaven,\" it said. Her daughter had taken her own life at the age of 44.",
      "\"She did not want to die by suicide. She did not want to die alone,\" Turcott said.",
      "Instead, Meadows had been seeking a medically assisted death \u2014 something Canada legalized in 2016. It had been set to expand last year to patients who were suffering solely from mental illness, but that expansion was delayed, and Meadows ultimately died by suicide.",
      "The delay has been welcomed by some, but condemned by others.",
      "The history of Canada's, still evolving MAID law",
      "In 2016, Canada enacted a law allowing medical assistance in dying, known as MAID, for people whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Under the law, following a process establishing that all eligibility criteria have been met, a physician or nurse either directly administers a substance that induces death or prescribes a drug that the person takes themselves.",
      "Five years later, the law was expanded, no longer requiring a person's death to be reasonably foreseeable as an eligibility criterion for adults with a grievous and irremediable medical condition. Under the changes, individuals suffering solely from mental illness were temporarily excluded for eligibility until March 2023.",
      "Meadows, described by her mother as a proud trans woman, had picked a date and began preparations for the end of her life.",
      "\"It gave me time to accept the fact that my daughter was going to die,\" Turcott said.",
      "A few days before Meadows would potentially have been eligible to seek a medically assisted death, however, the government announced a yearlong delay for the consideration of cases of mental illness. Seven months later, Meadows died by suicide.",
      "The delayed inclusion of patients seeking MAID on the basis of mental illness has been met with apprehension from the start.",
      "Canada's Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness, established to assist in developing the government's approach to the expansion of the law, outlined concerns in a 2022 report, including the daunting task for clinicians asked to make predictions about individual patients and establish incurability and irreversibility despite the difficulties of predicting the evolution of mental disorders.",
      "Another factor was what the report referred to as structural vulnerability, or the risk of factors such as unstable housing or lack of employment opportunities resulting in individuals viewing death as an only option.",
      "The panel offered a number of recommendations in its report for establishing an expanded MAID regime.",
      "The future of the MAID law's expansion, however, is also dependent to some degree on domestic politics, which appear set to shift. Pierre Poilievre, whose Conservative Party is up by a significant margin in polls ahead of national elections set to take place within a year, has vowed to \"revoke entirely\" the expansion of the law to include solely mental health cases, arguing that it blurred a line \"between suicide prevention and suicide  assistance.\"",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to.\"",
      "Since her daughter's death, meanwhile, Turcott has become an advocate for MAID access for those whose sole underlying condition is mental illness.",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to, and because that's what she wanted, that would have been fine with me,\" Turcott said. \"Suicide was not fine with me.\"",
      "In February, the government further postponed MAID eligibility for patients whose sole condition is mental illness until March 2027 \u2014 four years after it was initially slated to go into effect.",
      "Mark Holland, Canada's Minister of Health, said that while \"significant progress has been made in supporting practitioners in assessing MAID eligibility in complex cases,\" the country's health system was \"not yet ready for MAID where the sole underlying condition is mental illness.\"",
      "The delay has been condemned by some MAID advocates. Dying With Dignity Canada, an organization that advocates for end-of-life rights, filed a lawsuit in August alleging discriminatory exclusion in the law against people with mental illness.",
      "An ongoing debate over access to MAID",
      "Others, however, view the delay as a step to ensure necessary safeguards are in place and health care providers are prepared to handle relevant cases. The Canada Mental Health Association said in a January statement that it supported the postponement, citing what it called insufficient time and resources allocated to ensure that people with mental illnesses can access the necessary care.",
      "Some groups oppose the law's expansion outright. In September, Inclusion Canada, a nonprofit group that advocates for Canadians with intellectual disabilities, filed a lawsuit challenging MAID for people with a disability who are not dying or whose death is not \"reasonably foreseeable.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues that MAID Track 2, the 2021 expansion of the law to include patients whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, had already resulted in premature deaths.",
      "\"People are dying. We are witnessing an alarming trend where people with disabilities are seeking assisted suicide due to social deprivation, poverty and lack of essential supports,\" Krista Carr, executive vice-president of Inclusion Canada, said in September.",
      "Compounding CMHA and Inclusion Canada's concerns, an expert committee of professionals from disciplines including ethics, social work and medicine that reviewed MAID deaths in Ontario identified cases in which it said isolation and unmet social needs, such as housing, had fueled several euthanasia recipient's requests.",
      "The committee also found that patients seeking eligibility under the expanded Track 2 criteria were about 8% more likely to reside in areas of the province with high levels of social marginalization than MAID Track 1 recipients.",
      "The committee's report acknowledged that while the deaths discussed were not necessarily representative of frequent reasons for accessing MAID Track 2, or even the majority of MAID Track 2 deaths, the themes identified were \"not uncommon within the MAID review process.\"",
      "Out of 4,644 medically assisted deaths carried out during 2023 under Canada's MAID law, only 116 deaths were Track 2 patients, according to the committee.",
      "But the report's findings don't resonate with everyone, and opposition to the law's proposed inclusion of patients who suffer from only mental illness has been deeply frustrating for some people seeking MAID.",
      "Jason, a Toronto resident who didn't want to be fully identified over concerns that his future MAID review process could be affected, is one of those people.",
      "\"When I first heard that it was delayed, my world came crashing down,\" he said.",
      "Jason told CBS News that he's struggled with depression, anxiety and panic attacks for decades, and has attempted suicide twice. He said he's tried inpatient programs, medication, electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine treatment, among other remedies, to little avail.",
      "\"I would not be alive today if there wasn't the possibility of MAID going through in 2027,\" he said, saying the chance of MAID's expansion was the only reason he hadn't attempted suicide a third time.",
      "The current safeguards for those seeking MAID whose death is not reasonably foreseeable include two independent practitioners \u2014 one of whom must have expertise in the condition affecting the patient \u2014 confirming that all eligibility criteria are met, a minimum period of 90 days for eligibility assessments to be made, and the opportunity for the patient to withdraw consent at any point up until the procedure is carried out.",
      "The patient must also be informed of counseling and palliative care options, support for disabilities and mental health, and be offered consultation with relevant professionals in addition to having discussed with their practitioner \"reasonable and available means to relieve the person's suffering, and agree [with the practitioner] that the person has seriously considered these means.\"",
      "In a poll conducted in 2023 by Dying with Dignity Canada, 78% of respondents said they supported the removal of the \"reasonably foreseeable\" natural death requirement from the MAID law, indicating strong support for the Track 2 expansion. But a 2017 survey gauging the attitudes of Canadian psychiatrists toward medical assistance in death found only a minority of 29.4% supported MAID on the basis of mental illness alone, compared to 71.8% who said other factors should also be present to determine eligibility.",
      "Jason said he understood some doctors' opposition to MAID for mental illness.",
      "\"Doctors are there to make you better,\" he said. But he added that as mental illness isn't something that \"shows up on a screen,\" it can be difficult for people without direct experience to understand the extent of someone else's pain.",
      "\"I don't have the physical pain that someone else has, but the psychological pain is just as bad,\" he said.",
      "In 2022, MAID deaths accounted for 4.1% of overall deaths in Canada, with the average age of MAID patients being 77, according to Canada's fourth and most recent annual report on Medical Assistance in Dying. Since the law was introduced in 2016 there have been a total of 44,958 medically assisted deaths in the country.",
      "Jason said he didn't want to put his family through the trauma of another suicide attempt, and that his brother and mother were helping him explore options abroad. Those options, especially for people suffering mental illness, are limited, and often complicated by varying domestic laws around the world.",
      "Jason said that, like Turcott, his own mother is supportive of his choice to seek MAID.",
      "\"As much as she doesn't want me to do this again, she would rather I die properly with the assistance of a doctor than have it done by suicide,\" he said.",
      "Turcott said she was concerned that the postponement of MAID on the basis of mental health would result in more suicides, leaving families to mourn unexpectedly.",
      "\"I don't want anybody to experience the loss of their child through suicide, and their child being so desperate that they saw no other choice but to take their life,\" she said.",

      "A powerful new documentary is exposing the harsh realities faced by women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. The film, \"Bread &\u00a0Roses,\" is directed by Afghan filmmaker Sahra Mani, produced by Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence\u00a0and executive produced by Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai.",
      "Mani details the grim reality faced by millions of women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule, which drew the attention of Lawrence in 2021.",
      "\"My first reaction when watching that was to do what the Taliban did not want us to do, which was give access and facilities to the people on the ground to capture what was happening on the ground in real-time,\" she said. \"Because obviously the Taliban flourishes in secrecy.\"",
      "Some of the strict limitations imposed on women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule include prohibiting women from working, pursuing education, or even leaving their homes without a male escort. They are also barred from singing, playing music, making films, and, more recently, dining at restaurants or purchasing food in public.",
      "Lawrence and her producing partner, Justine Ciarrocchi, set out to reveal these realities in Afghanistan through the eyes of Afghan women. They enlisted Mani to direct the documentary and Yousafzai joined the project as an executive producer to help amplify its message.",
      "When asked why the Taliban opposes women's education, Yousafzai said, \"We have been trying to figure out an answer to that for the past 30 years\u2026I cannot find any explanation that justifies it to me. How can you stop a girl from her school? They come up with these excuses that it's culture, it's religion. There is no culture, excuse. The true representatives of that culture are the Afghan women and girls that we've seen in the documentary.\"",
      "The documentary follows three Afghan women who secretly filmed their protests. Mani said she wanted to capture the intimate moment of their life and give people an opportunity to see what life is like for Afghan woman under a Taliban dictatorship. But she also wanted to encourage by highlighting their strength.",
      "It's a reality that Lawrence said would be difficult to experience.",

      "\"There's 20 million women whose lives are in danger,\" she said.",
      "Yousafzai, who survived a Taliban attack in 2012, reflected on the ongoing fight for women's rights.",
      "\"What really shook me was the fact that people stand with you once you have survived, but we don't look at people who are still under a big threat,\" she said. \"Let's share our solidarity with them.\"",

    "story": [
      "In the wake of former President Donald Trump's re-election, Israel's far-right minister of finance suggested the country would look to annex the occupied West Bank in 2025. Here's what you need to know:",
      "What is the West Bank?",
      "The West Bank is an area of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, which is part of the former British-mandated territory of Palestine. It is surrounded by Israel on three sides \u2014 the north, west, and south \u2014 and it borders the country of Jordan on its east, across the river.",
      "After the departure of British forces in 1948 when the modern state of Israel was created, Arab forces entered and retained the West Bank, and the city of Jerusalem was divided into two sectors: the Israeli west and the Jordanian east.",
      "During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel occupied the West Bank and established a military administration there. Israel claimed East Jerusalem as part of its own territory, but fighting between the Israelis and the region's Palestinian inhabitants \u2014 who live with significant restrictions on their movement and other aspects of life under the decades-long occupation \u2014 has continued.",
      "Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel, decisively won a 2006 West Bank parliamentary election over the Western-backed Fatah faction, led by Mahmoud Abbas, which had been administering the Palestinian Authority. The Hamas victory brought sanctions and boycotts by the U.S., the EU and Israel of the new, Hamas-led joint Palestinian leadership.",
      "In 2007, Abbas dissolved the Hamas-led administration in the West Bank and created an emergency cabinet that favored Fatah. The power struggle between the two Palestinian factions led to a split between the West Bank and Gaza, with Western powers supporting the Fatah-administered West Bank diplomatically and economically, while blockading the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.",
      "How could U.S. policy change during the second Trump administration?",
      "The longstanding position of the United States has been support for a two-state solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, meaning the creation of an independent state of Palestine alongside the independent state of Israel. Most iterations of this policy envision a future Palestinian state made up of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as Gaza.",
      "Trump's previous administration bucked tradition, but did not flat-out reject a two-state solution. Trump moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and offered a plan that would have cemented Israeli control over the entire city. It also would have protected Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which are illegal under international law, while moving toward Palestinian self-rule.",
      "President-elect Trump's pick to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas governor and Baptist preacher Mike Huckabee, has never supported a two-state solution.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press when he was running to be the Republican presidential nominee in 2015, Huckabee said that, if elected, his administration would formally recognize the West Bank as part of Israel.",
      "\"I feel that we have a responsibility to respect that this is land that has historically belonged to the Jews,\" Huckabee told the AP.",
      "In a podcast interview earlier this year, Huckabee said that there \"isn't such a thing\" as Palestinians, describing himself as an \"unapologetic, unreformed Zionist.\" He voiced similar views during his campaign in 2008.",
      "Israel \"is an extraordinary oasis in a land of totalitarianism surrounded by tyranny,\" he said on the podcast earlier this year.",
      "Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for Secretary of State, has repeatedly voiced support for the Israeli government's response to Hamas' brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack.",
      "\"Although the Biden-Harris Administration has publicly backed Israel's right to defend itself, it has also undercut Israel's maneuverability, leading to a schizophrenic policy towards the region,\" Rubio said in a letter to current Secretary of State Antony Blinken in August.",
      "Voicing his objection to U.S. sanctions against individuals alleged to be supporting \"extremist settler violence\" against Palestinians in the West Bank, Rubio wrote that, \"Israel has consistently sought peace with the Palestinians. It is unfortunate that the Palestinians, whether it be the Palestinian Authority or FTOs such as Hamas, have rejected such overtures. Israelis rightfully living in their historic homeland are not the impediment to peace; the Palestinians are.\"",
      "Israel's far-right government says it's preparing for annexation of the West Bank",
      "Some of those who do not support the creation of an independent Palestinian state do support Israel's annexation of the West Bank, including members of the current far-right Israeli government led by Netanyahu.",
      "Netanyahu's Likud party is currently part of a coalition, formed to keep Netanyahu in power, with radical right-wing nationalist parties such as the Religious Zionist Party.",
      "Netanyahu, who has spoken out against the creation of a Palestinian state, committed to pursuing the annexation of the West Bank in Likud's coalition agreement with the Religious Zionist Party.",
      "\"The people of Israel have a natural right to the Land of Israel,\" the agreement says. \"In light of the belief in the aforementioned right, the Prime Minister will lead the formulation and promotion of a policy within the framework of which sovereignty will be applied in the West Bank, while choosing the timing and considering all national and international interests of the state of Israel.\"",
      "Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli finance minister who's a member of the Religious Zionist Party, said he believed Israel could work with the incoming Trump administration to promote annexation of the West Bank.",
      "\"I am convinced that we will be able to work closely together with President-elect Trump and all members of the incoming administration, to promote the common values and interests of the two countries, to strengthen the strength and security of the State of Israel, to expand the circle of peace and stability in the Middle East out of strength and faith and on the basis of recognition in the unquestionable historical belonging of the whole Land of Israel to the people of Israel,\" Smotrich said on social media.",
      "Israeli settlements and smaller outposts in the West Bank are illegal under international law. They're also seen as a barrier to a potential two-state solution, because the more Israeli Jews live in the occupied territory, the less likely it seems that Israel would ever abandon control of the land for it to become part of a Palestinian state.",
      "A Pew Research Center survey carried out in the summer found Israelis divided on the potential security risks and benefits of continued settlement expansion, with 40% of respondents saying they help make Israel more secure and 35% saying they hurt security. The survey found 21% of Israelis didn't believe settlement expansion would have any significant impact on security.",
      "Some Israeli activists believe their government is taking advantage of the country's collective grief after the Oct. 7 attack to push an agenda in the West Bank that doesn't have broad public backing.",
      "\"In Israel, there's very little public criticism or any sort of public debate on what is going on in the West Bank,\" Sarit Michaeli, international advocacy lead for the Jerusalem-based rights group B'Tselem, told CBS News of the situation post-Oct. 7 attack. \"Israelis are furious. They're angry. They're hurt. They're traumatized, and this collective trauma has been exploited by our government to push forward policies that most Israelis don't necessarily agree with in the West Bank.\"",
      "In June, the Israeli body that governs the West Bank transferred many powers over the territory from Israeli military officials to civil ones, who work under Smotrich.",
      "Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, the monitoring group Peace Now says it has documented at least 43 new illegal outposts in the West Bank, mostly on farmland. Dozens of new roads have been paved to facilitate the establishment of these outposts, the group said.",
      "What would it mean if Israel does annex the West Bank?",
      "In 2020, Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) analyzed what Israeli annexation of the West Bank could actually entail. They looked at three possible scenarios, with Israel either taking full security and administrative control of a portion of the Palestinian territory, or just preventing future evacuation of existing Israeli settlements.",
      "In all three of the scenarios examined, Israeli sovereignty would not necessarily be applied in full to Palestinians in the area. If it were to be, Palestinians would live under the jurisdiction of the State of Israel and, under Israeli law, would be entitled to request citizenship.",
      "The INSS said annexing West Bank territory would make it harder for future Israeli governments to give up that land as part of any deal to create a Palestinian state.",
      "\"In actuality, annexation means tying the hands of future Israeli governments that would be willing to transfer territories for a political settlement,\" the INSS report said.",
      "One senior Palestinian politician in Gaza recently told CBS News that regardless of what changes Israel ushers in under the new leadership in Washington, it would not end the Palestinian people's decades-long fight for a state of their own.",
      "\"We will struggle for our rights,\" Mustafa Barghouti, a doctor in Gaza and the leader of the Palestinian National Initiative party, told CBS News. The Palestinian National Initiative party champions a unified democratic government for both the West Bank and Gaza.",
      "\"It will take time. We will suffer. We know that. But what's the alternative? To cease to exist? It's ethnic cleansing. We cannot accept that,\" Barghouti said.",

    "summary": "Parts of the Great Barrer Reef have suffered the highest coral mortality on record, Australian researchers say, and they fear the rest of it has suffered a similar fate.",
    "story": [
      "Parts of the Great Barrer Reef have suffered the highest coral mortality on record, Australian research showed Tuesday, with scientists fearing the rest of it has suffered a similar fate.",
      "The Australian Institute of Marine Science said surveys of 12 reefs found up to 72 percent coral mortality, thanks to a summer of mass bleaching, two cyclones, and flooding.",
      "In one northern section of the reef, about a third of hard coral had died, the \"largest annual decline\" in 39 years of government monitoring, the agency said.",
      "Often dubbed the world's largest living structure, the Great Barrier Reef is a 1,400-mile expanse of tropical corals that house a stunning array of biodiversity.",
      "But repeated mass bleaching events have threatened to rob the tourist drawcard of its wonder, turning banks of once-vibrant corals into a sickly shade of white.",
      "Bleaching occurs when water temperatures rise and the coral expels microscopic algae, known as zooxanthellae, to survive.",
      "If high temperatures persist, the coral can eventually turn white and die.",
      "This year had already been confirmed as the fifth mass bleaching on the reef in the past eight years.",
      "But this latest survey also found a rapid-growing type of coral -- known as acropora -- had suffered the highest rate of death.",
      "This coral is quick to grow, but one of the first to bleach.",
      "Lead researcher Mike Emslie told public broadcaster ABC the past summer was \"one of the most severe events\" across the Great Barrier Reef, with heat stress levels surpassing previous events.",
      "\"These are serious impacts. These are serious losses,\" he said.",
      "World Wildlife Fund-Australia's head of oceans, Richard Leck, said the initial surveys confirmed his \"worst fears.\"",
      "\"The Great Barrier Reef can bounce back but there are limits to its resilience,\" he said. \"It can't get repeatedly hammered like this. We are fast approaching a tipping point.\"",
      "Leck added the area surveyed was \"relatively small\" and feared that when the full report was released next year \"similar levels of mortality\" would be observed.",
      "He said the findings reinforced Australia's need to commit to stronger emission reduction targets of at least 90 percent below 2005 levels by 2035 and move away from fossil fuels.",
      "The country is one of the world's largest gas and coal exporters and has only recently set targets to become carbon neutral.",

    "story": [
      "Taipei, Taiwan\u00a0\u2014   Numerous children were injured by a vehicle outside an elementary school in central China's Hunan province on Tuesday, reports said. Hours after the incident, the casualty count was unclear and authorities had yet to clarify if it was an accident or a deliberate attack. The incident follows a series of recent killings or attacks in China by people in vehicles or wielding knives, including others at schools.",
      "Students were arriving for classes around 8 a.m. at Yong'an Elementary School in the city of Changde when a small white SUV drove into a crowd of children and adults, according to state media. Few details were released, reflecting China's reflexive inclination to suppress news about crime, protests and major accidents that could erode public confidence in the ruling Communist Party's self-declared ability to maintain social order.",
      "Several adults were also injured, the official Xinhua News Agency said, adding that the driver was subdued by parents and security guards and some of the injured were immediately sent to the hospital.",
      "Police in the city's Dingcheng district, where the school is located, issued a statement saying no one had life-threatening injuries and identifying the driver as a 39-year-old man surnamed Huang, who was under detention. It said the incident was under investigation but gave no word on the cause or other details.",
      "Footage posted on Chinese social media showed the injured lying on the road while terrified students ran past the gate and inside the schoolhouse.",

      "The Chinese government generally censors internet content it deems overly sensitive or political, and some images of the school incident were quickly taken down. Most Western social media sites and search engines like Google are blocked in China, limiting available content even while some people use tools like VPNs and send news through Chinese social media before the censors have time to catch it.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 04:21:05 -0500",
    "summary": "A Russian lawmaker calls President Biden's decision to let Ukraine fire U.S. missiles deep into Russia a \"very big step toward the beginning\" of a third world war.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to fire U.S.-made and supplied missiles deeper into Russia \u2014 a major policy shift announced over the weekend after months of intense lobbying by Kyiv \u2014 has drawn a furious response from Moscow. While there was no immediate reaction directly from the man who launched the nearly three-year war on his neighboring nation, lawmakers aligned with President Vladimir Putin in Russia said Monday that the move was unacceptable and warned it could lead to a third world war.",
      "Mr. Biden authorized Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to use American-made missiles with a range of about 190 miles, known as ATACMS, to strike deeper inside Russian territory than the Ukrainians have to date.",
      "So far, Ukraine's attacks beyond the immediate border region inside Russia have been limited to non-U.S. \u2014 and much less potent\u2014\u00a0 weapons such as explosive drones. ATACMS are far more destructive and harder to shoot down as they head for their programmed targets.",
      "Zelenskyy's government had been pushing Washington for permission to use the missiles for long-range attacks for some time but the Biden administration had been reluctant given concerns about potentially escalating the war.",
      "Over the weekend, however, the calculus apparently changed. The decision came almost 1,000 days into the full-scale war in Ukraine, and with Mr. Biden about two months away from handing over the White House keys to President-elect\u00a0Trump, who's seen as far less supportive of Ukraine's ambitions of hanging onto all of its Russian-occupied territory.",
      "It also came as Russia hit Ukraine with a devastating missile attack, highlighting Ukraine's desperate desire for the ability to target Russian weapons systems deeper inside the country before they're launched, which Zelenskyy has stressed for more than a year.",
      "Many of the Russian rockets launched Sunday targeted energy infrastructure but a ballistic missile carrying cluster munitions also struck a residential part of the northern city of Sumy, killing 11 people, including two children, and leaving more than 80 others wounded. Fresh strikes hit apartment buildings in the southern city of Odesa on Monday, killing at least eight people including a child, regional authorities said.",
      "Residents in Sumy were targeted as they slept, and Ukrainian officials called the Sunday missile and drone salvo one of the largest Russian attacks since the start of the war.",
      "With the change in policy from the outgoing administration in Washington, Ukrainian forces will be able to retaliate harder, reaching further into Russia than ever before. Ukrainian forces have launched drone attacks into Russian territory, including targeting Moscow, for months, but with limited effect.",
      "Zelenskyy welcomed the change in U.S. policy, saying \"strikes are not made with words\u2026 The missiles will speak for themselves.\"",
      "But Ukraine's war-time leader also appeared to acknowledge the change in tack in Washington that Trump's second swearing-in will bring, with a far greater emphasis expected on striking a negotiated truce than on defending Ukraine's sovereign territory from unilateral annexation by Russia.",
      "\"It is certain that the war will end sooner with the policies of the team that will now lead the White House. This is their approach, their promise to their citizens,\" Zelenskyy said in an interview with a Ukrainian news outlet, adding that Ukraine \"must do everything so that this war ends next year, ends through diplomatic means.\"",
      "In Moscow, meanwhile, senior lawmaker Leonid Slutsky slammed Mr. Biden, accusing him of deciding \"to end his presidential term and go down in history as 'Bloody Joe'.\"",
      "Senator Vladimir Dzhabarov, meanwhile, told Russia's state-run Tass news agency that Biden's decision represented \"a very big step toward the beginning of the third world war.\"",
      "The official newspaper of the Russian state, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, warned \"the madmen who are drawing NATO into a direct conflict with our country may soon be in great pain.\"",
      "Putin had personally warned against the eventuality previously, issuing a warning in September that U.S. permission for Ukraine to fire American-supplied long-range missiles at his country, \"would mean that NATO countries, the United States, and European countries, are parties to the war in Ukraine.\"",
      "But Putin himself has dramatically raised the stakes in the war since then, by overseeing the deployment of at least 11,000 North Korean troops to fight alongside Russian forces. According to U.S. and South Korean officials, they've joined the battle in Russia's western Kursk region, a significant portion of which Ukrainian troops occupied earlier this year in a surprise offensive.",
      "According to John Sullivan, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Russia under both Trump and Mr. Biden, it may have been that move by Putin \u2014 \"really solidifying this as a global conflict with troops from North Korea fighting in Europe\" \u2014 that proved to be \"the last straw\" for the current U.S. president.",
      "\"It's been one escalation after another by Putin and, in my opinion, it was about time that the United States gave the Ukrainians the ability to defend themselves more completely,\" Sullivan said Monday on CBS Mornings.",
      "The parameters of the permission granted to Ukraine for the use of the ATACMS haven't been confirmed, but according to reports, they include \u2014 and may be limited to \u2014 Ukraine using the missiles to attack Russian defensive positions in Kursk.",
      "James Nixey, who heads the Russia and Eurasia program at the London-based Chatham House think tank, said in an analysis Monday that the change in policy from Washington was \"not a game changer,\" especially if it included a limitation on where Ukraine can use the ATACMS.",
      "\"The relaxation of range limits for Ukraine's usage of US ATACMS follows the overall pattern of America's approach to this war: to make sure Ukraine cannot inflict significant damage on Russia\u2026 but to allow small increases in hardware provision and their usage over extended periods of time,\" he said. \"If it is true that the authorization for usage extends only to the Kursk region (and is therefore primarily directed at North Korean troops); then, again, this fits the pattern, and means the overall effects on the war will be negligible.\"",

    "summary": "The sister of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, an American activist killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, says her idealistic vision of the U.S. has been shattered.",
    "story": [
      "More than two months after American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi was killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, allegedly by a member of Israel's security forces, her family tells CBS News their faith in the United States has been shattered due to the lack of any independent criminal investigation.",
      "Eygi's husband Hamid Ali said he was appalled by the reaction of the Biden administration.",
      "\"I would hope that the U.S. government is able to implement its own law in this case and withhold, at the very least, funding from its own taxpayers that went to this unit or this soldier that killed one of its own citizens,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Neither the Biden administration nor any U.S. law enforcement agency has announced an investigation into Eygi's killing. The State Department told CBS News it continues pushing to see the results of a \"full, transparent\" Israeli probe.",
      "Eygi's sister, \u00d6zden Bennett, said the Biden administration's response had made the grieving process \"even more heartbreaking and painful.\"",
      "\"No family should have to experience this,\" she told CBS News, with tears in her eyes.",
      "Bennett said that growing up in the U.S., she had developed an idealistic vision of the country and its values but her sister's death \"shattered\" those ideas.",
      "\"It feels like they don't care about all U.S. citizens the same way,\" she said. \"The U.S. government, or the Biden administration particularly, not opening an investigation makes us question why it is not being equally treated.\"",
      "Witnesses, her family, and the group Eygi had joined at a protest have said the U.S.-Turkish dual national was shot in the head by an Israeli sniper as she stood under a tree in the West Bank city of Nablus.",
      "She was shot not long after joining a protest organized by the International Solidarity Movement, at which the Israel Defense Forces said some demonstrators had thrown projectiles at troops. Witnesses said she was shot after the protest, and away from where it had taken place.",
      "The IDF said an initial inquiry found it was \"highly likely that she was hit indirectly and unintentionally\" by a member of the Israeli security forces. The IDF told CBS News on Thursday that it was unable to provide any further detail on its ongoing investigation.",
      "A State Department spokesperson told CBS News last week that the U.S. has continued to press Israel for \"a full, transparent, and rapid investigation.\"",
      "\"We are eager to see the findings as soon as possible, including any appropriate accountability measures that will be taken,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Asked whether the U.S. government intended to launch its own criminal investigation into Eygi's killing, the White House referred CBS News back to President Biden's statement from September, in which he said Israel had \"acknowledged its responsibility for Aysenur's death,\" and that the U.S. had \"full access to Israel's preliminary investigation, and expects continued access as the investigation continues, so that we can have confidence in the result.\"",
      "But Eygi's father, Mehmet Suat Eygi, said it seemed to have become the norm for the U.S. government to downplay the killing of Americans by Israeli forces. He said his daughter's death reminded him of the deaths of other U.S. nationals in the Palestinian territories, particularly Rachel Corrie and Shireen Abu Akleh.",
      "\"It's beyond disappointment,\" the bereaved father told CBS News. \"The reaction of the U.S. government only asserts that Israel could kill anyone and there would be no consequences.\"",
      "He emigrated to the Seattle area in 1999, when his daughter was 10 months old, and was naturalized in 2005. Aysenur Eygi grew up in the Pacific Northwest and graduated from the University of Washington in the spring of 2024. She had planned to start a PhD program after taking a gap year off.",
      "\"The safety of American citizens should not be tied to their ideological support to Israel,\" Eygi's father told CBS News.",
      "Samah Park Imtiaz was a close friend of Eygi. Sobbing quietly, she recalled to CBS News their last phone call, when Eygi told her how much she missed her cat.",
      "\"I am still in a dream state when I think about what happened,\" Imtiaz said. \"[Biden] said whoever hurt Americans would face consequences. We are Americans and we deserve answers.\"",
      "In September, 103 members of the U.S. Congress signed a letter to Mr. Biden urging the administration to launch an independent investigation into Eygi's killing.",
      "\"To walk away without asking further questions gives Israeli forces unacceptable license to act with impunity,\" the lawmakers said.",
      "Brad Parker, a member of the legal team supporting Eygi's family, called the Biden administration's response thus far \"underwhelming,\" and said it was \"concerning\" that there had not been a \"strong sign to pursue justice for Aysenur.\"",
      "\"I think it's the policy at this point, which can be characterized as providing impunity to Israeli forces, even in the killing of American citizens,\" he told CBS News. \"The focus has been on having the Israeli military adjust [its] rules of engagement, rather than justice and accountability for specific killings of American citizens.\"",
      "Eygi's husband, Ali, said Israel's close alliance with the U.S. should not make it immune to consequences.",
      "\"Israel has a history of not being forthcoming with any kind of investigation and, when they are, it is largely inadequate what they come up with,\" he said.",
      "His sister-in-law said the Biden administration had yet to address the family's pain, \"aside from condolences.\"",
      "\"If the U.S. government does not respond to cases like hers, which historically they have not, Israel has the green light to continue acting with impunity and killing other citizens,\" Bennett asserted.",

    "summary": "Gazans say they'd welcome Trump making good on his vow to end the war, but not \"at the expense of the Palestinian people.\"",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv\u00a0\u2014 After more than a year of bombing and homelessness, Gazans are looking to a new administration in Washington for help. President-elect Donald Trump's election victory has raised hopes and fears among the five million residents of the Palestinian territories \u2014 the war-torn Gaza Strip and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",
      "Gaza resident Rakan Abdul Ahman told CBS News he wants the new U.S. president to make Israel end the war.",
      "\"We've witnessed enough killing of women and children,\" he said. \"I'm looking for Trump to end the suffering in the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "In the eyes of Ahmed Harb, a Gazan journalist, the incoming Trump administration faces a real test. In his victory speech, Trump said he'd end wars. Harb hopes that means the one in Gaza.",
      "\"I hope he was telling the truth,\" he told CBS News, adding: \"But he shouldn't stop the war at the expense of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "That is the big worry for Palestinian politicians, too, including Mustafa Barghouti. Still a practicing physician, he leads the Palestinian National Initiative, a party that champions democratic government for all Palestinians in both the West Bank and Gaza.",
      "The question, Barghouti said, is \"how you stop the war? Do you stop it by annexing occupied territories? By ethnically cleansing Palestinians? Or do you stop the war by forcing Israel to end its illegal policy of settling Israelis on our land?\"",
      "Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, sparked by the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group's massacre of some 1,200 people on Oct. 7, 2023, has diverted international attention away from growing violence in the West Bank by Israeli settlers determined to encroach on what has been Palestinian land.",
      "In 2023, there were a record number of so-called outposts \u2014 makeshift Jewish encampments set up by settlers in what has been Palestinian land. They can be as simple as a couple of shipping containers that function as a de-facto Jewish real estate claim. The settler groups then lobby Israel's courts and government to retroactively make the outposts official Jewish settlements.",
      "Right-wingers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet support Jewish expansion, including the outposts, in the West Bank. They openly advocate driving the Palestinians out, and annexing the whole area for Israel. Not only would that be illegal under international law, Barghouti warns that it would also lead to even more conflict.",
      "\"We will struggle for our rights,\" he said. \"It will take time. We will suffer. We know that. But what's the alternative? To cease to exist? It's ethnic cleansing. We cannot accept that.\"",
      "Palestinians everywhere are watching Trump's choosing of pro-Israeli officials for key positions with dismay, especially Mike Huckabee, the president-elect's pick to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel.",
      "Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, is on the record as saying, \"there's really no such thing as a Palestinian.\"",
      "\"When you hear a person like Huckabee saying there is no occupation, and there are no settlements, they are just Israeli communities\u2026. he might as well say there is no international law,\" said Barghouti.",
      "During Trump's first term, he opposed the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and, in 2020, proposed what he called \"the deal of the century\" \u2014 a template for a long-sought Palestinian state.",
      "Under his proposal, the new state would have been a scattering of isolated Palestinian lands, each surrounded by Israel. The plan was rejected by both the Palestinians and by Jewish settlers and, since then, both sides have dug in.",
      "Even if the new Trump administration revives some version of its proposal for a Palestinian state, it will face Palestinians and their Arab allies whose resolve has only been hardened by a devastating year of war in Gaza that has killed almost 44,000 people.",
      "On the Israeli side, hardliners in Netanyahu's government oppose any form of Palestinian sovereignty. Netanyahu himself has flatly rejected the prospect repeatedly.",
      "Barghouti, however, sounded ready for the fight.",
      "\"I'm sure it will be a rough year for everybody,\" he told CBS News. \"But whatever happens, we, the Palestinian people, will never give up our right to struggle for our freedom.\"",

    "summary": "Bernadett \"Betty\" Szabo, 19, was stabbed multiple times just months after giving birth to a baby boy.",
    "story": [
      "By a canal in Amsterdam's red-light district, one of the \"window women\" is actually a hologram which Dutch police hope will help solve the gruesome murder of a sex worker in 2009.",
      "Peering through a frame out onto passers-by, a human-sized likeness of Bernadett \"Betty\" Szabo -- in skimpy shorts and a leopard-print bra, a dragon tattoo covering much of her torso -- taps the pane and fogs the glass with her breath.",
      "The word \"HELP\" appears, chillingly, on the screen.",
      "\"Fifteen years ago, Betty was killed in a horrible way and the investigation was never closed,\" Amsterdam police spokesman Olav Brink told AFP.",
      "Aged only 19, Hungarian-born Betty was stabbed multiple times in her brothel room in the centuries-old red-light district, known as De Wallen, just months after giving birth to a baby boy.",
      "Despite a large-scale police probe, the case went cold.",
      "During a review, however, police found \"promising clues\" and decided to reopen the investigation, Brink said.",
      "They hope the likeness of Betty, created with 3D visualization technology, will jolt the memories of people who may have information about her murder.",
      "\"Betty was murdered in one of the busiest areas in Amsterdam, maybe even in the Netherlands. It is really almost impossible that there are no people who saw or heard something unusual at the time,\" cold case team member Anne Dreijer-Heemskerk said in a statement. \"We hope witnesses who may have been afraid before or kept silent for other reasons now have the courage to come forward.\"",
      "Waiting for the \"golden tip\"",
      "\"There are still people who know what has happened to Betty,\" said Brink, hoping that 15 years on, \"people feel freer to share information with the police.\"",
      "The initiative also aims to raise awareness about the violence faced by sex workers.",
      "Around 78 percent of prostitutes in the Netherlands have faced sexual violence and 60 percent report being physically attacked, according to a 2018 report by Dutch charities and sex worker rights groups.",
      "Concerns about violence also rose during the Covid-19 pandemic, when loss of income forced some prostitutes to continue working illegally and reduced their ability to report crimes to the police.",
      "In the week since the hologram and accompanying information about Betty went on display, the police have seen \"that a lot of people are talking about it.\"",
      "\"We find it quite special that Betty can bring attention to her case this way,\" said Brink.",
      "In the streets of De Wallen, lined with women watching from red-lit window booths, groups of locals and visitors pause and strike up conversations about the unusual display, entitled \"Who was Betty?\"",
      "Theo, 80, who lives outside Amsterdam, said he read about the project in the papers and \"came especially to see it\" when he was in the city.",
      "Soyoon Jun, 34, lives near the red-light district, \"so it was more shocking for me that there were neighbors who are going through this type of horrendous event.\"",
      "For Jun, who works at a Christian charity, the hologram made the murder \"real.\"",
      "\"It wasn't just information that was given out,\" Jun explained. \"People could feel the helplessness that Betty would have felt.\"",
      "The police have already \"received several tips because of the campaign,\" Brink confirmed to AFP.",
      "They are still waiting, though, for the \"golden tip\" that will lead them to the murderer, which comes with a 30,000-euro ($31,600) reward.",
      "\"Special way of getting attention\"",
      "According to Brink, the hologram is a \"special way of getting attention for this case\" -- including by putting it in De Wallen, which is \"one of the busiest places in Amsterdam and probably the whole of the Netherlands.\"",
      "This may not last, though, since Amsterdam's sex workers may soon lose the centrality and visibility of their windows.",
      "The local government plans to relocate the red-light district to a purpose-built centere south of the city in the hope of reducing petty crime and tourist footfall in De Wallen.",
      "The move is opposed by tens of thousands of locals and sex workers, who are calling instead for better crowd control and surveillance in the existing red-light area.",
      "Miranda K, a 57-year-old who lives near Amsterdam and declined to give her full surname, said the relocation plan was a \"pity\" because she felt \"safe\" in De Wallen.",
      "She said the out-of-city center would be in a \"dark\" area, whereas De Wallen has \"tourists and people and locals and everything here. So I think it's safer.\"",
      "\"For me, it's not just about finding Betty or who was Betty,\" she said, \"but it's about... these other ladies on the streets too.\"",
      "Ongoing effort to identify cold case victims across Europe",
      "The search for Betty comes amid a wider effort to solve cold cases in the Netherlands and beyond. Last month, Interpol launched a new campaign to identify 46 women whose remains have been found across Europe in unsolved cases, some dating back decades.",
      "The initiative from the Lyon-based organization builds on the success of the first Identify Me campaign, which last year helped identify the body of a woman\u00a0 -- dubbed the\u00a0\"woman with the flower tattoo\" -- found murdered 31 years ago in a Belgian river as Briton Rita Roberts.",
      "The original initiative\u00a0launched to identify 22 deceased women\u00a0saw some 1,800 tips received from the public.",
      "Now the\u00a0campaign has been expanded\u00a0to include cold cases from Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands, as well as unexplained deaths from new participating countries France, Italy, and Spain.",
      "Most of the women were \"murdered or had died in suspicious or unexplained circumstances,\" the organization said.",
      "Among the women Interpol is seeking to identify is the body of a woman -- dubbed \"the woman in the suitcase\" -- with an estimated age of between 16 and 22. In the autumn of 2005, her corpse was found in a red suitcase lying in the canal in the town of Schiedam in the west of the Netherlands.",
      "The oldest of the cold cases, \"the girl on the parking lot,\" dates back to 1976. Her body was found along the A12 highway in the Netherlands.",

This raises the unsettling possibility of how such knowledge could be weaponized by those with more dangerous intentions.\"",
      "\"The incident highlights the dual nature of threats faced by the estate - protecting physical assets and ensuring the safety of key members of the royal family,\" Sacerdoti continued. \"Material losses are, of course, regrettable, but the symbolic and practical implications of a security breach near one of the most senior royal households are far more profound.",

      "\"Cass is not a conservative. He\u2019s an anti-Trump activist that MSNBC has on speed dial to undermine Trump\u2019s second-term agenda.\"",

Warren and Cass\u2019 American Compass, which were both published a month earlier and include multiple quotes from Warren and Cass, asking readers to identify the source of each quote.",

      "Americans for Tax Reform\u00a0went on to call American Compass \"left-wing\" and said Cass was the \"leader of the tax-hiking American Compass\" in a separate post from earlier this year due to his opposition to Trump\u2019s tax cuts.",

      "The clip prompted Richard Stern, who serves as the director of the Heritage Foundation's Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, to sound off on Cass, saying, \"[Cass on] CNBC this morning defending the uniparty's attempt to steal your money and put it in their hands \u2014 and to stop capital from flowing to new and small businesses. With \u2018friends\u2019 like this, who needs socialists.\"",
      "During a C-SPAN interview over the weekend, Cass praised some aspects of Trump's first administration, saying the United States \"made a tremendous amount of progress\" by implementing a \"much more aggressive trade policy and confronting China.\" He also praised the incoming Trump-Vance administration on some of its Cabinet picks, including calling Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., an \"excellent\" State Department pick because of his work sounding the alarm about China being our \"main adversary.\"",
      "He added he hopes the administration will have a \"labor policy that is much more focused on the interests of workers,\" pointing to Vice President-elect JD Vance's past comments and saying commerce and labor are the \"heart of our economic policy.\"",

      "Despite Cass offering some praise of Trump, he has been a longtime critic of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, calling them an \"expensive failure\" and saying Trumpism is facing an \"inevitable expiration\" and adding in September 2020 that Trump is \"building no intellectual foundation, no institutional infrastructure and no policy agenda.\"",
      "After Trump's 2024 election victory, Cass continued to signal opposition to Trump's tax policy.",
      "\"Well, I think we have today a politics where both candidates go around talking about how they`re just going to cut everybody`s taxes,\" Cass told PBS Nov. 10. \"And, of course, everybody likes a tax cut. But I don`t think those are the things that are going to turn our economy in a much better direction.\"",
      "During another interview from earlier this year, Cass said one of the things he thought was \"most encouraging\" was that there aren't \"mini Trumps\" and that he is \"extremely encouraged\" by the post-Trump era Republican leaders he is seeing.",

      "It\u2019s no secret that America\u2019s immigration policy is in desperate need of a high-tech overhaul.\u00a0 Most online immigration tools so far have been rudimentary, and that\u2019s often left legal immigrants complaining of long wait times, contradictory instructions, and a web presence that doesn't help with things like green card renewal or family petitions.\u00a0 Now President-Elect Trump is promising a big deportation push when he comes into office for his second term, and it\u2019s more important than ever for immigrants to have their paperwork in order.",
      "\"Immigration, legal immigration should be efficient and accessible and affordable for everyone,\" says Yasaman Soroori, the co-founder and CEO of Consulta, a new A.I.-powered platform offering high-tech solutions for those immigration issues.\u00a0 It\u2019s thought to be the first online platform dedicated specifically to helping legal immigrants navigate America\u2019s complicated immigration landscape.\u00a0 Their goal is simple;\u00a0 integrating tech with personalized support, hoping to bring order and affordability to a complex and costly process.",
      "And Soroori says their intake protocol is much more simple and cost-effective than going to see an immigration attorney.\u00a0 \"Once the user finds us on our website and goes to the platform,\" she explains, \"they are able to select the service that pertains to them, answer a simplified questionnaire, upload the necessary documents, we\u2019ll even take care of the passport pictures for them. And that's it.\"",
      "As the immigration debate heats up, Consulta is getting more visibility; it has a number of high-profile backers, including the founder of Venmo.\u00a0 Right now, services include renewing green cards, petitions for family visas, and help with citizenship.\u00a0 It\u2019s all part of using A.I. to deliver a more streamlined immigration experience.",
      "\"We always talk about the negativity about immigration, but we don't focus on the legal immigrants that are in this country,\" says Soroori. \"And we wanted to offer them the most stress free, affordable option in order for more people to pursue it.\""

      "Kurt Knutsson: Data breaches in 2024 exposed info of millions, stressing the need for better cybersecurity.",
      "A cybersecurity vendor claimed last month that a hacker stole data from the fashion retailer Hot Topic, including the personal information of millions of customers. At that time, there was no confirmation from the retailer itself. However, a breach notification site has now confirmed that the personal data of 56,904,909 users was found online and leaked from customers of Hot Topic, Torrid and Box Lunch.",
      "This data includes email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, purchase history, gender and dates of birth. Partial credit card data was also included in the breach.",

      "What you need to know",
      "The breach notification service\u00a0Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) announced this week that it alerted 56 million Hot Topic customers about a data breach compromising their personal information. While Hot Topic, which operates more than 640 stores across the U.S., has yet to confirm the breach, HIBP reported that it occurred on Oct. 19. Just two days later, a threat actor using the alias \"Satanic\" claimed responsibility.",
      "Satanic alleges that the database contains details of 350 million users, though that number seems inflated. The leaked data does, however, include names, email addresses, physical addresses and dates of birth; all information collected through Hot Topic\u2019s loyalty program. The hacker is offering the database for $20,000 and demanding that Hot Topic pay $100,000 to prevent its sale.",
      "Hudson Rock, an Israeli cybersecurity firm, initially reported the breach and considers it credible. The firm traced the issue back to a malware infection on an employee\u2019s computer at Robling, a third-party retail analytics firm. Hudson Rock, which operates the cyber intelligence platform Cavalier to monitor compromised devices, discovered the infection and flagged it for clients.",
      "It\u2019s likely that the threat actor used credentials stolen by info stealer malware to gain access to an analytics platform used by Hot Topic, potentially allowing them to infiltrate the retailer\u2019s cloud environments.",

      "Evidence of a data breach at Hot Topic keeps piling up, but the company hasn\u2019t said a word yet. Customers and state attorneys general haven\u2019t been notified, either. Hot Topic\u2019s silence could mean a few things, especially with such a big breach. They might still be investigating, working with cybersecurity experts to confirm what happened and figure out the extent of the damage. Sometimes, companies stay quiet, hoping to delay or dodge bad press. But this strategy can backfire, leading to more scrutiny and skepticism.",

      "5 ways you can stay safe in the event of a data breach",
      "1) Keep a strong password:\u00a0With the Hot Topic data breach exposing sensitive information, it\u2019s essential to update your passwords. Use a strong, unique password for each account, especially for services where your personal details are stored. A mix of letters, numbers and symbols will make it harder for hackers to guess. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep everything secure and easily accessible.",
      "2) Beware of suspicious links:\u00a0After a breach, phishing attempts increase, and hackers may use your leaked email to send fake links or emails. Never click on suspicious links, especially those that ask for personal information. Always double-check the sender's email and look out for strange language or urgent requests. If in doubt, go directly to the website instead of following the links in the message.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Invest in a data removal service:\u00a0Since your personal information could be floating around on the dark web or public databases, it\u2019s a good idea to invest in a data removal service.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "4) Watch out for the risk of identity theft:\u00a0The leaked data includes sensitive details like addresses, birthdays and purchase histories, which could be used for identity theft. Be extra cautious when sharing personal information moving forward, and if you notice anything unusual, report it immediately. If you are a Hot Topic customer, you might also want to consider an identity theft monitoring service.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5) Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Keep an eye on your bank accounts, credit card statements and even loyalty programs where your information is stored. Set up alerts for transactions and logins so you can act fast if anything seems off. Regular monitoring can help you catch fraudulent activity early, minimizing the damage if your data is misused.",
      "DON\u2019T LET SNOOPS NEARBY LISTEN TO YOUR VOICEMAIL WITH THIS QUICK TIP",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Hot Topic data breach is alarming, especially since it affects over 56 million people. What makes the situation even more concerning is that Hot Topic has stayed silent about it. The company hasn\u2019t notified those affected, leaving many unprepared for potential cybersecurity threats. Hackers could use this gap to target victims with scams, leading to financial losses. This situation is a strong reminder of the importance of maintaining good cybersecurity hygiene, whether you\u2019re impacted by a breach or not.",

This type of information is valuable not only to hackers but also to governments.

The report did not specify when the attack occurred, but T-Mobile says no customer calls or communication records were stolen.",
      "The U.S. government also\u00a0confirmed this month that Chinese hackers breached multiple U.S. telecommunications service providers to access wiretap systems used by law enforcement for surveillance of Americans. Wiretap systems allow law enforcement agencies to monitor phone calls, text messages and internet communications as part of investigations, typically with a warrant.",

The statement disclosed that PRC-affiliated hackers had breached networks at \"multiple telecommunications companies\" across the United States.

Early in the year, hackers used phished credentials from dozens of T-Mobile retail employees to access a sales application originally set up during the COVID-19 pandemic for remote viewing of customer data.

Use strong, unique passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers and symbols.\u00a0Password managers can help you generate and store these securely.",
      "2) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider services that scrub your personal information from public databases. This reduces the chances of your data being exploited in phishing or other cyberattacks after a breach.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Use identity theft protection: Identity theft protection services monitor your accounts for unusual activity, alert you to potential threats and can even assist in resolving issues if your data is compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your telecom accounts with\u00a02FA. This requires a second form of verification, like a text code or an app-based prompt, making it harder for hackers to access your accounts even if they have your password.",
      "5) Guard against phishing scams with strong antivirus software: Be cautious about unsolicited calls, texts or emails that ask for personal information or account access. Legitimate companies won't ask for sensitive details this way. If something seems off, contact your telecom provider directly through official channels. Whatever you do, don't click on links, as they can lead to scams or malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Telecom providers like T-Mobile and AT&T are frequent targets for hackers. Over the last two years, millions of Americans have had their data stolen, things like call records, text messages and even personal details. The issue got so bad that the FCC stepped in, warning T-Mobile to step up its cybersecurity efforts. The company was fined about $30 million, split between a $15 million penalty and a mandatory $15 million investment in better security. Unfortunately, if the companies handling your data keep getting breached, there's only so much you can do.",

      "2. Use a VPN: A virtual private network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers, ISPs or other third parties to track your online activity and searches. Many sites can read your IP address and, depending on their privacy settings, may display the city from which you are corresponding. A VPN will disguise your IP address to show an alternate location.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",
      "3. Enable SafeSearch: Google\u2019s SafeSearch filters help to block explicit or potentially harmful content. It\u2019s especially useful for filtering out unsafe links and improving search safety.",
      "4. Limit personal data on Google: Adjust your Google account\u2019s privacy settings to minimize data collection, including search history, location tracking and ad personalization. You can access these settings in the \"My Activity\" section of your Google account.",
      "5. Use private browsing or clear your history: Using Incognito Mode or clearing your browsing history regularly can help reduce tracking of your searches. While it doesn\u2019t hide your activity from ISPs or law enforcement, it limits the data Google can store on your device.",

It\u2019s concerning how malicious websites that put users at risk are readily available on the first page of Google. Although the search giant has claimed to prioritize helpful content this year, the ease with which hackers manipulate search results suggests Google is doing quite the opposite.

    "story": [
      "A VPN could be your secret weapon to protect your identity and finances.",
      "Many people turn to VPNs \u2014 virtual private networks \u2014 for added privacy and security online, only to find that their internet speeds suddenly slow to a crawl. But what exactly does a VPN do, and why might it cause this slowdown?",
      "A VPN works by creating a secure, encrypted pathway between your device and the internet, keeping your data private from hackers, advertisers and anyone else trying to monitor your activity. This encryption process also allows you to browse as if you\u2019re in a different location, which can help access content that may be restricted where you are.",

VPNs are fantastic tools for safeguarding data and unlocking restricted content, but that extra layer of protection and location masking can sometimes slow things down. The good news? There are several ways to keep your VPN running smoothly without sacrificing security.\u00a0 Let's dive in.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Make sure it's actually the VPN",
      "Before we blame the VPN, let's make sure it's really the culprit. Here's a quick test:",
      "1. Disconnect from your VPN: Close your VPN application completely or turn off the VPN connection in your device settings.",
      "2. Run a speed test at Speedtest.net and note the results: Click the \"Go\" button and wait for the test to complete. Write down your download and upload speeds, as well as the ping.",
      "3. Connect to your VPN: Open your VPN application and connect to your preferred server. Wait until the connection is fully established.",
      "4. Run the speed test again: Refresh the Speedtest.net page to ensure it detects your new location, then run the test again. Note down the new results.",
      "If your VPN-connected speeds are less than about 60% of your normal speeds, then Houston, we have a VPN problem. If the difference is minimal, you may just need to optimize your base internet connection first.",

      "TOP 6 HIDDEN WAYS A VPN CAN SAVE YOU MONEY NOW",
      "Fixing VPN speed issues",
      "When encountering slow speeds while using a VPN, it's crucial to approach the problem systematically. Assuming the VPN is indeed the bottleneck in your connection, there are several steps you can employ to potentially boost your speeds and improve your overall experience.",
      "The physical distance between you and the VPN server location plays a significant role in connection speeds. Opting for a server closer to your geographical location can often result in a noticeable improvement. If you need to connect to a specific country for content access or other reasons, experiment with different cities within that country. Many VPN providers offer multiple server options in popular locations. Additionally, some VPNs display server load information, which can be incredibly useful. Connecting to a less crowded server typically yields faster speeds, as you're sharing fewer resources with other users.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE U.S. NEWS",
      "Various server locations available on VPN. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Adjusting your VPN settings can lead to performance enhancements. If your VPN service allows for customization, consider lowering the encryption level from 256-bit to 128-bit AES. While 256-bit encryption is incredibly secure, it can sometimes impact speed. The 128-bit AES encryption is still considered very secure for most purposes and may offer a speed boost. Another setting to look for is the WireGuard protocol. If your VPN provider offers this newer protocol, enabling it could significantly improve your connection speed, as it's designed to be both faster and more efficient than older protocols. For those using the OpenVPN protocol, switching from TCP to UDP can often result in faster speeds. However, approach these changes cautiously, especially if you're not entirely sure about their implications. Avoid disabling critical security features in your quest for speed.",
      "Different protocols offer varying levels of speed and security. Generally, protocols like PPTP, L2TP and IKEv2 are known for their speed but may not provide the highest level of security. OpenVPN is often the default choice as it strikes a good balance between speed and security. If you decide to stick with OpenVPN, which is recommended for most users, try switching from TCP to UDP. This simple change can potentially provide a noticeable speed boost without compromising security.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Keeping your VPN application up to date is essential for ensuring optimal performance and security. VPN providers frequently release updates that not only enhance the overall functionality of their software but also address any bugs or vulnerabilities that may have been discovered. An outdated VPN app can lead to compatibility issues with your operating system, which can hinder performance and reduce connection speeds. Therefore, it is advisable to regularly check for updates within your VPN app's settings or visit the provider's official website to download the latest version. Additionally, many VPN services offer an automatic update feature, which you should enable to ensure that you are always using the most current version of the software without having to remember to do it manually.",
      "To improve your VPN speed, it is important to minimize the load on your device by closing unnecessary applications running in the background. Many applications consume bandwidth and processing power, which can significantly affect your VPN's performance. For instance, streaming services, file-sharing programs or even software that automatically updates can slow down your connection. Before connecting to your VPN, take a moment to close these apps and consider disabling any auto-sync features temporarily.\u00a0Also, restarting your device before initiating a VPN connection is also a good practice, as it clears temporary files and frees up memory, allowing for a smoother experience.",
      "If you have tried various troubleshooting methods and your current VPN service still fails to deliver satisfactory speeds, it may be time to explore other options. The market is filled with numerous VPN providers that emphasize speed and reliability, so conducting thorough research is essential. Look for services that boast a large network of servers strategically located around the world, as this can significantly enhance connection speeds. Many top-tier VPN providers offer free trials or money-back guarantees, allowing you to test their performance without any financial risk. When evaluating potential new services, consider not only their speed but also their security features, privacy policies and customer support options. By making an informed choice, you can find a VPN that meets both your speed requirements and security needs effectively.",
      "Remember, while these strategies can help optimize your VPN speed, it's important to have realistic expectations. Your base internet speed, provided by your internet service provider (ISP), will always be the ultimate limiting factor. No VPN can make your connection faster than the maximum speed your ISP provides. However, by implementing these techniques, you can ensure that you're getting the most out of your VPN connection and minimizing any unnecessary slowdowns.",

The email can come from any address and may be socially engineered to look like it's related to your organization. It could link to a Google Meet invite for a meeting, webinar, online collaboration or something similar. When you click on the link, you\u2019ll be directed to a fake Google Meet page, which will soon display a warning claiming there\u2019s an issue with your PC.

      "Wyoming is the latest state to push legislation giving homeowners and law enforcement teeth against squatters, following New York, Florida and Georgia.",
      "Approved 10-4 by the state legislature's Joint Judiciary Committee, the bill now needs to be approved on the state Senate floor. If passed into law, the bill would make squatting that involves property destruction a felony offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.",
      "The law would also allow property owners to call law enforcement to remove \"unauthorized residents\" from their properties, provided that there is no ongoing legal dispute related to the property between them. Currently, law enforcement in Wyoming and elsewhere in the country often have their hands tied in these situations and instruct frazzled homeowners to address the issue in civil court.",

      "\"I thought that the property was vacant,\" she recalled. \"I was going into the property, and I heard footsteps, and I thought \u2018What the heck.\u2019\"",
      "Then, she saw a large, unfamiliar man at the top of the stairs.",
      "\"He says \u2018Who are you and what are you doing in this property,'\" Boril recalled. \"I said, \u2018Who are you, and what are you doing on this property? I could ask you the same thing.\u2019\"",

      "She said that she would be back with the police in the morning \u2013\u00a0but both the local police and sheriff's department told her that they could not help and that she would have to pursue the matter in civil court.",
      "\"The next morning, I went back with a large fellow. We unlocked and they were gone. But the place was trashed \u2013\u00a0filthy clothing, filthy mattresses, needles and drug paraphernalia everywhere,\" she said. \"I started de-trashing the property.

      "Anderson said the bill was modeled off of Florida's HB 621, which was passed earlier this year.",
      "The committee also passed legislation that would establish a criminal offense for using fraudulent documents to gain or remain in possession of property in Wyoming.",
      "Attorney Joseph Cammarata, of Washington, D.C.-based Chaikin, Sherman, Cammarata & Siegel, P.C., told Fox News Digital that he supported the spirit of the legislation.",
      "\"You have people that are breaking the law, and they don't belong there,\" he said. \"Your home is your castle, and it's being invaded by other people, and you want them out, and they should be out regardless of who they are. And these people that say, 'Well, we have to treat this; this group of people, these squatters, with special concerns and considerations, so if they stay a little longer in the house, it's okay.' Well, you know what? I'd ask those people, can they move into your house and see how you like it?\"",
      "Although he believes the bill is well-intentioned, Cammarata said it \"would provide complete immunity to the police so that if they got involved in removing a squatter, they would not be responsible in any shape, way or form for any harm caused to either the homeowner or the squatter.\"",
      "\"To me, if you were to ask me, I think that goes too far in terms of providing absolute immunity to police,\" he added. \"They know how to act. They know how to act. They know how to handle themselves within constitutional protections.\"",
      "However, Anderson told Fox News Digital that the stipulation was added to help police deal with what is often a complicated situation.",
      "\"I like the police having immunity, it's thrown on them to make the judgment \u2013\u00a0supposedly the homeowner can produce a deed or any kind of paperwork, but many times the squatter can produce the same kind of document,\" he said. \"It is difficult for the police or sheriff or whoever is dealing with it.\"",
      "Cammarata also pointed out that, according to the wording of the prospective law, \"the sheriff may charge a reasonable hourly rate that the owner shall pay to the sheriff,\" if \"the owner... request[s] that the sheriff stand by to keep the peace while the owner or agent changes the locks and removes the personal property of the unauthorized occupant from the premises to or near the property line.",
      "\"Homeowners in exercising their rights and calling on the police would have to pay for the police. And if that is true, I think the legislature forgot that the homeowner already paid for the police as part of their taxes to provide safekeeping to the community at large.\"",
      "Anderson pointed out that the bill is still subject to revisions before its potential passage into law, which he said he is \"confident\" will take place.",

      "\"I might bring something up in the session and remove that paragraph \u2013\u00a0I don't even like it,\" Anderson said. \"I asked an attorney about it and he said 'I don't think it makes any difference [whether that portion is written into the bill] \u2013\u00a0the sheriff isn't going to stay if he isn't being paid.'\"",
      "Florida's HB 621 also charges the homeowner a fee in this situation, as well as a \"civil eviction fee plus an hourly rate if a deputy must stand by and keep the peace while the unauthorized person is removed.\"",
      "Cammarata also said that the $10,000 fine for squatters would likely be more symbolic than actionable.",
      "\"The $10,000 that the squatters have to pay? Yeah, well, first of all, try and collect it,\" he said. \"You could make it $100,000 \u2013\u00a0it's a piece of paper. And that's worth just what the piece of paper might be worth. Not much. So I wouldn't hold out hope on that $10,000 coming back anytime soon\u2026 They wouldn't be living in your place if they weren't homeless.\"",

      "Ron McAndrew, former warden of the Florida State Penitentiary, has asked outgoing President Biden to commute all federal and military death sentences before leaving office.",
      "FIRST ON FOX: A pro-Trump former Florida prison warden who oversaw executions is urging President Biden to commute all federal and military death sentences before leaving office.",
      "\"I voted for President Trump in all of his campaigns, and I agree with him on most of his positions, but not the death penalty,\" Ron McAndrew, former warden of the Florida State Penitentiary, wrote in a letter to the outgoing president. \"I have written to President Trump personally to ask him to stop calling for more executions.\"",
      "McAndrew, a self-described \"law-and-order guy,\" Air Force veteran and pro-life Catholic, said that after overseeing three electric chair executions and witnessing five lethal injections, he grew to oppose the death penalty.",
      "While he had reservations from the start, he told Fox News Digital that he saw a burst of flames from the head of Pedro Medina during his execution in 1997 on the electric chair. That incident became a watershed moment in Florida and other parts of the country that marked the beginning of the end of electrocution.",
      "TRUMP EXECUTION RESTART TO PUT BOSTON MARATHON BOMBER, CHARLESTON CHURCH SHOOTER, MORE KILLERS IN HOT SEAT",
      "Ron McAndrew, a former Florida prison warden, testifies during a 2019 hearing regarding a death row inmate. (Doug Engle/Ocala Star-Banner)",
      "\"A plume of smoke and then a flame that came down underneath the helmet and out right in front of my face, had it come a few inches further, it would have actually burned me,\" he said.",
      "Later, he said the stench was so overpowering that, \"it was like we had gone to a human barbecue.\"",
      "State investigators found that Medina, a convicted murderer and Cuban refugee, had died instantly \u2013 but the incident traumatized McAndrew and at least two dozen other witnesses, he said.",
      "The incident led Florida to adopt lethal injections instead, but he said that form of execution was no less disturbing for the prison workers who carried it out.",
      "TRUMP EXPECTED TO END BIDEN-ERA DEATH PENALTY PAUSE, EXPAND TO MORE FEDERAL INMATES",
      "Pedro Medina, a convicted killer, was sentenced to death and went to the electric chair on March 25, 1997. He was one of the last inmates electrocuted in this manner after his head burst into flames, filling the chamber with smoke and horrifying onlookers. (Archive PL / Alamy Stock Photo)",
      "\"The heaving of the chest is an example,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"You can see it if you're up close, and you're the executioner or a member of the team. You can see that they're trying to break out of their own body, so to speak. But the witnesses don't see this. They see it as, like, a clean, a sanitary form of killing someone.\"",
      "At one point, he said, he began seeing executed inmates in his sleep and drinking heavily \u2013 half a bottle of Johnnie Walker a night \u2013 as a result. Eventually, he was diagnosed with severe stress. Now he is a staunch supporter of abolishing the death penalty.",
      "Read the letter here:",
      "\"I feel compelled to say there is one thing in particular that I agree about with President Biden,\" McAndrew wrote in his letter. \"We share a strong opposition to the death penalty. President Biden has the power to show mercy through the process of executive clemency, and I urge that he do so expeditiously for everyone on the federal and military death rows.\"",
      "When asked why the worst of the worst killers on death row, including Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof and Pittsburgh synagogue gunman Robert Bowers, should have their lives spared, he questioned where we should draw the line and suggested incarcerating them all with no possibility of parole instead.",

      "\"If this same inmate was doing life without possibility of parole, he'd be working between 40 and 60 hours per week whether he liked it or not,\" he said. \"He would be making a contribution\u2026rather than being a burden on the taxpayers, sitting in a cell getting room service for 25 years.\"",

      "\"We're excited to have a cabinet level official focused on government efficiency, because this is the first time anyone in the federal government is positioned to eliminate the death penalty by executive order,\" Bonowitz said. \"There is no current government program more wasteful, ineffective and inefficient than capital punishment.\"",
      "The letter comes as Trump has vowed to not only end Biden's moratorium on capital punishment, but also to expand the list of crimes that can be punishable with execution to include child rape, human trafficking and the murder of U.S. citizens by illegal immigrants.",
      "There are currently 40 inmates on federal death row, and they include domestic terrorists, drug kingpins and criminals who had witnesses against them killed.",
      "Tsarnaev, who killed four and wounded hundreds; Roof, who killed nine at a Bible study; Bowers, who killed 11 at the Tree of Life Synagogue; and Kaboni Savage, a Philadelphia drug lord who killed 12 people \u2013\u00a0including four children linked to an informant \u2013\u00a0would all see clemency under the proposal.",

That is far fewer than the individual states, which have executed more than 1,500 condemned inmates in the last 50 years.",

      "In places like California, where death row inmates are safe from execution due to a moratorium against capital punishment, they also have access to elite attorneys and all the time in the world to try and fight their circumstances.",
      "The feds carried out death sentences for 13 federal prisoners during Trump's first term, the most under any president in a century. Biden declared a moratorium on federal executions after taking office in 2021.",

Parents loaded their children onto trains in the early days of the war, veins of trenches have scarred eastern Ukraine, and cities and towns have been completely decimated by air, land and sea-based bombardments.",
      "But the war has done more than remind Western leaders of the global repercussions that come when major nations enter into mass conflict. A new type of warfare emerged out of the fight in Ukraine and the reliance on cheaply made drones to target cities, troop locations and military equipment that cost millions, cemented a new era in combat strategy.",

      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday announced new plans to increase Ukraine\u2019s production of long-range drones and missiles in its latest attempt to gain an edge over Russia, particularly as his troops grapple with dwindling artillery supplies and uncertainty mounts ahead of the Biden administration\u2019s departure from the White House come January 2025.",
      "Kyiv plans to produce some 30,000 long-range drones next year, along with 3,000 cruise missiles and \"drone-missile hybrids,\" reported the Kyiv Independent.",
      "The announcement made in a speech to Ukraine\u2019s parliament on Tuesday came just two days after President Biden green-lit Ukraine\u2019s use of U.S.-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to hit targets inside Russia, and coincided with Kyiv\u2019s first strike against a military arsenal near the Russian town of Karachev in the Bryansk region, more than 70 miles from Ukraine\u2019s border, a U.S. official confirmed with Fox News Digital.",
      "The move by the Biden administration marked a significant shift in U.S. policy, which has for years rejected calls that Ukraine should be able to use U.S.-supplied weaponry to target the Kremlin\u2019s military depots inside Russia, fearing it would escalate the war beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders.",
      "But security experts have long criticized this policy, arguing the administration has helped create a war of attrition by denying and then capitulating on military capabilities like tanks, fighter jets, ATACMS and then strike permission.",

      "British reports suggested that now that the U.S. has lifted its restrictions on U.S. supplied-ATACMS, the U.K. and France will likely follow suit and supply Ukraine with Storm Shadow and SCALP long-range missiles stipulation free, though no official announcements have been made.",
      "The British Ministry of Defense would not comment on any plans to lift strike restrictions, but instead pointed to comments made Monday by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer,\u00a0who emphasized \"we need to double down\" on support for\u00a0Ukraine during his address to leaders of the G-20.",
      "It remains unclear how providing Ukraine with these capabilities at this time will affect the trajectory of the war, but according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) in Washington, D.C., there are \"hundreds of known Russian military and paramilitary objects in Russia\" that are in ATACMS strike range.",

      "Though the decision also closely followed escalating tensions in the Middle East involving Iran \u2013 which has also provided Moscow with drones since mid-2022 \u2013 as well as the 2024 presidential race secured by Trump, who has repeatedly claimed he will end the war, though he has yet to disclose how.",

      "A new analysis of precinct-level data by the NBC News Decision Desk shows the extent to which President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s wins in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania \u2014 and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s losses \u2014 were driven by weak turnout in heavily Democratic cities.",
      "Going into Election Day, Harris\u2019s clearest path to victory was to win all three states in the old \u201cblue wall.\u201d Ultimately, she fell short in all three, and the nearly completed vote count in those states shows how the number of votes compared to 2020 dropped in some of the most Democratic-friendly areas of those states.",
      "The charts below show the relationship between Harris\u2019 share of the vote and the percent change in the total number of votes cast in the presidential race compared to the total vote in 2020. Each dot represents a county, and dots that are above the 0% line are counties with more voters in 2024 than 2020; the relatively few dots below that line are counties with fewer voters in 2024 compared to 2020.",
      "As the diagonal black lines show, in all three states, heavily Democratic counties on the right side of each panel had worse turnout relative to 2020 than the heavily Republican counties on the left side. The largest county in each state \u2014 Wayne County, Michigan, home of Detroit; Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania; and Milwaukee County, Wisconsin \u2014 had either the worst or second-worst shift in votes cast of any county in their state.",
      "These three underperforming counties and their cities fueled the Democratic electoral success in the 2020 and 2022 elections. Although Harris comfortably won all three of these cities by over 50 percentage points each, she received a slightly lower percentage of the vote than Joe Biden did in 2020. More consequential, however, was the stagnant or shrinking turnout in these cities, which \u2014 coupled with turnout growth in Republican counties across the blue wall \u2014 drove Trump\u2019s victory.",
      "This map of Philadelphia highlights this shrinkage in turnout from 2020 to 2024. The purple parts of the map represent precincts where the total number of votes was smaller in 2024 than 2020, while the vote count increased in the green precincts.",
      "Out of more than 1,700 precincts in Philadelphia, 73% had fewer voters in 2024 than in 2020. Overall, the total number of votes in Philadelphia decreased by 2.9% \u2014 resulting in approximately 20,000 fewer voters this year. Meanwhile, the rest of Pennsylvania saw a 2.1% increase in the total number of voters compared to 2020.",
      "The next map shows turnout shifts in Detroit, which makes up about one-third of Wayne County's population. Detroit had an even more extreme drop-off in turnout than Philadelphia's. While the number of voters throughout the rest of Michigan grew by 2.6%, the number in Detroit fell by 4%.",
      "Across the precincts in the northern part of Detroit, where voters are predominantly Black, the total number of votes tended to be more down than up. Even though Harris received nearly as much support from Black voters in Michigan as Biden \u2014 89% versus 92%, respectively, according to the NBC News Exit Poll \u2014 diminished turnout in these precincts meant that for every 10 voters who did not participate, Harris was losing nine votes while Trump was losing only one.",
      "This overall decrease in Detroit\u2019s turnout would have been even more dramatic had it not been for increased turnout in the Latino neighborhoods in the central-southern part of the city. This turnout growth, however, may not have worked in Harris\u2019 favor. According to the NBC News Exit Poll, Trump carried the Latino vote in Michigan in 2024, while Joe Biden won a majority of that group in 2020.",
      "The third large blue wall city is Milwaukee, which makes up about 60% of Milwaukee County\u2019s population. Unlike Philadelphia and Detroit, the number of votes cast in the city of Milwaukee actually increased slightly since 2020, by about half a percentage point. But in the rest of Wisconsin, the number of voters grew 4% compared to 2020.",
      "The map of Milwaukee precincts show a patchwork of increased and decreased turnout. Even though turnout grew slightly overall in the city, just over half of precincts (58%) experienced a turnout decrease. Comparing Milwaukee\u2019s sluggish turnout to Dane County \u2014 which is Wisconsin\u2019s other large Democratic county, where turnout increased by over 6% \u2014 helps to show how different demographics may explain turnout changes. While both the city of Milwaukee and Dane County cast roughly three-quarters of their votes for Harris, they have dramatically different demographics.",
      "The biggest difference between Milwaukee and Dane is that the city of Milwaukee\u2019s population has been declining over the past few years, while Dane County\u2019s has grown rapidly. If Milwaukee\u2019s pattern of population decline \u2014 which also occurred in Philadelphia and Detroit \u2014 continues, Democratic candidates will have to rely more heavily on voters outside of those cities to win statewide elections.",
      "There are other important demographic differences between Milwaukee and Dane County. About 35% of Milwaukee\u2019s residents are white and non-Hispanic. Dane County, on the other hand, has a population that is about 84% non-Hispanic white. Furthermore, about a quarter of Milwaukee\u2019s residents have a college degree, compared to over half of people in Dane County.",
      "This difference is notable, given that Wisconsin voters with a college degree in the NBC News Exit Poll were one of the only demographic groups in which Harris improved on Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 vote results."

      "Fresh from a devastating loss to Donald Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris may now head to Capitol Hill to defy him in what could be her last major act in office.",
      "As President Joe Biden attempts to advance a crush of judicial confirmations before he leaves the White House, Democrats are bracing for the possibility of close calls in the process as they ambitiously seek to top the 234 judges Trump secured during his first term.",
      "That\u2019s where Harris would come in. As the president of the Senate, Harris wields the constitutional power to provide a tie-breaking vote. Democrats\u2019 slim majority has made Harris a go-to on this procedure throughout Biden\u2019s tenure, having broken a record last year for casting the most decisive votes of any vice president in history.",
      "It is an issue so important to the president \u2014 and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \u2014 that it came up last week when Harris and Biden met for lunch in their first post-election meeting, three sources with knowledge of the meeting said.",
      "\u201cThis is something they want to clear the decks on,\u201d a senior aide to Harris said.",
      "\u201cShe will definitely be available for any tie votes,\u201d a second senior aide said.",
      "\u201cIt is a big focus,\u201d a third person familiar with internal dynamics said.",
      "With Harris leaving Tuesday for a respite in Hawaii, the votes aren\u2019t expected to come up in the Senate until December, one of the sources said.",
      "A senior Harris aide said the vice president delayed her trip to California and Hawaii in the event that she would be needed for votes in the Senate to confirm judges. Harris was supposed to leave this past weekend but instead left Tuesday with the intention of returning to D.C. for needed votes. That aide, as well as a person familiar with planning, said the team determined she was not needed in D.C. right now but to expect a major battle over judicial nominees in December.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Tuesday said she had been told that Harris would be available to break judicial ties if needed. She would not say if she had personally spoken to Harris about it.",
      "\u201cThe goal is to fill every judicial nomination that we can,\" Warren said.",
      "Schumer has been vocal about getting through these confirmations before Biden leaves office, several people with knowledge of the conversations said.",
      "He has made clear he would use the lame-duck session \u2014 the period between the election and when the new president is inaugurated \u2014 to confirm more judges, as Republicans did in late 2020.",
      "\u201cWe are going to use the lame duck to confirm judges. And we\u2019re going to do everything we can to get as many judges done as possible, trying to overcome the Republican obstruction,\u201d Schumer told NBC News in a recent interview.",
      "It\u2019s something that\u2019s already irking Trump, who signaled that Republicans should block any attempts by Democrats to further their judicial agenda.",
      "\u201cThe Democrats are trying to stack the Courts with Radical Left Judges on their way out the door. Republican Senators need to Show Up and Hold the Line \u2014 No more Judges confirmed before Inauguration Day!\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social Tuesday.",
      "But Republicans \u2014 who famously pushed through a Trump Supreme Court appointment just one week before the 2020 election \u2014 do not have the power to stop it.",
      "GOP senators can slow the process down, but Democrats need a simple majority to overcome any obstruction and confirm judges. A senior Biden administration official working on judicial nominations noted that in the 2020 lame-duck session, after Trump had lost the election, Senate Republicans continued to confirm his judges.",
      "Confirming more judges is the top priority for Schumer and Senate Democrats\u00a0before they relinquish power to the new Congress, which will be controlled by Republicans in both chambers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll confirm as many judges as possible in the lame duck,\u201d Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said.",
      "The clash came to a head Monday after Democrats confirmed a judge to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Schumer kept the Senate in session until nearly midnight, holding another 18 roll-call votes over a six-hour span to tee up another seven confirmation votes on Biden-picked judges later this week.",
      "If they\u2019re all confirmed, that would bring Biden\u2019s total to 223 federal judges.",
      "That\u2019s close to Trump\u2019s final tally of 234 judges confirmed in his first term, a number that Democrats have set out to beat since they defeated him in the 2020 election. This summer, however, Schumer stopped short of guaranteeing it.",
      "The Biden administration official said the Trump number is beatable, arguing that there are enough pending nominees on the calendar or awaiting consideration in committee.",
      "\u201cWe could exceed the 234,\u201d the official said. \u201cThis is not about beating Trump\u2019s numbers. This is about getting good people on the bench. Is 235 within the realm of possibility? It is. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s driving it.\u201d",
      "At this time, the White House has not announced plans to nominate judges to other unfilled vacancies. That includes various openings in red states that are subject to the \u201cblue slip\u201d courtesy, where home-state Republican senators must sign off before they get consideration.",
      "The senior administration official declined to discuss whether Biden has talked to Harris or Schumer about lame-duck confirmations.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into conversations the president has had,\u201d the official said. \u201cBut you can certainly assume this remains a topic of discussion and engagement.\u201d",
      "A Senate Democratic aide was heartened by the notion that Harris would be on call to break ties.",
      "\u201cHope she\u2019s not needed,\u201d the aide said. \u201cBut glad that\u2019s an option while Dems have the majority.\u201d"

      "Senate Democrats who pulled off victories even as President-elect Donald Trump won their states believe the Democratic Party can learn some lessons from their races as it grapples with losing control of Washington.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science, but talking about those issues plainly, not from the faculty lounge, but from the assembly line, is, I think, a very important message,\u201d Sen.-elect Elissa Slotkin of Michigan told reporters Tuesday at a briefing at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, stressing the importance of focusing on \u201ckitchen table issues.\u201d",
      "Slotkin is one of four Democratic Senate candidates who won their battleground states, thanks to a combination of ticket-splitters and voters who only cast ballots in the presidential race, even as Vice President Kamala Harris lost them. For these Democrats, focusing on economic issues and their records in Congress, as well as expanding their voter outreach to Republican-leaning areas, were crucial to their wins.",
      "\u201cI personally think that identity politics needs to go the way of the dodo,\u201d Slotkin said.\u00a0\u201cPeople need to be looked at as independent Americans, whatever group they\u2019re from, whatever party they may be from.\u201d",
      "Along with Slotkin, Arizona Sen.-elect Ruben Gallego, Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen and Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin won their races even as Trump carried their states. The split results have been rare in the polarized Trump era, with only one other senator (Susan Collins, R-Maine) winning in a state that backed the opposite party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2016 and 2020.",
      "Rosen and Baldwin also spoke about criticizing their respective opponents for having deep connections to other states, effectively labeling them carpetbaggers.",
      "Democrats still lost the Senate majority despite those victories, with Republicans flipping seats in Montana, Ohio and West Virginia. The GOP could also pick up a seat in Pennsylvania. NBC News has not yet projected a winner in the race between Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican Dave McCormick, which has gone to a recount, with McCormick leading by about a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "Democrats acknowledged Harris faced some headwinds in running a protracted campaign after taking over the ticket in late July.",
      "\u201cAll of us talked about showing up everywhere, listening, delivering,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cAnd I would say that it\u2019s hard to do that in 107 days. But Trump was a known quantity, and he\u2019s been doing that for years.\u201d",
      "Gallego said he believed the Harris campaign ran \u201ca great race,\u201d but also said the short timeline was an issue.",
      "\u201cThe problem was that people did not have enough time to know about her,\u201d Gallego said, adding, \u201cI think this was going to be a tough race for whoever was the nominee, because it was \u2014 it ended up being a race on the economy,\u201d noting that inflation in Arizona was \u201cstubbornly high.\u201d",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., did not directly answer a question about whether President Joe Biden should have ended his campaign earlier or whether there should have been a primary after he did.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything bad about Joe Biden,\u201d Schumer said, calling him \u201can outstanding president.\u201d Schumer said Harris told him shortly after Biden\u2019s announcement that she wanted and was willing to compete in an open process for the nomination.",
      "\u201cThere was a groundswell right afterwards, and she became the nominee quickly for a whole bunch of reasons,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "And while his party lost the White House, the House and the Senate, Schumer touted the Senate victories as more evidence that the party should be focused on the economy.",
      "\u201cThe lesson we take is: Economic issues matter. Direct things that affect people\u2019s lives matter,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAnd one other lesson: how to show a lot of empathy. Sometimes Democrats may be a little too solution-oriented, and people want to, first before you get to the solutions, hear empathy. That I understand that the price of beef is way up, and it really hurts your pocketbook, and it affects you, and affects my family, it affects others. And then go into solutions.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I think these four candidates all did that.\u201d"

    "summary": "Ravens kicker Justin Tucker was the most accurate kicker in league history \u2014 now he's costing his team games.",
    "story": [
      "In what would eventually prove to be a tight, 1990s-esque, cold weather, low-scoring thriller between the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 11, momentum appeared to be shifting toward the Ravens late in the first quarter.",
      "Baltimore was lucky to be trailing only 3-0 after a fumble and missed field goal on two of its first three drives. But the defense had just stuffed the Steelers on a 4th-and-1 run, setting up the offense with great field position.",
      "The Ravens were only able to pick up 14 yards after the turnover on downs. Fortunately, they had set up their kicker \u2014 the second-most accurate in NFL history \u2014 for a 50-yard field goal to tie the game.",
      "Except he missed for the second straight time, keeping Pittsburgh in front.",
      "The Ravens ultimately fell to 7-4 after a hard-fought, 18-16 loss to their bitter rival, the Pittsburgh Steelers, on Sunday. It was a game with massive implications, as the winner would take over first place in the AFC North \u2014 and thus be in the driver\u2019s seat to host a playoff game.",
      "The Steelers won scoring exclusively via field goal, with kicker Chris Boswell hitting all six of his attempts. The Ravens, on the other hand, missed two field goals in the narrow defeat. And that\u2019s become a concerning trend.",
      "All four of Baltimore\u2019s losses this season have been in one-possession games. And in all four of those losses, kicker Justin Tucker has missed at least one field goal.",
      "Kickers missing kicks is not a new phenomenon \u2014 unless that kicker is Tucker.",
      "Entering the 2024 season, Tucker was the most accurate field-goal kicker in NFL history, converting 90.2% of his attempts, the only player at or above the 90% threshold. His accuracy has taken a tumble this season, however, as Tucker has made only 16 of 22 field goals through 11 games.",
      "It\u2019s a shocking fall from grace from a player who had become a legitimate weapon for Baltimore.",
      "Tucker\u2019s field-goal percentage this season is 72.7% \u2014 35th in the league. Not only has that dropped him under 90% for his career, it is by far the worst accuracy he\u2019s ever had in a single season. His previous low was 82.5% in 2015. From 2016-23, Tucker made at least 85% of his kicks in eight straight seasons, an NFL record.",
      "Tucker has already missed six kicks in 11 games this season. From 2012-23, Tucker missed at least six kicks in a full season only twice.",
      "More from Sports",

      "'Monday Night Football' highlights: Joe Mixon scores 3 TDs as Texans dominate Cowboys in Dallas",
      "TNT's 'Inside the NBA' headed for ESPN and ABC after Warner Bros. Discovery settlement",
      "From 2016-22, Tucker made 65 field goals in a row in the fourth quarter and overtime. He has made an NFL record seven game-winning kicks with no time left on the clock in regulation. He also has the record for longest kick in NFL history, 66 yards, which also happened to be a walk-off game winner.",
      "From 2016-23, Tucker converted 78% of his field goals from over 50 yards. In the last two seasons, he\u2019s made only 33.3% of his kicks from that distance.",
      "\u201c[Tucker] needs to make kicks. He knows that, that\u2019s important,\u201d Ravens coach John Harbaugh said after the loss Sunday. \u201cHe makes them in practice, and he made the long one later, which was good to see, which means he\u2019s still very capable. Kick them straight, we\u2019ll be good.\u201d",
      "Baltimore is almost certainly going to need Tucker to contribute at a higher level moving forward. Even with MVP-caliber play from Lamar Jackson and a rushing attack fortified by offseason signing veteran running back Derrick Henry, kickers can swing games. (Kansas City's Harrison Butker, for example, is one spot behind Tucker on the all-time field-goal accuracy list. He hit all 11 of his playoff field goals for the Super Bowl-winning Chiefs last season.)",
      "The Ravens, for now, are standing by their longtime kicker. When asked Monday if the team would bring in a player to compete with Tucker, Harbaugh said the team has no plans to do so.",
      "\u201cThe best option right now is to get Justin back on point because he is fully capable of doing it,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cWe certainly haven\u2019t lost any confidence in Justin Tucker.\u201d",
      "Even on Sunday, after arguably costing his team the game, Tucker wasn\u2019t shaken.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still confident I\u2019m going to go out there and nail every single kick,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cPart of the way we stay confident is by continuing to work and trust the process. I might sound like a broken record, but it\u2019s a part of what brings us success, is just trusting the process and then taking it one kick at a time.\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 22:15:24 GMT",
    "summary": "Israeli prosecutors have accused one of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s aides of illegally leaking classified intelligence in an attempt to blunt criticism.",
    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Israeli prosecutors have accused one of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s aides of illegally leaking classified intelligence in an attempt to blunt widespread criticism of the prime minister\u2019s handling of the Gaza hostage crisis.",
      "The allegations, detailed in newly released court filings, are part of a sprawling criminal probe that has rocked Israel\u2019s government and led to the aide\u2019s arrest and detention in prison. Four military personnel have also been arrested in connection with the case.",
      "Investigators discovered that a low-level Israeli soldier had illegally removed Hamas documents from a military database and passed them to Eli Feldstein, a communications consultant working for Netanyahu, prosecutors said.",
      "Feldstein, 32, then tried to get the documents published in the media with the goal of showing that the hostage families' protests were playing into Hamas\u2019 hands, according to the prosecutors' filings, which were published Sunday.",
      "Feldstein acted \u201cwith the intention of influencing public opinion in Israel on the negotiations regarding the hostages and in particular the issue of the contribution of the demonstrations to the strengthening of Hamas,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "Their filings came after Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff was questioned as part of a separate investigation into allegations that he tried to tamper with official phone logs from the day of Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack, a police official told NBC News.",
      "Netanyahu has not been personally accused of wrongdoing in either case and his office denies the allegations, saying it is being targeted by politically motivated security officials attempting to undermine the government.",
      "The leak investigation, referred to in Israeli media as \u201cBibiLeaks,\u201d from the prime minister\u2019s nickname \u201cBibi,\u201d was launched after the German tabloid Bild published an article in early September based on leaked Hamas documents.",
      "The newspaper claimed it had obtained documents from the personal computer of Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, who was subsequently killed by Israeli forces in October.",
      "The documents, according to the Bild report, showed Hamas was not interested in a quick cease-fire and believed that the protests by hostage families would weaken Israel\u2019s negotiating position.",
      "The story was published at a time of intense public anger toward Netanyahu in Israel following the murder of six hostages, including Israeli American Hersh Goldberg Polin, by Hamas in late August.",
      "Days after it was published, Netanyahu cited the article as evidence of Hamas\u2019 intent \u201cto use psychological warfare on the hostage families\u201d and to put pressure on the Israeli government.",
      "But inside the Israeli military, the story\u2019s publication set off alarm bells. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that the document cited by Bild was several months old and was not written by Sinwar, but instead a mid-level Hamas operative.",
      "Military leaders ordered an investigation into the leak of the document \u2014 which was classified as \u201ctop secret\u201d \u2014 and called in the police and the Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic security agency.",
      "In Sunday\u2019s filings, prosecutors said that when Israeli media declined to publish the document because of military censorship rules, Feldstein went around the domestic censor by giving the document to the Bild newspaper in Germany. A Bild spokesman told NBC News that the newspaper does not comment on its sourcing.",
      "Feldstein was arrested in late October. The Israeli soldier accused of leaking the document to him has also been arrested, along with three other military personnel, prosecutors said.",
      "On Monday, Israeli prison authorities said Feldstein had been placed on suicide watch.",
      "Asked to comment on Sunday\u2019s court filings, Netanyahu's office referred NBC News to a statement from Nov. 12 that said police had invoked special powers reserved for national security cases to hold Feldstein in isolation and deny him access to a lawyer.",
      "\u201cIt hurts us very much that the lives of young people are being destroyed with idle claims to harm the Right-wing government,\u201d his office said. \u201cIn a democratic country people are not arrested because of a leak for 20 days in the basements \u2014 while preventing a meeting with a lawyer for many days \u2014 just to extract from them false statements against the Prime Minister.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu has a history of railing against Israeli law enforcement. In 2019, he became the first sitting prime minister in the country\u2019s history to be charged with a crime.",
      "He denies the litany of bribery, fraud and breach of trust allegations and has said the prosecution is politically motivated. His lawyers have repeatedly tried to delay trial proceedings, citing his wartime leadership responsibilities.",
      "The Hostage Family Forum said in a statement Monday that it was \u201cappalled by the ongoing efforts of individuals close to the prime minister to sabotage a potential hostage deal.\u201d",
      "The advocacy group, which represents hostages and their families has repeatedly\u00a0 criticized Netanyahu and his government over the negotiations to free those taken captive by Hamas during the Oct. 7 terror attacks. Around 100 people remain in captivity, although around a third are believed to be dead.",
      "Police are also investigating allegations against Tzachi Braverman, Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff. Braverman was questioned for several hours last week but has not been arrested or charged, according to an Israeli police official briefed on the investigation.",
      "Police are looking into claims that Braverman falsified phone records from the morning of Oct. 7, the official said. The alleged alterations appear intended to make it look like Netanyahu sprung into action more quickly than he did.",
      "Braverman allegedly asked an aide to change phone records to make it look like a conversation that was logged as having occurred at 6.40 a.m. instead took place 11 minutes earlier, at 6.29 a.m., the official said. Braverman then changed the log himself in a handwritten note.",
      "The police investigation is completed and prosecutors will now make a decision on whether any charges are merited.",
      "Jack Chen, an attorney for Braverman, told NBC News that the situation was the result of a misunderstanding about the order of the phone calls during the chaotic early hours of the Hamas attack. He said Braverman had explained the misunderstanding to police, and they released him without any restrictive conditions.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s office would not comment specifically on Braverman\u2019s questioning but pointed to an earlier statement made by the prime minister on Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cFor the past few days, my office has been under a wild and unrestrained attack,\u201d Netanyahu said at the time. \u201cThe goal is not to protect the security of the state. The goal is to promote an agenda of weakness and concessions during the war.\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 20:58:39 GMT",
    "summary": "California health officials reported a possible case of bird flu in a child in the San Francisco Bay Area. The child had no known contact with infected animals.",
    "story": [
      "California health officials on Tuesday reported a possible case of bird flu in a child with mild symptoms.",
      "The child lives in Alameda\u00a0County, part of the San Francisco Bay Area, and tested positive for the virus despite having no known contact with an infected animal.",
      "Officials with the California Department of Public Health said in a news release that they are investigating whether the child could have been exposed to wild birds. It's considered a \u201cpossible\u201d case until the positive test is confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Fifty-three people have been confirmed with bird flu in the U.S. this year, according to the CDC; all but one had been exposed to infected poultry or dairy cows.",
      "The child experienced mild upper respiratory symptoms and is recovering at home after receiving treatment, the health department said. No person-to-person spread of the virus has been detected, and the child's family members all tested negative. A\u00a0bird flu\u00a0test on the child\u00a0four days after the positive result came back negative.",
      "Bird flu has been spreading rampantly in poultry since 2022 in the worst such outbreak the U.S. has ever experienced. More than 108 million birds have been sickened, killed or culled. Cases in dairy cows began to crop up in March and have since been reported in 15 states. The virus was found in a pig for the first time last month.",
      "Cases in people \u2014 nearly all among farmworkers \u2014 have been confirmed in seven states, with Oregon reporting its first human case last week. Such infections remain rare, however, and health officials maintain that the risk to the public is very low.",
      "In the case of the California child, tests for other respiratory viruses also came back positive at the same time, so health officials said those\u00a0viruses could have caused the child's symptoms.",
      "The child's family members were confirmed to have the same common respiratory viruses, and they are being treated with preventive medication, according to the officials' news release.",
      "Health officials notified other people who had contact with the child  and offered preventive treatment and testing. The child attended day care with mild symptoms, the officials said.",
      "Tom\u00e1s Arag\u00f3n, director of the state's health department, said in a statement that he understands that people might be concerned, but he reassured the public that, \"based on the information and data we have,\u00a0we don\u2019t think\u00a0the child was infectious\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and\u00a0no human-to-human spread of bird flu has been documented\u00a0in any country for more than 15 years.\"",
      "California represents the largest share of human bird flu cases in the U.S. so far, with 27 confirmed, not counting the child in Alameda County. Washington has recorded 11 cases, and Colorado 10. Levels of testing and surveillance differ by state, however, which could explain some of the discrepancy.",
      "In Canada, health officials reported the country's first human case of bird flu last week, in a teenager hospitalized\u00a0and in critical condition. The teen didn\u2019t have any exposure to farm animals but was around dogs, cats and reptiles, officials said."

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 15:00:33 GMT",
    "summary": "Political observers say Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba's indictment could intensify a long-running battle between city Democrats and Mississippi Republicans.",
    "story": [
      "JACKSON, Miss. \u2014 Seven years ago, Chokwe Antar Lumumba swept into the Jackson mayor\u2019s office with plans to shake up local politics. At 34, he was the city\u2019s youngest ever mayor, and he campaigned on a promise of self-determination for the predominantly Black city.",
      "Now Lumumba, 41, stands accused in a sprawling corruption scandal that has also ensnared Hinds County District Attorney Jody Owens and City Council members Aaron Banks and Angelique Lee.  Lumumba, Owens and Banks have pleaded not guilty. Lee, who resigned in August, pleaded guilty and awaits sentencing.",
      "Some officials fear the indictments could overshadow the city\u2019s efforts to improve residents\u2019 quality of life \u2014 or undermine local leadership.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just praying that the legislators and state leadership can see beyond these indictments and realize that we still need help from the state in getting some very specific things done,\u201d City Council President Virgi Lindsay said.",
      "While Lindsay hopes the state will still provide funds for necessary improvements to infrastructure and blight, she acknowledged the request is coming at a fraught time.",
      "Even before the indictments, the state\u2019s Republican leadership had pushed for greater control of the city\u2019s affairs. Political observers say this new crisis could intensify a long-running battle between the state\u2019s mostly white Republican elected officials and the city\u2019s largely Black Democratic leadership.",
      "\u201cRace is always a factor. It\u2019s an ongoing factor in Mississippi politics,\u201d said Leslie McLemore, a former Jackson State University political science professor who also once sat on the Jackson City Council. \u201cYou cannot in a very real sense separate Mississippi history in general from the tensions you find in the city of Jackson,\u201d McLemore added. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing saga.\u201d",
      "Jackson is Mississippi\u2019s largest city. But with roughly 144,000 residents, it is also small enough that constituents have a decent chance of running into local politicians around town.",
      "\u201cAll of these folks were well-trusted, well-liked individuals,\u201d said Bishop Ronnie Crudup Sr., the head pastor of New Horizon Church International in Jackson. \u201cWhen you have servants from the mayor to City Council members to the local DA all being indicted, that\u2019s a tremendous hit for the city.\u201d",
      "Jackson has already taken plenty of them. In 2022, a water crisis caused residents to go without clean water for days on end. That was on top of years of boil-water notices that eroded residents\u2019 trust in the city\u2019s water supply. Then, last year, Jacksonians went without municipal trash collection for roughly two weeks amid a contract dispute. And while some violent crimes have dropped, the homicide rate is still among the nation\u2019s highest.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not even shock anymore,\u201d Kim Meeks, who runs a locksmith shop in Jackson\u2019s Fondren neighborhood with her husband, said about the indictment. \u201cWhen\u2019s the next shoe going to drop?\u201d",
      "Federal prosecutors have alleged the officials accepted, or in Owens\u2019 case facilitated, bribe payments from out-of-state developers pitching a hotel project in downtown Jackson. Unbeknownst to them, the men were undercover FBI agents, according to a recently unsealed indictment. The mayor\u2019s office declined to comment; calls to Owens\u2019 attorneys, Banks and Lee were not returned.",
      "\u201cI know the state does not trust the administration of the city of Jackson,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Zakiya Summers, whose district includes parts of Jackson. Summers, who took office in 2020, said she is used to seeing \u201canti-Jackson\u201d legislation come across her desk, referring to what she called the state\u2019s push for oversight of city resources.",
      "A spokesperson for Republican Gov. Tate Reeves did not respond to questions about the relationship between the city and state. The spokesperson referred to his comments about the indictments on Nov. 7, when he called the charges \"serious.\"",
      "\"It is early in the process, and because it is an ongoing criminal matter, I don\u2019t believe I should make any other comment,\" Reeves told reporters.",
      "The House speaker and the lieutenant governor's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In April, a push by conservative legislators to strip local control of the city\u2019s water system failed for the second time in the House. More recently, a state-run police force has expanded its presence in Jackson. Last year, residents and civil groups also protested House Bill 1020, legislation sponsored by Republican lawmakers that would mandate the creation of a new court for Hinds County, of which Jackson is part, with a special judge and\u00a0prosecutors appointed by state officials.",
      "Supporters of the court say\u00a0it will promote public safety, but Lumumba called the bill \u201can attack on Black leadership,\u201d and the U.S. Justice Department and the NAACP weighed in on the city\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cH.B. 1020 intentionally discriminates against minority voters in Hinds County by creating a system of judicial and prosecutorial appointments specifically designed to undermine the historical power of Black residents, through their elected officials, to self-govern,\u201d they said in a complaint.",
      "A federal judge dismissed the NAACP\u2019s efforts to block the court in December; appointments for the court have not yet been announced.",
      "Next year\u2019s legislative session will overlap with primaries in the mayor\u2019s race, which could be more competitive for Lumumba than either of his two previous races.",
      "Some of his popularity stems from his revered father, Chokwe Lumumba, a civil rights activist, who was known on a national stage for calling for reparations, representing Black revolutionaries and successfully defending Tupac Shakur against assault charges.",
      "The elder Lumumba became mayor of Jackson in 2013 but died suddenly at age 66 only eight months into his term. His son announced his plans to run later that year, vowing to continue fighting for the city.",
      "\u201cI propose that the people didn\u2019t just vote for a man, they voted for a vision and for a movement,\u201d he told The Clarion-Ledger newspaper at the time. \u201cAnd no person is better suited to move that vision forward than myself, who co-authored it.\u201d",
      "Jacksonians will soon decide whether they still support that vision.",
      "Before his indictment, Lumumba announced his intentions to run again. Outside his arraignment, his sister, Rukia Lumumba, said those plans had not changed. He could face a crowded Democratic primary.",
      "Annie Cooper, 74, a retiree who lives in Northwest Jackson, said she voted for Lumumba in the past but has not decided whether she will again.",
      "\u201cI think that it\u2019s important for people to do things in a professional manner,\u201d she said, regarding the management of the city. \u201cIf it\u2019s not run in a certain way, it just gives the state more reason to take over.\u201d",
      "Byron D'Andra Orey, a political science professor at Jackson State University, said the bribery scandal could shape the municipal elections. \u201cHe\u2019s innocent until proven guilty,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t help his candidacy given the challenges Jackson faces. The negative attention it brings to his administration compounds what\u2019s already there.\u201d",
      "The Rev. CJ Rhodes, who leads Mount Helm Baptist Church in Jackson, said he was \u201cgrieved\u201d by the indictments but hopes the moment could prompt a change.",
      "\u201cThere could be people in the city of Jackson who remind us of our greatness and see this crisis more as an opportunity than as a death sentence,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is a great opportunity to convert the darkness rather than curse it.\u201d"

      "A federal judge ordered prosecutors Tuesday to get rid of copies of 19 pages of notes taken from Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' jail cell after his lawyers argued the seizure violated\u00a0attorney-client privilege.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the court will keep the papers while prosecutors and Combs\u2019 lawyers submit briefs about the issue over the next few weeks.",
      "Prosecutors have accused Combs of trying to influence witnesses while he is behind bars awaiting trial on charges of racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Combs was arrested this fall and charged with sex-related crimes that prosecutors say are linked to his music empire, which they allege he used to abuse and exploit women.",
      "Combs has denied both the charges and prosecutors' allegations that he is tampering with witnesses from jail. His defense has fired back at prosecutors, accusing the government of having committed \u201cegregious, willful and harmful breach of the attorney client privilege\u201d by seizing papers from his jail cell that should be protected from authorities.",
      "At Tuesday's hearing, Combs, 55, who wore olive prison clothing garb, appeared to have lost weight since his last court appearance. He smiled as he entered the courtroom but appeared to become grim as the hearing went on.",
      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said the papers \u2014\u00a011 pages and eight pages of a calendar book \u2014 feature Combs' writings about paying off witnesses and finding dirt on victims.",
      "\u201cA witness was paid off and finding dirt on two different victims is not privilege,\u201d Slavik said.",
      "She said that on Oct. 14, Combs called a family member to work with someone who is not a lawyer about finding information about an accuser.",
      "Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said he wants to know how prosecutors obtained the papers and to see the surveillance video showing the incident in Combs\u2019 cell at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. He argued that the incident could lead to the dismissal of the indictment or the recusal of the entire prosecution team.",
      "Slavik said the pages were obtained during a search that was part of a planned sweep to address contraband and drugs. No member of the prosecution team was aware of or responsible for the search \u2014\u00a0it was conducted by the Bureau of Prisons, the prosecutor told the judge.",
      "A Bureau of Prisons investigator said at Tuesday's hearing that the search was part of an ongoing covert investigation and that the materials were received in a completely appropriate manner.",
      "\"The bottom line is that no multi-agency law enforcement initiative justified rifling through Mr. Combs' personal handwritten notes of conversations with his lawyers, and the prosecutors\u2019 arguments to the contrary lack all credibility,\" Agnifilo wrote in a response to the court Tuesday."

    "summary": "Jay Z's Team Roc, the social justice arm of his Roc Nation entertainment company, filed a lawsuit Tuesday claiming Kansas City, Kansas, has violated public records laws by failing to \"timely produce\" law enforcement records related to decadeslong allegations of police abuse and misconduct.",
    "story": [
      "Jay Z's Team Roc, the social justice arm of his Roc Nation entertainment company, filed a lawsuit Tuesday claiming Kansas City, Kansas, has violated public records laws by failing to \"timely produce\" law enforcement records related to decadeslong allegations of police abuse and misconduct.",
      "The suit, filed in Wyandotte County District Court in partnership with the Midwest Innocence Project, says the Kansas City Police Department has not released substantial documents related to complaints pertaining to current and former detectives and officers after Roc Nation submitted a records request in November 2023.",
      "\"For decades, communities in Kansas City, Kansas \u2014 particularly minority and immigrant communities \u2014 have been subjected to an alarming pattern of abuse and other serious misconduct by the KCKPD,\" according to the suit, which was first obtained by NBC News.",
      "\"Rather than promoting a culture of transparency and accountability, the KCKPD has a long history of turning a blind eye to (at best) and even covering up (if not worse) abusive and/or corrupt conduct by its officers,\" the suit adds.",
      "The\u00a0complaint against the Kansas City Police Department and the Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas, alleges they have \"stonewalled\" the plaintiffs for almost a year. As part of its request under the Kansas Open Records Act, the plaintiffs said they were initially charged $2,200 in fees, which they agreed to pay.",
      "But to date, according to the plaintiffs, the 225 documents provided are mostly personnel locator records showing officer shifts and assignments and a smaller handful consisting of training materials and department policies. There has not been one document related to \"any complaint or investigation into even a single instance of misconduct by any member of the KCKPD,\" as requested, the suit says.",
      "The city's police force has come under scrutiny over allegations of corruption and civil rights violations in recent years. Activists have called for a broader federal investigation, particularly in light of the alleged abuses under former Kansas City police Det. Roger\u00a0Golubski,\u00a0who in September 2022 was charged with federal civil rights crimes after he was accused of exploiting Black women for sex and framing people for crimes they say they did not commit.",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Team Roc's managing director, Dania Diaz, said they only received personnel documents related to three out of 16 requests and some requests have not been sufficiently answered in a reasonable amount of time under the law.",
      "She said they believe litigation is warranted to compel action and to ultimately bring accountability to a department where officers' actions have come under scrutiny: \"This filing is because human beings with badges have betrayed the public's trust \u2026 That type of behavior must be held to a standard.\"",
      "Kansas City police didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit, and the Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas, declined to comment on pending litigation.",
      "The state's public records law does maintain that certain documents are exempt from public review, including personnel information of public employees and criminal investigation records.",
      "But the plaintiffs contend that the unified government denied its request in \"broad, undifferentiated strokes,\" and \"failed to distinguish between records relating to pending and closed investigations and failed to acknowledge that virtually all legitimate privacy concerns could be resolved through redactions.\"",
      "They add that the significant sum paid to the government, in what they were told would be an \"extensive\" and \"voluminous\" request, was met with boilerplate language they believe does not comply with the law.",
      "\"More important, the Unified Government's blanket assertion about 'unfounded allegations' is insufficient and reveals the heart of the problem when the public trust in law enforcement is broken,\" the suit says.",
      "The plaintiffs are seeking a judge to intervene and order the records to be produced within 30 days.",
      "Max Kautsch, a First Amendment rights lawyer in Lawrence, Kansas, said the state's open records law turns on whether disclosure of a document is in the public interest. There's a legitimate argument to be made that records related to police misconduct can \"shed light\" on how the public is being served, he added.",
      "Although Kansas' law is \"liberally construed to promote openness when there's ambiguity\" over whether a record is public, law enforcement records related to criminal complaints are routinely denied, Kautsch said.",
      "Team Roc's interest in Kansas City transpired after learning from local media in 2021 that the FBI had found numerous allegations of civil rights violations of officer misconduct and excessive force dating back to the 1990s.",
      "In 2022, Team Roc sued the department and took out a full-page ad in The Washington Post calling for an investigation. Team Roc attorney Alex Spiro wrote to the Justice Department that a \"blue wall of silence\" had allowed alleged misconduct to fester over decades.",
      "Following Golubski's arrest, Team Roc and other organizations rallied to get the Justice Department to launch a police \"pattern and practice\" investigation in Kansas City, Kansas, where about half the population is Black and Latino. That has not happened, although an investigation was opened in neighboring Kansas City, Missouri, regarding alleged discrimination within its police force of Black officers.",
      "That investigation has had little traction, according to the Kansas City Star, dimming hopes among some police reform advocates and community groups that the Justice Department under a Trump administration would review police in Kansas City, Kansas, as well. Under the first Trump administration, the department all but abandoned broad civil rights investigations into police forces.",
      "Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment about his potential plans for the Justice Department's police investigations.",
      "Meanwhile, attention on Kansas City, Kansas, police is expected to return next month, when Golubski's trial is scheduled to begin. Golubski, who\u00a0retired in 2010 after 35 years on the force, pleaded not guilty to six counts of deprivation of civil rights.",
      "Kansas City police didn't immediately respond to a request about community concerns. The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "Kansas City Police Chief Karl Oakman has previously said he would comply with any investigation, but Diaz contends there hasn't been any willingness on the department's part to be more transparent.",
      "\"We strongly believe that everyone wants to live in a society where they feel safe,\" she said. \"We are open to speaking to anyone who cares, and if this is not resolved before [Trump] takes office, we will work with the new administration to hopefully get a resolution that's decades long awaited.\""

    "story": [
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Susan Smith, who shocked the nation 30 years ago when she rolled her car into a lake with her two children inside and watched them drown, will ask a parole board Wednesday to release her from prison.",
      "Smith will testify virtually to the seven-person panel about why she believes she is ready to re-enter society. The board must approve parole with a simple majority vote in order to release her.",
      "Almost 30 years ago to the day, Susan Smith made international headlines when she said she was carjacked late at night near Union, South Carolina, by a Black man.",
      "She told police the man drove away with her 3-year-old son, Michael, and 14-month-old son, Alex, inside. Her report led to a nine-day manhunt during which Smith and her estranged husband, David Smith, pleaded on national TV for their safe return.",
      "The case drew massive media attention, including Susan Smith saying on NBC's \"TODAY\" show that, \u201cas a mother, it\u2019s only a natural instinct to protect your children from any harm, and the hardest part of this whole ordeal is not knowing if your children are getting what they need to survive and it hurts.\u201d",
      "Just hours after the Nov. 3, 1994, interview, Smith confessed to killing her sons, admitting to police that she had let her car roll into a nearby lake with the boys inside, watching as they drowned.",
      "At her trial the next year, prosecutors argued that Smith killed her sons because of a relationship with a wealthy man who ended it because he did not want children. Smith's attorneys argued she was the victim of sexual assault by her stepfather and was suffering a mental breakdown when she killed her sons.",
      "She was found guilty of murder and the jury sentenced her to life in prison, although prosecutors had sought the death penalty.",
      "Smith, now 53, has had an eventful three decades behind bars in South Carolina, including multiple disciplinary actions. Her first infraction occurred in 1997 when she was caught with contraband, a razor.",
      "In 2000, she was moved from the Women\u2019s Correctional Center after two prison guards pleaded guilty to having sexual encounters with her. Lt. Houston Cagle and Capt. Alfred R. Rowe Jr. were convicted of having sex with an inmate, following an investigation into prison guard conduct, according to Richland County criminal court records.",
      "The following year, Smith violated rules by not standing for count and was restricted to her cell for 45 days.\u00a0In 2010 and 2015, she was penalized with disciplinary detention and the loss of canteen privileges for using drugs, including marijuana, according to the South Carolina Department of Corrections.",
      "Last month, Smith was convicted of an internal disciplinary charge after speaking with a documentary filmmaker in August. According to the incident report, Smith \u201cdiscussed in depth the crime and the events leading up to and after it actually took place, including such details to what was in the trunk of the car when it went into the water and her plans to jump from a bridge while holding the boys but one woke up\u2026 Inmate Smith is profiting from her crime.\u201d",
      "She lost her telephone, tablet and canteen privileges for 90 days.",
      "While in prison, Smith has continued to argue in her defense. In a 2015 letter to The State newspaper in South Carolina, she wrote: \u201cSomething went very wrong that night. I was not myself. I was a good mother and I loved my boys... There was no motive as it was not even a planned event. I was not in my right mind\u2026 I am not the monster society thinks I am.\u201d",
      "Under state law, Smith became eligible for parole on Nov. 4. The board grants parole to about 8% of violent offenders, according to publicly available data. As of Monday, 471 people had written to the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services regarding Smith's hearing. Only six of the letters were in favor of her release.",
      "One of the jurors from her trial three decades ago,\u00a0Willie Rice, said Tuesday that Smith has \"done her time.\"",
      "\"The one thing that has always stuck in my head is would I be able to except her back in society , a question the prosecutor at the time asked before I became a juror,\" Rice said. \"My answer is still yes.\"",
      "David Smith, now her ex-husband and the father of Michael and Alex, said he plans to address the parole board Wednesday to oppose her release. Former lead prosecutor and current South Carolina State Rep. Tommy Pope is also expected to speak in opposition.",
      "Pope recently told\u00a0The State, \u201cI feel strongly that the death penalty was appropriate.\u201d He has said he believes the jury did not know a life sentence would give Smith the possibility of parole.",
      "Even the ex-prison guard who was found guilty of having sex with Smith in 2000\u00a0told NewsNation recently, \u201c[Smith\u2019s] prison record shows that she\u2019s not really learned anything,\u201d other than \u201chow to do illegal drugs.\u201d",
      "If she were granted parole, Smith would have to meet pre-release conditions regarding employment, residence, programming and detainers. If denied release, she could reapply in two years."

Their case has been thrust back into the public spotlight after recent documentaries and a Netflix series that dramatizes the murders and highlights the brothers\u2019 accounts that they acted in self-defense after years of physical and sexual abuse by their father.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n recommended this fall that the brothers be resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, citing good behavior during their 35 years behind bars. If a judge agrees, they would be immediately eligible for parole and could be released. A hearing is scheduled before a judge on Dec. 11",
      "But Hochman, the incoming DA, said he needs to review the case, including transcripts from two trials and prison disciplinary records, before he makes a recommendation. He could ask a judge for a delay.",

      "\u201cWas it a just decision or was it just a political ploy?\u201d Hochman asked NBC News. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have to do this thorough review of the facts and the law to make sure that there\u2019s no credibility problems with my decision.\u201d",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has denied that his re-election bid played any role in his support for resentencing.",
      "High-profile names, including Kim Kardashian, are among those who have called for the brothers\u2019 release, citing a cultural shift in how society views sexual abuse allegations and victims. Several of the brothers\u2019 relatives are also asking that they be set free.",
      "\u201cWe will look at all the facts of the underlying crimes and what created those crimes,\u201d Hochman said. \u201cBut as far as whether or not there\u2019s a cultural shift or not, that\u2019s in some ways irrelevant for whether or not the facts in the law in the Menendez case justify a resentencing and, if so, what that resentencing should be.\u201d",
      "The brothers have asked the court to weigh a piece of potential evidence centered on the sex abuse allegations to challenge their convictions \u2014 a letter Erik said he wrote to his cousin about the alleged abuse decades ago.",
      "Juan Mejia, who is now a head deputy for the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office but was a prosecutor on the brothers\u2019 second murder trial, said there are questions about that potential \u201clinchpin\u201d evidence, as one of the brothers\u2019 attorneys described it.",
      "\u201cAre they trying to pull another fast one on the court?\u201d Mejia asked.",
      "But many do believe the brothers.",
      "Last week, Gasc\u00f3n filed more than 600 pages of documents supporting resentencing, including several letters from prison employees and correctional officers who describe the brothers as rehabilitated \u201cmodel\u201d prisoners who deserve second chances.",
      "If Hochman were to make a different recommendation, he could introduce additional material ahead of the hearing next month, but ultimately the decision will be made by a judge, followed by the parole board and then, if he ultimately chooses to weigh in, Newsom."

    "summary": "Lenders often encourage federal student loan borrowers to enroll in automatic payments.",
    "story": [
      "Lenders often encourage federal\u00a0student loan\u00a0borrowers to enroll in automatic payments. It can seem like a good idea to do so: Borrowers don\u2019t need to worry about missing a payment and often get\u00a0a slightly lower interest rate\u00a0in exchange.",
      "However,\u00a0the decision can backfire\u00a0in a lending space plagued by\u00a0consumer abuses, according to a new report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, autopay errors were one of the most widespread, basic and consequential servicer errors we saw this year,\u201d CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman Julia Barnard told CNBC. \u201cThese errors are incredibly costly and completely unacceptable.\u201d",
      "In some cases, borrowers had money pulled from their bank accounts despite never consenting to autopay, Barnard said. Other autopay users saw incorrect amounts taken or were charged multiple times in the same month.",
      "CNBC\u00a0wrote\u00a0last year about a woman who was supposed to have a $0 monthly student loan payment under the plan she was enrolled in, but was charged $2,074 one month. After that unexpected debit, she worried she wouldn\u2019t be able to pay her mortgage.",
      "In March, one borrower told the CFPB that their student loan servicer took $6,897 from their account when they only owed $1,048.",
      "\u201cBorrowers have told the CFPB that these errors have made it hard or impossible for them to cover basic needs like food, medical care and rent,\u201d Barnard said.",
      "What borrowers can do about autopay errors",
      "Despite the issues some student loan borrowers experience, higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz recommends that people remain enrolled in the automatic payments.",
      "After all, it\u2019s one of the only ways to get an interest rate discount, he said. The savings is typically\u00a00.25%.",
      "In addition, he said, \u201cthey are less likely to be late with a payment.\u201d",
      "But some borrowers on a tight budget may prefer to forgo those benefits to make sure they\u2019re not overcharged, experts said.",
      "There are steps you can take to protect yourself from incorrect billing, Kantrowitz said.",
      "You can set up an alert with your bank and get notified whenever a debit occurs over a certain amount. If you set that amount a little under what your student loan bill should be, you can use that alert to check that the debit was correct each month and also have a record of your payment history, which can be especially helpful to those working toward loan forgiveness, Kantrowitz said.",
      "If your loan service takes the wrong amount from your bank account, you should immediately contact the servicer and demand a refund, Kantrowitz said. You should also ask your servicer to cover any late fees from bounced checks or an overdraft, he said.",
      "Unfortunately, Barnard says, the CFPB has heard from borrowers who weren\u2019t able to get a timely refund.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen instances where borrowers have waited months or even years to receive a refund related to autopay errors,\u201d she said.",
      "As a result, she also suggests borrowers reach out to their bank about the incorrect payment.",
      "\u201cThe borrowers\u2019 financial institution may be able to quickly resolve errors in autopay amounts,\u201d she said, so long as the borrower notifies them within 10 business days of the amount being debited.",
      "If you run into a wall with your servicer, you can file a complaint with the Education Department\u2019s feedback system at\u00a0Studentaid.gov/feedback. Problems can also be reported to the\u00a0Federal Student Aid\u2019s ombudsman, Kantrowitz said.",

    "story": [
      "Law enforcement missed critical opportunities to prevent a 2022 mass shooting at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado, a pair of lawsuits filed over the weekend allege.",
      "The suits claim that the massacre at Club Q in Colorado Springs, which killed five people and injured at least 19 others, could have been averted had authorities enforced Colorado\u2019s red flag law. The law, passed in 2019, allows law enforcement or family members to petition to have people\u2019s firearms temporarily removed if they are deemed dangers to themselves or others.",
      "The lawsuits were filed in U.S. District Court in Colorado. One was filed on behalf of three victims killed in the nightclub and their mothers, as well survivors of the attack. The other suit was filed on behalf of another survivor, Barrett Hudson, who was shot seven times before he escaped and who still has three bullets lodged in his body that cause \u201cdaily excruciating pain,\u201d his complaint says.",
      "The El Paso County Board of County Commissioners and former El Paso County Sheriff Bill Elder are named as defendants in the suits, which accuse them of negligence and, in the case of the deceased victims, wrongful death. A county spokesperson declined to comment on the allegations, citing the pending litigation. Elder did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Colorado is one of over a dozen states with red flag laws. The lawsuits say the El Paso County commissioners and the sheriff were critical of the state\u2019s red flag law because they saw it as an infringement on Second Amendment rights; before the law was enacted, the board of commissioners passed a resolution declaring El Paso County a \u201cSecond Amendment preservation county,\u201d according to the filings.",
      "The convicted shooter, Anderson Aldrich, then 22, who has identified as nonbinary, \u201chad a history of violent threats and behavior that clearly warranted intervention,\u201d the legal documents say. That included an arrest in June 2021 after Aldrich was alleged to have threatened to kill their grandparents, reportedly said they planned to become \u201cthe next mass killer\u201d and stockpiled weapons, the documents add.",
      "A judge later dismissed charges related to the 2021 arrest, largely because family members refused to cooperate with authorities, The Associated Press has reported. Aldrich was released on bond and, by August 2022, could legally possess firearms again without any restrictions, according to the lawsuits.",
      "The El Paso County defendants \u201cwillfully and wantonly ignored the shooter\u2019s warning signs,\u201d the legal documents say.",
      "\u201cThis tragedy was enabled by systemic failures, including law enforcement\u2019s refusal to enforce Colorado\u2019s Red Flag Law, which could have prevented the shooter from possessing firearms, and inadequate security measures at Club Q,\u201d they continue.",
      "Club Q is also named as a defendant, accused of having inadequate security despite past attacks targeting gay nightclubs, including a mass shooting that killed 49 people in Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, despite the increased risk of mass shooters, and industry opinion recommending increased security measures, Club Q decreased its security following the 2016 Pulse attack,\u201d the legal documents say.",
      "They add: \u201cClub Q advertised itself as a \u2018safe space\u2019 for LGBTBQIA+ individuals. But that was a fa\u00e7ade.\u201d",
      "Matthew Haynes, one of the owners of Club Q, said in a statement Tuesday that the accusations \u201care false and completely inaccurate.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe blame for this tragedy does not lie with those who were impacted but with Anderson Aldrich, the shooter, and a system that enables easy access to weapons of war,\u201d he said.",
      "The lawsuits seek jury trials. Aldrich, now 24, is serving life in prison after he pleaded guilty last year to five counts of murder and 46 counts of attempted murder. He later also pleaded guilty to hate crimes in federal court."

      "Mattel has released a new Barbie doll in honor of Rita Moreno's upcoming 93rd birthday.",
      "The doll of the trailblazing actress is part of the toymaker's Barbie Tribute Collection, which showcases the contributions and immense cultural impact of women such as Moreno, who was the first Latina to win an Academy Award.",
      "\u201cI was a girl who decided to go for it, and despite the challenges I faced, I never gave up on my dreams,\" Moreno said in a statement. \"I hope this doll inspires in each and every girl today: to live their life with courage and resilience so that they can make their dreams a reality.\"",
      "The doll's dress is inspired by the gown Moreno wore on the night she made history at the 34th Oscar ceremony in 1962, when she won best supporting actress for her role as Anita in \"West Side Story.\"",
      "Born in Puerto Rico in 1931 and raised in New York City, Moreno went on to have an illustrious career that has spanned seven decades.",
      "After \"West Side Story,\" she went on to win a Grammy, a Tony and in 1977 an Emmy, becoming only the third person to achieve EGOT status by winning all four of the most prestigious awards in show business.",
      "From \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d and \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d to \u201cThe Ritz\u201d and other movies and TV shows, Moreno has joined countless projects that center on narratives of Latino families. Through her art and activism, she has advocated for more Latinos to tell authentic stories about their communities in Hollywood. Moreno has also defended several human rights and social justice causes, such as gender and racial equality.",
      "Moreno's remarkable career has been recognized by several other high-profile awards. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004, the National Medal of Arts\u00a0in 2009 and a Kennedy Center Honor for her lifetime contributions\u00a0in 2015. The Peabody Awards organization gave Moreno a career achievement award in 2019.",
      "In 2021, she released the documentary \u201cRita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It,\u201d chronicling her extraordinary life and career, detailing the highs of her rise to stardom in Hollywood and the lows of the pernicious sexual abuse and relentless racism that she endured along the way.",
      "According to Mattel, the company worked closely with Moreno to sculpt a doll that properly reflects the likeness of the iconic performer. They worked together on initial designs and final touches for the outfit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to celebrate Rita Moreno as the latest addition to our Barbie Tribute Collection,\u201d said Krista Berger, senior vice president of Barbie and global head of dolls at Mattel. \u201cShe has shattered stereotypes and barriers for Latinas in the entertainment industry and beyond. Her fierce advocacy for the Latino community and her tireless commitment to pursuing her passions in the performing arts perfectly encapsulates Barbie\u2019s mission to inspire the next generation.\u201d",
      "The Barbie Tribute Collection, which started in 2021, has honored other trailblazing women including Lucille Ball, Vera Wang and Laverne Cox.",
      "While Moreno officially turns 93 on Dec. 11, the doll designed in her honor is already available online at the Mattel shop.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been an absolute pleasure to work with Barbie to bring this doll to life, and I hope it serves as a reminder to embrace your limitless possibilities and pursue your passions because when you embrace them, you\u2019re bound to go far,\u201d Moreno said."

    "story": [
      "For \u201cInterior Chinatown\u201d star Jimmy O. Yang, playing an invisible Chinatown extra in the new series hit close to home. That\u2019s because one of Yang\u2019s first roles was \u201cChinese Teenager #1.\u201d",
      "The irony helped him relate to his character, Willis Wu, and plays out in the series about a struggling Chinatown waiter who is pulled into investigating his brother\u2019s disappearance, airing on Hulu on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cInterior Chinatown,\u201d based on the National Book Award-winning novel of the same name by Charles Yu, is technically a show within a show. The leads \u2014 Yang, Chloe Bennet and Ronny Chieng \u2014 play \u201cChinatown\u201d extras within a police procedural called \u201cBlack and White.\u201d They are largely ignored by everyone in the procedural until the lights fade and the cameras go away, bringing viewers back to the characters\u2019 Chinatown realities.",
      "In the show\u2019s meta world, Yang is a lead actor playing a background character. His character, Willis, sneaks into \u201cBlack and White\u201d by disguising himself as the tech guy and the Chinese food deliveryman, using these stereotypes to his advantage.",
      "\u201cWe get put in a box,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThey expect you to know kung fu, they expect you to be a good student, or the model minority tech guy.\u201d",
      "For Yang, who has mostly played comedic roles, getting to embody multiple characters at once was creatively rewarding. \u201cI love subverting expectations \u2014 that\u2019s what the show is about, and that\u2019s what my career has been about,\u201d Yang said.",
      "He appreciates how the show lifts the curtain on the lives of sidelined characters, and how Chinatown is a metaphor for how he says America flattens certain communities. \u201cWe\u2019re shown the facades, the Chinese words, the kitschy restaurants, but what you don\u2019t usually see is behind the scenes,\u201d he said.",
      "Meanwhile, Chieng\u2019s character, Fatty Choi, remains a defender of Chinatown. Though Willis learns to jump between the worlds of \u201cBlack and White\u201d and Chinatown, Fatty stubbornly refuses to leave the Chinese restaurant where the two friends work. \u201c[Fatty] represents this idea of not pandering to a white society that doesn\u2019t even see you or want you around,\u201d Chieng said.",
      "Another character who navigates both worlds is Detective Lana Lee, played by Bennet. In \u201cBlack and White,\u201d Lee is a biracial cop who is simultaneously treated as a valuable \u201cChinatown insider\u201d and is constantly dismissed by her counterparts as an outsider. Bennet said as an actor, she paid special attention to the lighting cues, wardrobe and the way Lana carried herself in different contexts.\u00a0\u201cWe were really strategic with when to highlight the fact that I came from both worlds,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cLana uses that kind of code switching as a way to manipulate and deflect throughout the season.\u201d",
      "Bennet has discussed publicly how Hollywood struggles to understand her biraciality. She said playing a character that embodied her racial frustrations has been a cathartic experience. \u201cI felt so seen by the way Charlie [Yu] wrote her inner dialogue,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much I needed to play her and how much of her story is still so relevant to my life.\u201d",
      "Chieng said that by satirizing Hollywood\u2019s failures, the show makes a point about the larger society we live in. He hopes viewers will walk away with more curiosity about the lives of people behind the scenes. \u201cWe need to pay attention to who\u2019s in the background, and recognize them as people who have their own stories, their own tragedies and their own goals,\u201d he said."

      "Moviegoers who spoke to NBC News said they expect excited \u201ctheater kids\u201d to know the etiquette of not singing over the actors during the show. Many said they plan to lip sync, but that they would save the actual singing along for another time.",
      "\u201cYou would never sing in a Broadway theater,\u201d said Alex Lewis, a longtime member of the off-Broadway community who was among the many people who posted his take on the debate on TikTok. He and his band, Lewberger, posted a short song joking about the discourse last month.",

      "In her TikTok video, she joked that when the song \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d comes on, she will need all of her willpower to refrain from belting.",
      "Recognizing the fan passion surrounding the musical, some theaters like Alamo Drafthouse have already sold out \u201cinteractive\u201d showings, which actually recommend fans go all-out. The popular chain frequently hosts what it calls Movie Parties, which are interactive and prop-filled.",

    "story": [
      "Fifty years after the\u00a0Manson\u00a0Family killings, the name Charles\u00a0Manson\u00a0still evokes a strong image \u2014 that of a shaggy-haired cult leader who spoke provocatively about mass murder.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no need to feel guilty. I haven\u2019t done anything I\u2019m ashamed of. Maybe I haven\u2019t done enough,\u201d\u00a0Manson said in a\u00a01987 interview with TODAY\u00a0at California\u2019s San Quentin prison. \u201cMaybe I should have killed four, five hundred people, then I would have felt better. Then I would have felt like I really offered society something.\u201d",
      "Manson, whose followers committed a series of brutal killings in the late 1960s, is known for his infamous crimes. What\u2019s less known is who\u00a0Manson\u00a0was behind the scenes, when he was not being interviewed or making erratic outbursts in the courtroom.",
      "A new Peacock docuseries, \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson,\u201d out Nov. 19, features 20 years of never-before-heard recordings of\u00a0Manson\u2019s private phone conversations from prison. Peacock is owned by TODAY\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.",
      "More than 100 hours of audio recordings were provided by John Michael Jones, a man who says he first wrote to\u00a0Manson\u00a0in an effort to get his signature, then struck up a decadeslong relationship with him,\u00a0according to his interview in the documentary.\u00a0They stayed in touch until\u00a0Manson\u2019s death in 2017.",
      "These recordings \u201cgave us a candid conversation that we\u2019ve never seen. We\u2019ve never seen\u00a0Manson\u00a0without the mask before,\u201d the documentary\u2019s director, Billie Mintz, tells\u00a0TODAY.com.",
      "Mintz says the documentary, which also features several interviews with former members of\u00a0Manson\u2019s circle, is not meant to exonerate\u00a0Manson, but to add dimension and context to the widely accepted narrative about him. The documentary also includes the perspective of a forensic psychologist who analyzes\u00a0Manson\u2019s tapes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that I have sympathy for\u00a0Manson,\u201d Mintz says, \u201cbut by humanizing him, we understand a lot more of what led to these tragic events, and we learned a lot more about ourselves.\u201d",
      "Read on to learn more about Charles\u00a0Manson, and what is revealed in \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson.\u201d",
      "Who was Charles Manson?",
      "Charles\u00a0Manson\u00a0was a cult leader who was convicted in murder in 1971\u00a0after his\u00a0supporters committed a series of violent murders under his influence.",
      "Manson\u2019s followers, many of whom were teenage girls drawn to communal living and other 1960s counterculture ideals, have opened up about how he exerted power over them.",
      "\u201cHe was always needing to be in control, and that came from having all control taken from him at a very young age, and being helpless,\u201d former follower Catherine Share says in the documentary.",
      "Share was not involved in the Tate-LaBianca murders but served five years for involvement in a\u00a0Manson\u00a0Family robbery and later served a sentence for participating in a credit card scheme,\u00a0per AP.",
      "\u201cAnd a man does not want to be helpless, and he\u2019ll do anything not to feel that way again. He tried love for a while. He said, \u2018Oh, that worked.\u2019 And he said, \u2018But fear is stronger.\u2019\u201d",
      "Manson\u00a0had a troubled upbringing full of trauma and abandonment, per\u00a0NBC News, and he had frequent run-ins with the law from a young age. By the time he was 32 and released from a 10-year prison term in 1967, he had spent half his life in prison, Vincent Bugliosi \u2014 a true crime author and the prosecutor at\u00a0Manson\u2019s trial for the Tate-LaBianca Murder \u2014 estimates in \u201cHelter Skelter,\u201d a definitive book about\u00a0Manson. After his release, he moved to San Francisco and began attracting members of a group he called the Family. Members of the Family would go on to commit murders at\u00a0Manson\u2019s ordering.",
      "In April 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, as well as one count of conspiracy to commit murder, for the deaths of seven people in what is often referred to as the Tate-LaBianca murders.",
      "Members of\u00a0Manson\u2019s followers killed five people during the Tate murders, which took place on Aug. 9, 1969.",
      "Actor Sharon Tate Polanski, the wife of director Roman Polanski, was one of the people killed during a gathering at her home. She had been 8 months pregnant. Also murdered were hair stylist Jay Sebring, Folger coffee heiress Abigail Folger and her boyfriend, writer Wojciech Frykowski and Steven Parent, who was visiting the caretaker of the Polanskis\u2019 guest house.",
      "The next day on Aug. 10,\u00a0Manson\u2019s followers murdered two more people, Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary LaBianca, at their home in Los Angeles, per the Associated Press.",
      "While\u00a0Manson\u00a0was not physically present for any of these murders, prosecutors argued he held responsibility for the killings because he had known about the planned violence and had been closely involved in directing his followers to commit murder.",
      "\u201cThe prosecution\u2019s thesis was that\u00a0Manson\u00a0was vicariously liable for the acts of all the co-indictees,\u201d according to a\u00a01976 opinion\u00a0issued in the Court of Appeals of California. \u201cIf the jury believed\u00a0Manson\u00a0to be a conspirator, aider or abettor he was culpable for all of the homicides regardless of who held the knife.\u201d",
      "Manson\u00a0spoke to his role in the murders in the documentary. \u201cI never said I was innocent. I said I didn\u2019t break the law,\u201d he said.",
      "In March 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0and three of his followers, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, were sentenced to death for their roles in the Tate-LaBianca killings,\u00a0NBC News reported in his obit. Van Houten was charged in conspiracy for all the killings but for murder only in the LaBianca killings. Tex Watson was also sentenced to death later that year, the\u00a0New York Times reported\u00a0in 1971.",
      "In December 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0received two further first-degree murder convictions for the July 1969 death of musician Gary Hinman, per\u00a0NBC News, and the August 1969 death of stuntman and actor Donald Shea, per\u00a0NBC News.",
      "Bobby Beausoleil was convicted in the killing of Hinman in 1970 and remains in prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "In 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0devotee Bruce Davis was convicted in the killing of Hinman and Shea, and he remains in prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Steve Grogan was also convicted in Shea\u2019s killing and was released on parole in 1985 after revealing the location of Shea\u2019s body, per\u00a0the L.A. Times.",
      "The following year,\u00a0Manson\u00a0and his followers\u2019 sentences were commuted to life in prison after California abolished the death penalty in 1972.",
      "Manson\u00a0remained incarcerated for the rest of his life. He died at 83 from natural causes on Nov. 19, 2017, at a hospital in Kern County, California, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "Atkins, convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, died in prison of cancer in 2009,\u00a0NBC News reported. Watson and Krenwinkel, both convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, remain in prison, per the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Van Houten, convicted on two counts of first-degree murder, was freed on parole in 2023,\u00a0NBC News reported.",
      "What is revealed in the Peacock documentary about\u00a0Manson?",
      "The \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson\u201d docuseries features never-before-heard audio recordings of\u00a0Manson\u00a0discussing his childhood, his followers and his criminal convictions.",
      "In one recording,\u00a0Manson\u00a0claims that he murdered multiple people in Mexico.",
      "\u201cSee, there\u2019s a whole part of my life that nobody knows about,\u201d he tells Jones in the tape. \u201cI lived in Mexico for a while. I went to Acapulco, stole some cars. I just got involved in stuff over my head, man \u2026 got involved in a couple of killings. I left my .357 Magnum in Mexico City, and I left some dead people on the beach.\u201d",
      "He also argues that he was not responsible for the murders his followers committed and accuses the media of twisting his story.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the media. The media that starts selling that. They didn\u2019t want to hear the truth. They wanted that hippie cult leader thing, man,\u201d he says in one recording. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give a f--- whether I did it or whether I didn\u2019t do it. They wanted that vicarious thrill.\u201d",
      "Jones says in the documentary that he resonated with\u00a0Manson\u2019s difficult childhood experiences and describes building up a trusting relationship with\u00a0Manson\u00a0over the years.",
      "\u201cHe found somebody he could be vulnerable to. I think that\u2019s why Charlie gave me a lot of what we have on these tapes. And I think the longer I spent getting to know him, slowly that mask began to peel off,\u201d he says.",
      "Director Billie Mintz says it\u2019s possible that\u00a0Manson\u00a0was lying at times on the tapes and attempting to manipulate Jones.",
      "\u201cI think that for sure,\u00a0Manson\u00a0wanted (Jones) to like him, and (Jones) wanted to like\u00a0Manson,\u201d Mintz says. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s manipulation, but from listening to these stories, (Manson) didn\u2019t have any reason to. He didn\u2019t want to get out of prison. He wasn\u2019t trying to exonerate himself. He literally says, \u2018I\u2019m a bad guy. I should be in prison, but I shouldn\u2019t be in prison for this.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mintz says the documentary places the tapes in context by interviewing a wide range of\u00a0Manson\u00a0experts and former followers to create \u201cdiscourse where there was no discourse before.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t say we know the truth, but maybe we give you a more nuanced, closer version of the story to the truth than you might\u2019ve had before,\u201d he says.",
      "\u200b\u200bThe documentary features interviews with multiple former members of the Family, including Dianne Lake, who was 14 when she met\u00a0Manson.\u00a0She wrote in her memoir \u201cMember of the Family\u201d\u00a0that\u00a0she did not participate in the Tate-LaBianca murders, and in fact testified against\u00a0Manson\u00a0and other members of the Family during the murder trial.",
      "Lake, who was known by the nickname \u201cSnake\u201d in the Family, describes how\u00a0Manson\u00a0allegedly treated his female followers.",
      "\u201cHe definitely used us and he definitely abused us,\u201d she says. \u201cI got hit and beat and raped, once, and I think the other girls probably did, too, but they kept it a secret.\u201d",
      "Share, another former\u00a0Manson\u00a0associate, recalls\u00a0Manson\u00a0turning \u201cabsolutely dark and electrified and menacing.\u201d",
      "The documentary also features interviews with\u00a0Manson\u2019s former cellmate and family members of the Family\u2019s victims, as well as interviews with an investigative reporter, a forensic psychologist and a former FBI special agent and criminologist.",
      "Near the end of the documentary, Jones defends his relationship with\u00a0Manson.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a fanboy. I\u2019m a f------ human being with a heart who happened to befriend somebody that I didn\u2019t expect to,\u201d he says.",

      "Here\u2019s what to know about the sketch and the enthusiastic reaction it provoked.",

      "Released weeks before Halloween, several TikTok users uploaded their creative costumes inspired by Domingo and the sketch leading up to the holiday.",

      "\"I booked a couple of movies, and he saw that this is what I really wanted to do for the rest of my life. He was nothing but supportive,\" Crew says about his father.",
      "The 19-year-old recently joined the cast of another CBS daytime drama, \"The Bold and the Beautiful,\" as Will Spencer, the son of Katie Logan (Heather Tom) and Bill Spencer (Don Diamont). He says it's been \"incredible practice.\"",
      "Even though he grew up with a soap opera star as a father, Crew wasn't always eager to follow in his dad's footsteps.",
      "\u201cIt absolutely was not a passion of mine, but I always loved to make videos. I had several YouTube channels where I would make these little vlogs, edits and films at home. So that\u2019s where the passion sort of started,\" he says.",
      "After booking roles in two films, \u201c24 Hours to D-Day\u201d and \u201cContinental Split,\u201d Crew started to realize that he could make a living as an actor. He went on to audition for several shows, including \"B&B,\" and was convinced that he wouldn't get this particular role.",
      "\u201cI thought they couldn\u2019t possibly go with me, and then a month rolled on and I got the call,\u201d he recalls.",
      "Since he\u2019s so early on in his career, Crew is eager to learn from his new co-stars.",
      "\"Scott (Clifton, who plays Liam Spencer) is an incredible scene partner. Just watching him the way he does it, he\u2019s so good,\u201d he says, adding that all of his co-stars are \"so great.\"",
      "Tom, who plays Crew's mother on \"B&B,\" played Josh Morrow's on-screen sister on \"Y&R\" in the '90s. When she started working with Crew all these years later, she couldn't help but comment on his uncanny resemblance to his father.",
      "\u201cShe could not get over how much we looked alike,\u201d he says.",
      "Funnily enough, Crew only visited his father on the \"Y&R\" set a handful of times as a child, and he'd never been to the nearby set of \"B&B\" before landing the role of Will.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t grow up around it. People think I grew up around this world. I really didn\u2019t. And that\u2019s partly due to my dad. I mean, all he ever wanted to do was do his job and then raise his family and play sports with his sons. And that\u2019s what we did,\" he says.",
      "Now that he's building his own acting career, Crew has turned to his father for some pointers here and there.",
      "\"He\u2019ll watch the show back sometimes with my mother, and he\u2019ll come to me with these little tidbits that I absolutely appreciate. He\u2019s been in the game for so long, and he knows this medium so well, and he knows what people want to see that it\u2019s hard not to take his advice because you know that he\u2019s right,\" he says.",
      "On \"B&B,\" Crew's character recently returned to town and has started interning at the company where his mother works, Forrester Creations. He's also started crushing on a co-worker named Electra Forrester (Laneya Grace).",
      "\"I\u2019m just really nailing down who Will Spencer is as a man and what you\u2019re going to see from him,\" he notes.",
      "Looking ahead, Crew has dreams of writing his own films and doing his own stunts.",
      "\u201cAnything and everything is a win for me, but this job especially is just massive for sharpening my blades and my tools,\u201d he says.",
      "Of course, Crew would also be the perfect candidate for the role of his father's TV son Christian Newman on \"Y&R\" if the show ever decides to cast the character, who is often mentioned but never seen on screen.",
      "\"We talk to each other all the time about how it\u2019s silly that I\u2019m not playing that role,\" he jokes. \"But I\u2019m so thankful that 'B&B' decided to cast me as Will Spencer because now I can sort of carve my own legacy on another television show while also being in very close proximity to my dad.\""

      "\"They were so happy for me for all about three minutes,\" Bode, 24, tells TODAY. \"And then they were like, 'We told you to get your passport.'\"",
      "\"Wicked\" was filmed in the United Kingdom, near London. She was offered the part in October 2022, and ideally, she would have headed to set the next day.",
      "\"Rehearsals had already started. Ethan (Slater) was already there, Ari (Grande) and Cynthia (Erivo) were already over there,\" Bode says.",
      "But there was a catch: She needed to order a passport. So after the initial excitement of getting cast wore off \u2014 a process that included leads Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo holding up a sign that read, \"Will you be our Nessarose?\" \u2014\u00a0Bode was \"terrified,\" she says.",
      "\u201cAfter everything calmed down, I was like, \u2018Hey, so, actually I don\u2019t have my passport,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was so scared they were going to go with somebody else. But it worked out.\u201d",
      "After Bode got the document expedited, delaying her trip across the pond to film by only a few weeks, she came onto the set feeling \"nervous and anxious.\"",
      "\"When I care about something so much like this, I want to put my all into it, and I want to remind them why they chose me,\" she says.",
      "The Universal Pictures production marks Bode's film debut. (Universal Pictures is owned by TODAY.com's parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "The Wisconsin native grew up performing in plays through middle school and high school and attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles to study acting.",
      "Before she landed the part in \"Wicked,\" Bode was working as an after-school art teacher and mentor. When the audition for Nessarose landed in her inbox, she put her all into it.",
      "She says she feels \"beyond privileged and lucky\" to have been cast in \"Wicked\" just one year after graduating college.",
      "\"When you're not represented a lot and you don't see yourself, you still have \u2014 or at least I did have \u2014 a little bit of, 'I know what I'm capable of. I know that I can act. I know other disabled talent that can act and can model,'\" she says. \"But how much of the industry is willing to go for that and is willing to seek out disabled people and willing to listen? That was the one thing that I definitely bumped into.\"",
      "Now, she's making history as the first actor who uses a wheelchair to portray Nessarose, Elphaba's sister, in \"Wicked\" throughout its more than 21-year run.",
      "Making Nessarose her own",
      "In \u201cWicked,\u201d Nessarose is the younger sister of the green witch Elphaba, who eventually becomes the Wicked Witch of the West.",
      "In the story, Nessarose uses a wheelchair due to complications from her birth, attributable to her mother eating milk flowers while pregnant to avoid having another green baby.",
      "Much of Nessarose\u2019s arc involves her asserting her independence \u2014 something Bode, who started using a wheelchair at age 11 after a car accident, can relate to. After the accident, she remembers having her parents come on class trips with her for \u201cliability purposes,\u201d a phrase she puts in quotes.",
      "\u201cI see all my other classmates be completely independent, and that was hard for me, because all I wanted was to have that independence,\u201d she says.",
      "Bode\u2019s own upbringing allowed her to empathize with Nessarose, especially her situation at the beginning of the film. In \u201cWicked,\u201d Nessarose is excited to start school at Shiz University on her own, away from her father and sister. But the sisters' father asks Elphaba to keep an eye on Nessarose, which eventually leads to Elphaba enrolling at Shiz, too.",
      "\u201cAlthough you love your family, you really do want to be on your own and to prove to yourself that you can, even though you already know that you can,\u201d Bode says.",
      "Elphaba\u2019s journey to attending Shiz University in \u201cWicked\u201d the movie is slightly different from the musical\u2019s storyline. Originally, Elphaba is enrolled at Shiz from the beginning under her father\u2019s orders to look after her sister. But in the 2024 film, the plan is for Elphaba to only be there while Nessarose gets settled in.",
      "\u201cOf course, all disabilities are different, and there are some people in wheelchairs that have a higher level of needs and higher level of caregiving. But I think this was a moment to showcase that I don\u2019t have to be dependent on somebody,\u201d Bode says.",
      "In the musical, Nessarose and Elphaba\u2019s relationship is complicated, in part, by Nessarose\u2019s resentment of Elphaba\u2019s powers, her ability to walk and the amount of attention she receives.",
      "By splitting the movies in two, \u201cWicked\u201d can slow down and explore a sweeter side to their relationship.",
      "\u201cThere were pockets of time within the film itself when Elphaba is there where I am enjoying her presence because she\u2019s my sister,\u201d Bode says of her character.",
      "Another small difference that can be seen as a big change in Nessarose\u2019s storyline is how she tells Elphaba about the invitation she receives to the Ozdust Ballroom during the sweeping mid-film number \u201cDancing Through Life.\u201d",
      "Nessarose is able to \u201cconfide in her sister about wanting to go to this dance and have that be more of a special moment for them,\u201d Bode says, \u201crather than really anxiously begging the whole time, \u2018Please, just me.\u2019\u201d",
      "Making history in and out of Oz",
      "As the first-ever physically disabled actor to play Ness, Bode brings direct experience to the character.",
      "\u201cHow I feel as a disabled person in a world that is not necessarily built for me, in a world where people just don\u2019t understand or aren\u2019t always fully educated on disability as a whole \u2014 I definitely took those with me and leaned that into my character,\u201d Bode says.",
      "Bode says she feels \u201cover the moon\u201d about the decision to cast a wheelchair user as Nessarose in the \u201cWicked\u201d film.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not something I saw a lot of when I was growing up, and if I did, it was like for one special episode and you never saw the character again,\u201d Bode says.",
      "Bode credits some of the \u201clittle things\u201d she brought to the character of Nessarose with making her performance feel authentic. For example \u2014 where and how Nessarose transported her bag.",
      "\u201cI made the adjustment of having it on the back of my chair,\u201d she says.",
      "Nessarose is also able to independently make her way around campus in the movie. \u201cThankfully, the University of Shiz is accessible,\u201d Bode says. \u201cThere are ramps everywhere.\u201d",
      "And that alone sends a message, Bode says.",
      "\u201cThere are still a number of campuses \u2014 I know because I have a number of disabled friends still going to college and even my partner who\u2019s in college \u2014 that aren\u2019t accessible,\u201d Bode says. \u201cI think that also sends a message to universities and just people as a whole as to why and how they should make their spaces more accessible.\u201d",
      "She hopes her character can help people \u201cfeel a lot less alone,\u201d especially if they haven\u2019t found their community yet.",
      "But representation is \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg,\u201d she notes.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much more when it comes to fighting for accessibility and inclusion,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I hope feeling less alone helps other disabled people and emboldens them to advocate for themselves and for others in the community.\u201d"

    "summary": "Israeli prosecutors have accused one of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s aides of illegally leaking classified intelligence in an attempt to blunt criticism.",
    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Israeli prosecutors have accused one of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s aides of illegally leaking classified intelligence in an attempt to blunt widespread criticism of the prime minister\u2019s handling of the Gaza hostage crisis.",
      "The allegations, detailed in newly released court filings, are part of a sprawling criminal probe that has rocked Israel\u2019s government and led to the aide\u2019s arrest and detention in prison. Four military personnel have also been arrested in connection with the case.",
      "Investigators discovered that a low-level Israeli soldier had illegally removed Hamas documents from a military database and passed them to Eli Feldstein, a communications consultant working for Netanyahu, prosecutors said.",
      "Feldstein, 32, then tried to get the documents published in the media with the goal of showing that the hostage families' protests were playing into Hamas\u2019 hands, according to the prosecutors' filings, which were published Sunday.",
      "Feldstein acted \u201cwith the intention of influencing public opinion in Israel on the negotiations regarding the hostages and in particular the issue of the contribution of the demonstrations to the strengthening of Hamas,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "Their filings came after Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff was questioned as part of a separate investigation into allegations that he tried to tamper with official phone logs from the day of Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack, a police official told NBC News.",
      "Netanyahu has not been personally accused of wrongdoing in either case and his office denies the allegations, saying it is being targeted by politically motivated security officials attempting to undermine the government.",
      "The leak investigation, referred to in Israeli media as \u201cBibiLeaks,\u201d from the prime minister\u2019s nickname \u201cBibi,\u201d was launched after the German tabloid Bild published an article in early September based on leaked Hamas documents.",
      "The newspaper claimed it had obtained documents from the personal computer of Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, who was subsequently killed by Israeli forces in October.",
      "The documents, according to the Bild report, showed Hamas was not interested in a quick cease-fire and believed that the protests by hostage families would weaken Israel\u2019s negotiating position.",
      "The story was published at a time of intense public anger toward Netanyahu in Israel following the murder of six hostages, including Israeli American Hersh Goldberg Polin, by Hamas in late August.",
      "Days after it was published, Netanyahu cited the article as evidence of Hamas\u2019 intent \u201cto use psychological warfare on the hostage families\u201d and to put pressure on the Israeli government.",
      "But inside the Israeli military, the story\u2019s publication set off alarm bells. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that the document cited by Bild was several months old and was not written by Sinwar, but instead a mid-level Hamas operative.",
      "Military leaders ordered an investigation into the leak of the document \u2014 which was classified as \u201ctop secret\u201d \u2014 and called in the police and the Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic security agency.",
      "In Sunday\u2019s filings, prosecutors said that when Israeli media declined to publish the document because of military censorship rules, Feldstein went around the domestic censor by giving the document to the Bild newspaper in Germany. A Bild spokesman told NBC News that the newspaper does not comment on its sourcing.",
      "Feldstein was arrested in late October. The Israeli soldier accused of leaking the document to him has also been arrested, along with three other military personnel, prosecutors said.",
      "On Monday, Israeli prison authorities said Feldstein had been placed on suicide watch.",
      "Asked to comment on Sunday\u2019s court filings, Netanyahu's office referred NBC News to a statement from Nov. 12 that said police had invoked special powers reserved for national security cases to hold Feldstein in isolation and deny him access to a lawyer.",
      "\u201cIt hurts us very much that the lives of young people are being destroyed with idle claims to harm the Right-wing government,\u201d his office said. \u201cIn a democratic country people are not arrested because of a leak for 20 days in the basements \u2014 while preventing a meeting with a lawyer for many days \u2014 just to extract from them false statements against the Prime Minister.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu has a history of railing against Israeli law enforcement. In 2019, he became the first sitting prime minister in the country\u2019s history to be charged with a crime.",
      "He denies the litany of bribery, fraud and breach of trust allegations and has said the prosecution is politically motivated. His lawyers have repeatedly tried to delay trial proceedings, citing his wartime leadership responsibilities.",

      "The advocacy group, which represents hostages and their families has repeatedly\u00a0 criticized Netanyahu and his government over the negotiations to free those taken captive by Hamas during the Oct. 7 terror attacks. Around 100 people remain in captivity, although around a third are believed to be dead.",
      "Police are also investigating allegations against Tzachi Braverman, Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff. Braverman was questioned for several hours last week but has not been arrested or charged, according to an Israeli police official briefed on the investigation.",
      "Police are looking into claims that Braverman falsified phone records from the morning of Oct. 7, the official said. The alleged alterations appear intended to make it look like Netanyahu sprung into action more quickly than he did.",
      "Braverman allegedly asked an aide to change phone records to make it look like a conversation that was logged as having occurred at 6.40 a.m. instead took place 11 minutes earlier, at 6.29 a.m., the official said. Braverman then changed the log himself in a handwritten note.",
      "The police investigation is completed and prosecutors will now make a decision on whether any charges are merited.",
      "Jack Chen, an attorney for Braverman, told NBC News that the situation was the result of a misunderstanding about the order of the phone calls during the chaotic early hours of the Hamas attack. He said Braverman had explained the misunderstanding to police, and they released him without any restrictive conditions.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s office would not comment specifically on Braverman\u2019s questioning but pointed to an earlier statement made by the prime minister on Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cFor the past few days, my office has been under a wild and unrestrained attack,\u201d Netanyahu said at the time. \u201cThe goal is not to protect the security of the state. The goal is to promote an agenda of weakness and concessions during the war.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin formally lowered the threshold for his country's use of nuclear weapons Tuesday, days after the U.S. allowed Ukraine to strike inside Russia using American missiles.",
      "The Kremlin announced that Putin had approved an updated nuclear doctrine \u2014 a document that governs how Russia uses its nuclear arsenal \u2014 including the declaration that Moscow could unleash a nuclear strike if subject to an attack by a nonnuclear country that has the support of a nuclear state.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Ukraine had carried out its first strike on Russian territory using U.S.-supplied long-range weapons, hitting a military facility in the Bryansk region with an ATACMS missile.",
      "Russian air defenses shot down five ATACMS missiles but fragments of another \u201cfell on the technical territory of a military facility in the Bryansk region, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished. There were no casualties or damage,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "\"According to confirmed data, the deployed ATACMS operational-tactical missiles were American-made,\" it said.",
      "Two U.S. officials later confirmed to NBC News that Ukraine had fired ATACMS near the city of Karachev in the Bryansk region, across the country's northern border, marking the first use of the U.S.-supplied weapons inside Russia.",
      "Although Ukraine has struck targets deep inside Russia already, it has used homemade drones and not Western missiles with the fire power of the ATACMs, they said.",
      "Ukraine's military said that it had hit a military arsenal near Karachev in Bryansk. It did not specify what weapons were used in the attack.",
      "The changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine mark the most significant saber-rattling yet by the Kremlin, which has consistently warned about possible nuclear war throughout the 1,000 days since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThe nuclear doctrine update was required to bring the document in line with the current political situation,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the TASS state news agency in comments published early Tuesday.",
      "Peskov outlined Moscow\u2019s new threat in light of Washington\u2019s shift in policy: that the use of Western nonnuclear missiles by Ukraine\u2019s military against Russia under the new doctrine could lead to a nuclear response.",
      "Still, the use of nuclear weapons would be a \u201clast resort measure,\u201d he added.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said Russia's change wasn't surprising.",
      "\"Since the beginning of its war of aggression against Ukraine, it has sought to coerce and intimidate both Ukraine and other countries around the world through irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behavior,\" said Matt Miller of the State Department. \"Despite what Russia says, neither the United States nor NATO pose any threat to Russia.\"",
      "Putin had signaled the update to his country\u2019s policy earlier this year as he sought to warn the West against loosening restrictions on Kyiv's use of long-range weapons to strike deep inside Russia.",
      "Russia also reserved the rise to use the weapons even if Belarus was attacked, he said then. And the new doctrine matches that shift.",
      "\"Aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear country with the support of a nuclear state will be considered a joint attack,\" it reads.",
      "The doctrine also says that \u201cThe Russian Federation may use nuclear weapons in the event of a critical threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of itself and Belarus,\u201d a shift from previous language that said it may use nuclear weapons \u201cwhen the very existence of the state is at risk.\u201d",
      "The changes follow Putin's warning to the U.S. and its NATO allies that any use of their long-range weapons supplied to Ukraine against Russian territory would mean NATO and Russia are at war.",
      "The Biden administration had long resisted Kyiv's calls to relax restrictions on the weapons it has supplied to its ally.",
      "But after the U.S. and others said that thousands of North Korean troops had joined the fight alongside the Kremlin's military, U.S. officials told NBC News that the Biden administration had authorized use of the long-range ATACMS missile systems for limited strikes inside Russia.",
      "The shift drew condemnation from the Kremlin, with Peskov saying Monday that Washington was pouring \"oil on the fire\" and was provoking \"further escalation of tension around this conflict.\"",
      "The changes \u201ccreate more leeway for a Russian nuclear response to Ukrainian \u2014 or, as the Kremlin frames it, Western \u2014 strikes on Russian territory\u201d said Tatiana Stanovaya, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the founder and head of the political analysis firm R.Politik.",
      "She pointed to the change in leadership in Washington as a possible motive behind the timing of the updated nuclear doctrine.",
      "\u201cPutin may see the current situation as a strategic \u2018in-between\u2019 moment \u2014 anticipating possible peace initiatives from (President-elect Donald) Trump while emphasizing what he views as the \u201cirresponsibility\u201d of Biden\u2019s policy. Putin may seek to present the West with two stark choices: \u2018Do you want a nuclear war? You will have it,\u2019 or \u2018Let\u2019s end this war on Russia\u2019s terms,\u2019 Stanovaya said in a post on X.",
      "\u201cThis marks an extraordinarily dangerous juncture,\u201d she added."

      "The United Nations said armed men stole food and other aid from 98 trucks over the weekend, the largest single incident of its kind since the start of the war. It did not say who was behind the theft.",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the convoy of 109 trucks was instructed by the Israeli military to take an \u201calternative, unfamiliar route\u201d after the aid was brought in through the Kerem Shalom crossing, and that the trucks were stolen near the crossing itself.",
      "Israel has long accused Hamas of stealing aid, allegations denied by the militant group.",

      "The Hamas-run government had a police force of tens of thousands that maintained a high degree of public security before the war, but they have vanished from the streets in many areas after being targeted by Israeli strikes. Hamas says it has taken measures to prevent both looting and price-gouging in local markets.",
      "Hamas ignited the war in Gaza when its fighters stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,800 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their toll. The war has left much of the territory in ruins and forced around 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million to flee, often multiple times."

      "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s\u00a0King Richard III\u00a0was immortalized with the Shakespeare line \u201cA horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.\u201d",
      "Now state-of-the-art technology has revealed what it may have sounded like if he did indeed utter those words just before his death in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth.",
      "Unlike the upper-class tones of his modern successors, the re-created king's voice has a more common and earthy twang as he recites a medieval manuscript in a display that opened Sunday at the Theatre Royal in the U.K\u2019s ancient city of York.",
      "The project, which is 10 years in the making, was the brainchild of British vocal coach Yvonne Morley-Chisholm, who approached a team based at Face Lab at the U.K.'s Liverpool John Moores University and has since enlisted the help of leading specialists across a number of fields to create the avatar.",
      "\u201cThat involved dentistry, physiotherapy, the craniofacial reconstruction, the original pronunciation, forensic psychology, all sorts,\u201d she told NBC News in a telephone interview Monday, adding that it took them \u201c10 long years\u201d to put \u201cthe pieces together in the puzzle, because we wanted this to be based on evidence.\u201d",
      "It is the latest episode in the history of the doomed monarch, who was king of England for just two years from 1483 until his death two years later at age 32.",
      "Just over 100 years later in 1592, Shakespeare vilified him as a hunchback, giving him the famous cry of despair about a horse as his last line. His body was later discovered beneath a parking lot in 2012.",
      "To help work out how Richard and his contemporaries might have sounded, Morley-Chisholm enlisted the help of professor David Crystal, a leading linguist and expert in 15th-century pronunciation.",
      "\u201cNothing like this has ever happened before,\u201d Crystal said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cThis is as close as we can get. It\u2019s 90% or so accuracy.\u201d",
      "Crystal added that he created \u201cthe sound system\u201d of the era by looking at the spelling of the words, the rhymes that were around in the poetry of the time and what Richard\u2019s contemporaries wrote about the spelling and pronunciation of English.",
      "The result, he said, \u201cis not like any modern accent at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has distinctive echoes of some modern accents, and the\u00a0predominant echo was definitely Yorkshire,\u201d he said, referring to the county in northern England known for its distinctive dialect.",
      "Richard made global headlines 12 years ago when his skeletal remains were found by British historian Philippa Langley in a parking lot in Leicester, a city around 100 miles north of the U.K.'s capital, London.",
      "CT scans of the skeleton have since helped scientists reconstruct his face and body, revealing that while he did have curvature of the spine, he was not the hunchback that Shakespeare portrayed.",
      "\u201cThe skeleton has ruled out all the myths,\u201d Morley-Chisholm said. \u201cHe did not have a limp, a withered arm, a hunchback. He was able to speak in public.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout the discovery of his mortal remains, this project would not have been possible,\u201d she added.",
      "The skeleton also helped Morley-Chisholm find the actor that would eventually play the king\u2019s avatar.",
      "After 10 years of searching, she said she chose British actor Thomas Dennis because his face was such a good physical match. She then coached Dennis into the king\u2019s accent and personality.",
      "Langley was also involved in the project from the start, advising on Richard's character and personality by studying letters, diaries and public descriptions of the king, and looking at how that might affect the way he speaks.",
      "\u201cWhat we could then get was a probability, almost verging on certainty, of the recognized character of Richard III during his lifetime,\u201d she said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cYou are seeing the most accurate portrayal of Richard III.\u201d",
      "Mathew Morris, a project officer at the University of Leicester's Archaeological Services, who was involved in the dig 12 years ago but not part of the avatar project, said the project was \u201ca brilliant step.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is only so much you can learn from a skeleton,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cIt is creating a resource that is allowing people to then explore less tangible facets of his life in new and innovative ways. You just don\u2019t know what it\u2019s then going to inspire.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Crystal said he was already imagining other famous faces and voices from the past being re-created.",

      "Critics say the law has instead driven a crackdown on expression in the former British colony, which was promised its civil liberties would be preserved for 50 years when it returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. In March, Hong Kong\u2019s opposition-free legislature also enacted local national security legislation.",
      "The U.S. and other Western governments have criticized the so-called Hong Kong 47 trial as politically motivated and called for the defendants\u2019 immediate release. Most of the defendants, who are in their 20s to their 60s, have been held without bail since their arrests in early 2021.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether they would be credited with time served.",
      "Maya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch, said Tuesday that the \u201charsh sentences\u201d reflected \u201cjust how fast Hong Kong\u2019s civil liberties and judicial independence have nosedived\u201d since the national security law was imposed four years ago.",
      "\u201cRunning in an election and trying to win it is now a crime that can lead to a decade in prison in Hong Kong,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "The Hong Kong government rejects the idea that judicial independence is under threat, saying that cases are handled in accordance with the law and that individual rights are protected under Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution and Bill of Rights.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that Beijing \u201cfirmly supports\u201d Hong Kong \u201cin safeguarding national security and lawfully punishing activities that endanger it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe resolutely oppose interference in China\u2019s internal affairs and the smearing or undermining of Hong Kong\u2019s legal system by certain Western nations under the guise of specific judicial cases,\u201d spokesperson Lin Jian said.",
      "Of the 47 defendants, 31 \u2014 including Tai \u2014 pleaded guilty in the hope of lesser sentencing. Fourteen others were convicted in May, while the remaining two were acquitted.",
      "Apart from Tai, three other pro-democracy politicians \u2014 Au Nok-hin, Andrew Chiu and Ben Chung \u2014 were also considered primary organizers and \u201cprincipal offenders.\u201d All three testified for the prosecution, and they received sentences of six years and one month to seven years.",
      "Others including Joshua Wong, who gained global prominence as a leader of pro-democracy protests in 2014, were considered \u201cactive participants\u201d and mostly received shorter sentences.",
      "A woman identified by Reuters as Elsa Wu, whose son Hendrick Lui, a 42-year-old former social worker, was sentenced to four years and three months, was taken to a security van by police after she tried to hold up a sign in support outside the court building.",
      "\u201cHe is a good person,\u201d she shouted repeatedly while in tears.\u00a0\u201cWhy does he have to go to jail? Why?\u201d",
      "John Burns, an emeritus professor at the University of Hong Kong who specializes in the city\u2019s politics and governance, said the trial was part of authorities\u2019 effort to eliminate opposition.",
      "Among the 47 are \u201csecond-tier pan-democrats\u201d who were previously active members of the Hong Kong legislature, Burns said. In the eyes of authorities, he said, the \u201csole first tier\u201d is billionaire media tycoon Jimmy Lai, the founder of now-defunct pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily, who is also charged under the national security law and is taking the stand for the first time Wednesday as defense arguments begin almost a year into his trial.",
      "Given that the pan-democratic opposition regularly drew support from 40% to 60% of voters before electoral reforms in 2021 restricted candidacy to \u201cpatriots only,\u201d the trial also aims to \u201cre-educate\u201d Hong Kong people about how they should act on their political beliefs rather than change the way they think about politics, Burns said.",
      "\u201cStill, we see that some people are not getting the message, apparently,\u201d he said, noting a series of recent arrests under the local national security law, known as Article 23.",
      "Despite growing influence from Beijing, more than 80% of adults in Hong Kong support a democratic system in which two or more political parties compete in elections, according to a 2023 survey by the Pew Research Center.",
      "Hundreds of people, some of them with portable chairs, lined up hours and even days in advance to secure a spot in the courtroom for the activists\u2019 sentencing. On Tuesday morning, more people gathered outside the West Kowloon Magistrates\u2019 Court amid light rain and wind.",
      "Margaret Chen, a 59-year-old retiree who said she had attended most of the trial since it began in February 2023, said she had been in line since midday Sunday with her sleeping bag and other camping gear.",
      "The trial is \u201ctoo absurd\u201d and \u201cunjust,\u201d Chen said, adding that democracy had died in Hong Kong and people are too afraid to speak out.",
      "\u201cIf the primary election is illegal, then aren\u2019t the hundreds of thousands of people who voted also breaking the law? Why haven\u2019t they prosecuted us yet?\u201d she said.",
      "Carson Tsang, 21, a law student, said the trial was a \u201chistorical moment\u201d for Hong Kong\u2019s common law system.",
      "\u201cThe final result of the trial is not the most important thing,\u201d Tsang said. \u201cAs long as we have a group of people who continue to care about Hong Kong and the democrats, it\u2019s more than enough.\u201d"
