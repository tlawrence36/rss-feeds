      "Universal Pictures says Sunday that \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d has topped the North American box office with an estimated $26.5 million in ticket sales",
      "The horror sequel \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d topped the North American box office charts this weekend with $26.5 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. Not only did it surpass the original's $23.6 million debut, it's a much-needed win for Blumhouse after a string of disappointments this year like \u201cM3GAN 2.0.\u201d",
      "Though \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d opened in line with expectations, moviegoing in October continues to be slow \u2014 down about 11% from last year, according to Comscore. The overall box office is still up about 4% compared with last year, but a big blockbuster hit that could spark more momentum might not arrive until late November or December.",
      "Universal Pictures released \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d in 3,411 theaters in North America on a wave of good reviews. Coming four years after the original, the sequel sees the return of filmmaker Scott Derrickson, as well as stars Ethan Hawke and Mason Thames. Opening weekend audiences were 63% between the ages of 18 and 34, according to exit polls, and the biggest demographic was Hispanics, making up 39% of ticket buyers while Caucasians accounted for 35%.",
      "With an additional $15.5 million from 71 international territories, \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d had a $42 million worldwide launch against a reported $30 million production budget.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic opening,\u201d said Jim Orr, who heads Universal\u2019s domestic distribution. \u201cOur great partners in Scott Derrickson and Blumhouse once again took this property and crafted an unbelievably haunting, chilling story that audiences just simply couldn\u2019t get enough of.\u201d",
      "The first \u201cBlack Phone\u201d was a bit of a sleeper hit for Universal and Blumhouse in 2021 as cinemas were beginning to come back to life after COVID shutdowns. By the end of its run, it had earned more than $161 million worldwide against an $18 million budget.",
      "Blumhouse has had a rocky 2025, with a handful of duds including \u201cWolf Man\u201d and \u201cThe Woman in the Yard.\u201d But the once impenetrable horror hitmaker could be on the upswing again with a \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d sequel coming in December. The first movie earned nearly $300 million worldwide.",
      "The horror genre in general has soared to record-breaking heights this year, with hits like \u201cWeapons\u201d and the multi-genre \u201cSinners,\" generating over $1.2 billion for the industry, noted Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s head of marketplace trends.",
      "\u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d was also the only film to really break through this weekend, despite a slew of options playing in wide release including the R-rated Seth Rogen, Aziz Ansari and Keanu Reeves comedy \u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in 2,990 locations to $6.2 million, and the expansion of the Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which made $1.6 million from 1,238 theaters. Also new in theaters is Guillermo del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d although Netflix does not report box office grosses.",
      "\u201cTron: Ares\u201d fell about 67% to $11.1 million in its second weekend in theaters, which was enough to snag second place on the charts. Globally it has now earned $103 million.",
      "\u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in third place, had mostly positive reviews on its side, but Ansari's comedy with a side of social commentary did not drum up a lot of enthusiasm in its first weekend. With a B+ CinemaScore, though, it likely has a better chance in the coming weeks than the campus drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which got a very poor C- score.",
      "\u201cThis is a quintessential October for movies, meaning this is not a hotbed of box office blockbusters,\u201d said Dergarabedian. \u201cBut the marketplace is flush with titles. This is awards season; this is where you have a lot of auteur driven films, edgier films. Collectively these don\u2019t generate a ton of box office, but there\u2019s the currency of goodwill created with movie fans.\u201d",
      "Next weekend audiences will get another batch of awards-hopefuls, including Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s latest Emma Stone collaboration \u201cBugonia\u201d and the Bruce Springsteen biopic \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,\u201d starring \u201cThe Bear\u2019s\u201d Jeremy Allen White.",

      "San Francisco (AP) \u2014 A Northern California aquarium has raised more than $2 million for sea otter conservation in just two days. All it took was Taylor Swift wearing a vintage T-shirt.",
      "Swift wore a vintage Monterey Bay Aquarium otter conservation T-shirt in a release party movie for her new \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d album, sending her ardent fans on a quest to buy the shirt last produced in the 1990s. After the aquarium was flooded with calls about buying the T-shirt showing two otters floating on their back, it decided to re-release the garment Thursday as part of a special campaign to raise $1.3 million, a nod to Swift\u2019s favorite number, said Liz MacDonald, the aquarium\u2019s director of content strategy.",
      "The aquarium met and surpassed its goal to raise the funds for its sea otter conservation program in less than eight hours, averaging about $100,000 in sales every 15 minutes, MacDonald said. Donors who give at least $65.13 to its newest fundraising campaign to help injured and orphan otters will be mailed a T-shirt, MacDonald said.",
      "\u201cWe definitely had a little Taylor Swift dance party in the office yesterday afternoon when we hit the goal,\u201d she said.",
      "The aquarium began accepting back-orders and by Friday afternoon it had raised more than $2 million, according to its website.",
      "How Swift acquired the T-Shirt that was last produced more than 32 years ago \u2014 when she was just 3 years old \u2014 remains a mystery.",
      "She and fianc\u00e9 Travis Kelce have been documented visiting nearby Carmel, but MacDonald said the aquarium is not aware of the couple having been in their shop.",
      "MacDonald said the staff has had fun speculating about Swift's interest in the T-shirt.",
      "When Taylor announced the release of her new album on Kelce\u2019s podcast \"New Heights\" a couple of weeks ago, the couple had a little banter about how he loves otters and loves sending her videos of the furry sea creatures.",
      "\u201cOne of my favorite theories is that we have a sea otter on our exhibit whose name is Opal and she was named by the fans through an online poll, and I wonder if Taylor Swift may have been one of the people that voted for the name Opal,\u201d MacDonald said, adding that opal is Kelce\u2019s birthstone and that Opalite is the name of one of Swift\u2019s songs.",

      "Can one documentary encapsulate the life of Martin Scorsese",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The first time the filmmaker Rebecca Miller met Martin Scorsese was on the set of 2002's \u201cGangs of New York.\u201d Miller\u2019s husband, Daniel Day-Lewis, was starring in it. There, Miller found an anxious Scorsese on the precipice of the film\u2019s enormous fight scene, shot on a sprawling set.",
      "\u201cHe seemed like a young man, hoping that he had chosen the right way to shoot a massive scene,\u201d Miller recalls. \u201cI was stunned by how youthful and alive he was.\u201d",
      "That remains much the same throughout Miller\u2019s expansive and stirring documentary portrait of the endlessly energetic and singularly essential filmmaker. In \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d which premieres Friday on Apple TV, Miller captures the life and career of Scorsese, whose films have made one of the greatest sustained arguments for the power of cinema.",
      "\u201cWe talk about 32 films, which is a lot of films. But there are yet more films,\u201d Miller says, referencing Scorsese\u2019s projects to come. \u201cIt\u2019s a life that overspills its own bounds. You think you\u2019ve got it, and then it\u2019s more and more and more.\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s life has long had a mythic arc: The asthmatic kid from Little Italy who grew up watching old movies on television and went on to make some of the defining New York films. That\u2019s a part of \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d too, but Miller\u2019s film, culled from 20 hours of interviews with Scorsese over five years, is a more intimate, reflective and often funny conversation about the compulsions that drove him and the abiding questions \u2014 of morality, faith and filmmaking \u2014 that have guided him.",
      "\u201cWho are we? What are we, I should say?\u201d Scorsese says in the opening moments of the series. \u201cAre we intrinsically good or evil?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the struggle,\u201d he adds. \u201cI struggle with it all the time.\u201d",
      "Miller began interviewing Scorsese during the pandemic. He was then beginning to make \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon.\u201d Their first meetings were outside. Miller first pitched the idea to Scorsese as a multifaceted portrait. Then, she imagined a two-hour documentary. Later, by necessity, it turned into a five-hour series. It still feels too short.",
      "\u201cI explained I wanted to take a cubist approach, with different shafts of light on him from all different perspectives \u2014 collaborators, family,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWithin a very short amount of time, he sort of began talking as if we were doing it. I was a bit confused, thinking, \u2018Is this a job interview or a planning situation?\u2019\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s own documentaries have often been some of the most insightful windows into him. In one of his earliest films, \u201cItalianamerican\u201d (1974), he interviewed his parents. His surveys of cinema, including 1995\u2019s \u201cA Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies\u201d and 1999\u2019s \u201cMy Voyage to Italy,\u201d have been especially revealing of the inspirations that formed him. Scorsese has never penned a memoir, but these movies come close.",
      "While the bulk of \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d are the director\u2019s own film-to-film recollections, a wealth of other personalities color in the portrait. That includes collaborators like editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Paul Schrader, Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio and Day-Lewis. It also includes Scorsese\u2019s children, his ex-wives and his old Little Italy pals. One, Salvatore \u201cSally Gaga\u201d Uricola for the first time is revealed as the model for De Niro\u2019s troublemaking, mailbox-blowing-up Johnny Boy in \u201cMean Streets.\u201d",

      "It can be easy to think of Scorsese, perhaps the most revered living filmmaker, as an inevitability, that of course he gets to make the films he wants. But \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d is a reminder how often that wasn\u2019t the case and how frequently Scorsese found himself on the outside of Hollywood, whether due to box-office disappointment, a clash of style or the perceived danger in controversial subjects (\u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d) he was drawn to.",
      "\u201cHe was fighting for every single film,\u201d Miller says. \u201cCutting this whole thing was like riding a bucking bronco. You\u2019re up and you\u2019re down, you\u2019re dead, then alive.\u201d",
      "Film executives today, an especially risk-averse lot, could learn some lessons from \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d in what a difference they can make for a personal filmmaker. As discussed in the film, in the late \u201970s, producer Irwin Winkler refused to do \u201cRocky II\u201d with United Artists unless they also made \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d",
      "For Miller, whose films include \u201cThe Ballad of Jack and Rose\u201d and \u201cMaggie\u2019s Plan,\u201d being around Scorsese was an education. She found his films began to infect \u201cMr. Scorsese.\u201d The cutting of the documentary took on the style of his film\u2019s editing. \u201cIn proximity to these film,\u201d she says, \u201cyou start to breathe the air.\u201d",
      "Nearness to Scorsese also inevitably means movie recommendations. Lots of them. One that stood out for Miller was \u201cThe Insect Woman,\u201d Japanese filmmaker Sh\u014dhei Imamura\u2019s 1963 drama about three generations of women.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s still doing it,\u201d Miller says. \u201cHe\u2019s still sending me movies.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d recently debuted at the New York Film Festival, where Miller's son, Ronan Day-Lewis made his directorial debut with \u201cAnemone,\u201d a film that marked her husband's return from retirement.

      "\u201cYou hear all those people laughing with him or suddenly bursting into applause when they see Thelma Schoonmaker or at the end of the \u2018Last Waltz\u2019 sequence,\u201d Miller says. \u201cThere was a sense of such palpable enthusiasm and love. My husband said something I thought was very beautiful: It reminded everyone of how much they love him.\u201d",

      "Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke have collaborated for over 30 years, but their latest film, \"Blue Moon,\" pushed their partnership to new limits",
      "Richard Linklater likes to joke that if he and Ethan Hawke didn\u2019t know each other so well, Hawke probably would have punched him during the making of \u201cBlue Moon.\u201d",
      "The two Texans have been friends and collaborators for over 30 years. They had made eight films together when they started \u201cBlue Moon,\u201d about the lyricist Lorenz Hart set over one night at Sardi\u2019s restaurant. It\u2019s a project they\u2019d been talking about for over a decade.",
      "One might assume that it would be all old hat between them. And yet this was a film, in select theaters Friday, that would require a vastly different dynamic.",
      "\u201cI was nagging. I was riding his (expletive). It\u2019s not the way I work usually,\u201d Linklater said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThe film\u2019s small in scale. It seems minimalistic. But what was incumbent on Ethan was pretty massive.\u201d",
      "That punching thing, Hawke said in a separate interview, was completely true. He came to realize that Linklater was channeling his inner Sidney Lumet \u2014 a great actors\u2019 director, but a tough one.",
      "\u201cIt was shocking to me. He didn\u2019t want us to take the work for granted, or that we were friends,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cHe\u2019s been listening to me talk about acting for 30 years and he wanted to give me a chance to really do it. To stop talking about it and do it.\u201d",
      "Hawke has never shied away from a challenge. When they were making \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d in Vienna in 1994, Linklater remembered Hawke looking at the script and saying \u201cthis probably won\u2019t work\u201d but diving into it anyway. That\u2019s when he was sure he had found a kindred spirit, someone who ran towards the impossible.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be in that territory if you want to do anything that\u2019s different, something someone hasn\u2019t seen before,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to feel like you\u2019re out on some limb going, \u2018We\u2019re risking a huge whopping failure.\u2019\u201d",
      "But Lorenz Hart was not Jesse the writer in the \u201cBefore\u201d movies. Here was a man who was both small in stature (the most generous reports say he was 5-foot-2-inches), balding, extremely self-conscious about his appearance and the biggest personality and wit in the room. He was a genius and an alcoholic who had made himself unemployable. And amid all of this, the times were changing, and he was being left behind.",
      "Every couple of years over the last decade, they would get together and do a reading of the script. Hawke loved the character and felt deeply that he was the right person to do it, but when it came time to take it out of the theoretical, he said, \u201cit got very scary.\u201d During the first couple of days of rehearsal, Hawke got terribly sick.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like my body knew this was about to be something really stressful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe event of the movie is Lorenz Hart and everybody\u2019s actually supporting this portrait.\u201d",
      "That included himself and his ego. \u201cBlue Moon\u201d would require a deconstruction, and disappearance of the movie star that is Ethan Hawke.",
      "The script from author Robert Kaplow takes audiences inside the famed Broadway theater district restaurant Sardi\u2019s on the opening night of \u201cOklahoma!\u201d in 1943. Hart is holding court with a bartender (Bobby Cannavale) waiting for his old collaborator Richard Rodgers (Andrew Scott) to come to the party.",
      "For over 20 years Rodgers and Hart were a prolific and successful songwriting team, behind musical hits and hundreds of classic songs, including \u201cMy Funny Valentine,\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t It Romantic?\u201d \u201cThe Lady is a Tramp\u201d and \u201cBlue Moon.\u201d It\u2019s one of the great artistic partnerships of all time. This film is about that breakup.",

Hart, meanwhile, would die eight months after the \u201cOklahoma!\u201d opening, at age 48.",
      "\u201cThe country is changing, and the jazz era is ending and a new era is beginning and one of these people is going to continue on to lead and the other is going to be completely left behind,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cAnd the fact that he\u2019s so funny in the face of tragedy? That\u2019s where the screenplay really shines: The duality of this man. He\u2019s both absurdly jealous and simultaneously very supportive and loving. He\u2019s wickedly funny and suicidal. He\u2019s a homosexual in love with a woman. The correlation of opposites, that is Larry Hart.\u201d",
      "The production used old school Hollywood tricks to make the 5-foot-10-inch Hawke look tiny on a micro budget. He shaved his head to get that balding look. And they built a Sardi\u2019s set in Ireland.",
      "\u201cI always describe it as this little howl into the night of an artist being left behind. It\u2019s to live through your own extinction,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cI hope people respond to it the way you would a beautiful Rodgers and Hart song. It\u2019s lyrical, it\u2019s beautiful in a way, but it leaves you kind of devastated.\u201d",
      "Making a life in the arts requires immense sacrifice no matter how you look at it. And there\u2019s always the possibility that the culture will pass you by. Hawke, for one, said he\u2019s had three distinct moments in his career where he was pretty sure he was washed up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way you could do this for over 30 years and not feel it,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cThey come on like waves and you have to try to survive.\u201d",
      "The experience made him think of a lot of the people he came up with, who mentored him when he was starting out in the theater in the 1980s. Many of them, like Hart, were closeted, and they viewed their vocation not as a job but as a kind of spiritual calling. One stage actor he was thinking a lot about was the late Richard Easton, who he did a few plays with before he passed.",
      "\u201cWhen I was young, he said to me, \u2018One lifetime is not enough. It\u2019s not enough time to learn what you need to learn to be the kind of actor that you dream of being,\u2019\u201d Hawke said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great attitude. It creates a perpetual sense of learning and an ongoing process, and this part really did require everything that I\u2019d learned up until now.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlue Moon\u201d is actually one of two Linklater movies about artists that will be in theaters this month. \u201cNovelle Vague\u201d (out Oct. 31), about the making of Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s \u201cBreathless,\u201d is about the beginnings of a career. \u201cBlue Moon\u201d is about the end of one.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a poignancy to art careers,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cI think we all think we\u2019re just going to run the table and do this until the day we die. But things get in the way.\u201d",
      "One thing we don\u2019t have to worry about (yet) is a creative breakup between Linklater and Hawke. Linklater might have given his friend some tough love, but they never argued, and in the end it was worth it. Hawke lived up to the challenge and no one got punched.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cBeing bald is sexy. It\u2019s an attitude. It\u2019s a luxury. It\u2019s a lifestyle.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s how Brennan Nevada Johnson, who shaved her head voluntarily 14 years ago, opens the video podcast she launched last November to celebrate the advantages of choosing a bald look.",
      "Sensuous, self-assured and glamorous are not the adjectives typically assigned to women with shorn hair. For centuries, many cultures have viewed long hair as a symbol of femininity, health and fertility. But more women are defying that traditional beauty standard and finding empowerment by baring their heads.",
      "\u201cOnce you do it, it brings all this confidence into your life,\u201d Johnson, 34, said. \u201cWhenever you see someone who\u2019s bald and not wearing a wig, just know that they have fully embraced themselves, and I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s really challenging to do.\"",
      "Her initial decision to go baldheaded was practical. Johnson played competitive volleyball in college and found the sweating she did on the court affected the expensive hair relaxing treatments she often had done. Once she started shaving off her hair, though, she was hooked. She was relieved to save money on salon trips.",
      "Johnson now owns a New York public relations firm. \u201cBald and Buzzed with Brennan,\u201d the video podcast she posts on YouTube, was an attempt to fill a void in social media content that affirmed bald people, especially women. She says she always thought baldness was sexy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a fashion statement, and it\u2019s a really powerful look,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Other women without hair, whether voluntarily or due to medical conditions, also have sought ways to support each other, attending conferences, joining \u201cbaldie\u201d groups and swapping grooming and scalp care tips.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole community of us out there,\u201d said Dash Lopez, a content creator who posts a weekly video series of her shaving routine called \u201cFresh Cut Friday.\u201d \u201cWe need to talk about it because we do find comfort and empowerment and beauty in what some people think is weird.\u201d",
      "Lopez said members of her family praised the long curly hair she had growing up. Some of her friends played with different hair colors and styles, but Lopez said she didn't have the same freedom. And she didn't enjoy detangling her hair or spending long afternoons at the salon.",
      "As soon as she turned 18 and could get a haircut without permission, she chopped her locks into a pixie cut. Then she shaved it all off during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt makes me feel powerful in the sense that I\u2019m able to detach from the things that people place so much emphasis on,\u201d Lopez, 29, said. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here planning, \u2018Oh my gosh, when am I going to get my next color appointment done? That\u2019s gonna cost me $300. Oh my gosh. I\u2019ve got to get my hair done before I go to this event.\u2019\u201d",
      "Lopez signed a contract with a modeling agency in 2020, a time when brands wanted to showcase diversity, she said. Back then, being bald worked for her professionally.",
      "\u201cThere was an appreciation for quirks and if you had a gap in your tooth, if you had a bald head, if you had a face full of freckles, that\u2019s what casting directors were looking for,\u201d Lopez said.",
      "She noticed the tide shifting last year, when her bookings for modeling jobs decreased. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, the odds were stacked against me in the modeling world,\" Lopez said. \"I was 5\u2032 4\u2033, 5\u2032 5\u2033 on paper, no hair.\u201d",
      "A client suggested she wear wigs to land more work. Lopez did not want to do that or grow out her hair. Her modeling contract ended. Since then, she has shared glimpses of her life as a bald woman on Instagram and TikTok, where some of her videos have been watched millions of times.",

      "Then she came across a group called The Baldie Movement on Facebook. \u201cThe ladies just really inspired me,\u201d Flores, 47, said. \u201cThey really did help to encourage me and give me strength, ... and they were just so confident.\u201d",
      "She eventually decided to stop wearing wigs and embrace being bald in 2015, after a romantic breakup. \u201cI was tired of lying. I felt like I was hiding something. I felt like I wasn\u2019t myself,\u201d she said.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday that California will begin selling affordable insulin under its own label on Jan. 1, nearly three years after he first announced a partnership to sell state-branded generic drugs at lower prices.",
      "But California won\u2019t be the only state making lower-cost insulin available. The nonprofit Civica said it will also distribute its economical diabetes medication to pharmacies nationwide.",

      "The state entered a 10-year deal with Civica and Biocon Biologics in early 2023.

      "Demonstrators have clashed with police during a protest against worsening air pollutionfrom a phosphate-processing plant in the southern Tunisian city of Gabes",
      "GABES, Tunisia -- GABES, Tunisia (AP) \u2014 Police rained tear gas on crowds and several demonstrators and riot police were injured in the southern Tunisian city of Gabes as thousands of people marched Wednesday to protest worsening air pollution from a phosphate-processing plant.",
      "The protest descended into clashes with police who attempted to disperse protesters trying to reach the plant in an industrial complex, which is a designated military zone. Gabes, home to more than 400,000 residents, lies at the heart of Tunisia\u2019s phosphate industry, one of the key sources of export revenue for the North African country.",
      "Wednesday's protests were the latest since a gas leak near the state-owned Chemical Group of Tunisia industrial complex. The leak sent dozens of residents, including children, to hospitals in recent weeks, according to environmental activist group \u201cStop Pollution.\u201d",
      "The leak reignited long-standing anger in the coastal city, where residents blame more than five decades of industrial activity for rising cancer rates, respiratory illnesses and the collapse of the region\u2019s once-thriving and unique ecosystem.",
      "By nightfall Wednesday, plumes of tear gas, burning tires and trash bins filled the streets as protesters blocked major roads and chanted against what they called \u201cenvironmental crimes.\u201d Many demanded the dissolution of the GCT and closure of its phosphate units, which they accused of slowly poisoning Gabes.",
      "The city\u2019s chemical complex processes raw phosphate into fertilizer, an operation that for decades has discharged toxic waste directly into the Gulf of Gabes. Environmental groups say the pollution has wiped out marine life, turned the waters dark and forced generations of fishermen out of work.",
      "Successive Tunisian governments have promised to relocate or modernize the plant, but environmental activists say those pledges have repeatedly gone unfulfilled.",
      "Tunisia\u2019s National Observatory for Agriculture has repeatedly warned air quality in parts of Gabes exceeds limits set by the World Health Organization. Environmental experts repeatedly noted the persistent high levels of sulfur dioxide and ammonia in the atmosphere, pollutants known to cause respiratory damage and contribute to acid rain.",

      "On the sidelines of Wednesday\u2019s protest, she told The Associated Press that tensions escalated in recent weeks after the new gas leak sent a wave of panic through the community.",
      "\u201cThey refused to tell us what was causing people to get sick, even children were hospitalized, and some developed paralysis,\u201d she said. \u201cThey disregarded our worries and called us liars, and that drove people angry \u2026 We want this complex dismantled, and we will not stop until it happens.\u201d",
      "The GCT acknowledged \u201cmajor non-conformities\u201d in its operations in a July 2025 environmental audit, citing excessive ammonia and other emissions that fall short of global environmental standards. Despite the admission by the company, the government and even Tunisian President Kais Saied, residents say no visible action has followed.",
      "Saied said in a statement earlier this week that he ordered the formation of an urgent joint commission to meet protesters\u2019 demands.",
      "\u201cSerious failures were found in maintenance and testing that led to gas leaks. There will be no tolerance for those who neglected their duties,\" Saied said. \u201cThe people of Gabes will receive their full rights.\u201d",

      "In the wake of massive U.S. cuts to foreign aid, the tiny country of Lesotho in southern Africa faces deep uncertainty and worry over its HIV-positive residents",
      "HA LEJONE, Lesotho -- HA LEJONE, Lesotho (AP) \u2014 In the snow-topped mountains of Lesotho, mothers carrying babies on their backs walk for hours to the nearest health clinic, only to find HIV testing isn\u2019t available. Centers catering to the most vulnerable are shutting their doors. Health workers have been laid off in droves. Desperate patients ration or share pills.",
      "This Lesotho was unimaginable months ago, residents, health workers and experts say. The small landlocked nation in southern Africa long had the world\u2019s second-highest rate of HIV infections. But over years, with nearly $1 billion in aid from the United States, Lesotho patched together a health network efficient enough to slow the spread of the epidemic, one of the deadliest in modern history.",
      "Then, on Jan. 20, the first day of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, he signed an executive order freezing foreign aid. Within weeks, Trump had slashed overseas assistance and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development. Confusion followed in nearly all the 130 countries with USAID-supported programs. Nine months later in Lesotho, there\u2019s still little clarity.",
      "With the single stroke of a distant president\u2019s pen, much of a system credited with saving hundreds of thousands of lives was dismantled.",
      "Weeks ago, the U.S. announced it would reinstate some of its flagship initiatives to combat HIV worldwide. Officials here applauded the move. But the measures are temporary solutions that stress countries must move toward autonomy in public health.",
      "The State Department told The Associated Press in an email that its six-month bridge programs would ensure continuity of lifesaving programs \u2014 including testing and medication, and initiatives addressing mother-to-child transmission \u2014 while officials work with Lesotho on a multiyear agreement on funding.",
      "Those negotiations will likely take months, and while programs may have been reinstated on paper, restarting them on the ground takes considerable time, Lesotho health workers and experts told AP.",
      "HIV-positive residents, families and caregivers say the chaos that reigned most of this year has caused irreparable harm, and they\u2019re consumed with worry and uncertainty about the future. Most feel deep disappointment \u2014 even betrayal \u2014 over the loss of funds and support.",
      "\u201cEveryone who is HIV-positive in Lesotho is a dead man walking,\u201d said Hlaoli Monyamane, a 32-year-old miner who couldn\u2019t get a sufficient medication supply to support him while working in neighboring South Africa.",
      "HIV prevention programs \u2013 targeting mother-to-child transmission, encouraging male circumcision, and working with high-risk groups including sex workers and miners \u2014 were cut off. Unpaid nurses and other workers decided to use informal networks to reach isolated communities. Labs shuttered, and public clinics grew overwhelmed. Patients began abandoning treatment or rationing pills.",
      "Experts with UNAIDS \u2014 the U.N. agency tasked with fighting the virus globally \u2014 warned in July that up to 4 million people worldwide would die if funding weren\u2019t reinstated. And Lesotho health officials said the cuts would lead to increased HIV transmission, more deaths and higher health costs.",
      "Calculating how many lives are lost or affected is a massive task, and those responsible for tracking and adding data to a centralized system were largely let go.",
      "Lesotho Health Secretary Maneo Moliehi Ntene and HIV/AIDS program manager Dr. Tapiwa Tarumbiswa declined repeated requests to be interviewed or comment about the aid cuts. But Mokhothu Makhalanyane, chairperson of Lesotho\u2019s legislative health committee, said the impact is huge, estimating the country was set back at least 15 years in its HIV work.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose a lot of lives because of this,\u201d he said.",
      "Lesotho reached a milestone late last year \u2014 UNAIDS\u2019s 95-95-95 goal, with 95% of people living with HIV aware of their status, 95% of those in treatment, and 95% of those with a suppressed viral load. Still, the nation must care for the estimated 260,000 of its 2.3 million residents who are HIV-positive.",
      "Overall, Lesotho and even global HIV efforts accounted for small parts of the United States\u2019 massive international aid efforts. USAID spent tens of billions of dollars annually. Its dismantling has rocked the lives of millions of people in low- and middle-income nations around the world.",
      "For many in this mountainous country and elsewhere, a positive HIV test 20 years ago was akin to a death sentence. If untreated, most people with HIV develop AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. At the height of the epidemic in 2004, more than 2 million people died of AIDS-related illness worldwide \u2014 19,000 in Lesotho, UNAIDS estimated.",
      "In 2003, the U.S. launched the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. PEPFAR became the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease, and its main implementing partner was USAID. PEPFAR became so important and well known in Lesotho and other countries that health professionals and residents use the term as shorthand to refer to any HIV aid.",
      "When foreign assistance was frozen, Lesotho lost at least 23% of PEPFAR money, putting it in the top 10 countries for share of such funding cut, according to the Foundation for AIDS Research.",
      "Mapapali Mosoeunyane is among Lesotho residents who credit PEPFAR with helping save them. After learning she had the virus in 2009, she was certain dying was just a matter of time. Neighbors gossiped, she was fired, and she considered giving up her two young sons for adoption.",
      "But around 2013, she got access to antiretroviral medication \u2014 which suppresses HIV levels in the blood, with the potential to bring it to undetectable levels. In 2016, Lesotho was the first African country to \u201ctest and treat all\u201d \u2014 everyone who tested positive was prescribed ARVs. That work, officials say, was possible because of PEPFAR.",
      "Today, 62-year-old Mosoeunyane leads a peer support group in her village, Ha Koloboi. Neighbors ask for advice and trust her with their green medical booklets, where they record medical history, viral load, symptoms and medications.",
      "Lately, the group mostly worries \u2014 about the future, losing medication access, getting sick again.",
      "\u201cThis has been the most difficult time for me,\u201d Mosoeunyane said.",
      "Many in Mosoeunyane\u2019s group wish Trump himself could hear their concerns. \u201cTrump\u2019s decision is already translating into real life,\u201d said Mateboho Talitha Fusi, Mosoeunyane\u2019s friend and neighbor.",
      "The worries span Lesotho society: from rural to urban, low to middle income, patients to officials. Many Basotho \u2013 as people in Lesotho are known \u2013 feel hopeless.",
      "When Trump dissolved USAID, Lesotho leaders said they tried to talk to U.S. officials, even through their South African neighbors after failing to connect directly. But, they said, they got more information from news reports.",
      "For Lisebo Lechela, a 53-year-old sex worker turned HIV activist and health worker, the news was fast and blunt. Days after Trump\u2019s order, she was about to distribute medication, but a call from her boss interrupted her.",
      "\u201cStop work immediately,\u201d she was told.",
      "Lechela\u2019s organization, the USAID-funded Phelisanang Bophelong HIV/AIDS network, had drop-in centers at gas stations where sex workers could seek services. Workers set up tents outside bars with condoms and the prevention medication known as PreP. Teams delivered medication directly to patients who wouldn\u2019t step foot in public health clinics, for fear of discrimination.",
      "Lechela\u2019s group earned the trust of the skeptics and the stubborn. All that work is gone, she fears. She still gets calls from people desperate for services and refills. She does what she can, and their stories haunt her.",
      "Among them is a textile factory worker who turned to sex work at night to support her three children. She used to take PrEP and isn\u2019t sure how she\u2019ll protect herself. Most clients won\u2019t use condoms, she said, some turning violent if sex workers insist.",
      "\u201cI have to put bread on the table,\u201d said the woman, speaking on condition of anonymity because her husband, who works in South Africa, wouldn\u2019t approve of her sex work. She can\u2019t miss a day of factory work to wait in line at a clinic.",
      "Visiting the woman at home, all Lechela could do was demonstrate how to use a female condom \u2013 and hope her clients wouldn\u2019t notice or protest.",
      "With nearly all community groups and local organizations like Lechela\u2019s closed and 1,500 health workers fired, some Lesotho officials see overdue signs that their nation and others must stop relying on international aid.",

She also applauded U.S. efforts to buy doses of a twice-a-year HIV prevention shot and prioritize them for pregnant and breastfeeding women in low- to middle-income countries, including Lesotho, via PEPFAR.",

      "In its email to AP, the State Department said Secretary Marco Rubio had approved lifesaving PEPFAR programs and urged implementers to resume their work. The email emphasized that officials will work with Lesotho to continue providing health foreign assistance, but didn't give specifics about the amount of funding.",

      "Health committee chair Makhalanyane said this month that it remains unclear how much U.S. aid is being reinstated, even if temporarily. There had been only verbal promises, nothing in writing, he noted, and hundreds of health workers who had been promised they\u2019d be absorbed by the national health system remain unemployed.",
      "Unlike other PEPFAR-supported countries, Lesotho funded medication for 80% of its HIV patients \u2014 a figure officials tout as they try to move toward a self-sustaining system. Still, the aid cuts sparked panic over supply and distribution.",

      "Nurses were told to cut back. Patients grew alarmed.",
      "Miner Monyamane said he got a three-month supply, not his usual 12. So instead of continuing to work in South Africa, he decided to remain in his small village of Thaba-Tsoeu Ha Mafa.

      "HAYWARDS HEATH, England -- HAYWARDS HEATH, England (AP) \u2014 Deep underground beneath the Sussex countryside in southern England, millions of seeds are kept frozen in a vault built to withstand fire, flooding, and any other disaster.",
      "The Millennium Seed Bank at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew holds more than 2.5 billion wild plant seeds from around 40,000 species. The seeds are stored in sealed glass jars and foil packets, and are preserved in temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius ( minus 4 Fahrenheit) to guard against extinction.",

In the episode, they discuss the origins of the seed bank and its future potential to restore ecosystems across the world.",

      "\u201cDrying is the first step in increasing the longevity of those seeds,\u201d said Elinor Breman, senior research leader in seed conservation at Kew.",
      "In the drying room, air is kept at 15 degrees Celsius (59 Fahrenheit) and 15% humidity for about three months, allowing the seeds to lose moisture slowly and evenly. Removing water extends their lifespan by slowing the natural processes that cause decay.",
      "Once dried, the seeds move to the cleaning room. There, technicians use sieves, brushes and a device called an aspirator that separates seeds from dust and debris with air pressure. The work is mostly manual and time consuming, said David Hickmott, Seed Curator at Kew, who oversees the process.",
      "In the germination laboratory, petri dishes and incubators recreate the light and temperature of each seed\u2019s native environment. The tests confirm whether the seeds are still alive before storage.",
      "\u201cThe germination test is our last and most important process,\u201d said Rachael Davies, a germination specialist at Kew. \u201cIt gives us an indication that the seeds are alive.\u201d",

      "Dale Sanders, biologist and former director of the John Innes Centre in Norwich, said seed banks play a crucial role in protecting biodiversity. The need for genetic resources like those stored at Kew will grow as the world is expected to have 2 billion more people by 2050 and new agricultural land runs out.",
      "\u201cWithin species there is incredible genetic diversity, which protects against disease, climate change and other threats,\u201d he said. \u201cMaintaining that diversity is essential if we want to preserve the diversity of life itself.\u201d",
      "Since it opened, the Millennium Seed Bank has grown into a global partnership with 279 organisations in more than 100 countries. Its collections have supported projects to reintroduce native species and restore damaged habitats in the United Kingdom and abroad.",
      "\u201cWe have managed to conserve 40,000 species here,\u201d Breman said. \u201cBut the seed bank is not meant to be the end resting place for those seeds. The next 25 years will focus on using them to restore natural habitats and help combat biodiversity loss and climate change.\u201d",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- MANILA, Philippines (AP) \u2014 The Philippines has unveiled a new jail that may soon accommodate numerous powerful legislators, public works officials and others implicated in a massive corruption scandal involving flood control projects, a top official said Monday.",
      "The jail, which could hold up to 800 detainees in metropolitan Manila, was shown to the media by Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla in the latest bid by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\u2019s administration to quell public outrage over the scandal.",
      "The anomalies have linked dozens of Congress members, government engineers and construction company owners and sparked street protests in one of Asia\u2019s most flood-prone countries. Remulla estimated that about 200 officials and other suspects could be indicted by the Sandiganbayan, a special anti-graft court for government officials.",
      "That led to the decision to build a new jail to detain suspects who could be facing months or years of trial, he said.",

      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) \u2014 Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator, will be Bolivia\u2019s next president, preliminary results showed on Monday, paving the way for a major political transformation after almost 20 years of rule by the Movement Toward Socialism party and during the nation\u2019s worst economic crisis in decades.",
      "\u201cThe trend is irreversible,\u201d \u00d3scar Hassenteufel, the president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, said of Paz's lead over his rival, former right-wing President Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga. Paz won 54.5% of the votes, early results showed, versus Quiroga's 45.5%.",

Nor did Yemen's anti-Houthi forces, divided by warring interests and unable to launch a coordinated assault against the rebels even after intense American and Israeli bombing campaigns that targeted them.",
      "In recent months, the anti-Houthi forces have been able to interdict more cargo bound for the Houthis, something that having a presence on Zuqar could aid.",
      "\u201cThe possibility of a new Yemeni offensive against the Houthis, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, can\u2019t be ruled out, although I don\u2019t see it as approaching,\u201d said Eleonora Ardemagni, an analyst at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies who long has studied Yemen.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a more important point in my view regarding the build up in Zuqar: the countering of Houthis\u2019 smuggling activities, with particular regard to weapons,\u201d she said.",
      "Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show the construction of a nearly 2,000-meter (6,560-foot) runway on Zuqar Island, which is some 90 kilometers (55 miles) southeast of the Houthi-held port city of Hodeida, a key shipping hub.",
      "The images show work began in April to build out a dock on the island, then land clearing along the site of the runway. By late August, what appears to be asphalt was being laid across the runway. Images from October show the work continuing, with runway markings painted on in the middle of the month.",
      "No one has claimed the construction. However, ship-tracking data analyzed by the AP show the Batsa, a Togolese-flagged bulk carrier registered to a Dubai-based maritime firm, spent nearly a week alongside the new dock at Zuqar Island after coming from Berbera in Somaliland, the site of a DP World port. DP World declined to comment.",
      "A Dubai-based maritime company, Saif Shipping and Marine Services, acknowledged receiving an order to deliver the asphalt to the island likely used in the airstrip's construction on behalf of other UAE-based firms. Other Emirates-based maritime firms have been associated with other airstrip construction projects in Yemen later tied back to the UAE.",
      "The UAE is believed to be behind multiple runway projects in recent years in Yemen. In Mocha on the Red Sea, a project to extend that city\u2019s airport now allows it to land far larger aircraft. Local officials attributed that project to the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms, including Abu Dhabi and Dubai. There is also now a runway in nearby Dhubab.",

      "Saudi Arabia and the UAE entered the war in 2015 on behalf of the country's exiled government, stopping the Houthi advance. They also beat back the Houthis from Zuqar, retaking the island, which has become a staging ground for naval forces loyal to Tariq Saleh, a nephew of Yemen\u2019s late strongman leader Ali Abdullah Saleh.",
      "The younger Saleh, once allied to the Houthis before his uncle switched sides and the rebels killed him, has been backed by the UAE.",
      "Since then, the front lines of the war have been static for years.",
      "What changed was the Houthis' taking their campaign globally with attacks on ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. That continued even after a weekslong campaign of intense airstrikes known as Operation Rough Rider launched by the United States and continued strikes by Israel, which appear to be getting closer to the Houthis' top leadership despite the rebels' penchant for secrecy.",
      "\u201cThe Houthis, like any insurgent group, win by not losing,\u201d wrote Gregory D. Johnsen, a Yemen expert, in June. \u201cIt is how the group has survived and grown from each of its wars.\u201d",
      "While a loose confederation of anti-Houthi groups exists, it remains fragmented and did not launch any attacks during the U.S. airstrikes. But the growing network of air bases around Yemen comes as anti-Houthi forces have made several significant seizures of weapons, likely bound for the rebels \u2014 including one large haul that was praised by the U.S. military's Central Command.",
      "\u201cA likely Emirati airstrip in Zuqar could serve to improve surveillance and monitoring off the Hodeida coast to better support Yemeni forces in tackling smuggling,\u201d Ardemagni said.",

      "Vietnam is racing to electrify its motorbike market, one of the largest in Southeast Asia with 77 million bikes on the road",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- HANOI, Vietnam (AP) \u2014 Vietnam is split between two visions: the rumbling, reliable gas-powered motorbikes that now rule the roads, and sleek, silent electric bikes the government says are its future.",
      "Hanoi plans to ban fossil-fuel motorcycles from its city center in July 2026, part of a national drive to cut emissions and air pollution. Its commercial capital, Ho Chi Minh City, is weighing a similar step. By 2030, Vietnam aims for a third of cars and more than a fifth of motorbikes to run on electricity.",
      "Some see this as an opportunity to swap out smoke-belching engines for cleaner, quieter rides, But others remain wary. Gas-powered bikes are still cheaper, sturdier, and easier to repair. Many owners worry that electric models could fall short on range, affordability, and charging convenience.",
      "At the heart of the debate is the motorbike\u2019s central place in Vietnamese life. The country\u2019s 77 million two-wheelers \u2014 including 7 million in Hanoi and 8.5 million in Ho Chi Minh City \u2014 power small businesses, shape daily commerce, and set the rhythm of cities. Shopkeepers pile goods onto scooters to push through traffic, while families squeeze three generations onto a single bike for the school run.",
      "While delivery drivers and mechanics are scrambling, electric bike start ups are opening new retail stores and e-bike sales are climbing.",
      "Vietnam\u2019s biggest motorbike makers, Honda and Yamaha, say the 2026 timeline is too ambitious. Vietnamese electric vehicle companies \u2014 start ups like Dat Bike or the larger VinFast, backed by Vietnam\u2019s largest conglomerate VinGroup \u2014 and the Chinese electric bikemaker Yadea are betting on an electric future.",
      "Ta Manh Cuong, 45, a ride-hailing driver who earns about $20 on good days, calls his battered but reliable motorbike his \u201ciron horse,\u201d a slang riders use for their faithful companion through the city\u2019s daily chaos. He'd be willing to shift to an electric bike, would even welcome it if it cost less.",
      "\u201cBut right now I can\u2019t afford to buy an electric bike,\u201d he said.",
      "Vietnam\u2019s motorbike market, at about 3.5 million units a year, is the second-largest in Southeast Asia. It's also among the most electrified markets for two-wheelers, ranking third only to China and India, though electric motorbikes make up about 12% of total sales.",
      "Electrifying remaining two-wheelers is key for cutting tailpipe emissions and clearing smog from the streets. EVs are more energy efficient than gas engines, said Zifei Yang of the International Council on Clean Transportation. About 70,000 deaths in Vietnam each year are linked to polluted air, according to the Boston-based nonprofit Health Effects Institute.",
      "Unlike the car market, Yang added, motorbikes sold in Vietnam are made there. That means a shift to electric bikes could boost local producers, foster startups, and attract new investment. Vietnam\u2019s transition could also shape other developing markets.",
      "\u201cThese countries look at each other. Look at the experience,\u201d she said.",
      "Electric motorbike sales have surged since the ban was announced, with purchases of smaller bikes up 89% and full-sized bikes 197% in the first eight months of 2025. VinFast led as its sales more than quadrupled, outpacing Yadea and other local rivals, according to industry tracker MotorcyclesData.",
      "Yang said government subsidies to scrap old motorbikes could help riders like Cuong. While better public transport in crowded city centers would also encourage the shift to electric vehicles. She added that ride-hailing fleets stand to gain too since they travel longer distances and electric bikes could help them save on fuel. Stations where riders can replace depleted batteries with a fully charged one instead of waiting for it to recharge would also help.",

The city will offer low-interest loans, tax breaks and set up low-emission zones to curb pollution. In Hanoi, people affected by the ban can get $120\u2013$200 in subsidies to buy electric bikes worth at least $590, depending on income, and won\u2019t have to pay new registration or license plate fees until 2030.",

Its ride-hailing company, Green SM, surpassed Singapore-based regional ride-hailing firm Grab in February to become the market leader in Vietnam. It soon will launch its first battery\u2011swapping electric motorbike, selling for about $760. It plans, also, to build 150,000 battery-swapping stations nationwide within three years.",
      "VinFast is partnering with Vietnamese banks to offer low\u2011interest loans and subsidies to boost electric vehicle adoption, including covering up to 90% of costs and waiving registration fees.",
      "These policies and incentives can encourage more purchases of electric motorbikes, said Dat Bike CEO and founder Son Nguyen, but long-term success hinges on making electric bikes that deliver high performance, long ranges and fast charging at prices equal to or better than gas-guzzling motorbikes. \u201cIncentives can help add momentum, but long-term success depends on building products that win on their own merits,\u201d he said.",
      "Dat Bike raised $22 million in September from private investors, nearly doubling its capital to $47 million. The company said it will use the funding to boost production, research and expand its sales.",
      "Honda dominates Vietnam\u2019s motorcycle market with a more than 80% market share. It sold about 2.3 million bikes in Vietnam from April 2024 to March 2025 and exported 300,000 more, cementing the country as both a top market and a key production hub.",
      "Yamaha trails with about a 17% share. Through Vietnam\u2019s manufacturers\u2019 association, the two companies said the 2026 ban is too rushed. Honda only began selling e-bikes this year and warned that replacing millions of bikes quickly would strain consumers.",
      "Honda and the Vietnam's motorcycle manufacturers' association didn't respond to requests for comment. Yamaha told The Associated Press that it was reviewing the plan and couldn't respond yet.",
      "For now, many businesses are hedging their bets. Bao Ngoc Cao, who rents motorbikes to expats and tourists, said she was \u201cterrified\u201d when she first heard about the ban. Her business runs on the principle that bikes are cheap \u2014 costing about $80 monthly. Losing access to Hanoi\u2019s most touristy streets would cut her off from her core customers, and while interest in EVs is growing, current subsidies aren\u2019t nearly enough for her to replace her fleet. Still, she says she supports the ban in principle, welcoming the promise of cleaner air and healthier streets.",

      "China has expanded its export rules on rare earths, requiring foreign firms to get approval for exporting products containing even small amounts of China-originated materials",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 China likes to condemn the United States for extending its arm too far outside of its borders to make demands on non-American companies. But when it sought to hit back at the U.S. interests this month, Beijing did exactly the same.",
      "In expanding export rules on rare earths, Beijing for the first time announced it will require foreign firms to obtain approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even tiny amounts of China-originated rare earth materials or produced with Chinese technology.",
      "That means a South Korean smartphone maker must ask for Beijing's permission to sell the devices to Australia if the phones contain China-originated rare earth materials, said Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative. \u201cThis rule gives China control over basically the entire global economy in the technology supply chain,\u201d he said.",
      "For anyone familiar with U.S. trade practice, China is simply borrowing a decades-long U.S. policy: the foreign direct product rule. It extends the reach of U.S. law to foreign-made products, and it has been used regularly to restrict China's access to certain U.S. technologies made outside of the United States, even when they are in the hands of foreign companies.",
      "It is the latest example of Beijing turning to U.S. precedents for tools it needs to stare down Washington in what appears to be an extended trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "\u201cChina is learning from the best,\u201d said Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis. \u201cBeijing is copying Washington\u2019s playbook because it saw firsthand how effectively U.S. export controls could constrain its own economic development and political choices.\"",
      "He added: \u201cGame recognizes game.\"",
      "It was in 2018, when President Donald Trump launched a trade war with China, that Beijing felt the urgency to adopt a set of laws and policies that it could readily deploy when new trade conflicts arise. And it looked to Washington for ideas.",
      "Its Unreliable Entity List, established in 2020 by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, resembles the U.S. Commerce Department's \u201centity list\u201d that restricts certain foreign companies from doing businesses with the U.S.",

      "Calling it a toolkit against foreign sanctions, intervention and long-arm jurisdiction, the state-run news agency China News in a 2021 news report cited an ancient Chinese teaching, saying Beijing would be \u201chitting back with the enemy's methods.\u201d",
      "The law \u201chas combed through relevant foreign legislation and taken into consideration the international law and the basic principles of international relations,\u201d said the Chinese scholar Li Qingming as quoted in the news report.

      "Jeremy Daum, a senior research scholar in law and senior fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center, said Beijing often draws from foreign models in developing its laws in non-trade, non foreign-related areas. As China seeks capabilities to retaliate in kind in trade and sanctions, the tools are often \u201cvery parallel\u201d to those of the U.S., he said.",
      "Both governments also have adopted a \u201cholistic view of national security,\u201d which expands the concept to justify restrictions on each other, Daum said.",
      "When Trump launched his trade war with China shortly after he returned to the White House earlier this year, Beijing readily deployed its new tools in addition to raising tariffs to match those imposed by the U.S. president.",
      "In February, in response to Trump's first 10% tariff on China over allegations that Beijing failed to curb the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl, the Chinese Commerce Ministry put PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger and the biotechnology company Illumina, on the unreliable entity list.",
      "That barred them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country. Beijing also announced export controls on tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, which are elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products.",
      "In March, when Trump imposed the second 10%, fentanyl-related tariff, Beijing placed 10 more U.S. firms on its unreliable entity list and added 15 U.S. companies to its export control list, including aerospace and defense companies like General Dynamics Land Systems and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, among others, asserting that they \u201cendanger China\u2019s national security and interests.\u201d",
      "Then came the so-called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in April, when Beijing not only matched Trump's sky-high tariff of 125% but also blacklisted more U.S. companies and announced export controls on more rare earth minerals. That led to a pause in the shipment of magnets needed in manufacturing a wide range of products such as smartphones, electric vehicles, jet planes and missiles.",
      "While the new tools have allowed China to stare down the United States, Daum said they are not without risks.",
      "\u201cThe dangers in such a facially balanced and fair approach are, one, what one side sees as reciprocity the other might interpret as escalation,\u201d he said. And second, \"in a race to the bottom, nobody wins.\u201d",

      "Athletic departments across the country are adding commercial sponsorship logos to their football fields after an NCAA rule change",
      "The University of Texas broke tradition by adding corporate logos to its football field, a year after athletic director Chris Del Conte said he wasn't considering it.",
      "The additions of Humann logos on the playing field was in large part due to the company's longtime ties to the university, but the revenue generated certainly won't hurt, even for one of the most profitable departments in college athletics.",
      "\u201cRevenue is a component, but we don't need it,\u201d Del Conte said. The size of the deal, which is at least the sixth in the Southeastern Conference and involves all 20 Longhorns sports programs, was not disclosed.",
      "Corporate logos on the field alongside school branding is a trend and an important one for schools hungry for money. It started last season after the NCAA voted to overturn a decades-old restriction on commercial sponsor advertisements on the field of play. Schools were clear to add corporate logos at the 50-yard line, with no more than two flanking advertisements elsewhere on the field.",
      "The 2025 season has seen an uptick of corporate field logos after a multibillion-dollar lawsuit settlement allowed each school to share up to $20.5 million in revenue directly with its athletes this school year while doling out millions more in scholarships.",
      "That has pushed schools to find additional revenue streams. The NCAA is considering allowing commercial logos on uniforms next year, but field logos have already taken hold across the country, including some of the largest, tradition-rich schools in college athletics.",
      "Alabama partnered with the U.S. Navy\u2019s Maritime Industrial Base program to add \u201cBuild Giants Alabama\u201d logos on both 25-yard lines. Penn State added field logos in both end zones as part of a deal with Amica Mutual Insurance.",
      "Oklahoma has logos for Riverwind Casino painted across the 25-yard lines, LSU added Venture Global logos at the 25s in Death Valley and South Carolina has logos for machinery company Blanchard Cat on the field at Williams-Brice Stadium.",

    "story": [
      "Trade unions in Nevada want the state to offer tax incentives to major film studios to bring more movie making to the Vegas area",
      "LAS VEGAS -- LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Movies like \u201cThe Hangover\u201d and \u201cOcean's Eleven\u201d piqued interest in the Las Vegas Strip long ago. But now Nevada labor unions hoping to boost jobs and tourism are pushing state officials to offer tax credits aimed at bringing more Hollywood filmmaking to the state.",
      "The effort to offer up to $95 million in tax credits to Sony Pictures Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery for a new film production facility in the Vegas suburbs didn't win enough legislative support earlier this year. But more than a dozen labor unions are pushing to revive the proposal during an expected special session next month.",
      "\u201cWe believe if we can get the public behind us, we\u2019ll be able to get the legislators to understand what a big change this can bring to Southern Nevada,\u201d said Tommy White, business manager-secretary treasurer of Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, Local 872 in Las Vegas.",
      "Trade unions formed a political action committee called Nevada Jobs Now, which has raised over $1 million to be used for digital advertisements, mailers and some TV commercials, White said. The production companies behind the project say it would create 19,000 construction jobs.",
      "If the unions are successful, Las Vegas would be competing with cities like Atlanta, where the film industry has boomed for more than a decade thanks to a far more generous tax break. California, meanwhile, recently revamped its own tax incentive programs to combat a multiyear downward trend in Hollywood film production.",
      "The production companies would not come to Las Vegas if they don\u2019t receive the tax incentives, according to David O\u2019Reilly, CEO of Howard Hughes Holdings, the developer of the proposal called Summerlin Studios. It would include 10 movie stages, hotels, a medical center and be part of a master-planned neighborhood in West Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cThere would be no reason for Sony and Warner to film in Nevada when they can get tax credits in 20 other states or around the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to bring their productions to where they have the best economic deal, and we\u2019re just trying to make Nevada competitive with everybody else.\u201d",
      "To be eligible for the tax credits, $400 million needs to be spent building a studio and $1.8 billion spent building the mixed-use development of shops and restaurants, O\u2019Reilly said. Sony and Warner Bros. would have to spend $4.5 billion over 15 years. They would be eligible for the tax credits after the studio is built and filming begins, he said.",
      "The proposal comes as Las Vegas continues to see a decline in tourism. Between June 2024 and June 2025, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority reported an 11.3% decline in visitors.",
      "White and other supporters argue that not only will the film studios bring jobs and revenue, it will also attract tourists.",
      "\u201cWith movie studios, you bring in a whole different type of tourist,\u201d White said, likening it to how major sports teams draw visitors. \u201cYou don\u2019t just bring the person that\u2019s come in to go to a resort to gamble.\u201d",

      "Dubbed the \u201cHollywood of the South,\u201d metro Atlanta became a ubiquitous backdrop for huge projects, including Marvel films and Netflix\u2019s \u201cStranger Things.\u201d Its program has supported thousands of jobs and the creation of several thriving studios. But it is expensive \u2014 the state in 2024 was projected to give out $1.35 billion in credits that year alone.",
      "The state's return is an average of 17 cents in tax revenue for every state dollar spent, according to Carlianne Patrick, an associate professor at Georgia State University who conducts audits of the state\u2019s tax credit programs.",
      "Georgia has seen a large increase in production activity and an increase in jobs, though not all of them are full-time, permanent positions, Patrick said.",
      "Some don\u2019t see the payoff in giving tax credits to the film studios.",
      "The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), a union representing thousands of state workers, joined other Nevada organizations this week in sending a letter to the governor urging him to not include the film tax credit proposal in the upcoming special session. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo says he will call lawmakers back to the capital before the years ends, but it's not yet clear what issues lawmakers will tackle.",
      "They argue the project is \u201cfiscally irresponsible and politically indefensible\u201d and would only generate $0.52 in tax revenue for every $1 in credit, citing a May 2025 report commissioned by the state.",
      "\u201cEvery dollar we lock into a corporate handout is a dollar we can\u2019t put toward our rainy-day readiness, public education, health care, wildfire mitigation, housing, and the basic services Nevadans rely on when times get tight,\" the organizations wrote in the letter.",
      "Jared Kluesner, a psychiatric nurse at the Southern Nevada Adult Mental Health campus in Las Vegas and member of AFSCME, said the state should prioritize public services for people with mental health issues.",
      "Kluesner wants Sony and Warner Bros. to build a film studio facility and create more jobs for Nevadans, but \u201cif they\u2019re going to do it at the cost of public services and funds that should be allocated to state workers, then that\u2019s not really solving any problems.\u201d",

      "The closed-door gathering \u2014 known as the fourth plenum \u2014 is expected to last four days and will discuss and put the final touches on China\u2019s next five-year plan, a blueprint for 2026-2030.",
      "The leaders are meeting at a time of heightened trade tensions between Washington and Beijing and just ahead of a possible meeting between Xi and U.S. President Donald Trump during a regional summit later this month.",
      "Here is what to know about the meeting:",
      "The fourth plenum refers to the fourth plenary session, out of typically a total of seven sessions during the five-year term of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s central committee. Xi and about 370 members of the central committee are expected to attend.",
      "The gathering also may coincide with personnel changes. Since it's held behind closed doors, details may come days or weeks later.",
      "Such gatherings are meant to help unite officials and the public behind the party's agenda.",
      "The full five-year plan for 2026-2030 and specifics will likely not be released until the annual session of the National People's Congress is held in March.",
      "But there is little reason to expect a radical shift away from the format and messaging style of previous five-year plans, Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank, said in an interview.",
      "The world\u2019s second-largest economy is forecast to expand by 4.8% this year, according to the World Bank, a figure close to China\u2019s official target of about 5% annual growth. Growth in July-September slowed to 4.8%, the lowest pace in a year. China faces challenges from the trade war that has intensified since Trump took office, but also from chronic domestic problems that are dragging on growth.",
      "Longstanding efforts to boost consumer spending and investment by businesses and to curb excess capacity in many industries top the list of economic priorities. But Xi also will likely highlight China's push to become the global leader in many technologies, such as artificial intelligence.",
      "China\u2019s pursuit of technological \u201cself-sufficiency,\u201d weaning its industries of their reliance on advanced computer chips from the U.S., has sped up as Trump tightens American export control measures and raises tariffs.

      "Boosting consumption, which would drive borrowing and demand, is \u201cmuch more important than before\u201d but consumer confidence has been undermined by the bursting of China's property bubble several years ago, Zhang explained.",
      "Economists say bolder moves are needed to make a significant difference.",
      "Price wars in the auto industry are an example of the risks of the ferocious competition that results from overcapacity that afflicts many Chinese industries.

      "Since the massive disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, China has struggled to reignite faster economic growth. Its property sector downturn has complicated that effort, causing massive layoffs and leading families to cut back on spending as house prices have fallen.",
      "Wendy Leutert, a professor of economics and trade at Indiana University, noted in a recent report that China is still stinting on spending on areas that might help to balance the economy and encourage more consumer spending, such as health care, education and child and elder care.",
      "\u201cOverall, China\u2019s leaders still appear willing to accept economic costs, including resource misallocation and failures, in order to pursue self-sufficiency and technological leadership in strategically important industries and strengthen overall national power,\u201d she wrote.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California ramped up its efforts to curb plastic pollution Friday \u2014 suing three plastic-bag makers, alleging the companies falsely claimed their products were recyclable.",
      "State Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said companies Novolex Holdings, Inteplast Group and Mettler Packaging violated a state law passed in 2014 that banned plastic bags at grocery store checkouts that weren't recyclable.",
      "Under the law, shoppers could pay 10 cents for thicker plastic bags that needed to be reusable and recyclable. But the makers of the bags labeled them as recyclable even though they were not \u2014 recycling facilities cannot process them and they end up dumped in landfills, incinerated, or in the state\u2019s waterways, Bonta said.",
      "\u201cIn California, we\u2019re making it clear,\" he said at a news conference. \"Truth matters. Public trust matters. Environmental protection matters.\u201d",
      "The companies did not respond to email and phone requests for comment.",
      "The state filed a similar lawsuit against ExxonMobil about a year ago over the oil giant\u2019s plastic products. The lawsuit said the company deceived the public by falsely promising that its plastic products would be recycled. The oil giant said California\u2019s recycling system was ineffective and that the state should have worked with the company to keep plastics out of landfills.",
      "California lawmakers later decided the 2014 law didn\u2019t go far enough. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law last year that will ban all plastic shopping bags at grocery stores starting next year.",

The businesses agreed to collectively pay the state nearly $1.8 million and halt plastic bag sales in California after selling the rest of their existing stock.",
      "The lawsuit and settlements hold companies accountable for mislabeling their products as recyclable, said Nick Lapis, director of advocacy for environmental group Californians Against Waste.",

The crisis caused Silicon Valley Bank to fail, followed by Signature Bank, and led to the eventual sale of First Republic Bank to JPMorgan Chase in a fire sale. Other banks like Zions and Western Alliance ended up seeing their stocks plummet during that time period.",

      "Sounds hard to believe, but a young Victoria Beckham was put in the back row at theater school for being too heavy",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Now here\u2019s something you might not quite believe about Victoria Beckham, glam Spice Girl turned high-profile fashion designer: At theater school, they purposely put her in the back row. Because she was too heavy.",
      "\u201cIt was really difficult,\u201d she says now of the memory from her youth, sipping a sparkling water in a Manhattan hotel in between work engagements. \u201cWe were all judged on how we looked. I was young. I had bad skin, my weight was going up and down, I had really lank hair.\u201d",
      "Beckham was also bullied in school and told she was a bad learner, revelations that come in a new documentary, \u201cVictoria Beckham.\u201d The three-part Netflix series traces her career and especially her ascension in the fashion world \u2014 building up to a grand Paris runway show at a palace in front of 600 people.",
      "That 2024 show \u2014 with a rainstorm threatening to scuttle the whole thing \u2014 is presented as a career pinnacle for a designer who spent years proving herself alongside giants of the field, showing she wasn\u2019t simply a celebrity slapping her name on a label. ( Vogue\u2019s Anna Wintour is among the fashion luminaries attesting to Beckham\u2019s hard-won industry acceptance in the documentary).",
      "Of course the show also features liberal doses of Beckham\u2019s soccer legend husband David \u2014 just as Victoria appeared in his own recent, popular Netflix documentary \u201cBeckham\u201d (both were produced by David Beckham\u2019s own Studio 99).",
      "Some reviews have said Victoria\u2019s documentary feels more guarded and less revelatory. In any case, Victoria Beckham says wanted to tell her own story, her own way. She focuses only briefly on what a certain generation knows her best for \u2014 the four years she spent as Posh Spice \u2014 and mostly on the two decades she\u2019s been building her eponymous fashion and beauty brand.",
      "Other revelations: While she was the richer partner when they married in 1999 and in fact bought their first house, it was David Beckham who later invested in her label and helped get it going.",
      "She also talks about how her company almost fell apart due to bad business decisions \u2014 like spending 70,000 pounds (about $94,000) on office plants and 15,000 (about $20,000) more to water them \u2014 and how she learned, with investors, to right the ship.",
      "Beckham, 51, sat down with The Associated Press this week during a visit to New York. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "BECKHAM: Well, his documentary wasn\u2019t about me, you know. I was in the documentary as David\u2019s wife and I\u2019ve been part of his journey and I was so honored to talk about that. People\u2019s response to me in that really surprised me, and there was something quite liberating about that because when I saw myself ... I didn\u2019t like how I came across. But then I think I\u2019ve always felt that way about myself. I suppose it gave me the confidence to do my own.",
      "BECKHAM: I\u2019ve been in the fashion industry for almost two decades. I was in the Spice Girls for four years \u2014 and have been so defined by that four-year period in my life. A time that I\u2019m so proud of, but I\u2019ve fighting preconceptions because of that period. I feel that only now is my brand in a place where me talking about my past will not affect the brand that I\u2019ve built.",

And by the way, that started when I was a child, when I was at school. If anybody watches this documentary and I can give them the confidence to follow their dreams, that\u2019s another really good reason to do it.",

And I think looking at the documentary telling my story from ME explains the why. I can\u2019t blame people for looking at the pictures of me looking really grumpy.",
      "BECKHAM: Never quite like this. The opportunity has never really presented itself. And I know a lot of people can relate to my story because of all the messages that I\u2019ve had since people have watched the documentary. ... From, yes, people that I know, but people that I don\u2019t know, people who say, \u201cI can relate, I have been through that.\u201d It\u2019s taken this process finally for me to feel at my age proud of what I\u2019ve achieved and also to finally believe that I am enough.",
      "BECKHAM: I\u2019m so respectful of my time with Spice Girls. I still see all of the girls now. I wouldn\u2019t be who I am now ... the Spice Girls gave me the confidence to be me. I remember Geri (Halliwell) saying to me, \u201cYou\u2019re funny, be funny.\u201d I\u2019m shy. And they really gave me my personality back. ... I think people would be surprised to know that I was only a Spice Girl for four years. I\u2019ve been in fashion nearly two decades, but people like to pigeonhole.",
      "BECKHAM: Maybe. I don\u2019t know. \u2026 I think I\u2019ve earned my place to be showing where I am. I think that I\u2019ve more than proved myself and earned the right to be there. Now I have to work hard to maintain that.",
      "BECKHAM: I\u2019ve learned so much. I know what I know and I really know what I DON'T know. It got to a stage where my investors told me that we had to re-strategize not just the business side of things but the creative things as well. And that was difficult. ... We had to change a lot of things to fix the business and I took it on the chin. Of course that meant compromising, but I wanted to save the business.",
      "BECKHAM: Fashion in its own right is profitable. And to be able to say that in this current climate is something I\u2019m very proud of. I\u2019m an independent brand as well, so I\u2019m incredibly proud to say the fashion is making money. Beauty is also doing incredibly well. And now, it is about building the house that I really have always dreamed of.",
      "BECKHAM: I recognize that I am really blessed. I am very appreciative of the life I have. You have to take it along with the other stuff.",

      "Egypt has increased fuel prices by around 12%, marking the second hike this year",
      "CAIRO -- CAIRO (AP) \u2014 Egypt increased fuel prices by around 12% on Friday, a step likely to drive up the costs of goods and services across the country. This is the second fuel price hike this year.",
      "In a statement posted on Facebook, the Egyptian government gave no reason for the move but said fuel prices will remain fixed in the local market with no further increases for at least one year.",
      "Egyptians have been grappling with soaring inflation as they navigate rising daily costs that reached another high last year. They included an increase in fuel prices, a hike in subway fares and a slide in the Egyptian pound against foreign currencies.",
      "According to the latest data from the Central Bank of Egypt posted Oct. 8, Egypt\u2019s annual urban consumer price inflation reached 11.7% in September\u2014 down from 12% in August and 13.9% in July.",
      "Fuel prices last increased in April, rising between 11% and 14% on various fuel products.",
      "At the time of a previous price hike in late 2024, the government said that raising prices was meant to \u201creduce the gap between the selling prices of petroleum products and their high production and import costs.\u201d",
      "According to the new prices taking effect on Friday, the cost of a liter of diesel \u2014 which is heavily relied on for public transport \u2014 increased from 15.50 pounds ($0.33) to 17.50 pounds ($0.37), while the price of the 92-octane gasoline rose to 19.25 pounds ($0.40) from 17.25 pounds ($0.36) and the 95-octane gasoline increased from 19 pounds ($0.40) to 21 pounds ($0.44).",

      "The Toronto Blue Jays are back in the World Series for the first time since 1993",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 When slugger Joe Carter hit the last World Series pitch thrown in Canada over the left-field wall to win the Toronto Blue Jays' second consecutive title, it was 8 1/2 months before Shohei Ohtani was born.",
      "The Blue Jays are back in baseball's championship round for the first time since 1993 and will host Ohtani and the Dodgers in Friday night's opener as Los Angeles tries to become the first repeat winner in a quarter century.",
      "When the World Series was last north of the border, the Steroids Era was just starting, advanced analytics were science fiction and complete games were thrown about twice a month.",
      "While the Dodgers may be the favorite, the Blue Jays have an entire country behind them.",
      "\u201cYou always feel the weight of the world in decisions you make but when you\u2019re kind of feeling a country, it kind of gets a little dicey at times,\u201d Toronto manager John Schneider said early in the postseason. \u201cSixth inning with the bases loaded and nobody out and Aaron Judge hitting, you feel like people in Nova Scotia want to come murder you.\u201d",
      "Toronto hosts the opener because it finished the regular season with 94 wins, one more than the Dodgers.",
      "\u201cThey just got all their guys rolling. They\u2019re scoring seven, eight runs, 10 runs a game, so that\u2019s tough to slow down,\" Los Angeles shortstop Mookie Betts said. \"They\u2019re doing all three facets of the game.\u201d",
      "Seeking the franchise\u2019s ninth title and eighth since bolting Brooklyn for Los Angeles after the 1957 season, the Dodgers have overrun opponents during the postseason. Ohtani is starring at the plate and on the mound, a performance that would be deemed CGI if not witnessed by thousands in person.",
      "\u201cSometimes you\u2019ve got to check yourself and touch him to make sure he\u2019s not just made of steel,\u201d teammate Freddie Freeman said.",
      "Before his three-homer at the plate and 10-strikeouts, six-scoreless innings mound show Friday night, Ohtani\u2019s bat had been slumping.",
      "He\u2019s hitting .220 with five homers and nine RBIs in the postseason and is 2-0 with a 2.25 ERA in a pair of pitching starts, striking out 19 and walking four in 12 innings.",
      "Los Angeles is the first defending champion to reach the Series since the 2009 Philadelphia Phillies, who lost to the New York Yankees in six games. No team has won consecutive titles since the Yankees took three in a row from 1998-2000. The gap is the longest in baseball history, topping the previous high between the 1977-78 Yankees and the 1992-93 Blue Jays.",
      "In other U.S. major leagues, the longest Super Bowl title gap was between the 2004-05 New England Patriots and the 2023-24 Kansas City Chiefs, the longest in the NBA was between the 1968-69 Boston Celtics and the 1987-88 Los Angeles Lakers, and the lengthiest in the NHL was between the 1997-98 Detroit Red Wings and the 2016-17 Pittsburgh Penguins.",
      "\u201cRealizing how hard it is to do last year, realizing how hard it was in \u201920, it\u2019s special,\u201d Dodgers catcher Will Smith said. \u201cTrying to get back-to-back is even more special.\u201d",

Counting the $6.5 million signing bonus in rookie Roki Sasaki\u2019s minor league contract, the Dodgers\u2019 player cost this year totals $516 million \u2014 with final numbers to be calculated during the offseason.",
      "Including Sasaki\u2019s signing bonus, the 13 pitchers on the Dodgers' NLCS roster alone cost $124.5 million.",

      "Christian McCaffrey has his first 100-yard rushing game since 2023, helping the San Francisco 49ers beat the Atlanta Falcons 20-10 on Sunday night",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 For all the stars the San Francisco 49ers might have been missing, they still had Christian McCaffrey.",
      "That proved to be the difference against the Atlanta Falcons.",
      "McCaffrey ran for 129 yards and two touchdowns and had his 200-yard game from scrimmage in six years as the short-handed 49ers finally delivered a strong ground game to beat Atlanta 20-10 on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cThat should be our plan every time,\u201d left tackle Trent Williams said about feeding McCaffrey. \u201cHe's one of the better players on our team, so putting the ball in his hands as much as possible works out good for us.\u201d",
      "The usually run-focused 49ers (5-2) had struggled to generate much on the ground all season before getting back to their old style against the Falcons (3-3) with help from the return of tight end George Kittle.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a different ballgame when he\u2019s in there,\" McCaffrey said. \"Even when he doesn\u2019t have a big statistical game, the attention that he draws opens so much up.\u201d",
      "McCaffrey had his first 100-yard rushing game since his Offensive Player of the Year campaign in 2023 and his 201 yards from scrimmage were his most since playing with Carolina in 2019.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the most consistent player I\u2019ve been around,\u201d coach Kyle Shanahan said. \"He just allows you to stay on track. He gets every yard in the run game and more. What he does in the pass game, it\u2019s rare that you throw the ball to him and not get a completion.\"",
      "The Niners won for the fourth time in five starts this season with backup quarterback Mac Jones playing in place of Brock Purdy.",
      "San Francisco's defense came up big as well despite losing All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner to an ankle injury last week and playing without star edge rusher Nick Bosa.",
      "The 49ers delivered two key plays in the fourth quarter to preserve the lead. The Falcons were driving down 13-10 and had a third-and-1 at the San Francisco 35. But the Niners stopped Bijan Robinson for no gain and then Chase Lucas broke up a pass from Michael Penix Jr. to Drake London on fourth down to end the threat.",
      "\u201cAnytime you get a chance to throw it to one of your best players, you feel pretty good about it,\u201d coach Raheem Morris said. \u201cThey made a great play.\u201d",
      "San Francisco then moved the ball downfield on the ground before Jones hit McCaffrey on a 17-yard pass on third and 14 to get down to the 4 against a defense that had only 10 men on the field.",
      "\u201cIt was absolutely embarrassing,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIt was my fault. I\u2019ll get it fixed.\u201d",
      "McCaffrey then scored on the next play with help rookie offensive lineman Connor Colby, who pulled him into the end zone in a move that is technically a penalty but almost never called.",
      "\u201cI wouldn't say carried,\u201d Colby said. \u201cHis legs were still moving. I was just helping him along.\u201d",
      "Jones threw for only 152 yards with an interception after averaging a league-high 313 yards through the air in his first four starts.",
      "Penix finished 21 for 38 for 241 yards with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Robinson, but the Falcons offense managed just two scores on nine drives.",
      "The running game helped San Francisco take a 7-3 lead on a 1-yard run by McCaffrey and the pass rush helped make it 10-3 at the half.",
      "Bryce Huff's strip sack of Penix set up a 55-yard field goal by Eddy Pineiro. San Francisco then forced Penix into an intentional grounding penalty when Atlanta was in field goal range, leading to a 10-second run off that ended the half.",
      "Falcons: LB Divine Deablo (forearm) left the game in the first half and didn't return.",
      "49ers: C Jake Brendel (hamstring) and CB Renardo Green (toe) left in the first half and didn't return.",
      "Falcons: Host Miami on Sunday.",

      "Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit his sixth home run this postseason, rookie Trey Yesavage struck out seven in 5 2/3 innings and the Toronto Blue Jays pushed the American League Championship Series to the limit by beating the sloppy Seattle Mariners 6-2 on Sunday night.",
      "The AL pennant will be decided Monday night in Toronto, the second Game 7 in Blue Jays history. Toronto lost to Kansas City in the 1985 ALCS.",
      "\u201cGot to enjoy it, man. This is what we sign up for,\u201d Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. \u201cIt\u2019s special and unique, but you have to look at it as a game.\u201d",
      "For one famous baseball family, it will also be a first. Guerrero's father, Hall of Fame outfielder Vladimir Guerrero, never played in a postseason Game 7 during his 16-year career.",
      "\u201cMy dad was telling me, Game 7 is give it all you have,\u201d the Toronto slugger said.",
      "Seattle, the only big league team without a pennant, will play a Game 7 for the first time. The winner faces the NL champion Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series beginning Friday.",
      "\u201cWin or go home,\u201d Mariners center fielder Julio Rodr\u00edguez said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lay everything out there.\u201d",
      "Addison Barger homered and drove in three early runs for the Blue Jays, who turned three double plays behind Yesavage \u2014 two of them to escape bases-loaded jams.",
      "That made Toronto the first team to induce consecutive bases-loaded, inning-ending double plays in a postseason game, and only the fourth team to turn two in a single postseason game.",
      "\u201cI knew my defense had my back,\u201d Yesavage said.",
      "Toronto also took advantage of Seattle\u2019s season-high three errors. By comparison, the Blue Jays have made four errors in 10 playoff games.",
      "\u201cBalls just kind of in and out of the glove there that put a couple extra guys on base,\u201d Mariners manager Dan Wilson said. \u201cUnfortunately, it led to a couple runs.\u201d",
      "Guerrero\u2019s sixth career postseason homer \u2014 all this year \u2014 tied him with Jos\u00e9 Bautista and Joe Carter for the most in Blue Jays history.",
      "\u201cThis is what you look for from one of the elite players in the game,\u201d Schneider said.",
      "Bautista threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the game.",
      "Toronto had lost its previous four games when facing postseason elimination. That streak stretched to Game 5 of the 2016 ALCS against Cleveland and included wild-card round losses to Tampa Bay in 2020, Seattle in 2022 and Minnesota in 2023.",
      "Guerrero\u2019s leadoff homer in the fifth made it 5-0 and chased Mariners starter Logan Gilbert. The right-hander allowed four earned runs and seven hits in four-plus innings.",
      "\u201cI thought he had a good fastball, especially early,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cHis split was good at times. This is a tough lineup and they did what they had to do to get the ball in play.\u201d",
      "Yesavage took a shutout into the sixth. He was charged with two runs and six hits, five of them singles. Five of his strikeouts came on his split-finger fastball, as did both double-play grounders with the bases loaded.",
      "\u201cI just believed in myself. I know my stuff plays at this level,\u201d Yesavage said. \u201cI know the defense behind me is going to play at the best of their abilities, and getting three double plays in back-to-back-to-back innings was huge.\u201d",
      "The 22-year-old Yesavage threw a season-high 31 splitters. He got 10 whiffs on splitters and five more on sliders.",
      "\u201cHe brings the energy,\u201d Guerrero said. \u201cHe\u2019s young. He wants to win so bad.\u201d",
      "Three of Yesavage\u2019s six major league starts have come in the playoffs. He\u2019s won twice this postseason after winning one of three outings during the regular season.",
      "Louis Varland got four outs and Jeff Hoffman struck out four over two hitless innings to end it.",
      "The Mariners used two walks and a single to load the bases against Yesavage in the third but were denied when slugger Cal Raleigh grounded into a 3-6-1 double play started by Guerrero and completed by Yesavage covering first base. Raleigh\u2019s first-pitch grounder came off his bat at 101 mph.",
      "\u201cUnderappreciated, I think, is how Vlad can play really deep because of his arm,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cIn that situation, too, you need some wiggle room for a guy that hits the ball really hard.\u201d",
      "Raleigh finished 0 for 4 with three strikeouts.",
      "Seattle came up empty again after another bases-loaded opportunity in the fourth when J.P. Crawford grounded into a 4-6-3 double play.",
      "The Mariners broke through and chased Yesavage in the sixth. Josh Naylor\u2019s solo shot was his third home run of the playoffs. Yesavage exited after Randy Arozarena\u2019s base hit, and Eugenio Su\u00e1rez greeted Varland with a bloop RBI single.",
      "Toronto took advantage of fielding errors by Rodr\u00edguez in center field and Su\u00e1rez at third base to score twice in the second, when Barger and Isiah Kiner-Falefa had RBI singles.",
      "Ernie Clement hit a two-out triple off the left-field wall in the third and scored when Barger homered, his second of the postseason.",
      "George Springer started at designated hitter for the Blue Jays and went 0 for 4 with a walk. Springer exited in the seventh inning of Friday\u2019s Game 5 loss in Seattle after he was hit on the right kneecap by a 95.6 mph pitch from Bryan Woo.",
      "Guerrero was hit by a pitch from Seattle reliever Matt Brash in the seventh. Guerrero moved to second on Alejandro Kirk\u2019s single and was advancing on a wild pitch when he scored on Raleigh\u2019s throwing error.",
      "Toronto is expected to start RHP Shane Bieber on Monday night. Bieber allowed two runs and four hits over six innings in Game 3, a 13-4 win for the Blue Jays. He struck out eight and walked one as he bounced back from a poor outing against the Yankees in the Division Series.",
      "RHP George Kirby will start for Seattle. He allowed eight runs and eight hits, including three homers, over four innings in Game 3.",

      "\u201cI can actually come to you today and say there are less kids with food allergy today than there would have been if we hadn't implemented this public health effort,\" he added.",
      "The researchers found that peanut allergies in children ages 0 to 3 declined by more than 27% after guidance for high-risk kids was first issued in 2015 and by more than 40% after the recommendations were expanded in 2017.",
      "The effort hasn't yet reduced an overall increase in food allergies in the U.S. in recent years. About 8% of children are affected, including more than 2% with a peanut allergy.",
      "Peanut allergy is caused when the body\u2019s immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in peanuts as harmful and releases chemicals that trigger allergic symptoms, including hives, respiratory symptoms and, sometimes, life-threatening anaphylaxis.",
      "For decades, doctors had recommended delaying feeding children peanuts and other foods likely to trigger allergies until age 3. But in 2015, Gideon Lack at King\u2019s College London, published the groundbreaking Learning Early About Peanut Allergy, or LEAP, trial.",
      "Lack and colleagues showed that introducing peanut products in infancy reduced the future risk of developing food allergies by more than 80%. Later analysis showed that the protection persisted in about 70% of kids into adolescence.",
      "The study immediately sparked new guidelines urging early introduction of peanuts \u2014 but putting them into practice has been slow.",
      "Only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists reported following the expanded guidance issued in 2017, surveys found.",
      "Confusion and uncertainty about the best way to introduce peanuts early in life led to the lag, according to a commentary that accompanied the study. Early on, medical experts and parents alike questioned whether the practice could be adopted outside of tightly controlled clinical settings.",

      "In the recovery unit of UC San Diego Health, Salaysay helps patients manage pain after surgery. Along with medications, he offers tunes on request and sometimes sings. His repertoire ranges from folk songs in English and Spanish to Minuet in G Major and movie favorites like \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d",

      "The healing power of song may sound intuitive given music\u2019s deep roots in human culture. But the science of whether and how music dulls acute and chronic pain \u2014 technically called music-induced analgesia \u2014 is just catching up.",
      "No one suggests that a catchy song can fully eliminate serious pain. But several recent studies, including in the journals Pain and Scientific Reports, have suggested that listening to music can either reduce the perception of pain or enhance a person\u2019s ability to tolerate it.",

      "Two people with the same condition or injury may feel vastly different levels of acute or chronic pain. Or the same person might experience pain differently from one day to the next.",
      "Acute pain is felt when pain receptors in a specific part of the body \u2014 like a hand touching a hot stove \u2014 send signals to the brain, which processes the short-term pain. Chronic pain usually involves long-term structural or other changes to the brain, which heighten overall sensitivity to pain signals. Researchers are still investigating how this occurs.",
      "\u201cPain is interpreted and translated by the brain,\" which may ratchet the signal up or down, said Dr. Gilbert Chandler, a specialist in chronic spinal pain at the Tallahassee Orthopedic Clinic.",
      "Researchers know music can draw attention away from pain, lessening the sensation. But studies also suggest that listening to preferred music helps dull pain more than listening to podcasts.",
      "\u201cMusic is a distractor. It draws your focus away from the pain. But it\u2019s doing more than that,\" said Caroline Palmer, a psychologist at McGill University who studies music and pain.",
      "Scientists are still tracing the various neural pathways at work, said Palmer.",
      "\u201cWe know that almost all of the brain becomes active when we engage in music,\u201d said Kate Richards Geller, a registered music therapist in Los Angeles. \u201cThat changes the perception and experience of pain \u2014 and the isolation and anxiety of pain.\u201d",

      "For many young Americans, deciding on college has become a complex choice",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For a generation of young Americans, choosing where to go to college \u2014 or whether to go at all \u2014 has become a complex calculation of costs and benefits that often revolves around a single question: Is the degree worth its price?",
      "Public confidence in higher education has plummeted in recent years amid high tuition prices, skyrocketing student loans and a dismal job market \u2014 plus ideological concerns from conservatives. Now, colleges are scrambling to prove their value to students.",
      "Borrowed from the business world, the term \u201creturn on investment\u201d has been plastered on college advertisements across the U.S. A battery of new rankings grade campuses on the financial benefits they deliver. States such as Colorado have started publishing yearly reports on the monetary payoff of college, and Texas now factors it into calculations for how much taxpayer money goes to community colleges.",
      "\u201cStudents are becoming more aware of the times when college doesn\u2019t pay off,\" said Preston Cooper, who has studied college ROI at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cIt's front of mind for universities today in a way that it was not necessarily 15, 20 years ago.\"",
      "A wide body of research indicates a bachelor's degree still pays off, at least on average and in the long run. Yet there\u2019s growing recognition that not all degrees lead to a good salary, and even some that seem like a good bet are becoming riskier as graduates face one of the toughest job markets in years.",
      "A new analysis released Thursday by the Strada Education Foundation finds 70% of recent public university graduates can expect a positive return within 10 years \u2014 meaning their earnings over a decade will exceed that of a typical high school graduate by an amount greater than the cost of their degree. Yet it varies by state, from 53% in North Dakota to 82% in Washington, D.C. States where college is more affordable have fared better, the report says.",
      "It's a critical issue for families who wonder how college tuition prices could ever pay off, said Emilia Mattucci, a high school counselor at East Allegheny schools, near Pittsburgh. More than two-thirds of her school\u2019s students come from low-income families, and many aren't willing to take on the level of debt that past generations accepted.",
      "Instead, more are heading to technical schools or the trades and passing on four-year universities, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of families are just saying they can\u2019t afford it, or they don\u2019t want to go into debt for years and years and years,\u201d she said.",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been among those questioning the need for a four-year degree. Speaking at the Reagan Institute think tank in September, McMahon praised programs that prepare students for careers right out of high school.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying kids shouldn\u2019t go to college,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying all kids don\u2019t have to go in order to be successful.\u201d",
      "American higher education has been grappling with both sides of the ROI equation \u2014 tuition costs and graduate earnings. It\u2019s becoming even more important as colleges compete for decreasing numbers of college-age students as a result of falling birth rates.",
      "Tuition rates have stayed flat on many campuses in recent years to address affordability concerns, and many private colleges have lowered their sticker prices in an effort to better reflect the cost most students actually pay after factoring in financial aid.",
      "The other part of the equation \u2014 making sure graduates land good jobs \u2014 is more complicated.",
      "A group of college presidents recently met at Gallup\u2019s Washington headquarters to study public polling on higher education. One of the chief reasons for flagging confidence is a perception that colleges aren\u2019t giving graduates the skills employers need, said Kevin Guskiewicz, president of Michigan State University, one of the leaders at the meeting.",
      "\u201cWe're trying to get out in front of that,\u201d he said.",

      "The issue has been a priority for Guskiewicz since he arrived on campus last year. He gathered a council of Michigan business leaders to identify skills that graduates will need for jobs, from agriculture to banking. The goal is to mold degree programs to the job market's needs and to get students internships and work experience that can lead to a job.",
      "Bridging the gap to the job market has been a persistent struggle for U.S. colleges, said Matt Sigelman, president of the Burning Glass Institute, a think tank that studies the workforce. Last year the institute, partnering with Strada researchers, found 52% of recent college graduates were in jobs that didn\u2019t require a degree. Even higher-demand fields, such as education and nursing, had large numbers of graduates in that situation.",
      "\u201cNo programs are immune, and no schools are immune,\u201d Sigelman said.",
      "The federal government has been trying to fix the problem for decades, going back to President Barack Obama's administration. A federal rule first established in 2011 aimed to cut federal money to college programs that leave graduates with low earnings, though it primarily targeted for-profit colleges.",
      "A Republican reconciliation bill passed this year takes a wider view, requiring most colleges to hit earnings standards to be eligible for federal funding. The goal is to make sure college graduates end up earning more than those without a degree.",
      "Others see transparency as a key solution.",
      "For decades, students had little way to know whether graduates of specific degree programs were landing good jobs after college. That started to change with the College Scorecard in 2015, a federal website that shares broad earnings outcomes for college programs. More recently, bipartisan legislation in Congress has sought to give the public even more detailed data.",
      "Lawmakers in North Carolina ordered a 2023 study on the financial return for degrees across the state\u2019s public universities. It found that 93% produced a positive return, meaning graduates were expected to earn more over their lives than someone without a similar degree.",
      "The data is available to the public, showing, for example, that undergraduate degrees in applied math and business tend to have high returns at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, while graduate degrees in psychology and foreign languages often don't.",
      "Colleges are belatedly realizing how important that kind of data is to students and their families, said Lee Roberts, chancellor of UNC-Chapel Hill, in an interview.",
      "\u201cIn uncertain times, students are even more focused \u2014 I would say rightly so \u2014 on what their job prospects are going to be,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I think colleges and universities really owe students and their families this data.\u201d",

      "A new wave of protests is unfolding worldwide, driven by young people expressing discontent with their governments",
      "NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 From the Andes to the Himalayas, a new wave of protests is unfolding across the world, driven by generational discontent against governments and anger among young people.",
      "This week, Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina was forced out of power and out of the country after a military mutiny, the culmination of weeks of demonstrations led by young protesters referring to themselves as \u201cGen Z Madagascar.\u201d",
      "The rage against the political establishment in the Indian Ocean island country mirrors other recent protests across the world, in countries like Nepal, the Philippines, Indonesia, Kenya, Peru and Morocco. These protests have been sparked by specific grievances but are driven by long-simmering issues like widening inequality, economic uncertainty, corruption, and nepotism of leaders.",
      "But they have one thing in common: Mostly leaderless, they are made up primarily of young people who brand themselves as \u201cGen Z,\u201d defined as those born roughly between 1996 and 2010 \u2014 the first generation to grow up entirely in the internet age.",
      "\u201cWhat connects these youth-led protests is a shared sense that traditional political systems aren\u2019t responsive to their generation\u2019s concerns, whether that\u2019s corruption, climate change, or economic inequality. Protest then becomes the logical outlet when institutional channels feel blocked,\u201d said Sam Nadel, director of Social Change Lab, a U.K.-based nonprofit that researches protests and social movements.",
      "Though their specific demands differ, most of these protests have been sparked by government overreach or neglect. Some have also confronted harsh treatment by security forces and brutal repression.",
      "In Morocco, a leaderless collective called Gen Z 212 \u2014 named after Morocco\u2019s dialing code \u2014 has taken to the streets to demand better public services and increased spending on health and education. In Peru, protests over a pension law exploded into broader demands, including action to tackle rising insecurity and widespread corruption in the government. In Indonesia, deadly protests have erupted over lawmakers\u2019 perks and the cost of living, forcing the president to replace key economic and security ministers.",
      "The most widely recognized movement to be dubbed as a \u201cGen Z\u201d protest was a deadly uprising in Nepal that culminated with the resignation of the prime minister in September. Protesters drew inspiration from successful anti-government movements elsewhere in South Asia \u2014 Sri Lanka in 2022 and Bangladesh in 2024 \u2014 which led to the ouster of incumbent regimes.",
      "In Madagascar in turn, protesters say they were particularly inspired by the movements in Nepal and Sri Lanka.",
      "The protests began against regular water and electricity cuts but quickly morphed into wider discontent, as demonstrators called for the president and other ministers to step down. On Wednesday, Madagascar\u2019s military coup leader said he is \u201ctaking the position of president.\u201d",
      "Across multiple countries, a singular pop culture symbol has emerged: a black flag showing a grinning skull and crossbones wearing a straw hat. The flag comes from a cult Japanese manga and anime series called \u201cOne Piece,\u201d which follows a crew of pirates as they take on corrupt governments.",
      "In Nepal, protesters hung the same flag on the gates of the Singha Durbar, the seat of the Nepalese government, and on ministries, many of which were torched in protests. It was also hoisted by crowds in Indonesia, the Philippines, Morocco and Madagascar.",
      "Last week in the Peruvian capital, Lima, 27-year-old electrician David Tafur stood with the same flag in San Mart\u00edn Square, now the stage for weekly protests.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fighting the same battle \u2014 against corrupt officials who, in our case, are also killers,\u201d he said, recalling that President Dina Boluarte\u2019s government held on to power since December 2022 despite more than 500 protests and the deaths of 50 civilians.",

While they also used the internet and social media for mass mobilization, the \u201cGen Z\u201d protesters are taking it to another level.",
      "\u201cDigital platforms are powerful tools for information sharing and building connections, but the most effective movements often combine digital mobilization with traditional in-person organizing, as we\u2019ve seen in these recent protests,\u201d said Nadel from Social Change Lab.",
      "Days before the deadly protests began in Nepal, the government announced a ban on most social media platforms for not complying with a registration deadline. Many young Nepalese viewed it as an attempt to silence them and began accessing social media sites through virtual private networks to evade detection.",
      "Over the next few days, they used TikTok, Instagram and X to spotlight the lavish lifestyles of politicians\u2019 children, highlighting disparities between Nepal\u2019s rich and poor, and announce planned rallies and venues.

      "Hold on. The rat hole wasn't what you think. It wasn't some back alley bar that served as a speakeasy for the city's notorious gangster clientele or a tenement stuffed to the brim with junk. It was actually a full-body impression of an unlucky critter that got trapped in wet sidewalk cement in the city's Roscoe Village neighborhood about 20 or 30 years ago. The imprint closely resembles that of a spread-eagled rat, complete with outlines of what appear to be tiny claws, arms and legs and even a tail.",
      "The rat hole went viral early last year after comedian Winslow Dumaine posted a photo of it on X. The post drew curious tourists to the site at all hours, with some leaving coins and other odd objects around the impression as a tribute.",
      "The constant traffic drew complaints from neighbors, though, and in April 2024 someone filled the impression with a substance resembling plaster. City workers eventually removed that slab of sidewalk and took it to the City Hall-County Building. A plaque honoring the rat hole remains at the actual site.",
      "Researchers hailing from the University of Tennessee, New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine and the University of Calgary published a paper Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters that concludes the rat hole was most likely created not by the titular rodent but a squirrel or a muskrat.",

      "The researchers studied online photos of the rat hole and compared measurements of the imprint to museum specimens of animals commonly found in the Chicago area. The presence of arms, legs and a tail excluded birds, snakes, frogs and turtles, shrinking the possibilities to a mammal. The claw outlines further reduced the field to rats, mice, squirrels, chipmunks and muskrats, the study said.",
      "The creature's long forelimbs, third digits and hind paws were too large for a rat but fell into the measurement ranges for Eastern gray squirrels, fox squirrels and muskrats. The most probable suspect is the Eastern gray squirrel given how abundant that creature is in the Chicago area, the study concluded.",
      "Other researchers have theorized that a squirrel created the imprint, the study acknowledged. Cement is typically wet during the day, and rats are nocturnal and the creature didn't leave any tracks, suggesting a squirrel misjudged a leap or slipped from a branch and landed in the wet cement, the study noted.",
      "The imprint didn't show any sign of a bushy tail, but hair often lacks the rigidity to create deep, well-defined impressions, and it would have been surprising to find such an imprint, the study said.",
      "\u201cWe therefore propose that the specimen be rechristened the 'Windy City Sidewalk Squirrel' \u2014 a name more fitting of its likely origins and more aligned with the evidence at hand,\" they wrote.",

      "The first licensed platforms are expected to start operating in late 2026 at the earliest, officials said.",
      "In granting a license, Hong Kong's transport commissioner can consider the firm\u2019s experience, financial capacity and intended investments in the region.

      "A leading opponent of affirmation action launched a campaign last month to test the policy's legality and stop Kamehameha Schools from favoring Hawaiians. It's part of a movement to expand the legal definition of racial discrimination in education, which comes on the heels of a Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action in college admissions and is bolstered by the Trump administration\u2019s war against diversity, equity and inclusion.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court said on Monday that it will consider whether people who regularly smoke marijuana can legally own guns, the latest firearm case to come before the court since its 2022 decision expanding gun rights.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration asked the justices to revive a case against a Texas man charged with a felony because he allegedly had a gun in his home and acknowledged being a regular pot user.

His lawyers got the felony charge tossed out after the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the blanket ban is unconstitutional under the Supreme Court\u2019s expanded view of gun rights. The appellate judges found it could still be used against people accused of being high and armed at the same time, though.",

The gun charge was the only one filed, however, and his lawyers said the other allegations were irrelevant and were mentioned only to make him seem more dangerous.",
      "The case marks another flashpoint in the application of the Supreme Court's new test for firearm restrictions. The conservative majority found in 2022 that the Second Amendment generally gives people the right to carry guns in public for self-defense and any firearm restrictions must have a strong grounding in the nation\u2019s history.",

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 A Rhode Island man who appeared to fake his death and flee the United States to avoid rape charges is scheduled to be sentenced Monday on one of two rape convictions in Utah.",
      "Nicholas Rossi, 38, faces between five years and life in prison when sentenced Monday by District Judge Barry Lawrence in Salt Lake City.",
      "The sentence is the first of two scheduled for Rossi after he was convicted separately in August and September of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 4 for the second conviction, also for five years to life in prison.",
      "In August, jurors found Rossi guilty of rape after a three-day trial in which his accuser and her parents each took the stand. Rossi did not testify on his own behalf.",
      "It took more than a decade from the time of the rapes to his convictions. Utah authorities began searching for Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, when he was identified in 2018 through a decade-old DNA rape kit tied to the other case. He was among thousands of rape suspects identified and later charged when Utah made a push to clear its rape kit backlog.",
      "Months after he was charged in that case, an online obituary claimed Rossi died on Feb. 29, 2020, of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But police in his home state of Rhode Island, along with his former lawyer and a former foster family, cast doubt on whether he was dead.",
      "He was arrested in Scotland the following year while receiving treatment for COVID-19. Hospital staff recognized his distinctive tattoos \u2014 including the crest of Brown University inked on his shoulder, although he never attended \u2014 from an Interpol notice.",
      "He was extradited to Utah in January 2024 after a protracted court battle. At the time, Rossi insisted he was an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight who was being framed. Investigators say they identified at least a dozen aliases Rossi used over the years to evade capture.",
      "In his first Utah trial, Rossi's public defender denied the rape claim and urged jurors not to read too much into his move overseas.",

      "The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals has scheduled a hearing in Philadelphia over Habba's appointment, which a lower court judge said in August was done with a \u201cnovel series of legal and personnel moves\u201d and that she was not lawfully serving as U.S attorney for New Jersey.",

      "Habba is validly serving in the role under a federal statute that permits the first assistant attorney, a post she was appointed to by the Trump administration, the government said in court briefs ahead of Monday's hearing.",
      "A similar dynamic is playing out in Nevada, where a federal judge disqualified the administration's pick to be U.S. attorney there.",
      "In the Habba case, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann's decision came after several people charged with federal crimes in New Jersey challenged the legality of Habba\u2019s tenure. They sought to block the charges, arguing she didn\u2019t have the authority to prosecute their cases after her 120-day term as interim U.S. attorney expired.",
      "Habba was Trump's attorney in criminal and civil proceedings before he was elected to a second term. She served as a White House adviser briefly before Trump named her as a federal prosecutor in March.",
      "Shortly after her appointment, she said in an interview she hoped to help \u201cturn New Jersey red,\u201d a rare overt political expression from a prosecutor, and said she planned to investigate the state\u2019s Democratic governor and attorney general.",

      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) \u2014 The murder trial of an Illinois sheriff\u2019s deputy charged with killing Sonya Massey, a Black woman shot in her home last year after calling police for help, is set to begin Monday.",
      "Sean Grayson, 31, responding to a call about a suspected prowler, fired on the 36-year-old Massey in her Springfield home early on July 6, 2024, after confronting her about how she was handling a pan of hot water Grayson had ordered removed from her stove.",
      "Jurors will report Monday and the trial could continue into next week.",
      "Massey's killing raised new questions about U.S. law enforcement shootings of Black people in their homes and it prompted a change in Illinois law requiring fuller transparency on the background of candidates for law enforcement jobs.",
      "Here's what to know about the charges.",
      "In addition to first-degree murder, Grayson is charged with aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Widespread attention on Grayson's shooting of Massey prompted Sangamon County Circuit Judge Ryan Cadagin to move the trial from Springfield, 200 miles (322 kilometers) southwest of Chicago. Jurors will instead come from Peoria and surrounding areas, an hour's drive north, and will hear the case in their local courthouse.",
      "Grayson, who is white, faces a sentence of 45 years to life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder.",
      "After Grayson and another deputy checked the area around Massey\u2019s house, body camera video shows Grayson knocked on her door to report they had found nothing suspicious. He entered the house to obtain details for a report, noticed a pan on the stove and ordered its removal. Massey picked it up.",
      "She laughingly asked Grayson why he was backing away; he said he was trying to avoid the \u201chot, steaming water.\u201d Massey responded, \u201cI rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\u201d Grayson wrote in an incident report, \u201cI interpreted this to mean she was going to kill me.\u201d",
      "According to body camera video, Grayson pulled his 9 mm pistol and yelled at Massey to drop the pot. She apologized then put the pan down and ducked behind a counter, but in the confusion, as Grayson yelled, it appears she picked it up again. Grayson fired three times, hitting Massey once just below the left eye.",
      "Massey, a single mother of two teenagers who had a strong religious faith, was beset by mental health problems. When she answered Grayson's knock minutes before the shooting, she said, \u201cDon't hurt me,\u201d and then, as she was questioned and Grayson asked her if she was all right, she repeatedly said, \u201cPlease God.\u201d",

In one, her mother, Donna Massey, told authorities her daughter was suffering a \u201cmental breakdown.\" Donna Massey also told the dispatcher, \u201cI don\u2019t want you guys to hurt her.\"",
      "Grayson was not aware of the calls or Massey's background. County officials have since said there's no practical way to determine and communicate such information for police responding to emergency calls.",
      "Grayson was arrested 11 days after killing Massey and fired from the sheriff's department.",
      "As his background was scrutinized, Massey's family and others questioned why Grayson, who had been a Sangamon County deputy sheriff for 14 months, had been hired at all.",
      "In his early 20s, he was ejected from the Army for a drunken-driving arrest in which he had a weapon in his car. He was convicted of a DUI again within the year.",
      "Before joining the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department, Grayson had four policing jobs in six years \u2014 the first three of which were part-time.",
      "There was no indication Grayson had been fired from any job, but evaluations from past employers documented concerns about him. One department reported that while Grayson worked hard and had a good attitude, he struggled with report writing, was \u201cnot great with evidence \u2014 left items laying around office\u201d and was \u201ca bragger.\u201d",

JB Pritzker signed a law requiring that prospective police officers permit the release of all personal and employment background records to any law enforcement agency considering hiring them.

      "China has expanded its export rules on rare earths, requiring foreign firms to get approval for exporting products containing even small amounts of China-originated materials",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 China likes to condemn the United States for extending its arm too far outside of its borders to make demands on non-American companies. But when it sought to hit back at the U.S. interests this month, Beijing did exactly the same.",
      "In expanding export rules on rare earths, Beijing for the first time announced it will require foreign firms to obtain approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even tiny amounts of China-originated rare earth materials or produced with Chinese technology.",
      "That means a South Korean smartphone maker must ask for Beijing's permission to sell the devices to Australia if the phones contain China-originated rare earth materials, said Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative. \u201cThis rule gives China control over basically the entire global economy in the technology supply chain,\u201d he said.",
      "For anyone familiar with U.S. trade practice, China is simply borrowing a decades-long U.S. policy: the foreign direct product rule. It extends the reach of U.S. law to foreign-made products, and it has been used regularly to restrict China's access to certain U.S. technologies made outside of the United States, even when they are in the hands of foreign companies.",
      "It is the latest example of Beijing turning to U.S. precedents for tools it needs to stare down Washington in what appears to be an extended trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "\u201cChina is learning from the best,\u201d said Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis. \u201cBeijing is copying Washington\u2019s playbook because it saw firsthand how effectively U.S. export controls could constrain its own economic development and political choices.\"",
      "He added: \u201cGame recognizes game.\"",
      "It was in 2018, when President Donald Trump launched a trade war with China, that Beijing felt the urgency to adopt a set of laws and policies that it could readily deploy when new trade conflicts arise. And it looked to Washington for ideas.",
      "Its Unreliable Entity List, established in 2020 by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, resembles the U.S. Commerce Department's \u201centity list\u201d that restricts certain foreign companies from doing businesses with the U.S.",
      "In 2021, Beijing adopted the anti-foreign sanction law, allowing agencies such as the Chinese Foreign Ministry to deny visas and freeze the assets of unwelcome individuals and businesses \u2014 similar to what the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Treasury can do.",
      "Calling it a toolkit against foreign sanctions, intervention and long-arm jurisdiction, the state-run news agency China News in a 2021 news report cited an ancient Chinese teaching, saying Beijing would be \u201chitting back with the enemy's methods.\u201d",
      "The law \u201chas combed through relevant foreign legislation and taken into consideration the international law and the basic principles of international relations,\u201d said the Chinese scholar Li Qingming as quoted in the news report.

      "Jeremy Daum, a senior research scholar in law and senior fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center, said Beijing often draws from foreign models in developing its laws in non-trade, non foreign-related areas. As China seeks capabilities to retaliate in kind in trade and sanctions, the tools are often \u201cvery parallel\u201d to those of the U.S., he said.",
      "Both governments also have adopted a \u201cholistic view of national security,\u201d which expands the concept to justify restrictions on each other, Daum said.",
      "When Trump launched his trade war with China shortly after he returned to the White House earlier this year, Beijing readily deployed its new tools in addition to raising tariffs to match those imposed by the U.S. president.",
      "In February, in response to Trump's first 10% tariff on China over allegations that Beijing failed to curb the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl, the Chinese Commerce Ministry put PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger and the biotechnology company Illumina, on the unreliable entity list.",
      "That barred them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country. Beijing also announced export controls on tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, which are elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products.",
      "In March, when Trump imposed the second 10%, fentanyl-related tariff, Beijing placed 10 more U.S. firms on its unreliable entity list and added 15 U.S. companies to its export control list, including aerospace and defense companies like General Dynamics Land Systems and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, among others, asserting that they \u201cendanger China\u2019s national security and interests.\u201d",
      "Then came the so-called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in April, when Beijing not only matched Trump's sky-high tariff of 125% but also blacklisted more U.S. companies and announced export controls on more rare earth minerals. That led to a pause in the shipment of magnets needed in manufacturing a wide range of products such as smartphones, electric vehicles, jet planes and missiles.",
      "While the new tools have allowed China to stare down the United States, Daum said they are not without risks.",
      "\u201cThe dangers in such a facially balanced and fair approach are, one, what one side sees as reciprocity the other might interpret as escalation,\u201d he said. And second, \"in a race to the bottom, nobody wins.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Freed from the prison where he had been serving time for ripping off his campaign donors, former U.S. Rep. George Santos says he\u2019s humbled by his experience behind bars but unconcerned about the \u201cpearl clutching\u201d of critics upset that President Donald Trump granted him clemency.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty confident if President Trump had pardoned Jesus Christ off the cross, he would have had critics,\" Santos said Sunday in an interview on CNN.",
      "Santos, who won office after inventing a bogus persona as a Wall Street dealmaker, pleaded guilty to fraud and identity theft last year and began serving a 7-year sentence in July at a prison in New Jersey. But Trump ordered him released him Friday after he'd served just 84 days. Trump called Santos a \u201crogue,\u201d but said he didn't deserve a harsh sentence and should get credit for voting Republican.",
      "Speaking on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Santos said he had \u201clearned a great deal\u201d and had \u201ca very large slice of humble pie, if not the whole pie\u201d while in prison.",
      "He also apologized to former constituents in his New York congressional district, saying he was \u201cin a chaotic ball of flame\" when he committed his crimes. Santos admitted last year to deceiving donors and stealing the identities of 11 people \u2014 including his own family members.",
      "But when asked about fellow Republicans unhappy that Trump freed him so soon, Santos said other presidential acts of clemency had been worse, citing President Joe Biden's decision to pardon his son, Hunter, for gun and tax crimes.",
      "\u201cSo pardon me if I\u2019m not paying too much attention to the pearl-clutching of the outrage of my critics,\u201d Santos said.",
      "As part of his guilty plea, Santos had agreed to pay restitution of $373,750 and forfeiture of $205,003. But Trump's clemency order appeared to clear him of paying any further fines or restitution.",
      "Santos said he has been granted a second chance and intended to \u201cmake amends,\" but when asked if he intended to pay back the campaign donors he had defrauded, he said only if he had to.",

      "Revelations that Santos invented much of his life story surfaced just weeks after he became the first openly gay Republican to elected to Congress in 2022.",

He had never graduated from Baruch College, where he had claimed to be a standout player on the Manhattan college\u2019s volleyball team. He had never worked at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. He didn't own property.",
      "In truth, he struggled financially, had drifted through several jobs, including one for a company accused of running a Ponzi scheme, and even faced eviction.",

      "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Sunday he would slash U.S. funding to Colombia because the country\u2019s leader \u201cdoes nothing to stop\u201d drug production, in what is the latest sign of friction between Washington and one of its closest allies in Latin America.",
      "In a social media post, Trump referred to Colombian President Gustavo Petro as \u201can illegal drug dealer\u201d who is \u201clow rated and very unpopular.\u201d He warned that Petro \u201cbetter close up\u201d drug operations \u201cor the United States will close them up for him, and it won\u2019t be done nicely.\u201d",
      "Trump, while at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, wrote on his Truth Social platform that Petro is \u201cstrongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields\u201d across Colombia, which the Republican president spelled as Columbia. \u201cPetro does nothing to stop it, despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cAS OF TODAY, THESE PAYMENTS, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PAYMENT, OR SUBSIDIES, WILL NO LONGER BE MADE TO COLUMBIA,\u201d Trump said. He also said Petro had \u201ca fresh mouth toward America.\"",
      "Earlier Sunday, Petro accused the U.S. government of assassination and demanded answers after the latest American strike in Caribbean waters. The U.S. said on Saturday it was repatriating to Colombia and Ecuador two survivors from that attack, the sixth since early September. At least 29 people have been killed in strikes that the U.S. has said are targeting alleged drug traffickers.",
      "In September, the Trump administration accused Colombia of failing to cooperate in the drug war, although at the time Washington issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered aid cuts. Colombia is the world\u2019s largest exporter of cocaine, and the cultivation of the critical ingredient of coca leaves reached an all-time high last year, according to the United Nations.",
      "More recently, the State Department said it would revoke Petro\u2019s visa while he was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly because of his participation in a protest where he called on American soldiers to stop following Trump\u2019s commands. \u201cI ask all the soldiers of the United States\u2019 army, don\u2019t point your rifles against humanity\u201d and \u201cdisobey the orders of Trump,\u201d Petro said.",
      "Petro said a Colombian man was killed in a Sept. 16 strike and identified him as Alejandro Carranza, a fisherman from the coastal town of Santa Marta. He said that Carranza has no ties to drug trafficking and that his boat was malfunctioning when it was hit.",
      "\u201cU.S. government officials have committed murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters,\u201d Petro wrote on X. \u201cThe Colombian boat was adrift and had a distress signal on, with one engine up. We await explanations from the US government.\u201d",
      "Petro said that he has alerted the attorney general's office and demanded that it act immediately to initiate legal proceedings internationally and in U.S. courts. He continued to post a flurry of messages into early Sunday about the killing.",
      "\u201cThe United States has invaded our national territory, fired a missile to kill a humble fisherman, and destroyed his family, his children. This is Bol\u00edvar\u2019s homeland, and they are murdering his children with bombs,\u201d Petro wrote.",

      "Experts said delays caused by the request could most affect local governments and agencies that receive grant money passed down by states because their budgets and staffs are smaller. At the same time, FEMA also reduced the time frame that recipients have to spend the money, from three years to one. That could prevent agencies from taking on longer-term projects.",

      "The Ministry of State Security alleged that the U.S. agency had exploited vulnerabilities in the messaging services of a foreign mobile phone brand to steal sensitive information from devices of the National Time Service Center's staff in 2022. It did not specify the brand.",
      "The U.S. agency also used 42 types of \u201cspecial cyberattack weapons\u201d to target the center's multiple internal network systems and attempted to infiltrate a key timing system between 2023 and 2024, it said in a post on WeChat, a Chinese social media platform.",
      "The ministry said it had evidence but did not provide it in the post.",
      "It said the time center is responsible for generating and distributing China\u2019s standard time, in addition to providing timing services to industries such as communications, finance, power, transport and defense.

      "Pope Leo XIV has canonized Venezuela's \u201cdoctor of the poor\u201d before tens of thousands of people",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV canonized Venezuela\u2019s beloved \u201cdoctor of the poor\u201d Sunday before tens of thousands of people, offering the South American nation its first saint and a reason to celebrate amid a yearslong economic crisis and new tensions with the United States.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Hern\u00e1ndez, revered by millions for his dedication to poor people, was declared a saint alongside the founder of a Venezuelan religious order, Mother Carmen Rendiles Mart\u00ednez, at a Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Square that Leo called a \u201cgreat celebration of holiness.\u201d",
      "Thousands of jubilant Venezuelans filled the square and draped Venezuelan flags on its police barricades, adding splashes of red, blue and yellow that perfectly matched the uniforms of the attending Swiss Guards.",
      "Thousands more who couldn't travel to Rome gathered overnight in the Caracas plaza outside the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Candelaria church, where a 26-foot (8 meter) statue of Hern\u00e1ndez stands, and watched the Mass from Rome on a giant screen.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good news after so much sadness,\u201d said Ana Sanabria, a 71-year-old homemaker, as she watched the fireworks in Caracas.",
      "The Mass, which the Vatican said drew some 70,000 people, also gave Papua New Guinea its first saint: Peter To Rot, a layman killed in prison in 1945 for standing up for monogamous marriage at a time when polygamy was practiced. In all, seven people were canonized in a ceremony that Pope Francis put in motion in some of his final acts as pope.",
      "In fact, Francis approved Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s canonization from his hospital room on Feb. 24, agreeing to bypass the Vatican\u2019s typical miracle confirmation process to pronounce him a saint based on the \u201cwidespread veneration of the \u2018doctor-saint\u2019 among the faithful,\u201d the Vatican said.",
      "Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro thanked Francis for intervening, after years of petitions from ordinary faithful and the Venezuelan Catholic hierarchy.",
      "\u201cToday we have raised a prayer for the eternal spirit of he who is going to be a saint, also for Pope Francis, who gave this beautiful gift to Venezuela,\u201d he said in Caracas after the Mass.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez is beloved among Venezuelans, with his face plastered on street art around Caracas, in portraits in hospitals and in photos gracing individual home altars.",
      "As a doctor in Caracas during the late 1800s and early 1900s, he refused to take money from poor people for his services and often gave them money for medicine, earning the nickname \u201cdoctor of the poor.\u201d He was killed in a road accident in 1919 while crossing a street shortly after picking up some medicine at a pharmacy to bring to a poor elderly woman.",
      "He became a religious icon after his death, and when Pope John Paul II visited Venezuela in 1996, he received a petition signed by 5 million people \u2014 almost one in four Venezuelans \u2014 asking that he declare Hern\u00e1ndez a saint.",
      "\u201cFor them, this is indeed a national event of the highest order,\" said Silvia Correale, who spearheaded his sainthood case. \u201cCertainly, the canonization of Jos\u00e9 Gregorio is desired by all the Venezuelan people, and has been waited for by all the people.\u201d",
      "Jos\u00e9 Ramon Malavecontreras, a Venezuelan resident in Rome, said his mother named him after Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "\u201cThey believed I\u2019d be stillborn, so she dedicated his name to me for saving my life,\" he said Sunday in St. Peter's. \"Therefore, this moment was unmissable for me. I couldn\u2019t fail to be here.\u201d",
      "In Caracas, Arqu\u00edmides Blanco, 60, said he wasn\u2019t a particular fan of Hern\u00e1ndez but recognized the significance of his canonization for Venezuela now. Blanco belongs to a cultural collective commissioned to paint the streets ahead of the canonization.",

      "Also canonized Sunday were Archbishop Ignazio Choukrallah Maloyan, an Armenian Catholic who was killed for refusing to renounce his faith during what the Vatican has said was the Ottoman era genocide of Armenians; Sister Vincenza Maria Poloni, a 19th century founder of a religious order; Sister Maria Troncatti, an Italian missionary in Ecuador; and Bartolo Longo, who like Hernandez was canonized based on widespread veneration among the faithful, not a purported miraculous healing.",

      "It's been more than a decade since the last big ancient Egypt show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art",
      "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The powerful gods of ancient Egypt are having a get-together on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side.",
      "That would be at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It\u2019s been more than a decade since the museum\u2019s last big Egypt show, so \u201cDivine Egypt\u201d \u2014 a lavish exploration of how ancient Egyptians depicted their gods \u2014 is a major event, as evidenced by the crowds packing the show since its Oct. 12 opening.",
      "After all, few things excite the museum-going public like ancient Egypt, notes Diana Craig Patch, the Met\u2019s curator of Egyptian art.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first ancient culture that you learn in school,\u201d says Patch. \u201cPyramids, mummies, the great tomb of Tutankhamun \u2026 they\u2019re in our popular culture, books, films and now video games.\u201d",
      "But Patch hopes visitors will learn something deeper from \u201cDivine Egypt,\u201d which explores how the gods were portrayed by Egyptians both royal and common, and not only in temples where only kings or priests could go, but in daily worship by ordinary people.",
      "Ancient Egyptian civilization lasted some 3,000 years; the show, which runs into January, covers all periods and features over 200 objects, from huge limestone statues to tiny golden figurines. It includes 140 works from the Met\u2019s collection, as well as others lent by museums across the globe.",
      "\u201cThe divine landscape of ancient Egypt is full of gods \u2014 actually 1,500 if you count all of them,\u201d said Patch, leading The Associated Press on a tour last week. The show focuses on 25 main deities.",
      "Even pared down to 25, the research was daunting. The material and the textual information in Egyptology is fragmentary. What's more, the Egyptians kept bringing in new gods, or giving established gods new roles. \u201cAnd so that makes it a very complex, but fascinating landscape,\u201d Patch says.",
      "One aim is to show visitors that all of these images concern \u201chow ancient Egyptians related to their world. Those gods were how they solved problems of life, death, and meaning \u2014 problems that we\u2019re still trying to solve today.\u201d",
      "Some highlights:",
      "You\u2019d think that the boy king Tutankhamun, aka King Tut, would be the star of any party, given the astounding riches from his tomb the world has come to know. But in a sculpture that first greets visitors, from the Louvre in Paris, the solar god Amun-Re sits on a throne, presenting the much smaller pharaoh beneath his knees \u2014 or rather, protecting him \u2014 with hands resting on the small shoulders. The god is identified by his feathered crown, curled beard, divine kilt and jewelry \u2014 and is definitely the main attraction. Amun-Re was worshipped at the Karnak temple complex; the presence of Re in his name links him closely to the sun.",
      "The first of five galleries, \u201cExpressing the Divine\u201d focuses on two main deities, the god Horus and goddess Hathor. Horus is always represented as a falcon with a double crown, which signifies he is the king of Egypt and linked to the living king. But Hathor, who represents fertility, music and defense, among other things, takes many forms, including a cow, an emblem, a lion-headed figure or a cobra. In one statue here, she wears cow horns and a sun disc.",
      "\u201cSo these are two main ways gods are represented: sometimes with lots of roles, sometimes with only one,\u201d Patch says.",
      "This gallery looks at the all-important Re, whose domains are the sun, creation, life and rebirth. Re often merges form with other deities. \u201cRe rules the world \u2014 he's the source of light and warmth,\u201d Patch says.",
      "He's presented in this room as a giant scarab beetle. \u201cThat's his morning aspect,\u201d Patch says. \u201cHe's seen as a beetle who takes the sun out from the underworld and pushes it up into the sky.\u201d",
      "Also here is a vivid painted relief of the goddess Maat, from the Valley of the Kings in Thebes (modern Luxor). She embodies truth, justice and social and political order. Patch notes: \u201cThe best way we translate it today is rightness. She stands for the world in rightness, the way it should work.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis is one of the things that I hope people begin to take away: that Egyptians had multiple ways of dealing with things,\u201d Patch says of the competing myths. \u201cI find that fascinating. They overlapped.\u201d",
      "She's standing beside a huge statue of the god Min in limestone \u2014 a headless representation of a hard-to-define god associated with vegetation, agricultural fertility and minerals.",
      "Only kings and priests could access state temples to worship their gods. What were regular folks to do?",
      "Patch explains: \u201cAt festivals, the god came out of the temple on a sacred barque (sailing vessel), and people could commune with that image in the streets, and ask him or her questions.\u201d",
      "In this room, curators have arranged a set of objects as if on a barque. At the top and center: a gleaming, solid gold statuette of Amun, which the Met purchased in 1926 from the collection of Lord Carnarvon, who was involved in the 1922 discovery of Tut\u2019s tomb.",
      "Some of the most striking art connected to Egyptian gods is about death and the afterlife. \u201cOvercoming death is something that kings and non-royals alike had to deal with,\u201d says Patch.",
      "The gods in this section include Anubis, who embalms the deceased and leads them to the afterlife; Isis and Nephthys, the sisters of Osiris, who mourn and protect the dead; and Osiris, judge and ruler of the afterlife.",
      "This gallery houses the show\u2019s signature object: a stunning statuette, on loan from the Louvre, depicting the triad of Osiris, Isis and Horus. Made of gold inlaid with lapis lazuli, it shows the shrouded Osiris, falcon-headed Horus, and Isis in a sun disc and horns. The gold represents the skin of the gods, the lapis their hair.",
      "Although this last section is about overcoming death, \u201cI think you will have seen that most of the exhibition is about life,\u201d Patch notes. \u201cAnd that is what all of these deities were about. Even in overcoming death, it was about living forever.\u201d",

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Ace Frehley (April 27, 1951-Oct. 16, 2025) was a founding member and lead guitarist of the rock band Kiss, whose theatrical makeup, costumes and stagecraft made them a leading proponent of glam rock in the 1970s and '80s.",
      "Born Paul Daniel Frehley into a musical family, he played guitar since age 13, and performed with bands around New York City. At 18 he was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix.",
      "In 1973 Frehley joined with singer-guitarist Paul Stanley, bassist Gene Simmons and drummer Peter Criss to form Kiss. Their earliest albums did not sell well, but their stage antics \u2014 replete with pyrotechnics and stage blood, and guitars that emitted smoke during solos \u2014 earned them a following. By 1976 their albums \"Destroyer\" and \"Rock and Roll Over\" went platinum, and 1977's \"Love Gun\" hit #4 on the Billboard chart.",
      "Frehley frequently feuded with fellow band members Stanley and Simmons, and left Kiss in 1982.",
      "He performed both as a solo artist and with his band, Frehley's Comet, before rejoining Kiss in the mid-1990s, reclaiming his persona of \"The Spaceman,\" or \"Space Ace.\" He stayed until 2002, when he resumed recording solo and with Frehley's Comet.",
      "The original members of Kiss were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.",
      "In 2024 Frehley told Guitar World magazine, \"I'm always flattered when people tell me I influenced them. If I knew I was going to influence thousands of guitar players, I would have practiced more!\u00a0 I laugh, but that's the truth. \u2026 I've had so many players come up to me and say, 'You are the reason I play guitar,' and I'm always like, 'Wow.'\""

      "The band added: He was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of human. A true legend of legends. And his spirit will live forever in every groove, every stage, every memory.\"",
      "Fred Durst, the band's frontman and lead vocalist, posted a video Sunday morning that recounted how they met at a club in Jacksonville Beach, Florida, and went on to musical stardom and performances around the globe. Durst said he has shed \"gallons and gallons of tears since yesterday.\"",

      "\"Vagabond: A Memoir\" by Tim Curry",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Introduction",
      "\"Honey, you're the third Tim Curry to call today,\" she said, and hung up the phone.",
      "It was the spring of 1976. By an extraordinary coincidence, I had recently moved into a great apartment right behind the Waverly cinema, in New York's Greenwich Village. The Waverly was the flagship of several key venues that were experiencing success with a little film called The Rocky Horror Picture Show, whose new life had only just taken off.",
      "I'd been in the stage adaptation, and we'd had an extraordinary run in London and Los Angeles. But when the film was released in 1975, it had bombed rather spectacularly. Less than a year later, it was going through a sort of renaissance, due to some genius marketing and raucous audience participation.",
      "Naturally, I was curious, however hesitant, about this new incarnation. I'd called a day ahead of time, to let them know that I was a member of the cast and to ask if they would be so kind as to reserve a few tickets for my friends and me.",
      "\"And who are you?\" the woman asked. Her accent was rather aggressive and I caught the distinct whiff of exaggerated boredom in her tone.",
      "\"This is Tim Curry.\"",
      "That was when I was informed of the previous two Tims. The receiver dinged, and the line went dead.",
      "I stared at the phone, both bemused and irate by her response. Ultimately, my friends and I showed up anyway (with identification). We didn't wear special costumes or anything like that \u2014 I'm not inclined to do so unless it's required or earned. Luckily, as much renewed success as the show was now having, it wasn't terribly difficult to get tickets. We went in and sat toward the back of the theater. I was far more interested in viewing the spectacle than in participating, and the crowd's engagement was a true delight to behold.",
      "Before long, people started noticing me. A group of girls came up to my seat, giggling, touched my arm or leg, then tittered as they dispersed. It was all rather surreal, especially with the film, the fevered audience participation, and the all-too- familiar music carrying on in the background.",
      "Unintentionally, I'd created a stir among the already animated audience. About a half hour into the film, the woman from the ticket booth of the Waverly \u2014 a slightly bedraggled, very unlikely blonde \u2014 hustled down the aisle and pulled me out of my seat.",
      "\"You are an imposter,\" she hissed. \"You must leave. You're a nightmare! And you are not Tim Curry at all \u2014 you don't even look like him!\" She pointed at the screen, her long red fingernail trembling with emphasis.",
      "I stood up slowly and, with a mixture of embarrassment and triumph (neither of which were particularly founded), I handed her my passport.",
      "She snatched it, squinted at the photo, looked back at my face, then back at the passport. In the flickering light, I watched her haughty expression collapse. Speechless, she seemed to sort of melt in front of me, evoking a wicked witch who had been assaulted by a bucket of water.",
      "Aware I was now on a stage of sorts, I steadied myself and waited for her response.",
      "\"Ohhh my God. Oh, Mr. Curry. I didn't ... Please just ... please sit down.\"",
      "I took my passport back and gestured to my friends.",
      "\"I wouldn't dream of it!\" I said, and promptly strode out of the cinema.",
      "By definition \u2014 as one who has professionally pretended or masqueraded onstage, onscreen, and into a microphone \u2014 there is an argument to be made that I have been a career imposter for most of my life.",
      "But if you ask me, there's a much better word for my vocation and identity, a word that carries me back to my earliest days.",
      "Vagabond.",
      "Vagabonds rove. We travel about and pick up work wherever we go. We wander, drift, stagger, wink. Reluctant to be pinned down, we're enticed by risk, restless if we linger, fueled by curiosity and a sense of wonder.",
      "Vagabonds learn, often from a young age, that indeed time is fleeting. As is fame \u2014 a fairly worthless pursuit, really. We are less startled by life's unpredictable shifts than those who choose to remain safe and settled. We often practice our trade in varied locations.",
      "Those of us with itinerant upbringings or similar proclivities often have no choice but to adapt and reinvent ourselves. Over and over and over again. We rely on charming exteriors and don't mind saying so, leading us to project an inflated sense of self-confidence. We feel deeply but are perhaps less inclined to express our true selves to others \u2014 because our relationships so often prove to be ephemeral.",
      "Of course, these qualities don't apply to all vagabonds. I'm not sure they'll apply to me tomorrow. But it feels about right today.",
      "In Shakespearean times, people of the stage were considered rogues and vagabonds. I always rather liked that. I presume that such labels came about because of actors assuming manifold identities, traveling from one town to the next in pursuit of new audiences and a bit of coin here and there. How can you trust somebody, or truly know somebody, who appears as a king one day and a jester the next? What does it mean when neither role is the true identity of the person, and when that very person might be gone the next day? These entertainers with ever-changing faces and varied costumes were presumed to be scoundrels, not regarded as honorable or honest members of society.",
      "That part doesn't define me, of course.",
      "I'm very trustworthy.",
      "You believe me, don't you?",
      "Over the course of my life, my vagabond blues, hopes, and highs have found their way into varied channels of expression, different creative boxes from which flashes of my real self could emerge. Through my songs. Delivered upon the stage. Exhibited on screens. Cultivated in my homes and gardens. Re-envisioned, attached to, and filtered through more voices and personas than I can recall.",
      "Much of this book has involved returning to those characters, the ones who defined my professional life. As there is a piece of me who either exists in or understands each of the roles we'll be revisiting, surveying them together will hopefully yield a colorful, curious mosaic of who I am, beneath the cosmetics and costumes.",
      "Looking in the rearview mirror is neither my instinct nor my preferred way of being. I'd rather get on with it and keep moving forward. I have never been one to dwell on past performances any more than is required. I do not snatch memorabilia from my films to keep it displayed around my house like glistening ashes. I find little reward lingering in nostalgia. Living gig to gig for the better (and worse) part of half a century, I have grown accustomed to appreciating and accepting lessons offered, then looking forward to the next challenge.",
      "That's the vagabond's way.",
      "And yet, it hasn't escaped my notice that others have jumped at the opportunity to make their own assumptions. I have been described as everything from a confounding sex symbol, to a home designer, to a rock 'n' roll singer, to an imposter, to the prince of Halloween, to a paralyzed tragic case, to a dead legend.",
      "Contrary to village gossip, I am still very much alive.",
      "So, while that remains the case, I believe it's my turn \u2014 and my privilege \u2014 to malign my own reputation.",
      "Why expose myself now? After all, I'm quite comfortable in the shade, and it would be easy enough to remain there. But with time, the thought of sharing my story stayed on my mind and felt just risky enough to intrigue me as a creative pursuit. I've also developed increasing respect for the characters I've played over the course of my life, characters about whom I've spent no small amount of time answering (and avoiding) questions.",
      "More than anything, the challenges presented to me by being alive, by the pandemic, and by sundry health issues have offered an appalling amount of time to reflect. Strewn amid those reflections has been a recurring fantastical notion: Maybe it's time to write my story. Before I could even finish musing about what that might mean, self-doubt had persistently reared up, chuckling malevolently: You've got a nerve.",
      "I'm prone to heed that voice, which has so often intervened, posing the deceptively simple question: Who do you think you are?",
      "However, as loud and obstructive as that voice has been throughout my life, generations of you (yes, you) have continued to flatter me with curiosity and kind attention. In doing so, you have given me permission to mute my self-deprecating instincts \u2014 or at least to hold them at bay.",
      "Today, I am physically unable to take you on a vigorous vagabond's adventure, due to a stroke I endured in 2012 that has limited my capacity as an active tour guide. But my mind and most of my memories have remained intact, and within them exist a multitude of journeys perhaps worth sharing. Before I can no longer be bothered to recount them, I humbly invite you into my stories of living across various environments: seaside living, country living, city living; on the road, on the stage, crossing borders and blurring them, ever in a vagabond state. I've loved inhabiting most of those settings, and \u2014 with some notable exceptions \u2014 enjoy remembering the times I've had.",
      "You should know what you're in for, however.",
      "I'd hate to leave you dissatisfied.",
      "Before we raise the curtains, before the elevator descends, know this:",
      "This will not be a master class. I have stories to impart, not explicit lessons to teach. You may glean profound takeaways from where I've been, how I got there, whom I've met, what I've done, or how I finagled my way into repeatedly being cast as an irresistible villain. Even so, my words are not meant to serve as instructions on how to act, sing, become a voiceover artist, or remain resilient in the face of unforeseen physical hardship. In part, because I do not believe that I have mastered any of those things. Furthermore, since I was a young boy, I've been dubious of anyone who claims to be an authority. Far be it for me to adopt an expert's stance now.",
      "I must also warn (or assure) you that while there are scraps of my nature in all of my characters, I am none of them. That sentence feels too ludicrously obvious to put in writing, but the distinctions between who I really am and who I've pretended to be as an actor have proven to be a source of great disappointment to some audiences. It has not caused me much personal distress, beyond the periodic necessity to deter stalkers.",
      "Nor will this be a juicy Hollywood tell-all. Not because my moral compass won't allow it, or because I haven't had ample run-ins with juicy celebrities \u2014 but simply because I find such books immensely dull and highly susceptible to gathering dust.",
      "I also won't be dishing out lurid details of my love affairs. I guarantee you, if it matters, that I have experienced true love, true heartbreak, and everything in between, including no small amount of wreckage. Which, naturally, helps inform who I am. I have loved and been loved and I hope you have, too. But I'm not interested in your romances. And specifics about my affairs of the heart or the bedroom are \u2014 respectfully \u2014 none of your f***ing business.",
      "With those caveats taken care of, I sincerely hope you enjoy the escapades, illusions, and contradictions I've collected recklessly over the course of my vagabond days.",
      "I trust you're now shivering with antici - I'll play along; I'll SAY IT - pation ...",
      "Let's get on with it.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Oct 2025 10:10:12 -0400",
    "summary": "After the deaths of his mother and father, actor-director Ben Stiller sought to pay tribute as few sons could: a documentary about their lives on-stage and off. But even he didn't anticipate to what depths his film, \"Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost,\" would go.",
    "story": [
      "A-List actor and director Ben Stiller knows a good story when he sees one, so he knew profiling his late parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, would be compelling. But even he had no idea how deep it would take him. \"No, I didn't!\" he laughed. \"I mean, I didn't know where it was gonna go.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara had been the husband-and-wife comedy team of the 1960s and '70s, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" 36 times. But for Ben and sister Amy, Stiller & Meara were also Mom & Dad \u2013 and that could get confusing.",
      "Stiller's new Apple TV documentary, \"Stiller & Meara\" Nothing Is Lost,\" examines how his parents navigated both roles.",
      "Married 62 years, their family life was shaped by Jerry's relentless ambition, and Anne's resentment doing comedy when her dream was to be a serious actress \u2013 and the drinking that followed. As Ben noted in his film, \"She had to go up there and do that act, because she was so good at it. But it wasn't really her true thing, you know? It wasn't her true happiness.\"",
      "The film is an adult's attempt to answer the complicated question that shaped his childhood: Where did the act end, and the marriage begin?",
      "In one archival interview, Jerry Stiller calls his wife \"the funniest woman in the world off stage and on stage. Now the thing is, when she does these funny things, I am an exploiter and opportunist, and I'll take a pencil and I'll start to write it down.\"",
      "Anne Meara picks up: \"He says we can use that on a show, and I'm ready to kill him! Again, where does the act end and the marriage begin?\"",
      "Ben Stiller said, \"There's so much footage and material and things to show of the good and the bad and the tension and the happy times. I felt it was really important to try to have a balance in the film that would relay to the audience what the reality was of their relationship, which was, I think, grounded in love.\"",
      "From 2010: Stiller & Meara on love and marriage (\"Sunday Morning\")",
      "It wasn't just old clips from long-ago shows that Stiller had access to. He stumbled into some unexpected help while cleaning out the family apartment to sell: Jerry Stiller had secretly taped everything, producing boxes and boxes of recordings. \"I had no idea that there were these sort of arguments and discussions that he had recorded,\" said Ben. \"All of it, I'd never heard before. It brought me back to being a kid in the house when they were working together.\"",
      "For a filmmaker trying to figure it all out, Ben Stiller had struck gold.",
      "Among the recordings was a conversation in which his father talks to his mother about her drinking, and confronts her about it.",
      "I asked, \"Was it important to you in terms of understanding your dad, that you could hear him do that?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ben. \"I was like, 'Oh, okay. He really did speak to her about it.' Because as kids that was never anything we talked about.\"",
      "\"You may be carrying around this sense of, why didn't dad ever confront mom? Guess what \u2013 he did.\"",
      "\"Right! He did,\" said Ben. \"And it changed.\"",
      "This deconstruction of his parents' marriage came while Stiller was wrestling with his own mid-life issues. Separated at the time from his wife, actress Christine Taylor (with whom he later reconciled), Stiller describes himself as having felt out of balance and unhappy, disconnected from his family, and a little bit lost.",
      "He talked about the irony of thinking he was doing so much better than his parents: \"When you're younger, you think, Okay, I'm gonna do everything better. I'm not gonna make THAT mistake. I found myself at a place in my life where things weren't really in sync.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara now had some company under the magnifying glass: their son. \"I didn't want to pretend to be some sort of objective judge of their relationship when I had so many issues in my own relationships and my stuff,\" he said,",
      "Was that a challenging journey to make himself? \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Then it changed everything because it was like, oh, okay. I'm gonna have to, you know, talk about my own feelings! It's stuff that I don't really ever, you know, talk about.\"",
      "Not exactly where he expected to end up, when he started the project. In honest, raw, and revealing conversations with his daughter Ella and son Quin, Ben talked in the film about his own issues being the child of someone famous: \"I remember there was this one time I literally was on the street talking to him about the fact that I felt like he didn't pay enough attention to us, and while we were talking someone on the street came over and said, 'Jerry, I love you work' and he started talking [to them]!\"",
      "Stiller exposes the excruciating challenge of breaking patterns, when his son adds: \"That's hilarious, because just a few weeks ago we were all out at a restaurant and I'd been stressed about college stuff. And then the people there wanted to get a picture of you, and I remember I was so frustrated, like, the world just has to stop to get this picture.\"",
      "Stiller said, \"I was genuinely surprised when he told me that. As a filmmaker I thought, This is an interesting moment in the movie.\"",
      "\"As a father?\" I asked.",
      "\"As a father I was like, Oh, s***,\" he laughed.",
      "Ben Stiller has done something requiring more courage than simply making an honest movie about loved ones; he's made an honest movie about himself.",
      "I said, \"One of the most uncomfortable places you can ever be is the mirror, right? Sometimes your kids are holding up the mirror.\"",
      "\"Yeah, you know, it's kind of like \u2026 it is a bummer, 'cause I'm never gonna get to go back, you know?\" Stiller said.",
      "And that's helped him round the edges from his own childhood \u2013 finding the grace to give his parents by understanding he might need to seek some of his own.",
      "Asked where he stands in his relationship to his parents, Stiller replied, \"I don't know!\"",
      "\"All this work, and you don't know?\"",
      "\"Well, I mean, they're still not here. That was the sad thing for me about finishing the movie. It was like, Oh, now I don't have an excuse to kind of just be connecting with them here.\"",
      "I asked, \"This was an intense reconnection when it sounds like you needed it the most?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Stiller. \"Like my mom probably would have said, like, 'Yeah, go make a movie about it if you wanna figure out how to process your feelings!'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Oct 2025 09:40:15 -0400",
    "summary": "The star of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" \"Clue\" and \"It\" has played roles campy, comical, and menacingly sinister, yet his most inscrutable role is still Tim Curry. He talks about his memoir \"Vagabond,\" the stroke he suffered in 2012, and learning how to speak again.",
    "story": [
      "A stroke 13 years ago left Tim Curry partially paralyzed, but it hasn't diminished his memorable laugh, or the mystique about him. In 50 years on the screen, he's played so many types \u2013 campy, comical, menacingly sinister \u2013 yet his most inscrutable role is still Tim Curry.",
      "And being an enigma is exactly how he wants it. \"I think it's important,\" he said. \"I encourage it.\"",
      "Though Curry is out with a new memoir, \"Vagabond\" (to be published Tuesday by Grand Central), he's keeping some secrets to himself. \"One of the keys is to not encourage an identity, I think, and I've tried to nurse that,\" he said. \"I have protected that, and continue to.\"",
      "Born a military brat in Hong Kong, Curry grew up moving from place to place. As a boy, he worshipped his dad, a chaplain in the British Royal Navy. The last time he saw his father, when he was 10, was when his dad had a stroke: \"And as they were about to take him into the ambulance, he said, 'Look after your mother.'\"",
      "After his father's death, there was no one to buffer the impact of his mother, who would be kind one minute, then cruel the next. \"I actually think now that she was probably bipolar, because she could turn on a dime,\" Curry said.",
      "Acting offered him an escape from his mother's moods \u2013 and access to so different many different lives. He said what excited him about acting was \"the freedom of being somebody else, and I think that I was (like everybody else) drawn to the idea of fame probably, although I came to kind of rather despise it.\"",
      "His first nibble of notoriety came from his first paid gig, in the 1969 London production of \"Hair.\" It was a big deal, but nothing in comparison to what came next: \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" first on stage, then the movie. He joked that he got the part of Dr. Frank-N-Furter because of his legs. It was a transformative performance, for Curry, and the audience.",
      "Curry says what made the role unique was his power: \"He gave a lot of teenagers permission to be different, and I'm very happy that he did have that power.\"",
      "\"Rocky Horror\" earned Curry stardom. It did not earn praise, or even respect, from his mother. She lived well into her son's success, but \"she didn't make much of it,\" Curry said. \"She was scared of it.\"",
      "Why? \"Well, she said to me later that, 'I thought your head was gonna grow too big.' She would have preferred me to operate under the radar!\"",
      "He laughed: \"I never did. I didn't give a s*** about the radar!\"",
      "I asked, \"When Frank is committing his particularly most heinous act in 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' [killing Eddie with an axe], was some of that directed at your mom maybe?\"",
      "\"It's not directed at her, it's just channeling,\" Curry replied.",
      "\"Rocky Horror\" set up Curry to play some memorable screen villains \u2013 under a mountain of prosthetics in \"Legend,\" opposite Tom Cruise; as Pennywise in the Stephen King thriller \"It\"; and as Carol Burnett's scheming and duplicitous brother in \"Annie.\" \"I loved her to bits,\" Curry said of Burnett.",
      "And don't forget the hotel concierge in \"Home Alone 2,\" and the manipulative butler in \"Clue.\"",
      "But then came 2012, and the moment that changed Tim Curry's life. \"It was so strange,\" he said. \"I was actually having a massage, and the guy who was giving me a massage said, 'I'm worried about you. I think we should call a doctor.' I felt fine. I had no symptoms that I was aware of. I wasn't in pain.\"",
      "But he was taken to the hospital, where he learned he'd had a stroke. \"I though immediately of my dad. So, I was scared,\" he said.",
      "He then underwent invasive brain surgery, and had rehabilitation to learn how to speak again. \"That was very weird,\" he said. \"I hated not being able to speak.\"",
      "He also has paralysis on his left side. \"My face kind of went sideways,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"From reading the book, and from talking to the people here who care about you, there hasn't been a lot \u2013 I'm sure there was some self-pity, but it doesn't sound like there was a lot?\"",
      "\"I don't think so,\" Curry said. \"I hope not, because I don't admire self-pity much. Another legacy from my mother, I guess. It's one that I'm thankful for: Why are you so important that we have to pity you?\"",
      "Now 79, he's reached an age he didn't think he'd see back in 2012. Today, he's not remotely afraid of dying \u2013 though exactly what he means remains, fittingly, a mystery.",
      "\"I don't fear death,\" he said. \"I try to avoid it, as I think we all do! But I suspect that in the end, I will welcome it.\"",
      "And what does that mean? \"Well, I think it may be very comforting to go bye-bye \u2013 and I want to earn it!\" he laughed.",

    "story": [
      "Britain's Prince Andrew will not use his royal titles, including the Duke of York, any longer, he said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace on Friday. The announcement comes after the release of excerpts from a posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had repeatedly claimed to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to Andrew.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "He continued: \"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, sued Andrew in 2021, alleging that he forced her to engage in sexual acts against her will when she was 17 years old. The two reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022. Andrew has denied the allegations.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Guiffre's family said they believe Prince Andrew's decision to give up his royal titles is \"vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere.\" They called on Charles to strip him of the title of prince.",
      "\"This moment serves as victory for Virginia, who consistently maintained, 'He knows what happened, I know what happened, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me,'\" the statement said. \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by Epstein and his co-conspirators.\"",
      "Giuffre was one of the most vocal accusers of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of helping Epstein groom, recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Giuffre alleged Maxwell connected her with Epstein, which Maxwell denies.",
      "In an excerpt of her memoir published by The Guardian, Giuffre describes her alleged encounters with Andrew in detail.",
      "\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\"",
      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has long been a source of tabloid fodder because of his links to Epstein, other questionable characters and money woes.",
      "His attempt to refute Giuffre's allegations backfired during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals \u2014 such as disputing Giuffre's recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring \u2014 and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.",
      "Within days of the interview, Andrew stepped down from his royal duties.",
      "As well as no longer being known as the Duke of York, Andrew will also give up other titles: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.",
      "He will remain a prince, which he has been entitled to since birth."

    "summary": "The Grand Sumo Tournament is rumbling London's iconic Royal Albert Hall in a rare foreign foray for Japan's centuries-old sport.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The world of professional sumo wrestling stepped outside of Japan for only the second time in its centuries-long history on Wednesday night, as fighters clashed on a specially constructed ring in the middle of London's Royal Albert Hall.",
      "The iconic venue in the British capital is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the roughly 1,500-year-old sport's most important competition\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for the second time, drawing more than 44 professional wrestlers, or rikishi, to compete in 100 bouts over five days. The only other time the tournament was held outside Japan was in 1991, when it also came to the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "There are unique challenges in bringing sumo to London, as the contemporary national sport of Japan is rooted in two millennia of tradition, interwoven with the Shinto religion, and thus treated with the utmost respect and protection to ensure adherence to its rituals and norms.",
      "\"One of the things that we've worked really hard at is to make sure that we have a good understanding of the cultural and religious significance that sumo has,\" Matthew Todd, the Royal Albert Hall's programming director, told CBS News.",
      "He said attention to detail was \"really critical to the authentic presentation that we're able to make here.\"",
      "That meant shipping 11 tons of clay from Japan to construct the ring, or dohyo, in the center of the concert venue, where the wrestlers compete. Shipping containers were at sea for three months making the voyage. A big team of ring attendants (yobidashi), also had to make the trip from Japan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0alongside 11 interpreters to help them communicate with British workers.",
      "The roof for the dohyo, now suspended from the Albert Hall ceiling, was built in Britain, but its design is taken straight from traditional Japanese Shinto shrines, which, according to Todd, \"helps to show that this is a sacred area,\" in which routines and holy ceremonies are conducted as part of the tournament.",
      "It's a vital step, he said, to ensure the Shinto gods are paid their due respects before the fights.",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Sumo is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture and religion in ways that many Western sports fans may find difficult to comprehend. According to legend, it originated as a ritual to ask the gods for a bountiful harvest, but it transformed over almost 2,000 years into the sport it is today, drawing competitors still primarily from Japan, but also from around the world.",
      "Many of the most recent champions have been from Mongolia, and this year's tournament features two rikishi from Ukraine. While Americans have competed successfully in past tournaments, there are no U.S. rikishi competing in this year's event in London.",
      "The nuance of the wrestling competition itself can also be difficult to fully grasp, with 82 winning techniques called kimarite, numerous ranks and divisions and a host of other rules. So to help translate all this for a largely Western audience, in-ear English language commentary is provided at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside video replay screens to describe and explain the bouts, which can sometimes end in just seconds when a competitor is forced out of the ring.",
      "The wrestlers themselves live an incredibly regimented life. They are forbidden from driving cars and, somewhat counterintuitively, eating breakfast, and are normally required to take a long nap after their hefty lunch, to help them pack on the pounds.",
      "The average weight of a rikishi is about 330 pounds, but some tip the scales at 550.",
      "They have been given some leave during their visit to the British capital to enjoy themselves, however\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with organizers likely seeing the value in some degree of publicity.",
      "During the lead-up to the tournament, social media platforms were full of photos and videos of the traditionally kimono-clad wrestlers sightseeing around London.",
      "The Albert Hall will also be graced this week by the presence of two yokozuna, the highest ranking of all sumo wrestlers. The word yokozuna is generally translated as grand champion, but it translates literally to \"horizontal rope,\" in a reference to the special rope worn around their waists to display their rank.",
      "Once a rikishi is promoted to the rank of yokozuna, they keep it until retirement. In nearly 400 years of professional sumo, only 75 men have attained the vaunted grand champion status. The honor typically requires not only multiple consecutive championship wins, but approval by a dedicated council that judges rikishi on their wrestling skills, but also a range of other personal attributes.",
      "The tournament is due to end on Sunday, when the wrestler with the most victories in the ring will be crowned this year's champion.",
      "The field is considered wide open this year, but many, especially back at home in Japan, will be hoping for 25-year-old Yokozuna Onosato, the country's first grand champion in almost a decade, to emerge victorious."

The magnitude of his passing is of epic proportions, and beyond comprehension. Reflecting on all of his incredible life achievements, Ace's memory will continue to live on forever!\"",
      "Frehley's former Kiss bandmates, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, said in a statement they were \"devastated\" by Frehley's passing.",
      "\"He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history,\" the two said. \"He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy.

Doctors advised Frehley not to travel following his fall, Ostrosky said.",
      "Born in 1951 in the Bronx, Frehley grew up surrounded by music and received his first electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.",
      "Frehley co-founded Kiss in 1973 alongside Stanley, Simmons and Peter Criss. He played on many of Kiss' classic albums, including \"Destroyer,\" \"Rock and Roll Over\" and \"Love Gun.\" Today, Kiss has more gold albums than any other American band and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.",
      "Kiss, whose hits include \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" and \"Detroit Rock City,\" was known for its intense stage shows, which included fireworks, smoke and eruptions of fake blood performed by band members in black-and-white painted faces, platform boots and black wigs.",
      "Band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters \u2014 Frehley was known as \"Space Ace\" and the \"Spaceman.\" The New York-born entertainer often experimented with pyrotechnics, making his guitars glow, emit smoke and shoot rockets from the headstock.",
      "The band was extremely popular, especially in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to sell numerous products. \"Beth\" was its biggest commercial hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1976.",
      "Frehley later released his first solo album, \"Ace Frehley,\" in 1978, and his song \"New York Groove\" quickly became a hit. Frehley frequently feuded with Stanley and Simmons through the years and left Kiss in 1982 to form the band Frehley's Comet and later continued recording under his own name.",
      "In 1996, Frehley rejoined Kiss for their 1996 reunion tour but left again in the early 2000s. The band continued with replacement members wearing the Frehley and Criss makeup and costumes. Kiss performed a\u00a0farewell tour in 2023.",
      "When the original four entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, a dispute scrapped plans for them to perform. Simmons and Stanley objected to Criss and Frehley being inducted instead of then-guitarist Tommy Thayer and then-drummer Eric Singer.",
      "Simmons told Rolling Stone magazine that year that Frehley and Criss \"no longer deserve to wear the paint.\" \"The makeup is earned,\" he added. \"Just being there at the beginning is not enough.\"",
      "Frehley and Kiss also had a huge influence on the glammy style of 1980s so-called hair metal bands, including M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison.",

      "The Emmy Award-winning star of \"The Bear\" plays the lead role in \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" out Oct. 24. The biopic strips away the stadium rock legend to reveal a deeply human artist.",
      "\"I don't remember a time I didn't know the name Bruce Springsteen,\" White said.",
      "White had no experience singing or playing guitar before taking on the role, but that didn't stop director Scott Cooper \u2014 or Bruce Springsteen himself \u2014 from believing in him.",
      "After a call with Cooper, where White learned that Springsteen personally wanted him for the part, White said he felt an immediate sense of confidence. Knowing that Springsteen had seen his work and believed in his ability, he decided to take a leap of faith and fully commit to the transformation.",
      "Preparing for the role meant months of intense training, from vocal work to learning guitar. White said he found unexpected confidence through the music itself.",
      "\"I sang his songs over and over and over again,\" he said.",
      "Springsteen served as an important resource throughout the project. White said their conversations went beyond the film itself, touching on personal experiences and emotional challenges. During one discussion, Springsteen shared a story about a road trip and a moment at a county fair when he suffered a panic attack. He described feeling detached, as if he were merely observing his own life, a realization that deeply resonated with White, who had faced similar feelings himself.",
      "Through those exchanges, Springsteen encouraged White to bring his own emotions and perspective to the role, allowing him to fully inhabit the character with authenticity and vulnerability.",
      "One of the most meaningful exchanges came when Springsteen gave White something invaluable: freedom.",
      "\"One of the most beautiful things he did was really give me permission to bring myself to it,\" White said.",
      "Capturing the humanity behind \"The Boss\"",
      "Cooper shaped the story around the creation of Springsteen's \"Nebraska\" album, a period the musician described as one of the darkest in his life. The film explores his battles with depression and his complicated relationship with his father, who suffered from schizophrenia.",
      "Springsteen remained closely involved in the production, visiting the set several times but allowing the filmmakers full creative space. Cooper said his presence was supportive rather than intrusive and said that Springsteen made it clear he would step back if needed. White recalled being aware that Springsteen was on set but said it never broke his focus.",
      "Springsteen later praised White for his performance, calling it \"a deeply intuitive, psychological portrait\" of his younger self, a compliment that left the actor stunned.",
      "\"I still can't believe, you know, I don't know. I still can't believe we got started. I can't believe he gave our blessing in the first place,\" White said.",
      "Premiering at the Telluride Film Festival, the film earned praise from psychologists for its emotional depth and its potential to spark conversations about mental health, especially among men.",
      "Cooper described it as more than just a biopic, saying his hope is that audiences see it as a call for compassion and connection.",
      "\"I suppose if there's anything that I want this film for people to take away from the film, it's if you're struggling, if you're despairing and if you don't know how to get help, can't afford help, ask,\" Cooper said."

      "Wahlberg said it was hard to say goodbye to \"Blue Bloods,\" but that he eventually saw \"Boston Blue\" as an \"opportunity to keep family, faith and tradition on TV, to tell a story of a law enforcement family, and to keep the Reagans alive in this new world with an amazing new cast and an amazing new partner.\"",
      "Martin-Green, who previously starred in \"Star Trek: Discovery\" and \"The Walking Dead,\" said she drew on her experience working within major television franchises.",
      "\"I just couldn't have expected it. I didn't think 'Star Trek: Discovery' would come after 'Walking Dead,' and I certainly didn't think another beloved TV franchise would come after 'Star Trek: Discovery.' So, I've learned a lot about doing that, about building new iterations of beloved franchises,\" she said.",

      "\"She really brings so much to the table in that experience, but also in her talent,\" Wahlberg said. \"The show is, you know, it's a universe show. It's a spinoff. However you want to refer to it. But it is a new world as well. Danny is a fish out of water and he meets someone that really is one of the reasons he stays. Not that it's romantic or anything, but he meets an equal.\"",
      "He described their working relationship as collaborative.",
      "\"We lean on each other. We talk to each other constantly. We are constantly working for the success of this show,\" Wahlberg said.",
      "\"Boston Blue\" premieres Friday at 10 p.m. on CBS and will stream on Paramount+."

    "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 13:57:50 -0400",
    "summary": "With open enrollment starting soon, employees could get sticker shock, with their costs expected to rise 6% to 7% for 2026, a new study says.",
    "story": [
      "Open enrollment \u2014 the annual window when employees can adjust their benefits \u2014 may deliver sticker shock this year. Workers are likely to pay between 6% to 7% more for their 2026 employer-sponsored health insurance, more than double the current rate of inflation, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from consultant Mercer.",
      "That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that four in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24."

The number of high protein shakes and drinks on the market rose by 122% from 2020 to 2024, Innova Market Insights reported, noting that Gen Z is driving most of the online chatter around the beverages.",
      "Chains like Starbucks, Dutch Bros, Smoothie King and others recently introduced protein-packed options and add-ons to their menus. PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta also said protein would be a big focus for the company, telling investors in July that \"consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case in a few months back, a few years back.\"",
      "Protein, an essential nutrient, certainly has health benefits.",
      "\"It's the building block of your bones, muscles and other organs, and getting enough is crucial for keeping your body working properly,\" Christine Byrne, a registered dietitian and owner of Ruby Oak Nutrition, said.",
      "Ansari noted it also helps to build enzymes, support hormone health and provide a structural component to hair, skin and nails.",
      "But \"today's wellness culture tends to overestimate the amount of protein most people actually need,\" Byrne said.",
      "Ideally the source of your protein is whole foods, instead of powders and supplements, registered dietitian Helen Tieu said.",
      "Consumer Reports recently found some protein powders and shakes contain high levels of lead. A total of 23 protein powders and shakes were tested as part of their investigation, which determined that more than two-thirds of the products contained unsafe levels of lead.",
      "\"For people who are able to reach their protein targets from whole foods, protein powders and supplements are not necessary,\" Tieu said. \"Limit protein powder intake to an occasional use when necessary. Whole foods also provide more nutrients and keep us full for longer, compared to an isolated protein powder supplement.\"",
      "For some people \u2014 including those with certain medical conditions or competitive athletes \u2014 protein supplements can be more crucial, Byrne said.",
      "\"Although I'd caveat that this generally isn't the case for everyday exercisers, even those who hit the gym or the trail daily,\" she said.",
      "How much protein is really needed in a diet?",
      "For growing children and adolescents, protein provides the building blocks for muscle, bones, skin and hormones. Getting enough protein is also essential for older adults. It can help preserve strength, maintain bone density and reduce the risk of age-related injury.",
      "Government guidelines suggest most adults aim for about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. For example, someone who weighs 150 lbs would need about 54 grams of protein \u2014 this is what's in about 6 ounces of cooked chicken breast, Byrne said.",
      "\"We want to look for high quality sources,\" Ansari said. \"So those are generally speaking animal protein. Now another way to do this is by combining beans and grains and making it a full meal.\"",
      "Byrne said you can calculate your estimated protein needs by consuming 0.36 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight.",
      "\"That calculation is an oversimplification, and many people need more protein than this. But the idea that you need to slam a protein shake before and after every workout just to meet your needs and reach your goals is totally wrong,\" she said.",
      "High-protein foods",
      "\"To boost protein intake from whole foods, make sure to include protein at every meal, and aim for a minimum of 20 grams per meal to boost muscle protein synthesis,\" Tieu suggests.",

      "The scientist, one of hundreds of CDC employees terminated by the Trump administration last week, asked that her identity be concealed for fear of retribution.",
      "\"It's going to mean more deaths, more preventable deaths,\" she told CBS News on Wednesday of the layoffs. \"People will absolutely die from the impact of this administration.\"",
      "The scientist worked at the CDC for the past decade, studying chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.",
      "She spoke out the same day a federal judge in Northern California issued a verbal order temporarily halting all the government layoffs that were issued since the shutdown began. This was in response to a lawsuit brought by federal employees' unions.",
      "\"They went in and fired entire programs, even statutorily mandated by law programs, they cut entirely,\" she said. \"So there is no staff to do this work anymore.\"",
      "She said everything she was working on has come to a complete stop.",
      "\"It's truly like an episode of 'Squid Games,' because we don't know what's going to happen next,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has used the government shutdown, now in its third week, to lay off more than 4,000 federal workers, and plans to go further, according to Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.",
      "\"I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000,\" Vought said Wednesday during an appearance on \"The Charlie Kirk Show.\"",
      "Since last week, the Trump administration has informed approximately 600 CDC employees they have been laid off.",
      "On Tuesday, internal CDC officials not authorized to speak to the media told CBS News that on Oct. 10, about 1,000 CDC employees were initially given reduction-in-force notices, a government term for layoffs.",
      "However, within about 24 hours, hundreds of those notices were rescinded, reducing the total number of layoffs in the agency since Oct. 10 to about 600, the officials said.",
      "The judge's ruling Wednesday would put the layoffs of those 600 employees on hold, leaving them in limbo while the case plays out.",
      "According to numbers provided by a congressional source familiar with the cuts, the 600 CDC layoffs impacted all staff in the CDC's offices in Washington, D.C., all staff for the office of the director for the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, all staff for the National Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Public Health Infrastructure and Workforce, and all policy and communications staff for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.",
      "The CDC agencies that saw their layoffs rescinded, according to the source, were the Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Center, the Global Health Center, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report team, the Epidemic Intelligence Service, and scientists working on responses to outbreaks of measles in the U.S. and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "So far this year, the CDC has lost about 3,000 employees to resignations and layoffs, or just under a quarter of its staff, according to AFGE Local 2883, the union that represents CDC employees. That number was confirmed by the CDC officials who spoke to CBS News.",
      "The CDC has been beset by changes since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the reins of the Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year. A vaccine skeptic, Kennedy controversially replaced all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a panel that makes vaccine recommendations.",
      "And in August, less than a month after being confirmed by the Senate as CDC director, Susan Monarez was fired from her post over what she said was pressure from Kennedy to rubber-stamp his vaccine directives, later testifying before the Senate that Kennedy's demands were \"inconsistent with my oath of office and the ethics required of a public official.\" Her firing also prompted several top CDC officials to resign in protest.",
      "Kennedy, in his own Senate testimony last month, denied that he pressured Monarez to preapprove vaccination recommendations. He told senators that when he asked Monarez if she was \"a trustworthy person,\" she responded, \"no.\"",
      "The congressional source also confirmed that among the permanent layoffs in HHS last week were 41 people in the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, an agency under the U.S. Public Health Service whose staff works in biodefense, as well as monitors data on natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks and cyberattacks on hospitals.",
      "An HHS spokesperson told CBS News on Wednesday that the department's layoffs are part of an effort to cut a \"bloated bureaucracy,\" and that the positions were deemed \"non-essential by their respective divisions.\"",
      "\"HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "But the scientist who spoke to CBS News said the turmoil inside the CDC will impact responses to disease outbreaks, like the measles outbreak in South Carolina, where five new cases were reported Tuesday, bringing the total to 16 since July, and forcing 139 students into quarantine, according to health officials.",
      "\"The surge capacity of the CDC is going to be significantly hampered with these cuts,\" the scientist told CBS News. \"It's going to impede our ability to respond to public health outbreaks, just when all of these threats are on the rise.\""

      "The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be \"insufficient funds\" to pay full November SNAP benefits.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program. Advocates, meanwhile, have warned the effects could be devastating.",
      "\"These are, for the most part, working individuals who still are living paycheck to paycheck,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger.",
      "How SNAP benefits are normally administered",
      "Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use\u00a0to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.",
      "While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident and SNAP recipient, told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on whether that option is under consideration.",
      "During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, Plata-Nino said.",
      "\"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ...\" Plata-Nino said. \"They have the money, so it really is a policy choice.\"",
      "It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.",
      "Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states."

The effects depend on how much cannabis is used, how it's taken and how used to it someone is.\"",
      "Heavy or long-term intake of the drug, especially in teens, can lead to lasting issues with memory, attention and decision-making, said Gounder. Long-term use, she added, can also lead to cannabis-use disorder, which is a clinical term for addiction,\u00a0defined\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as when users are unable to stop using cannabis even though it's causing them health and social problems.",
      "Some heavy users may also develop severe nausea and vomiting, Gounder said. Those most at risk are pregnant individuals, teens, and people with mental or heart conditions, she added.",
      "The potential effects of a cannabis-infused drink can be felt in as little as 15 to 20 minutes, compared with 30 to 90 minutes for an edible, according to Dr. Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, in a recent article on the school's website.",
      "\"If you are interested in trying it and it is legal for you to do so, be mindful about controlling the experience until you know how a particular product affects you,\" Gruber said.",
      "Target eyes THC segment",
      "The U.S. has a patchwork of regulations governing the sale of cannabis products, with states offering varying degrees of restrictions, including minimum-age requirements. THC beverages can be legally sold in 44 states in total, \u00a037 of which allow sales outside of the marijuana dispensary systems according to Whitney.",
      "In those areas, the beverages can commonly be found at restaurants, bars, grocery stores and liquor stores.",
      "In Atlanta, for example, Scofflaw Beverage Company \u2014 previously a brewery fighting for its financial life after the pandemic \u2014 revived its business by canning drinks without alcohol that contain 5 to 10 milligrams of hemp-derived THC, CBS News Atlanta reports. Cannabis products are legal in Georgia and can be shipped across the U.S.",
      "\"It's really been an almost seismic shift in customer preference,\" Scofflaw co-founder Matt Shirah told CBS News Atlanta. \"The THC infused business has the potential to be 10 to 20 times the size of beer business.\"",
      "Cannabis beverages have even caught the attention of major retailers like Target. The Minneapolis-based chain confirmed to CBS News that it is testing the sale of THC beverages at certain Target liquor stores in Minnesota. While other retailers, such as Total Wine & More, already sell cannabis beverages, Target is the first big-box player to explore the THC beverage market.",
      "\"At Target, we're always exploring new ways to meet our guests' evolving preferences and needs,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Whitney Economics estimates there are 500 to 750 brands marketing cannabis drinks. Of those, roughly 30 are sizable labels with national distribution, while the rest are regional and local brands, according to Diana Eberlein, chair of the Coalition for Adult Beverage Alternatives Retailers, a group that represents stakeholders in the hemp and alcohol industries.",
      "Better-known names in the space include Cycling Frog, which makes THC seltzers and edibles; Cann, which markets itself as a \"social beverage\"; and Nowadays, which employs the motto \"the future of drinking is here.\"",
      "Mainstream alcohol brands are also testing the waters. Beer makers Lagunitas Brewing and Pabst have come up with their own THC-infused beverages.",
      "Whitney and Eberlein said the cannabis drink sector is growing most rapidly among women in their 30s and early 40s who are looking for more accessible, and less caloric, alternatives to alcoholic beverages.",
      "\"They still want to have a beverage, but they don't want the high amount of calories. They don't want the alcohol, they don't want the sugar, and they don't want to have a hangover the next morning,\" Whitney said. \"They're replacing their evening glass of wine with THC beverages.\""

    "story": [
      "Americans continue to\u00a0fall behind\u00a0on auto loan payments in the face of record-high car prices and high interest rates.",
      "A recent\u00a0study by VantageScore found that auto loan delinquency rates have increased by more than 50% over the past 15 years. The upward trend continues even as delinquency rates in other loan categories \u2014 including credit card loans, personal loans and home equity loans \u2014 have declined, according to the report.",
      "\"Back in 2010, auto loans were the least risky of all products at that point in time,\" Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, said in a recent video. \"Now, as we look at 2025, it's actually \u2014 excluding student loans \u2014 the riskiest credit product.\"",
      "While a growing number of Americans have been\u00a0falling behind\u00a0on car payments for years, auto loan delinquency rates have picked up after a pandemic-induced dip.",
      "The most recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve shows that auto loan delinquency rates \u2014 defined as the portion of loan balances that are at least 30 days past due \u2014 were at 3.8% in June 2024, the highest level since June 2010.",
      "The rise in delinquency rates includes all household income groups, VantageScore's data shows. What's more, delinquency rates among prime borrowers have climbed faster than subprime borrowers on an absolute basis.",
      "\"The broad-based decline in consumer credit quality indicates that economic pressures are no longer concentrated among some VantageScore credit tiers and income levels,\" Susan Fahy, executive vice president and chief digital officer at VantageScore, said in a statement.",
      "VantageScore also found that the average loan amount has increased 57% over the last 15 years \u2014 a bigger jump than any other loan category, including mortgages.",
      "Why people are falling behind on payments",
      "One of the main factors hurting car owners is rapidly increasing monthly payments.\u00a0Data from the Federal Reserve shows that average monthly payments increased roughly $130 from January 2020 to January 2023, to $600. By contrast, in the three-year-period from January 2017 to January 2020, average monthly car loan payments had increased approximately $40, from $430 to $470.",
      "Payments have continued to escalate: One in five new car loans have monthly payments that exceed $1,000, according to auto researcher\u00a0Edmunds.",
      "Behind the ballooning payments are rising car prices and interest rates. The average cost of a new vehicle is now more than $50,000, according to September data from Cox Automotive \u2014 the highest it's ever been.",
      "\"Prices for both new and used vehicles surged during and after the pandemic and they haven't come down,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Those higher vehicle costs have encouraged more buyers to finance their purchases, often at increased interest rates, Kates added. The average auto loan rate in September was 7% for new cars and approximately 11% for used cars, September\u00a0data\u00a0from Edmunds shows.",
      "\"The combination of elevated prices and borrowing costs has led to longer loan terms, which increase the total interest paid and raise the risk of borrowers becoming underwater as their cars depreciate faster than they pay down the loan,\" Kates said.",
      "Broader economic conditions are also influencing delinquency rates, experts have noted. Fahy from VantageScore said that in addition to higher borrowing costs, the rise in auto loan delinquencies could also be attributed to inflation and an unsteady employment picture.",
      "While inflation has cooled since its 2022 peak, many Americans are still feeling stretched by sky-high prices. A Bankrate analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data found that while the gap is narrowing, average wages are still trailing behind inflation and won't catch up until mid-2026."

      "They are due to be paid again Oct. 28, but they are at risk of missing that paycheck if the government shutdown persists, Duffy said. Because the Federal Aviation Administration defines air traffic controllers as\u00a0essential workers, they are required to stay on the job during government closures despite going unpaid, although they are guaranteed back pay once lawmakers restore government funding.",
      "\"They got a partial paycheck a week ago Tuesday. Their next paycheck comes a week from Tuesday. In that paycheck there will be no dollars. They don't get paid,\" Duffy said. \"[W]e have heard they are taking Uber jobs. They are doing DoorDash, they are [finding] ways to keep their families afloat.\"",
      "Since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, some flights and airports have experienced delays due to shortages of air traffic controllers, including Burbank, California; Denver, Colorado; and Newark, New Jersey, federal flight data showed earlier this month.",

Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that four in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24."

Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",

      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",

      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News."

    "story": [
      "Frozen meals served to students across the United States as part of federally-funded school breakfast and lunch programs may be contaminated with listeria and have been recalled, officials announced on Saturday.",
      "The recall applied to approximately 91,585 pounds of prepackaged breakfast burritos and wraps, manufactured by the California company M.C.I. Foods between Sept. 17 and Oct. 14,\u00a0said the Food Safety and Inspection Service, a branch of the U.S. Department of Agriculture that focuses on public health regulations.",
      "Its announcement cited seven different types of frozen breakfast products that could be tainted. They are distributed to low-income students around the country as part of the National School Breakfast and Lunch Programs, which the Department of Agriculture administers. The breakfast program served more than 14 million children in 2016, and close to 30 million children participated in the lunch program in 2019, according to the department.",
      "There are no confirmed reports of illnesses tied to the recalled products, which include burritos and wraps sold by the brands El Mas Fino, Los Cabos and Midamar and contain egg, cheese and various meats like beef, ham, sausage and turkey, according to the Food Safety and Inspection Service. The agency said it recalled those products after the manufacturer discovered listeria while conducting routine testing on egg ingredients from its external suppliers.",
      "\"FSIS is concerned that some product may be in institutional refrigerators of freezers,\" said the agency. \"Institutions are urged not to serve these products. These products should be thrown away.\"",
      "Listeria is an infection caused by bacteria of the same name that spreads through food. Fever, headache, stiff neck, muscle aches, confusion, loss of balance and a range of gastrointestinal problems are some of the symptoms brought on by the illness,\u00a0according to the Mayo Clinic. The clinic warns that pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are at the highest risk of developing a harmful infection.",
      "People can be infected with listeria without becoming seriously ill, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency has estimated that listeria is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the U.S., with 1,250 people contracting the infection and 172 dying from the infection each year.",
      "Public health officials note that flu-like symptoms caused by listeria can signal an \"invasive\" infection, meaning one that has spread from the gastrointestinal tract, where symptoms may start, to other parts of the body. These invasive infections typically develop within two months of eating contaminated food, according to the CDC.",
      "Multiple listeria outbreaks have been reported just this month. One impacted meal kits from the food subscription service HelloFresh\u00a0and another forced the recall of nearly 245,000 pounds of precooked pasta, from the California company Nate's Fine Foods, which turned deadly and potentially contaminated dozens of different products sold in grocery stores nationwide"

      "When families are forced to cut costs, it's easy to eliminate a single-use item like a costume. But it also comes at the expense of childhood memories.",

      "The president said last month he would impose a 25% tariff rate on all medium- and heavy-duty trucks imported into the U.S., as he seeks to protect U.S. companies from foreign competitors. The tariffs on parts are also meant to discourage vehicle manufacturers from using only foreign materials.",
      "The 25% tariff on all truck imports will apply to all Class 3 to Class 8 vehicles, senior administration officials said on a call with reporters ahead of the signing, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The Trump administration will also provide a credit for vehicle manufacturers who import some parts into the U.S. so they can make the vehicle in the U.S., in order to offset the tariffs, one of the senior administration officials said.",
      "\"The idea here is we want to incentivize domestic manufacturing of vehicles, and one way to do that is to say, 'Alright, we understand that not 100% of a vehicle can be used with goods that are already here in the United States,'\" the official said. \"And so, for the parts that do need to be imported, we are essentially allowing a credit so that they can offset any tariff liability that they would accrue because they're importing parts just to manufacture in the United States.\"",

    "story": [
      "Americans receive tens of millions of unsolicited automated calls and texts each day, often intended to dupe them into forking over personal information or money.",
      "That's the thrust of a new report by U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy organization, which found that scam and telemarketing calls and texts have proliferated across the country, despite safeguards intended to prevent them. (Of the 9,242 phone companies that filed with the FCC as of Sept. 28, 2025, less than half have fully installed robocall-fighting software.)",
      "Nationwide, Americans received an average of 2.56 billion robocalls a month from January to September. That's up from 2.14 billion a month in 2024, and the highest level in six years, according to PIRG's analysis of data from YouMail, one of the largest robocall-blocking companies.",
      "Meanwhile, the volume of automated texts received by Americans has skyrocketed since 2021, when a government crackdown on robocalls led more telemarketers and scammers to shift to texts. Data from PIRG shows that the annual volume of robotexts received in 2024 was roughly 19 billion, nearly triple the approximately 7 billion robotexts received in 2021.",
      "The predatory messages are a daily nuisance for many. About one-third of Americans say they get at least one scam phone call a day, while one-fifth say they receive one scam text every day,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Pew Research Center.",
      "Types of scams",
      "Roboscams come in many forms, as detailed in PIRG's report. Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at PIRG, said they usually stem from crime rings or dedicated scam operations whose mission is to extract personal information or get some kind of financial information or actual payment from victims.",
      "\"The calls and texts are low cost and high reward,\" she said in an email. \"As long as some percentage keep working, the scammers will keep trying.\"",
      "Examples of some common scams include:",
      "Impersonating IRS, BanksDuring tax season, bad actors pose as IRS officials or tax preparation companies. Many scammers impersonate banks and credit card companies to steal account information. Another common trap are calls and texts that incite fear about unpaid loan balances or offer dubious debt relief opportunities.",
      "Package deliveryPackage delivery scams have become very common, with fraudsters posing as the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx and UPS sending out messages that there was an issue with a delivery. Included in the text is a fake link, leading victims to pay money to ensure the fake package ends up in their hands.",
      "While some escape the scams unscathed, many don't. According to Pew, approximately a quarter of Americans say they've given up personal information to scammers as a result a predatory phone call, text message or email.",
      "How did the problem get so bad?",
      "Scams are growing more sophisticated and easier to set up, thanks to\u00a0artificial intelligence. According to PIRG, AI allows bots to send fraudulent texts to thousands of people at a time.",
      "\"The bad guys always seem to be several steps ahead of the regulators and phone companies,\" Murray said.",
      "Scammers have employed\u00a0AI voice-cloning tools\u00a0to trick people into thinking they are talking to a friend, family member or government official.",
      "Up until late 2023, robocalls had declined considerably, according to Alex Quilici, founder and CEO of YouMail, who is cited in the PIRG report. Over the last two years, however, the number of automated texts and calls has increased along with the cost of related scams for victims.",
      "The amount of money lost to phone scams rose 16% from the first half of 2024 to the first half of 2025, according to the Federal Trade Commission. On average, victims lost $3,690 to scam robocalls and $1,452 to scam texts in the first half of 2025, PIRG found.",
      "In 2019, Congress passed the TRACED Act, which directed the Federal Communications Commission to require phone companies to implement stricter technology to regulate robocalls, including caller ID authentication. To keep track of compliance, the FCC launched a\u00a0robocall mitigation database where companies are supposed to detail their efforts to fight illegal robocalls on their networks.",
      "But those efforts have been met with mixed success. As of Sept. 28, only 44% of phone companies have completely installed the mandated software and adopted anti-robocall policies, down from 47% in 2024, PIRG found.",
      "\"You'd think that \u2014 given that it's been more than 15 years since the first federal law to attack spam robocalls \u2014 we'd have seen more progress by now,\" the PIRG report authors write,\u00a0\"We still don't know whether to trust our caller ID and may worry we'll miss an important call if we don't answer.\""

    "story": [
      "As economic uncertainty deepens the rush for gold continues, with the price of the precious metal this week topping $4,300 for the first time.",
      "The going price for New York spot closed at a record $4,326 per troy ounce on Thursday. Futures also traded as high at more than $4,344 per troy ounce Thursday, before falling below the $4,300 mark Friday morning. Still, gold is up 6.7% over the last week, marking one of its best weeks to date.",
      "Gold sales can rise sharply when anxious investors seek a \"safe haven\" for their money. For the U.S., the latest gains arrive amid the now weekslong government shutdown and ongoing trade wars abroad \u2014 with President Trump most recently threatening to place much higher tariffs on China, before appearing to walk back those potential new levies as unsustainable.",
      "Still, his barrage of other import taxes has already strained economies worldwide. Meanwhile, the prospect of lower interest rates is also making gold a more attractive investment.",
      "Gold futures are up nearly 60% since the start of 2025 \u2014 trading at about $4,268 per troy ounce, the standard for measuring precious metals, as of around 11:45 a.m. Friday. That's up from around $2,670 at the beginning of January.",
      "Silver has seen an even bigger percentage jump year to date. Silver futures are up about 70%, trading at over $50 per troy ounce Friday morning.",
      "A lot of it boils down to uncertainty. Interest in buying metals like gold typically spikes when investors become anxious.",
      "Much of this year's economic turmoil has spanned from Trump's trade wars. Since the start of 2025, steep new tariffs the president has imposed on goods coming into the U.S. from around the world have strained businesses and consumers alike \u2014 pushing costs higher and helping to weaken the job market.",
      "As a result, hiring has plunged\u00a0while inflation has inched back up. And more and more consumers are expressing pessimism about the road ahead.",
      "The U.S. government shutdown adds to those anxieties. Key economic data has been delayed \u2014 and scores of federal employees are already feeling the effects of furloughs and working without pay as long as the shutdown lasts, which has no immediate end in sight. The Trump administration also moved to use the shutdown to conduct mass firings, although a judge temporarily blocked such action.",
      "Separately, analysts have pointed to continued weakness of the U.S. dollar and renewed rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Last month, the Fed cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point \u2014 and projected it would do so twice more this year.",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors over time. Over recent years, there's been strong gold demand from central banks around the world \u2014 particularly amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "And on Wall Street this week, several regional banks saw sharp losses amid scrunity over quality of loans, although recovery seemed to be steadying the market on Friday. Meanwhile, investors appeared to be distancing themselves from riskier assets like cryptocurrency \u2014 with bitcoin, for example, down 2.67%.",
      "Gold jewelry sticker shock",
      "Many jewelry merchants and dealers have increasingly reported surges in customers looking to check the value of gold they own \u2014 sometimes opting to melt or sell family heirlooms to cash in on the precious metal's rising price.",
      "At the same time, those in the market for gold jewelry may be feeling \"sticker shock\" if they can't afford certain products anymore \u2014 particularly if it's something impacted by both rising material costs and tariffs.",
      "Larger retailers like Pandora and Signet have acknowledged these headwinds in recent earnings calls.",
      "Advocates of investing in gold call it a safe haven \u2014 arguing that the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road as a hedge against rising inflation. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time.",
      "Of late, however, stock prices have steamed to record highs this year, economic\u00a0growth has accelerated\u00a0in recent months and inflation this year has remained relatively subdued, prompting questions about what's fueling investors' renewed appetite for gold.",
      "\"$4,000 an ounce seemed far-fetched at the start of the year as gold entered 2025 near $2,800 an ounce. But after a ~50% rally, here we are,\" eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell recently told CBS News.",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors. Analysts point to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "Still, experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket. And not everyone agrees gold is a good investment.",
      "Not always a reliable inflation hedge",
      "Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many claim \u2014 and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.",
      "The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, and prices rise as demand goes up \u2014 meaning \"when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers,\" the commission noted.",
      "The frenzy for gold has also resulted in health and environmental consequences \u2014 with officials pointing to rising demand for mercury, a toxic metal that is key in illegal gold mining worldwide.",
      "Mercury is widely used to separate gold during artisanal or small-scale mining. But it pollutes water, accumulates in fish, makes its way into food and builds up in people's bodies, leading to neurological and developmental harm. Even small-scale exposure can carry serious risks \u2014 putting in danger workers who rely on the industry, as well as residents in affected areas more broadly.",
      "The Associated Press has reported about the effects of mercury poisoning tied to gold mining in countries like Senegal, Mexico and Peru, among other parts of the world."

      "The class action lawsuit, filed Oct. 9 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, claims the customers wouldn't have bought the shoes if they had known about the noise.

      "Flights into Hollywood Burbank Airport, which serves Los Angeles, were slowed until 1 a.m. Tuesday, resulting in average delays of 2.5 hours, FAA data shows. No air traffic controllers were on duty on Monday evening at the airport, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a social media post.",

      "When there's a shortage of air traffic controllers, the FAA reduces the number of takeoffs and landings to ensure the on-duty personnel aren't overwhelmed and the system remains safe. But that can creates flight delays and cancellations.",

    "summary": "More than 3,000 U.K. claimants accuse U.S. pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson of knowingly selling asbestos-tainted talcum powder, making them ill.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Thousands of people in the United Kingdom have filed a joint legal claim estimated to be worth more than \u00a31 billion ($1.34 billion) against Johnson & Johnson, accusing the U.S. pharmaceutical giant of selling baby powder that it knew was contaminated with carcinogenic asbestos.",
      "The claim involves more than 3,000 people who developed various forms of cancer and other diseases and is based on internal Johnson & Johnson memos and scientific reports.",
      "The company has long fought thousands of similar cases in the United States, and despite winning some appeals, in June last year it agreed to pay $700 million in a nationwide settlement to resolve allegations that it misled customers about the safety of its talcum-based powder products in its marketing.",
      "Just last week, a Los Angeles jury ordered the firm to pay $966 million to the family of a woman who died from a form of cancer after using J&J products.",
      "The U.K. lawsuit, which covers the years 1965 to 2023, claims that Johnson & Johnson, \"knew their talc products contained carcinogenic fibres, including asbestos, for more than fifty years and chose to keep it on the market in pursuit of profit.\"",
      "Despite the alleged knowledge of the carcinogens in its products, the firm only took its talcum powder products off shelves in Britain in 2023, the suit alleges, when it switched to a cornstarch based product \u2014 three years after doing so in Canada and the U.S.",
      "\"For decades Johnson & Johnson have orchestrated a campaign of denials and subterfuge,\" said the claimants' lead lawyer, Tom Longstaff of KP Law, which has brought the case against J&J and Kenvue Ltd., which was spun off two years ago, before the U.K. High Court. \"The facts are clear, contaminated talc contains carcinogenic material and Johnson & Johnson knew the risk to consumers.\"",
      "\"The scale of Johnson & Johnson's corporate wrongdoing is extraordinary, and we will be relentless in holding them to account on behalf of all those who have suffered due to their actions,\" Longstaff said.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News on Thursday, Johnson & Johnson said inquiries about the claim \"would be best addressed by Kenvue, our former consumer health business, which separated from Johnson & Johnson in August 2023. As a part of that separation, Kenvue retained the responsibility and any purported liability for talc related litigation outside of the United States and Canada.\"",
      "Kenvue told the BBC in a statement that it sympathized \"deeply with people living with cancer. We understand that they and their families want answers \u2014\u202fthat's why the facts are so important,\" adding that the safety of its baby powder was backed by testing by \"independent and leading laboratories, universities, and health authorities in the U.K. and around the world\" over years.",
      "The company told BBC that the J&J baby powder \"was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.\"",
      "Talc is a naturally occurring mineral that is often found together with asbestos during the mining process, which makes eliminating all traces of asbestos from talcum powder difficult.",
      "The claim alleges people who regularly used Johnson & Johnson talcum powders have developed, and in many cases died from, ovarian cancer, mesothelioma \u2014 another form of cancer \u2014 uterine fibroids and other diseases.",
      "\"My mother used it and I used it,\" 63-year old Siobhan Ryan told CBS News' news partner network BBC News. \"It smelled nice and was soft and lovely. When my babies were born I used it on them. I thought I was doing my best for them \u2026 It was such a shock. We just hugged and cried. I couldn't believe what I was hearing when the doctor told me I had stage-four ovarian cancer.\"",
      "Siobhan, who blames her cancer on Johnson & Johnson's baby powder, has been through three rounds of chemotherapy, near-fatal sepsis, and major abdominal surgery. Doctors say her cancer is no longer operable.",
      "\"They knew it was contaminated and still they sold it to new mums and their babies,\" she said.",
      "According to the U.K. claim, Johnson & Johnson began in the 1960s to commission scientists to analyze its talc-based products. In 1969, an internal memo stated that until tremolite \u2014 one of six types of asbestos \u2014 was proven to have no adverse effects, its use should be minimized, and noted that talc could no longer be guaranteed to be safe for babies.",
      "By the 1980s, it was widely accepted that all forms of asbestos were dangerous and could cause cancer, but Johnson & Johnson \u2014   and other firms \u2014   successfully lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to not regulate asbestos content in talc, according to the lawsuit.",
      "In 2018, the FDA finally began testing talcum powder and other related products for asbestos. A year later, Johnson & Johnson voluntarily withdrew a batch of its powder after the FDA found asbestos fibers in a sample.",
      "The U.K. claims will be decided by a judge, rather than a jury, at the U.K. High Court's Manchester Circuit Commercial Court.",
      "In a statement, Kenvue said it believes the judge will find that its talc-based powder did not cause cancer.",
      "Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the attribution of the statement from Kenvue Ltd. to BBC News and to note that it is a separate company from J&J, not a subsidiary."

    "published": "Wed, 15 Oct 2025 15:38:10 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. population of people over 65 is expected to surge by 40% over the next 25 years, but many aren't prepared for longevity, a new study says.",
    "story": [
      "America's population of seniors is expected to surge by 40% over the next 25 years \u2014 a shift that could spark a crisis of aging, as most people remain unprepared for longer lives, according to new research from the MIT AgeLab and insurance company John Hancock.",
      "Americans are lagging in readiness to handle the demands of greater longevity, ranging from managing the cost of a longer retirement to maintaining their health in old age, according to the inaugural Longevity Preparedness Index, or LPI, from the MIT AgeLab, a research institute focusing on improving the quality of life for older people, and John Hancock.",
      "The problem goes well beyond saving for retirement \u2014 another area where Americans are known to fall short \u2014 and touches nearly every aspect of aging, from building community in later life to preparing for care when people can no longer look after themselves. Some people may fail to plan simply because they underestimate their own longevity, with\u00a0earlier research by Stanford University retirement expert Annamaria Lusardi finding that Americans generally believe they'll die younger than statistics predict.",
      "\"Believe it or not, longevity is quite new \u2014 we've always had older people, but never this many older people living this long,\" Joe Coughlin, founder and director of the MIT AgeLab, told CBS News. \"We can't look to our parents, saying 'This is how they did it.'\"",
      "Preparing for a long old age isn't all about money, although that remains an important part of retirement readiness, said Brooks Tingle, CEO of John Hancock, told CBS. While Americans are living longer, they're spending more years in poorer health, which raises additional issues around preparing for longer retirements than prior generations, he noted.",
      "A 65-year-old woman has a 40% chance of living to age 90, while men the same age have a 30% chance of reaching that age, according to Lusardi's research.",
      "The study analyzed eight aspects of longevity preparedness:",
      "Social connection: Relationships with family, friends and community.Finance: Having enough saved for retirement and old age.\u00a0Daily activities: Keeping busy with meaningful daily activities.\u00a0Care: Identifying who will care for you if you need assistance, understanding the costs of care and having advance directives in place.\u00a0Home: Modifying your home to prolong independence in old age.\u00a0Community: Access to health care, stores, recreation and transportation.\u00a0Health: Developing positive physical, mental, and cognitive behavioral habits to maintain health as you age.Life transitions: Preparing for major changes like retirement, the death of a loved one and more.",
      "Social connection: Relationships with family, friends and community.",
      "Finance: Having enough saved for retirement and old age.",
      "Daily activities: Keeping busy with meaningful daily activities.",
      "Care: Identifying who will care for you if you need assistance, understanding the costs of care and having advance directives in place.",
      "Home: Modifying your home to prolong independence in old age.",
      "Community: Access to health care, stores, recreation and transportation.",
      "Health: Developing positive physical, mental, and cognitive behavioral habits to maintain health as you age.",
      "Life transitions: Preparing for major changes like retirement, the death of a loved one and more.",
      "U.S. adults scored an average of 60 out of 100 across the eight areas, which MIT and John Hancock said signifies that Americans' general longevity preparedness is low.",
      "\"Preparedness is, yes, about saving money, but really it's practically being aware of other things you'll have to do, like 'What should I do, who am I going to live with,'\" Coughlin said. \"Your Zip code is probably your bigger predictor of quality of life, not your 401(k).\"",
      "Care emerged as Americans' weakest area of preparedness, with an average score of 42 out of 100 on the LPI. The strongest domain was community, where people scored 70, suggesting greater readiness for maintaining access to stores, health care and recreation as they age.",
      "The price of long-term care, such as assisted living facilities, can easily cost $6,000 per month or more, placing it out of reach for many Americans. But smaller, less costly steps can also make a difference, such as identifying friends or family members who could step in to help if you ever need extra support, Tingle noted.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Will I need intensive care?' but 'Who is going to change the lightbulb for me when I'm 91?,'\" Tingle said. \"A big takeaway is just to start these conversations.\"",
      "He added, \"Most families don't ever talk about these things.\"",
      "To be sure, saving for retirement can ease many of these issues, ranging from having the resources to pay for long-term care to modifying your home with grab bars and other additions that can prolong independent living. On average, Americans scored a 64 for financial preparedness, but the study found a large gap between those with few assets and people with wealth.",
      "Those with less than $50,000 in investible assets had an overall longevity preparedness score of 56, while those with more than $3 million in assets scored 65, the survey found. People with financial advisers scored a 65, while those without ranked 7 points lower, it noted.",
      "\"Those who had financial advisers had better scores \u2014 of course they did better. The better financial advisers don't just advise you on your wealth, they help you anticipate what will come tomorrow,\" Coughlin noted. \"You have someone who is asking you to think about what those future plans are.\"",
      "He added, \"Most of us are hacking longevity, and we figure it out day after day.\" But he said he hopes the LPI will \"change the cultural narrative\" about aging by shifting the conversation beyond money to include how people can plan how to live and find purpose in their later years."

      "Federal prosecutors claim Chen Zhi, the founder and chairman of Prince Holding Group, oversaw a vast criminal network in Cambodia built on forced labor that extracted billions from victims in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "The indictment, which was unsealed in a\u00a0federal court in Brooklyn on Tuesday, charges the 37-year-old Cambodian national with wire fraud and money laundering.",
      "\"By dismantling a criminal empire built on forced labor and deception, we are sending a clear message that the United States will use every tool at its disposal to defend victims, recover stolen assets and bring to justice those who exploit the vulnerable for profit,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement.",
      "The complaint is the largest forfeiture action in the history of the Department of Justice, according to the agency.",
      "Chen remains at large, according to the Justice Department. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison.",
      "\"Today the FBI and partners executed one of the largest financial fraud takedowns in history,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement. \"This is an individual who allegedly operated a vast criminal network across multiple continents involving forced labor, money laundering, investment schemes, and stolen assets \u2014 targeting millions of innocent victims in the process.\"",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control\u00a0announced Tuesday that it has coordinated with U.K. officials to impose sweeping sanctions against 146 entities associated with the Prince Group, which has been formally designated a transnational criminal organization by the department.",
      "Prince Holding Group's website lists it as one of the largest conglomerates in Cambodia, with businesses focused on real estate development, banking, finance and consumer services.",
      "The company did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment. The company has previously denied involvement in scam operations and has not publicly responded to the latest allegations.",
      "Federal prosecutors described the cryptocurrency fraud allegedly employed by Chen as a \"pig butchering\" scam, or when scammers dupe a victim into phony investments.",
      "The Justice Department alleges the criminal network convinced victims over social media and messaging apps to transfer cryptocurrency based on the false promises that it would be invested. The scammers then stole the funds, laundered them and used the proceeds for luxury travel, entertainment and other extravagant purchases, according to the agency.",
      "Allegations of human trafficking",
      "Federal prosecutors said Prince Group targeted victims around the world with assistance from local networks, including one operated from Brooklyn, New York. To carry out the schemes, the criminal actors allegedly trafficked hundreds of people and forced them to work in a network of compounds across Cambodia. The \"violent, forced labor camps\" consisted of vast dormitories surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, according to the Justice Department.",
      "To dodge law enforcement, Chen and Prince Group's top executives allegedly paid bribes to public officials and used their political influence, the department said.",
      "Mark Taylor, who formerly worked on human trafficking issues in Cambodia for the nonprofit Winrock International, said that Chen was embedded in the Cambodian elite and \"well protected\" by the government, showing \"the larger role that Cambodia has played as a safe center for this online scamming to prosper.\" Chen was formerly a personal adviser to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet.",
      "\"Cambodia is the physical location where a lot of it operates, but it's also the money laundering center for the entire region,\" Taylor said",
      "Independent research group Cyber Scam Monitor has documented more than 200 online scamming centers and casinos in Cambodia alone, based on first-hand accounts from former scam workers, field surveys and media reports."

    "summary": "A new court filing by James Comey's attorneys definitively answers a lingering question about the criminal charges against the former FBI director: who is \"Person 3\"?",
    "story": [
      "A new court filing by James Comey's attorneys definitively answers a lingering question about the criminal charges against the former FBI director: Who is \"Person 3\"?",
      "The Department of Justice last month charged Comey with lying during a 2020 Senate hearing. The two-page indictment accuses the former FBI director of falsely telling lawmakers that he never gave anybody at the FBI permission to serve as an anonymous source in news reports about the bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton. But it doesn't name the FBI staffer whom Comey allegedly authorized to leak, referring to them only as \"Person 3.\"",
      "In a motion filed Monday to dismiss the charges, Comey's lawyers wrote that last week, the government \"confirmed to the defense that \u2026 Person 3 refers to Daniel Richman.\"",
      "Richman, a longtime friend of Comey, is a Columbia University law professor and former federal prosecutor in New York. He served at one point as a \"special government employee\" at the FBI when Comey led the bureau.",
      "It's still unclear what information Richman is accused of leaking. The Justice Department has not charged Richman with a crime or accused him of any wrongdoing.",
      "Monday's filing \u2014 which argues Comey is the victim of a vindictive prosecution driven by President Trump's \"personal animus\" toward him \u2014 marks the first time that court papers have named the person the Justice Department believes Comey authorized to leak. Several media outlets had previously reported that Richman was \"Person 3.\"",
      "Richman's name did not come up in the Senate testimony that led to Comey's charges.",
      "Instead, the indictment focuses on a testy back-and-forth in 2020, when Republican Sen. Ted Cruz grilled Comey about whether he let a different person \u2014 former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe \u2014 leak information about the Clinton probe to the Wall Street Journal. McCabe says he told Comey after the article came out that he authorized the leak, and Comey approved of it, but Comey has long insisted that no such conversation took place.",
      "Comey had previously told Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in 2017 that he never authorized anyone to serve as an anonymous source in media coverage on the FBI's investigations into Clinton or Mr. Trump. Three years later, Cruz argued McCabe's statements about the Wall Street Journal leak contradicted that.",
      "\"Now, what Mr. McCabe is saying and what you testified to this committee cannot both be true. One or the other is false,\" Cruz said to Comey in 2020. \"Who's telling the truth?\"",
      "\"I can only speak to my testimony. I stand by the testimony,\" replied Comey.",
      "In Monday's filing, Comey's attorneys cast the fact that Cruz didn't ask about Richman as a fatal flaw in the government's case against the ex-FBI chief, who was charged with one count of making false statements to Congress and one count of obstructing a congressional investigation.",
      "The lawyers wrote: \"the indictment omits Senator Cruz's words that explicitly narrow the focus of his questions to Mr. McCabe and misleadingly implies that the questioning related to Mr. Richman.\"",
      "\"In other words, the indictment presents an inaccurate description of the testimony at the heart of this case,\" the court filing continued.",
      "His attorneys also argue the Justice Department's charges misquote Comey. The indictment says Comey falsely stated to the Senate that he hadn't \"authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports\" \u2014 but that exact phrase was actually used by Cruz and Grassley, not Comey. And the filing notes that Cruz used the phrase \"Clinton administration,\" not \"Clinton investigation.\"",
      "The filing says Comey is planning on asking for his false statement count to be dismissed \"based on a defense of literal truth.\" It referenced the Supreme Court case Bronston v. United States, which said people who make literally true statements under oath aren't guilty of perjury.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department, Comey's attorneys and Richman for comment.",
      "What is Daniel Richman accused of doing?",
      "The indictment doesn't say what information the Justice Department believes Richman leaked to the media. It states only that Comey \"authorized PERSON 3 to serve as an anonymous source in news reports regarding an FBI investigation concerning PERSON 1.\"",
      "Comey's lawyers confirmed in Monday's filing that \"Person 1\" referred to Clinton.",
      "The filing points to one FBI leak investigation involving Comey and Richman called \"Arctic Haze,\" which was detailed in a memo declassified by the bureau earlier this year. Arctic Haze sought to figure out how classified details on the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server made their way into a 2017 New York Times article, which looked at Comey's decision-making while leading the politically fraught probe.",
      "Richman was interviewed as part of Arctic Haze, according to the heavily redacted memo, which was published by the conservative-leaning site Just The News. The memo says Richman told FBI agents he had spoken with one of the authors of the Times article, but he didn't know how the reporter got a hold of the classified information, and Richman said he was \"sure 'with a discount'\" that he didn't tell the reporter himself.",
      "The memo describes Richman as Comey's \"liaison to the media,\" but also notes at one point: \"Richman later told the interviewing agents Comey never asked him to talk to the media.\"",
      "The Arctic Haze investigation closed without any charges. The memo said the probe \"has not yielded sufficient evidence to criminally charge any person, including Comey or Richman, with making false statements or with the substantive offenses under investigation.\"",
      "Separately, during the first Trump term, Comey was investigated by the Justice Department's inspector general for giving memos about his conversations with Mr. Trump to Richman, who then provided their contents to a Times reporter. The internal watchdog found that Comey \"violated applicable policies\" but did not release any classified information.",
      "Mr. Trump has accused Comey of leaks and other nefarious conduct for almost a decade, stretching back to when he fired Comey as FBI director in 2017. The president has long criticized how Comey handled the FBI's probes into Clinton and the Trump campaign. Comey, for his part, has called Mr. Trump \"morally unfit to be president.\"",
      "In Monday's court papers, Comey's lawyers asserted that Mr. Trump's longstanding \"personal spite\" led to the charges against him, which were filed shortly before the statute of limitations expired.",
      "\"No reasonable prosecutor would have brought such a deficient case; the only explanation is that the President's handpicked interim U.S. Attorney did so to carry out the President's wishes,\" they wrote in a 51-page filing, which also included a 60-page attachment listing all of the verbal barbs flung between Comey and Mr. Trump over the years."

      "The agents forced their way into the home without showing a warrant, Maga\u00f1a told CBS News.",
      "The raid occurred on Oct. 15. Maga\u00f1a, a native of Mexico, said she got a call from her children, who told her the agents were shouting for someone named Israel, but nobody in their home goes by that name. She said she told her children to lock themselves inside a room.",
      "With guns drawn, agents broke open the room's door. Maga\u00f1a's daughter took a video of the heavily-armed agents telling them to put their hands up as her daughter, a three-month-old baby, cried. One of the agents asked if any of the men inside the room were named Israel.",
      "Outside of the home, witnesses asked the federal officers for information.",
      "\"Stop watching TikTok. We don't have to identify ourselves to you,\" one agent was heard saying on video recorded by a witness.",
      "While federal officials have since admitted they were looking for someone else, agents still detained Maga\u00f1a's 20-year-old son and her partner, saying they were in the U.S. illegally. Maga\u00f1a said neither has a criminal record. Federal records reviewed by CBS News also indicate the men do not have any criminal charges or convictions.",
      "ICE's online detainee system indicated on Monday that Maga\u00f1a's son, Napoleon Maga\u00f1a, was being held at the agency's detention facility in Tacoma, Washington. Her partner, Arturo Garcia Cabrera, was transferred to the Adams County Correctional Center in Mississippi, the system showed.",
      "A senior Homeland Security official told CBS News the federal agents who entered Maga\u00f1a's home on Oct. 15 were looking for an individual with a criminal history who they say had evaded arrest and fled into the apartment complex. The target of the operation remains at large, the official said.",
      "\"Two other aliens from Mexico were found inside the apartment and taken into ICE custody at the scene,\" the official said, adding that no federal agents were hurt during the incident.",
      "As millions took to the streets over the weekend for \"No Kings\" protests, federal agents in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered outside and ICE facility, where for months there have been demonstrations denouncing the agency's tactics as heavy-handed and indiscriminate.",
      "In an interview with CBS News in Portland, Marcos Charles, the head of ICE's deportation branch, Enforcement and Removal Operations, denied those charges.",
      "\"They're not indiscriminate,\" he told CBS News. \"We do our surveillance. If you're in the country illegally, we're gonna arrest you.\"",
      "Charles also downplayed concerns that ICE's tactics have become too aggressive.",
      "\"We use the force necessary to affect an arrest,\" he said. \"If people interpret that as being aggressive, so be it.\"",
      "Since President Trump took office again and launched a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration, ICE agents have been given a broad mandate to detain and deport those in the U.S. illegally, with Biden-era limits on arrests of non-criminals reversed.",
      "Charles said ICE is still primarily targeting immigrants in the U.S. illegally who also have committed crimes. But he said anyone in the U.S. illegally who is found by his agents will be arrested, even if they lack a criminal record and have been in the country for 40 years.",
      "On Monday, an appeals court said the Trump administration could deploy National Guard troops to Portland to protect the ICE facility there while the legal battle over their deployment plays out.",
      "Some in the local community are seeking to help those who could be targeted by immigration agents, including Pastor Mark Knutson, who has put up signs saying ICE agents need permission to enter his church.",
      "\"We're not gonna hide people. What we're gonna create is a space to be safe,\" explained Knutson, who is a reverend doctor at the Augustana Lutheran Church. \"And then we work the systems to help them get their amnesty or get the documents.\"",

      "Comey's attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that it is based on a vindictive and unlawful prosecution. He is also challenging the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan to that role.",
      "Comey's attorneys wrote that the charges arose due to an \"egregious abuse of power,\" and there are \"multiple glaring constitutional violations\" in the indictment. They argued that Mr. Trump ordered prosecutors to charge Comey due to \"personal spite\" and because Comey had \"frequently criticized the President,\" who fired Comey from his role leading the FBI in 2017 and has sparred with Comey for years.",
      "The requests were expected, as Fitzgerald previewed them when he appeared alongside Comey during his arraignment earlier this month. He is expected to file a second tranche of filings to toss out the charges in the coming weeks.",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff has set a hearing on the first set of motions for Nov. 19 in Alexandria, Virginia.",
      "Comey's attorneys said that even if the case is not dismissed for vindictive prosecution, \"concrete and objective facts justify thorough discovery into the suspect prosecutorial decision-making process that led to this flawed indictment and a hearing at which the government must justify its decision to bring these unfounded and retaliatory charges.\"",
      "His legal team says that \"absent a dismissal with prejudice, Mr. Comey would face a potential perpetual state of being vindictively prosecuted.\"",
      "In a separate motion, attorneys for Comey also argued that Halligan, the only attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia to sign his indictment, \"was defectively appointed to her office as an interim U.S. Attorney.\"",
      "Arguing that \"no properly appointed\" official from the executive branch had obtained the indictment against Comey, his lawyers said \"the indictment is equally a nullity\" and should be dismissed.",
      "\"The President and Attorney General appointed the President's personal lawyer as interim U.S. Attorney in violation of a clear statutory command so that the interim U.S. Attorney could indict an outspoken critic of the President just days before the relevant statute of limitations was set to expire,\" Comey's lawyers wrote.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson had no comment on the pair of motions.",
      "Prosecutors raise doubts about Comey's attorney",

      "\"[B]ased on publicly disclosed information, the defendant used current lead defense counsel to improperly disclose classified information,\" prosecutors Tyler Lemons and Gabriel Diaz, wrote in a filing. \"This fact raises a question of conflict and disqualification for current lead defense counsel.\"",
      "A Department of Justice Inspector General report found that Comey shared four memos with Fitzgerald in May 2017, who then forwarded them to two other lawyers working for Comey. Prosecutors are asking Nachmanoff to put in place a \"filter team\" to sift through evidence that may contain information shielded by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be disclosed.",
      "Prosecutors' use of material protected by privilege can raise obstacles in the case, ranging from disqualification of that material to mistrial or dismissal of charges. Filter teams are typically groups of government attorneys who review documents and separate privileged information from non-privileged information before the material gets to prosecutors on a given case.",
      "Prosecutors said the evidence at issue in Comey's case includes communications between him and several lawyers, one of whom appears to be Fitzgerald. They wrote in their latest filing that the material subject to review by the filter team \"could also inform a potential conflict and disqualification issue for\" Fitzgerald.",
      "But Comey's lawyers accused prosecutors of attempting to \"defame\" Fitzgerald and noted that the Justice Department's internal watchdog \"found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the Memos to members of the media.\" The Justice Department in 2019 declined to prosecute Comey for his handling of the memos.",
      "Halligan is the latest DOJ prosecutor to face court challenges",
      "Comey was charged in September with one count of making false statements to Congress and one count of obstruction of justice, related to Senate testimony he gave five years ago. Comey pleaded not guilty to both counts at his arraignment.",
      "Because Comey is challenging Halligan's appointment to temporarily lead the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, Nachsmanoff, who sits on the bench in the district, will have to recuse himself, and a judge from outside of the district will hear arguments on that motion.",
      "The challenge to Halligan's appointment comes after defendants in New Jersey and Nevada successfully challenged similar U.S. attorney appointments President Trump made in those two states in recent weeks, as the administration has attempted to bypass the Senate confirmation process for these positions around the country.",
      "A federal judge in August found that Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, is serving \"without lawful authority\" as the U.S. attorney in New Jersey. Weeks later, a federal judge ruled that Sigal Chattah, the top federal prosecutor in Nevada, was also serving illegally in her role.",
      "Halligan, one of Mr. Trump's former defense lawyers who later joined him in his second administration, was tapped as interim U.S. attorney in September after serving as a senior aide to Mr. Trump in the White House. Her appointment came days after Erik Siebert, who had been the top federal prosecutor in Eastern Virginia, resigned amid concerns he would be forced out for not prosecuting another of Mr. Trump's foe, New York Attorney General Letitia James, for alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "James was indicted in the Eastern District of Virginia earlier this month on one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. She has called the charges \"baseless.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi has invoked a provision of federal law that addresses U.S. attorney vacancies to install people in these posts temporarily. The law allows an appointee to serve 120 days as interim U.S. attorney and gives district court judges in the area the authority to keep them in the role or tap a new U.S. attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled.",
      "In the case of the Eastern District of Virginia, Siebert was installed as the interim U.S. attorney in January, and the judges there had extended his appointment as U.S. attorney for the region in May.",
      "But in the challenge to Habba's appointment to lead the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office earlier this year, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann found that the attorney general is given 120 total days to appoint an interim U.S. attorney. The judge agreed that the law allows different individuals to be appointed interim U.S. attorney, \"but for an aggregate term of 120 days.\"",
      "Allowing the 120-day clock to reset with the selection of each new temporary U.S. attorney would allow the president \"to staff the United States Attorney's office with individuals of his personal choice for an entire term without seeking the Senate's advice and consent,\" Brann wrote.",
      "While that conclusion does not bind the judge who will consider the validity of Halligan's appointment in Virginia, Fitzpatrick's motion points to Habba's case as part of the government's attempt to \"end run\" Congress' authority on judicial nominations and appointments, adding: \"This Court should reject the government's machinations here.\"",
      "Comey charged after sparring with Trump for years",
      "Comey has long been a political opponent of Mr. Trump's, and the president has for years taken to social media to attack the former FBI director. Mr. Trump has lambasted Comey for his handling of the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and alleged ties between Russia and Mr. Trump's associates. Mr. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, and Robert Mueller, who was named special counsel just over a week after Comey's ouster, then took over the probe.",
      "The indictment of the former FBI chief came days after Mr. Trump took to social media to voice frustration with Bondi for not bringing criminal charges against Comey and two other political opponents: James and California Sen. Adam Schiff, both Democrats.",
      "In his message to Bondi, Mr. Trump called the trio \"guilty as hell\" and wrote, \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"",
      "While claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are difficult to prevail on, former prosecutors have said the circumstances surrounding Comey's indictment could be a boon to his lawyers in having the charges tossed out.",
      "Selective prosecution is when the prosecutor appears motivated by discriminatory intent, and vindictive prosecution is when the government acts out of \"genuine\" animus or seeks to punish a defendant for exercising a legal right.",
      "Fitzgerald said at Comey's arraignment that there will be another slate of motions filed by Nov. 20 also challenging the case against him, including claims of grand jury abuse and \"outrageous conduct\" by the Justice Department.",
      "Grounds for a motion alleging abuse of the grand jury process can include possible improper legal instructions given by the prosecutor to the grand jury, an intentional withholding of information that would exonerate the defendant or indictments obtained as a means of retaliation."

      "The fragile peace deal President Trump spearheaded between Israel and Hamas in Gaza appeared on Monday to have survived serious threats over the weekend. The top U.S. officials who helped negotiate the ceasefire and hostage release agreement \u2014   senior envoy Steve Witkoff and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2014 were back in Israel on Monday to help ensure it does not unravel.",
      "Israel struck multiple targets inside Gaza after a deadly attack on Israeli soldiers. Hamas has rejected Israel's claim that it was involved in that attack.",
      "On Monday, the skies over Gaza were quiet again in the wake of the gravest threat since the ceasefire there came into effect on Oct. 10. Hamas and Israel accused each other of violating the terms of Mr. Trump's peace plan over the weekend, but both sides recommitted to the process on Monday.",
      "For a couple tense days, however, war was back in Gaza. Local health officials in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory said 45 people were killed in Israeli strikes.",
      "Speaking Monday in Israel's parliament, the Knesset, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military had dropped almost 169 tons of bombs in Gaza over the weekend.",
      "\"One of our hands holds a weapon, the other hand is stretched out for peace,\" he told lawmakers. \"You make peace with the strong, not the weak. Today Israel is stronger than ever before.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said it launched the attack after two soldiers were killed when Hamas operatives opened fire with an RPG.",
      "As mediators raced to get the peace process back on track, President Trump said the situation would be \"handled toughly, but properly,\" and added that in his view, the ceasefire remained in effect.",
      "Over the weekend, Palestinian families had come out to enjoy a quiet moment at a seaside caf\u00e9 in Gaza, when cameras captured the moment that an Israeli strike shattered the peace.",
      "Many feared the blood-soaked scenes left in the wake of the explosions were a sign that two years of relentless violence had resumed after just a week.",
      "\"We were drinking tea,\" said Salih Salman, \"when suddenly people were bombed.\"",
      "Once again Gaza's crippled hospitals filled up with dozens of injured in the wake of multiple Israeli strikes.",
      "The IDF said it was targeting Hamas forces responsible for ceasefire violations, and it provided video purportedly showing armed Hamas fighters moving toward Israeli troops.",
      "A media center in central Gaza was among the locations bombed, with the strike killing a cameraman and an engineer, and wounding three other people.",
      "\"We are all journalists here,\" protested Ajeb Mohamed at the scene. \"No-one else can even enter here.\"",
      "More than 220 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza since the war started, according to the international advocacy group Reporters Without Borders.",
      "Amid the renewed fighting and accusations over the weekend, an Israeli official said all humanitarian aid deliveries into Gaza would be suspended. On Monday, however, COGAT, the Israeli government agency that handles affairs in the Palestinian territories, told CBS News that the Kerem Shalom border crossing was open for aid to transit.",
      "The United Nations and a number of humanitarian aid agencies have called repeatedly since the ceasefire came into effect for Israel to open all of the border crossings into Gaza to allow far more food, water, medicine, building materials and other essential items in.",
      "The ingress of aid \u2014 which under the U.S. peace plan should be maximized under the ceasefire \u2014   is likely to be among the key issues as Witkoff and Kushner meet with Israeli officials this week to ensure the process stays on track. Vice President JD Vance is also due in Israel this week, and set to meet with Netanyahu.",
      "Netanyahu met Monday with Witkoff and Kushner to discuss \"developments and updates in the region,\" Shosh Bedrosian, a spokeswoman for Netanyahu's office said Monday.",
      "She added that Vance and his wife were also expected in the country \"for a few days and will be meeting with the prime minister,\" but neither she nor the White House have confirmed the Vances' arrival date.",
      "Witkoff and Kushner were entrusted by Mr. Trump to broker the peace deal, and in an exclusive interview with 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday, they said an apology phone call from Netanyahu to Qatar's leader, about unprecedented airstrikes on the U.S. ally's capital, Doha, and a moment of personal connection between Witkoff and Hamas' top negotiator marked two key turning points that led to the ceasefire."

      "Most cancer treatment centers encourage patients to ring a wall-mounted bell when they complete cancer treatment to signal their progress and encouragement to other patients. But it is unclear at this time whether Biden will need to undergo any other treatment, since doctors always need to assess a patient's progress in the weeks after they complete cancer treatment.",
      "Biden announced in May that he had an advanced stage of\u00a0prostate cancer\u00a0that has metastasized, or spread, to his bones, prompting an\u00a0outpouring of concern\u00a0and a new round of questions about his health and whether he faced undisclosed or unknown medical challenges during his presidency.",

      "Gleason scores are a grading system, and the lower the grade, the more cancer cells look like normal cells. A score of 9 is the second-highest,\u00a0CBS News previously reported, and places Biden in the most aggressive risk category.",
      "Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer that affects men, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. Age is the most common risk factor. The condition has many forms of treatment, including radiation, chemotherapy, surgery and hormone treatment.",
      "Biden also\u00a0underwent a skin cancer surgery\u00a0in September 2025. That procedure was a Mohs surgery, which involves cutting away thin layers of skin until only cancer-free tissue remains in the affected area.",
      "The former president is occasionally spotted in Washington, where he still keeps an office, and aboard Amtrak trains to and from his home in Delaware. He has begun fundraising and planning for an eventual library and museum documenting his time in the White House."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Monday cleared the way for the Trump administration to mobilize and deploy members of the Oregon National Guard to Portland while a legal challenge moves forward.",
      "A divided panel of three judges on U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit agreed to freeze a lower court order that had blocked the Trump administration from sending Oregon National Guard troops to Portland to protect federal immigration personnel and property.",
      "In its 2-1 ruling, the majority found the Trump administration is likely to prevail on the merits of its appeal by establishing that President Trump lawfully invoked a law known as Title 10 to bring Oregon's National Guard into federal service and send them to Portland.",
      "\"The statute delegates the authority to make that determination to the President and does not limit the facts and circumstances that the President may consider in doing so,\" Judges Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade, both appointed to the 9th Circuit by Mr. Trump, said in the opinion for the court.",
      "The judges found that the \"rather than reviewing the president's determination with great deference,\" the district court \"substituted\" its own findings related to the circumstances in Portland.",
      "\"Considering the totality of the circumstances, there is a colorable basis for the President's determination that he is unable with regular forces to execute the laws of the United States,\" the majority found.",
      "Judge Susan Graber dissented and urged the full 9th Circuit to reconsider the case \"before the illegal deployment of troops under false pretenses can occur.\"",
      "Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield echoed Graber's call and encouraged the Portland community to ensure the city remains \"peaceful and safe\" while the legal proceedings continue.",
      "\"Today's ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification,\" he said in a statement. \"We are on a dangerous path in America.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, appointed by Mr. Trump, had issued two temporary orders earlier this month regarding the president's federalization and deployment of National Guard members. The first forbade the administration from mobilizing Oregon National Guard troops and sending them to Portland, a decision that was appealed to the 9th Circuit. But the second prevented the administration from deploying any federalized National Guard members in Oregon.",
      "The Justice Department did not appeal that second decision, arguing instead that because it relies on the same legal reasoning as the first order regarding the Oregon National Guard, the district court would be required to dissolve it if the Trump administration succeeded in their bid for emergency relief. The 9th Circuit said in its decision that it agrees with the Trump administration that \"the first TRO and the second TRO rise or fall together on the merits of the issues raised in this motion for a stay pending appeal.\"",
      "The dispute involving Portland began in late September, when the president directed the Defense Department to coordinate the deployment of National Guard troops to Oregon. Mr. Trump's move came in response to protests outside of an immigration facility in Portland, some of which have turned violent. The president said on social media that he was sending in troops to protect the \"war ravaged\" city and immigration facilities from \"Antifa and other domestic terrorists,\" and was authorizing \"full force, if necessary.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth then issued a directive placing 200 members of the Oregon National Guard under federal control to protect immigration personnel and property at the immigration facility in Portland.",
      "Oregon officials, however, objected to the deployment, and they filed a lawsuit arguing that Mr. Trump lacked the authority to federalize the Oregon National Guard. Immergut, the district judge presiding over the case, swiftly issued a temporary order blocking the Trump administration from implementing the September directive that ordered the federalization and deployment of the Oregon National Guard.",
      "The judge found that Mr. Trump's determination that the National Guard had to be federalized because of the situation on the ground in Portland was \"untethered to the facts,\" and said that while the president is entitled to significant deference, that is \"not equivalent to ignoring the facts on the ground.\"",
      "But following that order, the Trump administration said it would be sending 300 members of California's National Guard to Portland. Mr. Trump had deployed members of the state's National Guard in Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration enforcement actions, and the 9th Circuit allowed their continued deployment in June.",
      "Immergut issued her second decision blocking the Trump administration from deploying any federalized National Guard members, which the Justice Department did not appeal.",
      "Mr. Trump has relied on as law known as Title 10 to bring members of state-run National Guards under federal control and has sought to deploy troops to Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland and Chicago. The law allows the president to federalize members of any state's Guard when he cannot execute U.S. laws with the regular forces or when there is a \"rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the government.",
      "In its decision, the 9th Circuit ruled that \"there is a colorable basis for the President's determination that he is unable with regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "The judges found that the district court discounted \"violent and disruptive events\" that occurred between June and August, some of which forced the closure of the ICE facility for several weeks. The president, they said, is \"entitled, and indeed, duty-bound, to evaluate the entire context of events leading up a decision to invoke\" Title 10.",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts to send National Guard troops to major U.S. cities has divided federal appeals courts. While the 9th Circuit has sided with the president in the early stages of cases challenging the president's deployment of troops from the Oregon and California National Guards, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit has prevented the administration from sending Illinois National Guard troops into Chicago.",
      "The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene, setting up an early test of the president's authority to mobilize and deploy National Guard troops over the objections of local leaders."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical minerals deal at the White House on Monday, as the U.S. eyes the country's rich rare earth resources while China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own minerals abroad.",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal, which will entail up to $8.5 billion in projects, had been negotiated over several months. Albanese said the deal would take the U.S.-Australia relationship \"to the next level.\"",
      "\"In about a year from now we'll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won't know what to do with them,\" Mr. Trump said, seated alongside Albanese. \"They'll be worth $2.\"",
      "Critical minerals include some of the elements necessary for modern technology, including lithium and silicon. They also include rare earth elements, which are used to make magnets that are used in defense and aerospace technology.",
      "The White House says the U.S. and Australian governments intend to invest more than $3 billion in critical minerals projects in the next six months. But the framework released by the Australians says the two countries will invest $1 billion in the next six months. The framework the Australians released says the two countries will work together to accelerate the secure supply of critical minerals for defense manufacturing, streamline or deregulate the permitting process for critical minerals and rare earths, protect domestic critical minerals and rare earth markets from unfair trade and address gaps in key supply chains, among other things.",
      "The U.S.-Australia deal comes after Beijing announced it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain. The move led Mr. Trump to threaten an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "The Trump administration and the president himself have been focused on securing rare earths deals, in part to find alternatives to China. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump struck a deal with Ukraine to\u00a0give the U.S. access to that country's minerals.",
      "Albanese said the critical minerals deal also signals the strong partnership between the U.S. and Australia.",
      "\"We are great friends and we're great allies,\" Albanese said Monday. \"And this is a relationship that's been forged in the battlefields of the world. We have stood side by side for freedom and democracy.\"",
      "The White House said Australia is also making new defense investments, including the purchase of $1.2 billion in unmanned underwater vehicles. Since February, the White House said Australia has contributed $1 billion to modernize the U.S. submarine industrial base. A trilateral security partnership called AUKUS involving the U.S., Australia and the United Kingdom \u2014 which was first struck during the Biden administration \u2014 aims to counter China in the Indo-Pacific, and producing submarines for that region is a key part of that security alliance.",

Last week, an effort to advance a House-passed measure to fund the government fell short of the 60 votes needed in the Senate for a tenth time, as Republicans sought to peel off support from Democrats. But they've been unable to win over additional support since the shutdown began, as most Democrats have demanded an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits as a condition for reopening the government.",

Still, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said last week that he's told Democrats he's willing to guarantee a vote on the tax credits, though he can't guarantee an outcome. And in a post on X Friday, the South Dakota Republican added that he's willing to sit down with Democrats on the health care issue, but only under the condition that the shutdown ends.",

      "Though there have been conversations between lawmakers about how to reopen the government, congressional leaders have not met since the shutdown began, last gathering on Sept. 29 for a meeting with President Trump at the White House.",
      "\"The president has spent one hour negotiating this issue with leadership in Congress. That's it, one hour,\" Kelly said. \"They need to get in the room and stay in a room until we can hash this out. The president has said he wants to fix this premium thing, and he wants the government open. That's what we want.\"",
      "Sen. Britt: Democrats need to \"do the right thing\"",

      "\"There are a lot of people that are being affected by the Democrats playing politics, and they need to actually do what's right, and that is work for the American people,\" Britt said. \"And so getting the government open is number one.\"",
      "On extending the health insurance tax credits, Britt reiterated that Republicans are willing to discuss the issue, but only once the government is reopened.",
      "\"We believe that you can walk and chew gum at the same time. Democrats, for some reason, don't think that that's possible,\" Britt said. \"They need to come to the table, open the government back up, and then we're happy to have a conversation about the broken system that they created and help them get out of their own mess.\"",
      "Britt said it's \"absolutely totally ridiculous to sit here and say we're afraid people cannot afford their health care, but at the same time we're going to deny them their paycheck.\"",
      "\"Those two things do not match up, and Democrats need to actually be honest about it and get the government back open,\" she added."

      "The Trump administration fired two federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia who voiced opposition to the criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James, a high-ranking Justice Department source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "Kristin Bird and Elizabeth Yusi were terminated Friday from their posts as assistant U.S. attorneys in the Eastern District of Virginia's Norfolk office, where James' case is being prosecuted. Yusi, according to her LinkedIn profile, had been an assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District since 2010. Bird's LinkedIn profile says that she had worked in the office since 2019 and was the deputy chief of the Narcotics and Violent Crime Unit. Her profile now says she's in the private sector.",
      "These firings continue an ongoing purge in the office, after the ouster of Erik Siebert, the former interim U.S. attorney who did not bring cases against James or former FBI Director James Comey.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "There have been other firings, too, including the office's top national security official, Michael Ben'Ary. He contends that he was fired because far-right social media figure Laura Loomer criticized him on X, but the Justice Department has not commented.",
      "First Assistant U.S. Attorney Maggie Cleary left her post just weeks after taking the position. She briefly led the Eastern District of Virginia last month, shortly after Siebert's departure from the office. Cleary had told the staff that she was Siebert's replacement, but days later, former White House aide and Trump personal lawyer Lindsey Halligan was sworn in as interim U.S. attorney. Less than a week after taking office, Halligan brought criminal charges against Comey, accusing him of lying to Congress.",
      "James is scheduled to be arraigned Friday, but it is not yet clear who will represent the Justice Department at the hearing because of the firings. Halligan secured James' indictment from a grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, and has never appeared in the Norfolk federal court.",
      "James' defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has retained a former Norfolk-based assistant U.S. attorney, Andrew Bosse, to serve as local counsel at James' arraignment and in future proceedings",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

    "story": [
      "President Trump reiterated his call on Sunday for an immediate halt to the three-and-a-half-year full-scale war in Ukraine, saying the battle lines should be frozen where they currently stand, with Russia's invading forces occupying most of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly rejected the idea of forfeiting the Donbas, or any other occupied ground, to Moscow in the years since Vladimir Putin ordered Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "\"Let it be cut the way it is. It's cut up right now. I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia. You leave it the way it is right now,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday on Air Force One, apparently referring specifically to the Donbas region. \"They can negotiate something later on down the line. But I said cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.\"",
      "The Donbas is a culturally and economically significant region, where many people speak Russian and have sympathies with Moscow. It is home to much of Ukraine's heavy industry and mining, accounting for about 16% of the country's GDP before the war started, according to The Associated Press.",
      "His remarks came two days after Mr. Trump met in person with Zelenskyy at the White House, which was a day after he spoke on the phone for two hours with Putin.",
      "Zelenskyy appeared to reiterate Kyiv's unwillingness to cede any territory for a ceasefire on Sunday, meanwhile, saying he had urged European leaders to apply \"the right kind of pressure\" on Russia.",
      "\"Almost every day now, we are communicating with leaders to ensure that we have a common position, all of us in Europe, on putting pressure on Russia \u2014 the right kind of pressure. We will grant the aggressor no gifts and forget nothing,\" Zelenskyy said in\u00a0a social media post.",
      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Sunday that Ukraine should not be put under pressure to make concessions on its territory.",
      "\"None of us should put pressure on Zelenskyy when it comes to territorial concessions,\" he said in a\u00a0social media post. \"We should all put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression. Appeasement never was a road to a just and lasting peace.\"",
      "In\u00a0another social media post, Zelenskyy called his Friday Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump a \"pointed conversation.\"",
      "The Financial Times newspaper reported Sunday that the meeting had descended into a shouting match on occasion, with Mr. Trump \"cursing all the time.\" Zelenskyy's delegation had brought in maps of the battlefield and Mr. Trump threw them to one side saying he was \"sick\" of seeing them, according to the FT report, which cited an official familiar with the matter.",
      "In response to a request for comment on the report of a second heated exchange between the leaders, the White House referred CBS News on Monday to Mr. Trump's remarks to reporters on Air Force One, without providing any additional description of the meeting. The Ukrainian president's office did not immediately reply to CBS News' request for comment for this story.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a post on his own Truth Social media platform that his meeting with the Ukrainian leader was \"very interesting, and cordial.\"",

Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts. They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday.",
      "The White House meeting followed Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy's\u00a0incredibly tense encounter\u00a0in front of television cameras in February.",
      "The president had spoken on Thursday with Putin by phone. Following that lengthy discussion, the White House said Mr. Trump would hold a second bilateral summit with Putin in Hungary's capital, Budapest, at a still-to-be-confirmed date to discuss a possible ceasefire deal. Mr. Trump said it would likely happen within a couple weeks.",
      "It will be their second bilateral meeting this year, following in-person talks in Alaska in August. That diplomatic effort by Mr. Trump yielded no tangible results, as Moscow has continued to press its military campaign, taking more territory on the ground and bombarding Ukrainian cities from the air. Putin has also so far declined Mr. Trump's urging to hold a three-way meeting with Zelenskyy.",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials told CBS News that\u00a0Zelenskyy had hoped Mr. Trump would agree to a deal at Friday's meeting to supply Tomahawk missiles, but that has not yet materialized. Kyiv sees the long-range, guided cruise missiles as vital to give Ukraine's armed forces the ability to hit critical military, logistical and energy targets deep inside Russia.",
      "Ukraine has ramped up its attacks on key Russian energy infrastructure in recent months. The General Staff of the Armed Services, Ukraine's military headquarters, said Sunday in\u00a0a social media post that it had struck the Orenburg Gas plant in southern Russia, one of the country's largest natural gas processing plants.",

      "The Trump administration has implemented a policy of selling weapons to Ukraine via America's European NATO allies, who foot the bill for the hardware, since August. That arrangement was worked out between Mr. Trump and other NATO leaders earlier in the summer.",
      "Despite positive signals from the White House in recent months regarding a potential deal to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles, Mr. Trump demurred on the subject when asked about it by reporters Friday during his meeting with Zelenskyy.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will decide whether a federal law that prohibits unlawful drug users from having firearms violates the Second Amendment, adding a second high-stakes case involving gun rights to the docket for its current term.",
      "The Justice Department is urging the high court to uphold the prohibition, arguing that there are \"narrow circumstances\" in which the government may burden the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. A federal appeals court ruled that the law is unconstitutional in most cases, and the Trump administration said that decision should be reversed.",
      "In agreeing to take up the Justice Department's appeal, the Supreme Court is adding another gun rights dispute to its docket this term. It will also decide whether states can prohibit concealed-carry permit holders from bringing their handguns onto private property open to the public.",
      "The law at issue in the case is the latest longstanding firearm restriction to come under legal scrutiny in the years since the Supreme Court ruled in 2022 that the Second Amendment protects the right to carry a firearm in public. In that landmark decision, the high court laid out a new standard for evaluating the constitutionality of gun restrictions focusing on the nation's history and tradition of firearms regulation.",
      "Since then, the Supreme Court has been asked to decide the constitutionality of state bans on assault weapons, as well as federal laws barring felons and people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from having guns. The high court in 2024 upheld the restriction targeting alleged domestic abusers, but has turned away the other cases.",
      "But the legal battles have continued to make their way to the Supreme Court, including over a provision of the 1968 Gun Control Act that prohibits a person \"who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance\" from having a gun.",
      "The same restriction drew attention after Hunter Biden, former President Joe Biden's son, was convicted last year for knowingly having a gun while he was addicted to illegal drugs. Biden\u00a0pardoned his son in December, weeks before he left office.",
      "The case before the high court involves Ali Danial Hemani, a dual citizen of the U.S. and Pakistan, who the government says is a drug dealer who also uses cocaine and marijuana, among other substances. During a search of Hemani's family home in Texas, FBI agents found a 9 mm pistol, marijuana and cocaine. He was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2023 for violating the drug-user-in-possession prohibition, related to what prosecutors said was his \"habitual\" use of marijuana.",
      "Hemani sought to have the indictment tossed out on the ground that the law violates the Second Amendment as applied to him, and a district court ordered it to be dismissed. While his case was proceeding, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled in two other similar challenges that the prohibition is unconstitutional.",
      "In one of those cases, involving a \"nonviolent, marijuana-smoking gunowner,\" the 5th Circuit found that \"our history and tradition do not support disarming a sober person based solely on past substance usage,\" but may support \"some limits on a presently intoxicated person's right to carry a weapon.\"",
      "It went on to rule in Hemani's favor in light of that 2024 ruling.",
      "The Trump administration appealed that decision to the Supreme Court and wrote that the 5th Circuit was wrong to find that the Second Amendment precludes Congress from keeping habitual drug users from having firearms.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the firearms ban for illegal drug users complies with the Second Amendment, since it targets a category of people \"who pose a clear danger of misusing firearms: habitual users of unlawful drugs.\" He argued that the law prohibits gun possession temporarily \u2014 anyone who stops habitually using illegal substances can have firearms.",
      "\"The habitual drug user, in other words, always has the option of restoring his own right to keep and bear arms by simply forgoing the habitual use of unlawful drugs,\" Sauer wrote. \"But if he lacks the motivation or will to comply with the law because of addiction or other factors, that fact alone provides powerful evidence of society's interest in keeping him disarmed.\"",
      "Sauer compared the law to founding-era measures restricting the rights of drunkards, or those who abused alcohol habitually. He also noted that legislatures have been prohibiting drug addicts or users from having guns since the 1920s and 1930s. More than 30 states have laws barring drug users or addicts from possessing firearms.",
      "Hemani's lawyers urged the Supreme Court to turn his case away, arguing that the 5th Circuit's decision is \"exceedingly narrow.\""

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested."

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown."

Jen Kiggans of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this month with bipartisan support, the \"Pay Our Troops Act of 2026,\" which would keep members of the military and Coast Guard paid during a shutdown, but it did not pass in time because the House is out of session until Oct 7.",
      "During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October. The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a\u00a0press release\u00a0it would \"offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support.\" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a \"no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.\"",
      "The Defense Department published contingency guidance on Friday, outlining its priority missions and stating that unused funds passed in the reconciliation bill over the summer could be considered to support them. The list includes, in order: operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East operations, the U.S. missile defense project Golden Dome for America, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions.",
      "The guidance estimates about 406,000 of the department's 741,000 civilian employees will be required to work in the event of a shutdown because their mission is critical and not easily carried out by any U.S. service member.",
      "While a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget said some civilians could be laid off during the shutdown, the guidance released by the Defense Department outlines furloughs but no cuts to the civilian workforce.",
      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care will be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted."

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "IT enhancement activities, public relations and training",
      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",

    "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 09:23:08 -0400",
    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich."

      "Hamas said that it was not involved in any of the clashes that had been reported earlier in Rafah in southern Gaza.",
      "\"We reaffirm our full commitment to implement everything that was agreed upon, foremost of which is a ceasefire across all areas of the Gaza Strip,\" the group's Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades said in a statement. \"We have no knowledge of any incidents or clashes taking place in the Rafah area, as these are red zones under the occupation's control, and contact with the remaining groups of ours there has been cut off since the war resumed in March of this year.\"",
      "Hospital sources in Gaza told CBS News that at least 38 people have been killed in the territory since Sunday morning.",
      "Israel's military said it had struck dozens of what it called Hamas targets.",
      "Later on Sunday, Israel's military said that \"in accordance with the directives of the political echelon,\" it had begun \"re-enforcing the ceasefire following its violation by the terrorist organization Hamas.\"",
      "\"The IDF will continue to enforce the ceasefire agreement and will respond forcefully to any violation of the agreement,\" the Israeli military said in a statement.",
      "Later Sunday night, President Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that the ceasefire was still in effect, and blamed \"some rebels within\" Gaza, rather than Hamas itself, for the alleged breaches.",
      "\"But either way, it's going to be handled properly. It's going to be handled toughly, but properly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The strikes came as Israel\u00a0identified the remains of two hostages released by Hamas overnight, and the Palestinian group said talks to launch the second phase of ceasefire negotiations have begun.",
      "Meanwhile, Israel threatened to keep the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt closed \"until further notice.\" The statement from Netanyahu's office said reopening Rafah would depend on how Hamas fulfills its obligation under the ceasefire deal to return the remains of all the deceased hostages. The bodies of 16 hostages, two of them foreign nationals, are still in Gaza, according to the Israeli media.",
      "At the same time, the U.S. State Department\u00a0warned that it had received \"credible reports\"\u00a0indicating that Hamas may be planning an attack on \"Palestinian civilians\" in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The State Department did not provide any details on the timing or location of the possible attack, saying only that it \"would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts.\"",
      "On Sunday, Hamas rejected the claims, calling them \"false allegations.\" The group accused Israel of supporting armed groups operating in Israeli-controlled areas. Hamas urged the U.S. administration to pressure Israel to stop supporting the gangs and \"providing them a safe haven.\"",
      "Israel and Gaza implemented the first phase of Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan\u00a0last week, with a ceasefire taking effect in Gaza after Israeli troops pulled back to a predetermined line. Since then, Hamas has released 20 living hostages and the remains of 12 others. Meanwhile, Israel has released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The released Palestinians include 250 people who are serving life sentences, and about 1,700 others who have been detained and held without charges since the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "Israel has released 150 bodies of Palestinians back to Gaza, including 15 on Sunday, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Israel has neither identified the bodies nor said how they died.",
      "The next stages of the ceasefire are expected to focus on disarming Hamas, Israeli withdrawal from additional areas it controls in Gaza and future governance of the devastated territory."

      "Federal officials found what they have described as a \"suspicious stand\" near an area of Palm Beach International Airport used by Air Force One when President Trump travels to Florida, FBI Director Kash Patel said Sunday\u00a0in a social media post.",
      "The U.S. Secret Service said in a statement it found \"items of interest\" while sweeping the area before Mr. Trump's arrival on Friday. The agency didn't identify the items, but it shared a photo of what appeared to be a platform or hunting stand set up high in a tree.",
      "\"There was no impact to any movements and no individuals were present or involved at the location,\" Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News that the hunting stand was across a highway in a tree line more than 200 yards away and had apparently been there for months, based on its condition. Mr. Trump was not using that part of the airport in the past year due to construction, so it would not have had a direct line of sight to Mr. Trump and was not part of the Secret Service's sweeps of the site",
      "Once construction ended, Air Force One started using that area of the airport again, and the stand was discovered by the Secret Service right away in its initial sweeps, the sources said.",
      "It was not immediately clear when construction ended.",
      "The president flew into the Palm Beach airport on Friday and is set to head back to Washington on Sunday after spending the weekend at his Mar-A-Lago club.",
      "The airport is located less than a mile north of Mr. Trump's golf club in West Palm Beach, which was the site of an attempted assassination against the president last year. Prosecutors say Ryan Routh \u2014 who was found guilty in the assassination plot last month \u2014 pointed a rifle from the golf club's tree line, but Secret Service agents spotted him and opened fire.",
      "Mr. Trump survived a separate assassination attempt just two months earlier, when a bullet grazed his ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The security breaches drew new scrutiny to the Secret Service, which suspended several agents earlier this year."

      "Crowds hit the streets Saturday in cities and towns across the country to vent their anger over President Trump's policies in \"No Kings\" protests, which Republicans have slammed as \"Hate America\" rallies.",
      "People carrying signs with slogans such as \"Nothing is more patriotic than protesting\" or \"Resist Fascism\" packed into New York City's Times Square and rallied by the thousands in parks in Boston, Atlanta and Chicago. Demonstrators marched through Washington and downtown Los Angeles and picketed outside capitols in several Republican-led states, a courthouse in Billings, Montana, and at hundreds of smaller public spaces.",
      "Mr. Trump's Republican Party disparaged the demonstrations as \"Hate America\" rallies, but in many places the events looked more like a street party. There were marching bands, huge banners with the U.S. Constitution's \"We The People\" preamble that people could sign, and demonstrators wearing inflatable costumes, particularly frogs, which have emerged as a sign of resistance in Portland, Oregon.",
      "More than 2,700 demonstrations were planned coast to coast, with at least one in every state and even near Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, where he is spending the weekend.",
      "Organizers said the nationwide rally drew more people than similar events on June 14, which was Mr. Trump's birthday and the day of a giant\u00a0military parade in the U.S. capital, the No Kings Coalition said in a news release.",
      "\"The millions of people protesting are centered around a fierce love for our country. A country that we believe is worth fighting for,\" said Katie Bethell, the executive director of MoveOn, an advocacy group that's part of the larger coalition.",
      "Protestors said they were outraged over the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented migrants and its deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles.",
      "Since then, Mr. Trump \u2014 who returned to the White House in January \u2014 has ordered National Guard troops into Washington, D.C. and Memphis. Planned deployments to Chicago and Portland\u00a0have so far been blocked in the courts.",
      "Demonstrators are also upset over Mr. Trump's attacks on the media, prosecutions of his political opponents and a host of other actions they see as authoritarian.",
      "On its website, \"No Kings\" organizers say, \"The president thinks his rule is absolute. But in America, we don't have kings and we won't back down against chaos, corruption, and cruelty.\"",
      "\"This president is a disgrace and I hope there will be millions in the street today,\" Stephanie, a 36-year-old hospital worker who did not give her last name, told AFP in the Queens borough of New York, where hundreds had already gathered in the morning.",
      "Tens of thousands of people gathered in Portland for a peaceful demonstration downtown. Later in the day, tensions grew as a few hundred protesters and counterprotesters showed up at a U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement building, with federal agents at times firing tear gas to disperse the crowd and city police threatening to make arrests if demonstrators blocked streets.",
      "The building has been the site of mostly small nightly protests since June \u2014 the reason the Trump administration has cited for trying to deploy National Guard troops in Portland, which a federal judge has at least temporarily blocked.",
      "More than 10,000 people showed up at Lafitte Greenway for the No King New Orleans rally, organizers told CBS News. When asked about how numbers were counted, they said it was based on RSVPs online and other on-the-ground crowd-counting measures.",
      "In Chicago's Grant Park, Democratic Congresswoman Delia Ramirez led the crowd in a chant, \"When I say people, you say power!\"",
      "\"May that powerful voice be heard from here to Washington, D.C., and every corner of this country,\" Ramirez said, CBS Chicago reported. \"I am the proud daughter of Guatemalan immigrants, and I will never be ashamed of my roots.\"",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker joined the demonstration.",
      "In San Francisco hundreds of people spelled out \"No King!\" and other phrases with their bodies on Ocean Beach. Hayley Wingard, who was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, said she too had never been to a protest before. Only recently she began to view Trump as a \"dictator.\"",
      "\"I was actually OK with everything until I found that the military invasion in Los Angeles and Chicago and Portland \u2014 Portland bothered me the most, because I'm from Portland, and I don't want the military in my cities. That's scary,\" Wingard said.",
      "In Miami, one demonstrator told CBS Miami\u00a0that she showed up to give voice to those who feel the most marginalized in the country.",
      "\"I'm most worried about people who aren't doing well in this country, people who are being marginalized,\" said Roxanne Featherly. \"The hate [and] I guess you can say the bipolarism that we have.\"",
      "More than 1,500 people gathered in Birmingham, Alabama, evoking and openly citing the city's history of protests and the critical role it played in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement two generations ago, the Associated Press reported.",
      "\"It just feels like we're living in an America that I don't recognize,\" Jessica Yother, a mother of four, told the AP. \"It was so encouraging. I walked in and thought, 'Here are my people.'\"",
      "Outside of the U.S., crowds gathered outside U.S. embassies in Berlin, Rome, Paris and Sweden in solidarity with the protesters in the U.S. Photos show them holding signs denouncing fascism and dictatorships.",
      "So far, the president's response to the events has been muted.",
      "\"They're saying they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king,\" he told Fox News show \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" in an interview that will air on Sunday.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Air Force One later Sunday night, Mr. Trump called the protests \"a joke\" and said the participants were \"not representative of this country.\"",
      "Top surrogates, like House Speaker Mike Johnson, dismissed the event. Johnson called it the \"Hate America Rally.\"",
      "\"You're going to bring together the Marxists, the Socialists, the Antifa advocates, the anarchists and the pro-Hamas wing of the far-left Democrat Party,\" he told reporters.",
      "Republican lawmaker Tom Emmer also used the \"Hate America\" phrase and referred to participants as the \"terrorist wing\" of the Democratic Party. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin activated the National Guard and announced a \"substantially increased police presence\" ahead of the planned events. He said that protestors have the right to free speech but that \"does not include the destruction of property, looting, vandalism, disruption of traffic, or violence of any kind\u2014for which there will be zero tolerance.\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott also said the National Guard and public safety employees will be surged to Austin to handle expected protests.",
      "Top Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer encouraged demonstrators to let their voices be heard.",
      "\"I say to my fellow Americans this No Kings Day: Do not let Donald Trump and Republicans intimidate you into silence. That's what they want to do. They're afraid of the truth,\" he wrote on X. \"Speak out, use your voice, and exercise your right to free speech.\""

      "\"The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are\u2014they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda,\" Hegseth wrote.",
      "At least 32 people have been killed in U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats. The Trump administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, arguing that the narcotics they smuggle kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, constituting an \"armed attack.\"",
      "\"When they're loaded up with drugs, they're fair game, and every one of those ships were,\" President Trump told reporters last week.",
      "The strikes have drawn some pushback from lawmakers who have pressed for more evidence that the boats were carrying drugs, and argue the administration hasn't made the case that the attacks are legally permitted.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that he believed the legal justification offered to members of Congress was \"very convoluted.\"",
      "\"They had a very hard time explaining to us ... the legal rationale for doing this and the constitutionality of doing it,\" Kelly said. \"The brief we got had a tremendous number of holes in it, and they had to go round and around to give us the legal rationale for doing this.\"",
      "The Venezuelan and Colombian governments have also criticized the strikes. This weekend, Colombian President Gustavo Petro accused the U.S. of hitting a fishing vessel in one of its strikes. Mr. Trump later called Petro an \"illegal drug leader\" and threatened to cut off U.S. aid to the South American country."

      "And because so much of the online world's plumbing is underpinned by a handful of companies, when something goes wrong \"it's very difficult for users to pinpoint what is happening because we don't see Amazon, we just see Snapchat or Roblox,\" Burgess said."

    "summary": "Officials warned that attackers could exploit the vulnerabilities to steal credentials, move laterally through networks, and potentially take full control of targeted systems.",
    "story": [
      "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday issued a sweeping emergency order directing all federal agencies to immediately patch critical vulnerabilities in certain devices and software made by F5, a technology vendor, after confirming a nation-state cyber actor gained unauthorized access to F5's source code.",
      "CISA \u2014 a part of the Department of Homeland Security that manages risks to the U.S.'s cyber and physical infrastructure \u2014 issued\u00a0Emergency Directive 26-01\u00a0following the company's disclosure that a foreign threat actor had maintained long-term, persistent access to its internal development and engineering environments using source code.",
      "Officials warned that attackers could exploit the vulnerabilities to steal credentials, move laterally through networks, and potentially take full control of targeted systems. F5 said it first discovered the attack in August but did not disclose exactly when it began.",
      "\"This directive addresses an imminent risk,\" Nick Anderson, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said during a news briefing Wednesday. \"A nation-state actor could exploit these flaws to gain unauthorized access to embedded credentials and API keys. That's an unacceptable risk to federal networks.\"",
      "F5 is a publicly traded American technology company headquartered in Seattle, Washington.",
      "Justice Department delayed breach announcement",
      "Earlier Wednesday, F5 disclosed the breach in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "In the SEC 8-K report, F5 said the Justice Department on Sept. 12 \"determined that a delay in public disclosure was warranted.\" It's one of the first times a company has publicly acknowledged DOJ intervention under the SEC's\u00a0cybersecurity disclosure rules.",
      "The rules were adopted in July 2023 and require companies to report cybersecurity incidents within four business days of determining that a material event has occurred.",
      "\"Under item 1.05(c), the Department may grant a delay after finding that a disclosure required by Item 1.05 would pose a substantial risk to national security or public safety,\" a Department of Justice spokesperson told CBS News in a statement.",
      "F5 CEO Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou signed the filing, which said the company learned of the attack on Aug. 9 and launched an investigation alongside cybersecurity firms CrowdStrike, Mandiant and others, with assistance from federal law enforcement and unnamed \"government partners.\"",
      "\"During the course of its investigation, the Company determined that the threat actor maintained long-term, persistent access to certain F5 systems, including the BIG-IP product development environment and engineering knowledge management platform,\" F5 wrote in its filing.",
      "What's in the CISA emergency order",
      "CISA's order directed federal civilian executive branch agencies \u2014 which include the Department of Justice, Department of State, Department of the Treasury and the Federal Trade Commission, among others \u2014 to inventory F5 BIG-IP products, which are application delivery and security services.",
      "The federal agencies need to evaluate if their networks are accessible from the public internet, and apply newly released updates from F5 by Oct. 22, the emergency order stated. They must also complete scoping reports identifying affected devices by Oct. 29.",
      "There are currently thousands of F5 devices in use across federal networks, Anderson told CBS News. The cybersecurity agency said it expects to know more about the scope of exposure by the end of the month.",
      "CISA Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala said in a statement that the agency remains \"steadfast\" in its mission to defend U.S. networks, even amid the ongoing government shutdown and the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.",
      "\"The alarming ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited demands immediate and decisive action,\" Gottumukkala said. \"These same risks extend beyond federal systems \u2014 to any organization using this technology.\"",
      "No confirmed compromises yet, but broader campaign underway",
      "Anderson confirmed that CISA is not aware of any current data breaches within federal agencies, though the directive is designed to uncover any potential compromises. He said the campaign appears to be part of a broader nation-state effort targeting elements of the U.S. technology supply chain, not just one vendor.",
      "\"The broader goal here is persistent access \u2014 to gather intelligence, hold infrastructure hostage, or position themselves for future attacks,\" Anderson told CBS News during Wednesday's briefing.",
      "CISA declined to name the country behind the attack, citing ongoing investigations.",
      "\"The U.S. government is not making a public attribution at this time,\" said Marcy McCarthy, CISA's director of public affairs.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the head of threat intelligence for Unit 42, a team of cybersecurity experts and researchers at Palo Alto Networks, said the theft of F5 BIG-IP source code is \"significant, as it potentially facilitates rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities.\"",
      "\"Generally, if an attacker steals source code, it takes time to find exploitable issues,\" Unit 42 Chief Technology Officer Michael Sikorski said. \"In this case, they also stole information on undisclosed vulnerabilities that F5 was actively working to patch. This provides the ability for threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities that have no public patch, potentially increasing speed to exploit creation.\"",
      "Working through the government shutdown",
      "Pressed on the government's ability to respond amid furloughs and staffing reductions at CISA, Anderson acknowledged the agency's challenges but said it remains operational.",
      "\"We're sustaining essential functions and providing timely guidance like this to mitigate risk,\" he said. \"This is core mission work for CISA \u2014 exactly what we should be doing.\"",
      "Anderson also said the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, a law that had governed federal-private sector cyber information sharing before sunsetting, did not delay coordination with F5 or impact the agency's response.",
      "While the directive applies only to federal agencies, CISA is strongly urging state, local and private sector organizations using F5 technologies to follow the same patching and mitigation steps. F5's products, including its BIG-IP line, are widely used in both government and commercial networks to manage internet traffic and security."

      "Seattle was up 3-1 in the 7th inning of the winner-take-all game, but a 3-run home run off the bat of George Springer catapulted the Blue Jays into the lead. The Mariners never even had a baserunner over the final two innings.",
      "Springer's was the first go-ahead homer in Game 7 history when a team trailed by multiple runs in the seventh inning or later.",

      "The Blue Jays were playing in a Game 7 for the first time since losing at home to Kansas City in the 1985 ALCS.",
      "Toronto slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. arrived at the stadium wearing a Maple Leafs hockey jersey with Auston Matthews' name and number. Fortunately for Guerrero, his team did not follow in Matthews' footsteps, as the star forward is 0-6 in Game 7s with Toronto during his 10 seasons in the NHL.",
      "Cal Raleigh and Julio Rodr\u00edguez each hit a solo home run for the Mariners in the team's first Game 7 but Seattle failed to reach its first World Series, leaving the heartbroken Mariners as the only major league team without a pennant.",
      "Addison Barger walked to begin the seventh and Isiah Kiner-Falefa followed with a single. Seattle right-hander Bryan Woo was removed after Andr\u00e9s Gim\u00e9nez advanced the runners with a sacrifice bunt, and Springer greeted Eduard Bazardo with his fourth homer of this postseason, a 381-foot drive to left field that got the sellout crowd of 44,770 roaring.",
      "The Dodgers, meanwhile, have overrun opponents during the postseason. Ohtani is starring at the plate and on the mound, a performance that would be deemed CGI if not witnessed by thousands in person.",
      "\"Sometimes you've got to check yourself and touch him to make sure he's not just made of steel,\" teammate Freddie Freeman said.",
      "But before his three-homer at the plate and 10-strikeouts, six-scoreless innings mound show Friday night, Ohtani's bat had been slumping.",
      "He's hitting .220 with five homers and nine RBIs in the postseason and is 2-0 with a 2.25 ERA in a pair of pitching starts, striking out 19 and walking four in 12 innings.",
      "Los Angeles is the first defending champion to reach the World Series since the 2009 Philadelphia Phillies, who lost to the New York Yankees in six games. No team has won consecutive titles since the Yankees took three in a row from 1998-2000. The gap is the longest in baseball history, topping the previous high between the 1977-78 Yankees and the 1992-93 Blue Jays."

      "\"If you are traveling today, please arrive at your station at your regularly scheduled time typically 30 minutes prior to your train's departure,\" Amtrak said in a statement shared with CBS News.",
      "Amazon and Amazon Web Services did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "How did this start?",
      "Amazon first reported the outage issue at 3:11 a.m. ET. Shortly after, it said its services in its eastern U.S. region were disrupted and engineers were working to understand what was causing the problem. At 5:27 a.m. ET, AWS began reporting progress, saying, \"We are seeing significant signs of recovery.\"",
      "A little more than a half-hour later, it said, \"We continue to observe recovery across most\" of the affected services.",
      "AWS customers include some of the world's biggest businesses and organizations.",
      "\"So much of the world now relies on these three or four big (cloud) compute companies who provide the underlying infrastructure that when there's an issue like this, it can be really impactful across a broad range, a broad spectrum\" of online services, said Patrick Burgess, a cybersecurity expert at U.K.-based BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT.",
      "\"The world now runs on the cloud\" and the internet is seen as a utility like water or electricity as we spend so much of our lives on our smartphones, Burgess said.",
      "And because so much of the online world's plumbing is underpinned by a handful of companies, when something goes wrong \"it's very difficult for users to pinpoint what is happening because we don't see Amazon, we just see Snapchat or Roblox,\" Burgess said."

    "summary": "A lapse in funding due to the shutdown could have a devastating effect on the millions of Americans who rely on the federal food stamps program for groceries.",
    "story": [
      "States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.",
      "\"Starting October 16, SNAP \u00a0[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0ends and funds are released to PA,\" reads a\u00a0notice from the Pennsylvania state website.",
      "New Jersey,\u00a0Maryland, New York and\u00a0Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.",
      "The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be \"insufficient funds\" to pay full November SNAP benefits.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program. Advocates, meanwhile, have warned the effects could be devastating.",
      "\"These are, for the most part, working individuals who still are living paycheck to paycheck,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger.",
      "How SNAP benefits are normally administered",
      "Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use\u00a0to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.",
      "While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident and SNAP recipient, told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on whether that option is under consideration.",
      "During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, Plata-Nino said.",
      "\"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ...\" Plata-Nino said. \"They have the money, so it really is a policy choice.\"",
      "It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.",
      "Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states."

      "Former President Joe Biden has completed a round of radiation therapy to treat an aggressive form of prostate cancer \u2014 an encouraging sign of progress \u2014 but one that does not signal the end of his treatment.",
      "A Biden spokeswoman confirmed to CBS News Monday that the former president, who turns 83 next month, finished several weeks of radiation therapy treatment Monday at Penn Medicine Radiation Oncology in Philadelphia. His office first announced Oct. 11 that the former president had been undergoing radiation treatment for prostate cancer for several weeks.",
      "\"He rang the bell today,\" Biden spokeswoman Kelly Scully said.",
      "Ashley Biden, the daughter of the former president,\u00a0posted on Instagram\u00a0a quick video clip of her father ringing the bell, with the caption, \"Rung the bell! Thank you to the incredible doctors, nurses, and staff at Penn Medicine. We are so grateful!\"",
      "Subsequent photos posted by the one-time first daughter show the former president posing with a medical professional, and another with former first lady Jill Biden and two of their grandchildren with the caption, \"Dad has been so damn brave throughout his treatment. Grateful.\"",
      "Most cancer treatment centers encourage patients to ring a wall-mounted bell when they complete cancer treatment to signal their progress and encouragement to other patients. But it is unclear at this time whether Biden will need to undergo any other treatment, since doctors always need to assess a patient's progress in the weeks after they complete cancer treatment.",
      "Biden announced in May that he had an advanced stage of\u00a0prostate cancer\u00a0that has metastasized, or spread, to his bones, prompting an\u00a0outpouring of concern\u00a0and a new round of questions about his health and whether he faced undisclosed or unknown medical challenges during his presidency.",
      "According to a statement from his office in May, the former president was diagnosed with \"prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone\" after a small nodule was found in the prostate.",
      "Gleason scores are a grading system, and the lower the grade, the more cancer cells look like normal cells. A score of 9 is the second-highest,\u00a0CBS News previously reported, and places Biden in the most aggressive risk category.",
      "Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer that affects men, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. Age is the most common risk factor. The condition has many forms of treatment, including radiation, chemotherapy, surgery and hormone treatment.",
      "Biden also\u00a0underwent a skin cancer surgery\u00a0in September 2025. That procedure was a Mohs surgery, which involves cutting away thin layers of skin until only cancer-free tissue remains in the affected area.",
      "The former president is occasionally spotted in Washington, where he still keeps an office, and aboard Amtrak trains to and from his home in Delaware. He has begun fundraising and planning for an eventual library and museum documenting his time in the White House."

    "story": [
      "A Rhode Island man\u00a0who appeared to fake his death and flee the United States to avoid rape charges was sentenced to prison Monday on one of two rape convictions in Utah.",
      "Nicholas Rossi, 38, was sentenced to five years in prison by District Judge Barry Lawrence in Salt Lake City, CBS affiliate KUTV reported.",
      "During the impact statement before Rossi was sentenced, the victim said Rossi left a \"trail of fear, pain and destruction\" behind him.",
      "\"This is not a plea for vengeance. This is a plea for safety and accountability, for recognition of the damage that will never fully heal,\" she told the court.",
      "Rossi \"uses rape to control women\" and posed a risk to community safety, argued Deputy Salt Lake County District Attorney Brandon Simmons, a prosecutor in the case.",
      "The sentence is the first of two scheduled for Rossi after he was convicted separately in August and September of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 4 for the second conviction, also for five years to life in prison.",
      "In August, jurors found Rossi guilty of rape after a three-day trial in which his accuser and her parents each took the stand. Rossi did not testify on his own behalf. Given a chance to speak before being sentenced Monday, Rossi maintained his innocence.",
      "\"I am not guilty of this. These women are lying,\" Rossi said softly, with a raspy voice.",
      "It took more than a decade from the time of the rapes to his convictions. Utah authorities began searching for Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, when he was identified in 2018 through a decade-old DNA rape kit tied to the other case. He was among thousands of rape suspects identified and later charged when Utah made a push to clear its rape kit backlog.",
      "Months after he was charged in that case, an online obituary claimed Rossi died on Feb. 29, 2020, of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But police in his home state of Rhode Island, along with his former lawyer and a former foster family, cast doubt on whether he was dead.",
      "He was arrested in Scotland the following year while receiving treatment for COVID-19. Hospital staff recognized his distinctive tattoos \u2014 including the crest of Brown University inked on his shoulder, although he never attended \u2014 from an Interpol notice.",
      "He was extradited to Utah in January 2024 after a protracted court battle. At the time, Rossi insisted he was an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight who was being framed. Investigators say they identified at least a dozen aliases Rossi used over the years to evade capture.",
      "In his first Utah trial, Rossi's public defender denied the rape claim and urged jurors not to read too much into his move overseas.",
      "The victim had been living with her parents and recovering from a traumatic brain injury in 2008 when she responded to a personal ad Rossi posted on Craigslist. They began dating and were engaged within a couple weeks.",
      "She testified that Rossi asked her to pay for dates and car repairs, lend him $1,000 so he wouldn't be evicted, and take on debt to buy their engagement rings. He grew hostile soon after their engagement and raped her in his bedroom one night after she drove him home, she said.",
      "She went to police years later after hearing Rossi was accused of raping another woman in Utah around the same time.",
      "The victim in that case went to police soon after Rossi attacked her at his apartment in Orem. The woman had gone there to collect money she said he stole from her to buy a computer.",
      "Rossi grew up in foster homes in Rhode Island and returned there before he appeared to fake his death and flee the country. He was previously wanted in the state for failing to register as a sex offender. The FBI says he also faces fraud charges in Ohio, where he was convicted of sex-related charges in 2008."

Some varieties also include cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical compound found in marijuana or hemp that proponents say helps relieve pain, anxiety and other health symptoms. The drinks come in different forms including seltzers, juices, sodas and teas.",
      "Consumer demand for cannabis beverages is growing as Americans drink less booze. According to a July Gallup survey, the percentage of U.S. adults who say they consume alcohol fell to 54%, the lowest level since 1939, when the polling organization first started tracking people's drinking behavior. More Americans also believe even moderate alcohol consumption is unhealthy, the poll found.",
      "Hundreds of brands small and large now hawk cannabis beverages, many promising to help take the edge off in social settings.",
      "\"There's a replacement factor going on between THC beverages and wine and beer and distilled spirits,\" said Beau Whitney, chief economist at Whitney Economics, an Oregon-based consultancy focused on the cannabis and hemp industry.",
      "THC beverage sales in the U.S. are expected to grow from $1.1 billion last year to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035, according to Whitney Economics.",
      "\"The remarkable growth and innovation we're seeing in the hemp-derived beverage space is a clear sign of consumer enthusiasm and entrepreneurial success,\" Michelle Rutter Friberg, director of government relations at the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CBS News in an email.",

      "Several THC beverage brands market themselves as nonalcoholic alternatives and say their drinks contain zero calories and zero sugar. Doctors, however, warn that cannabis beverages can come with side effects.",
      "Whether smoked or ingested as an edible or drink, cannabis can affect the brain, heart, lungs and mental health, CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder said, adding that the drug can trigger anxiety, paranoia, elevated heart rate and, in rare cases, psychosis.",
      "Potential short-term effects of cannabis include issues with memory, focus and coordination, said Gounder.",
      "\"People may have trouble remembering new information, paying attention or moving smoothly,\" she said. \"This can slow reaction time, cause slurred speech, and raise the risk of car crashes by 30%-40%. The effects depend on how much cannabis is used, how it's taken and how used to it someone is.\"",
      "Heavy or long-term intake of the drug, especially in teens, can lead to lasting issues with memory, attention and decision-making, said Gounder. Long-term use, she added, can also lead to cannabis-use disorder, which is a clinical term for addiction,\u00a0defined\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as when users are unable to stop using cannabis even though it's causing them health and social problems.",
      "Some heavy users may also develop severe nausea and vomiting, Gounder said. Those most at risk are pregnant individuals, teens, and people with mental or heart conditions, she added.",
      "The potential effects of a cannabis-infused drink can be felt in as little as 15 to 20 minutes, compared with 30 to 90 minutes for an edible, according to Dr. Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, in a recent article on the school's website.",
      "\"If you are interested in trying it and it is legal for you to do so, be mindful about controlling the experience until you know how a particular product affects you,\" Gruber said.",

THC beverages can be legally sold in 44 states in total, \u00a037 of which allow sales outside of the marijuana dispensary systems according to Whitney.",
      "In those areas, the beverages can commonly be found at restaurants, bars, grocery stores and liquor stores.",
      "In Atlanta, for example, Scofflaw Beverage Company \u2014 previously a brewery fighting for its financial life after the pandemic \u2014 revived its business by canning drinks without alcohol that contain 5 to 10 milligrams of hemp-derived THC, CBS News Atlanta reports. Cannabis products are legal in Georgia and can be shipped across the U.S.",
      "\"It's really been an almost seismic shift in customer preference,\" Scofflaw co-founder Matt Shirah told CBS News Atlanta. \"The THC infused business has the potential to be 10 to 20 times the size of beer business.\"",
      "Cannabis beverages have even caught the attention of major retailers like Target. The Minneapolis-based chain confirmed to CBS News that it is testing the sale of THC beverages at certain Target liquor stores in Minnesota. While other retailers, such as Total Wine & More, already sell cannabis beverages, Target is the first big-box player to explore the THC beverage market.",
      "\"At Target, we're always exploring new ways to meet our guests' evolving preferences and needs,\" a spokesperson said.",

      "\"The statute delegates the authority to make that determination to the President and does not limit the facts and circumstances that the President may consider in doing so,\" Judges Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade, both appointed to the 9th Circuit by Mr. Trump, said in the opinion for the court.",
      "The judges found that the \"rather than reviewing the president's determination with great deference,\" the district court \"substituted\" its own findings related to the circumstances in Portland.",
      "\"Considering the totality of the circumstances, there is a colorable basis for the President's determination that he is unable with regular forces to execute the laws of the United States,\" the majority found.",
      "Judge Susan Graber dissented and urged the full 9th Circuit to reconsider the case \"before the illegal deployment of troops under false pretenses can occur.\"",
      "Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield echoed Graber's call and encouraged the Portland community to ensure the city remains \"peaceful and safe\" while the legal proceedings continue.",
      "\"Today's ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification,\" he said in a statement. \"We are on a dangerous path in America.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, appointed by Mr. Trump, had issued two temporary orders earlier this month regarding the president's federalization and deployment of National Guard members. The first forbade the administration from mobilizing Oregon National Guard troops and sending them to Portland, a decision that was appealed to the 9th Circuit. But the second prevented the administration from deploying any federalized National Guard members in Oregon.",
      "The Justice Department did not appeal that second decision, arguing instead that because it relies on the same legal reasoning as the first order regarding the Oregon National Guard, the district court would be required to dissolve it if the Trump administration succeeded in their bid for emergency relief. The 9th Circuit said in its decision that it agrees with the Trump administration that \"the first TRO and the second TRO rise or fall together on the merits of the issues raised in this motion for a stay pending appeal.\"",
      "The dispute involving Portland began in late September, when the president directed the Defense Department to coordinate the deployment of National Guard troops to Oregon. Mr. Trump's move came in response to protests outside of an immigration facility in Portland, some of which have turned violent. The president said on social media that he was sending in troops to protect the \"war ravaged\" city and immigration facilities from \"Antifa and other domestic terrorists,\" and was authorizing \"full force, if necessary.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth then issued a directive placing 200 members of the Oregon National Guard under federal control to protect immigration personnel and property at the immigration facility in Portland.",
      "Oregon officials, however, objected to the deployment, and they filed a lawsuit arguing that Mr. Trump lacked the authority to federalize the Oregon National Guard. Immergut, the district judge presiding over the case, swiftly issued a temporary order blocking the Trump administration from implementing the September directive that ordered the federalization and deployment of the Oregon National Guard.",
      "The judge found that Mr. Trump's determination that the National Guard had to be federalized because of the situation on the ground in Portland was \"untethered to the facts,\" and said that while the president is entitled to significant deference, that is \"not equivalent to ignoring the facts on the ground.\"",
      "But following that order, the Trump administration said it would be sending 300 members of California's National Guard to Portland. Mr. Trump had deployed members of the state's National Guard in Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration enforcement actions, and the 9th Circuit allowed their continued deployment in June.",
      "Immergut issued her second decision blocking the Trump administration from deploying any federalized National Guard members, which the Justice Department did not appeal.",
      "Mr. Trump has relied on as law known as Title 10 to bring members of state-run National Guards under federal control and has sought to deploy troops to Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland and Chicago. The law allows the president to federalize members of any state's Guard when he cannot execute U.S. laws with the regular forces or when there is a \"rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the government.",
      "In its decision, the 9th Circuit ruled that \"there is a colorable basis for the President's determination that he is unable with regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "The judges found that the district court discounted \"violent and disruptive events\" that occurred between June and August, some of which forced the closure of the ICE facility for several weeks. The president, they said, is \"entitled, and indeed, duty-bound, to evaluate the entire context of events leading up a decision to invoke\" Title 10.",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts to send National Guard troops to major U.S. cities has divided federal appeals courts. While the 9th Circuit has sided with the president in the early stages of cases challenging the president's deployment of troops from the Oregon and California National Guards, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit has prevented the administration from sending Illinois National Guard troops into Chicago.",
      "The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene, setting up an early test of the president's authority to mobilize and deploy National Guard troops over the objections of local leaders."

    "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 16:18:14 -0400",
    "summary": "The checks-and-balances of our government have been increasingly tested in ways our founding fathers never anticipated, yet the Constitution remains, in the words of one expert, \"absolutely eternal and timeless.\"",
    "story": [
      "For more than two centuries, amendments have allowed our Constitution to grow with the country. The 13th Amendment, for instance put an end to slavery, while the 19th gave women the vote. It was intended to be amended.",
      "But you have to go back more than 50 years to find a meaningful change to the Constitution. Asked how long we can work as a country without updating the Constitution, Jeffrey Rosen, president and CEO of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, replied, \"The real fear that the founders had was that we would stop listening to each other. They thought self-government was hard, and that crucially requires deliberation and debate.\"",
      "Before anyone could even consider a national constitution, of course, there was the Declaration of Independence, ratified in 1776, and the Articles of Confederation, agreed to in 1777, a full decade before the new Constitutional Convention.",
      "Historian Jill Lepore's latest book, \"We the People,\" describes a Constitution ratified by the people it governed, and designed to be changed by the very same. In other words, we aren't stuck with any of it. But at the outset, she said, \"The support for the Constitution and its ratification was pretty slender.\"",
      "In addition to the three equal branches of government and a schedule of regular elections, the U.S. Constitution includes a mechanism for changing the Constitution itself. \"They came up with this Article V of the Constitution, which is the amendment provision, which had been insisted on by the people,\" said Lepore. \"People are like, if we're going to have a written document, we need to have the ability to amend it ourselves.\"",
      "In fact, Lepore says, though we often think of the Constitution as the final draft, it was always designed to be a work in progress. The founding fathers expected it to be revised constantly. \"Yeah, they absolutely did,\" Lepore said. \"And remember, like, a whole bunch of them refused to sign it, 'cause they didn't think it was good enough.\"",
      "Before the states would agree to ratify it, she says, some insisted on revisions; there were more than 200 amendments proposed by the states. The result: a set of amendments, whittled down to ten, that we now know as the Bill of Rights. Ratified in 1791, they include some of the bedrock ideas of modern America: freedom of speech; freedom of religion; a right to bear arms; and, for the accused, the promise of a fair trial.",
      "But the Constitution was also a tangle of compromises, none more tragic than the compromise over the institution of slavery and the exclusion of women from political life.",
      "Rosen says there was one concession, though, that James Madison, one of the document's framers, would not make. \"He refused to admit into the Constitution an endorsement of slavery,\" Rosen said. \"He said the idea that there could be property in men wouldn't be written into the Constitution, 'cause they wanted to leave it up to future generations to eradicate slavery.\"",
      "Though it took 100 years and a civil war, America at last had what some call its \"second founding,\" with the addition of amendments that, among other things, abolished slavery, guaranteed citizenship to the formerly enslaved, and gave all men the right to vote regardless of race \u2013 trying to make the promise of the Declaration of Independence (which was absent from the Constitution) real.",
      "\"It was just this incredible day,\" Lepore said, of when the House voted on the amendment abolishing slavery. \"The galleries were packed. They even had women in the galleries. Frederick Douglass' son, Charles Remond, was in the gallery. And the House just was nearly blown over by the burst of energy.\"",
      "These days, even though the language of the Constitution hasn't changed lately, the interpretations still have, with the Supreme Court regularly reinterpreting our nation's founding framework. But Rosen noted, \"None of the founders expected constitutional change to come mostly from the Supreme Court.\"",
      "In fact, the Constitution does not give the Supreme Court the right to determine the constitutionality of a law passed by Congress; they just assert the right to do so.",
      "Rosen says the Constitution is still the answer to our problems, not the cause, and yet, for the moment, he worries about how it's being used.",
      "\"There's a broad agreement that checks-and-balances are not working now the way they were supposed to,\" he said. \"Congress has stopped acting and refuses to check presidents of its own parties. And the courts have become vastly more powerful than the founders anticipated in deciding almost every political question, and insisting that they have the last word.",
      "\"So, whether or not you like what's going on in our politics today, I think you have to say this is not what the founders intended,\" Rosen said.",
      "The founders never claimed to have created a perfect country. But in the Constitution, they did try to pass on the tools to build a \"more perfect union.\"",
      "To people who say the Constitution may have no bearing on life today, Rosen said, \"The Constitution was written in the 18th century, but it was expressing principles vindicated as recently as yesterday's news. The basic idea that a president should not be a king, that power corrupts, that we are a government of laws \u2013 these are the ancient ideas of freedom. And every country that has forgotten them has descended into dictatorship and tyranny. It is historically irresponsible to dismiss the Constitution as outdated. It's absolutely eternal and timeless.\"",

      "With Halloween falling on a Friday this year, celebrations are expected to be bigger. Consumers are opening their wallets for everything spooky, from candy to costumes, despite paying higher prices for many items.",
      "U.S. consumers are expected to spend a record $13.1 billion this Halloween, up from $11.6 billion last year, according to the National Retail Federation. That breaks the previous record of $12.2 billion set in 2023. On average, Americans will shell out $114.45 per person, nearly $11 more than last year.",
      "The Hershey Co., which makes Halloween favorites including Hershey bars, Kit Kat bars and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, told CBS News there was \"no impact on Halloween candy prices this season.\" But prices at the register are telling a different story. According to CBS, a box of 48 full-size chocolate bars has jumped from $40 to more than $50.",
      "Cocoa prices have more than doubled since early 2024, according to the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute's latest analysis. Extreme weather in West Africa, which supplies 70% of the world's cocoa, has slashed yields, with heavy rains, crop disease and droughts causing the biggest supply deficit in more than 60 years.",
      "The world's top producers, Ivory Coast and Ghana, saw cocoa output drop by more than 25% and 31%, respectively, in the last year.",
      "Price-conscious shoppers have some options other than chocolate treats this year, Stew Leonard Jr., the president and CEO of Stew Leonard's, a family-owned grocery chain in the Northeast, told CBS News. He recommended gummy bears and Starbursts instead.",
      "\"They are about 18 cents. So almost half the price [of a mini chocolate bar],\" he said.",
      "Alcohol prices may also hit consumers' wallets, given a 15% tariff on imported spirits. That could encourage shoppers to turn to domestically produced wines, beers and spirits.",
      "Nearly 90% of Halloween products, such as costumes and decorations, contain at least one component made overseas \u2014 most often in China \u2014 according to the Halloween and Costume Association. These products are vulnerable to supply chain issues and a 30% tariff rate on Chinese imports.",

    "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:14:42 -0400",
    "summary": "A new study by VantageScore found that auto loan delinquency rates have increased more than 50% over the last 15 years.",
    "story": [
      "Americans continue to\u00a0fall behind\u00a0on auto loan payments in the face of record-high car prices and high interest rates.",
      "A recent\u00a0study by VantageScore found that auto loan delinquency rates have increased by more than 50% over the past 15 years. The upward trend continues even as delinquency rates in other loan categories \u2014 including credit card loans, personal loans and home equity loans \u2014 have declined, according to the report.",
      "\"Back in 2010, auto loans were the least risky of all products at that point in time,\" Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, said in a recent video. \"Now, as we look at 2025, it's actually \u2014 excluding student loans \u2014 the riskiest credit product.\"",
      "While a growing number of Americans have been\u00a0falling behind\u00a0on car payments for years, auto loan delinquency rates have picked up after a pandemic-induced dip.",
      "The most recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve shows that auto loan delinquency rates \u2014 defined as the portion of loan balances that are at least 30 days past due \u2014 were at 3.8% in June 2024, the highest level since June 2010.",
      "The rise in delinquency rates includes all household income groups, VantageScore's data shows. What's more, delinquency rates among prime borrowers have climbed faster than subprime borrowers on an absolute basis.",
      "\"The broad-based decline in consumer credit quality indicates that economic pressures are no longer concentrated among some VantageScore credit tiers and income levels,\" Susan Fahy, executive vice president and chief digital officer at VantageScore, said in a statement.",
      "VantageScore also found that the average loan amount has increased 57% over the last 15 years \u2014 a bigger jump than any other loan category, including mortgages.",
      "Why people are falling behind on payments",
      "One of the main factors hurting car owners is rapidly increasing monthly payments.\u00a0Data from the Federal Reserve shows that average monthly payments increased roughly $130 from January 2020 to January 2023, to $600. By contrast, in the three-year-period from January 2017 to January 2020, average monthly car loan payments had increased approximately $40, from $430 to $470.",
      "Payments have continued to escalate: One in five new car loans have monthly payments that exceed $1,000, according to auto researcher\u00a0Edmunds.",
      "Behind the ballooning payments are rising car prices and interest rates. The average cost of a new vehicle is now more than $50,000, according to September data from Cox Automotive \u2014 the highest it's ever been.",
      "\"Prices for both new and used vehicles surged during and after the pandemic and they haven't come down,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Those higher vehicle costs have encouraged more buyers to finance their purchases, often at increased interest rates, Kates added. The average auto loan rate in September was 7% for new cars and approximately 11% for used cars, September\u00a0data\u00a0from Edmunds shows.",
      "\"The combination of elevated prices and borrowing costs has led to longer loan terms, which increase the total interest paid and raise the risk of borrowers becoming underwater as their cars depreciate faster than they pay down the loan,\" Kates said.",
      "Broader economic conditions are also influencing delinquency rates, experts have noted. Fahy from VantageScore said that in addition to higher borrowing costs, the rise in auto loan delinquencies could also be attributed to inflation and an unsteady employment picture.",
      "While inflation has cooled since its 2022 peak, many Americans are still feeling stretched by sky-high prices. A Bankrate analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data found that while the gap is narrowing, average wages are still trailing behind inflation and won't catch up until mid-2026."

    "summary": "With open enrollment starting soon, employees could get sticker shock, with their costs expected to rise 6% to 7% for 2026, a new study says.",
    "story": [
      "Open enrollment \u2014 the annual window when employees can adjust their benefits \u2014 may deliver sticker shock this year. Workers are likely to pay between 6% to 7% more for their 2026 employer-sponsored health insurance, more than double the current rate of inflation, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from consultant Mercer.",
      "That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that four in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24."

      "More than 220 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza since the war started, according to the international advocacy group Reporters Without Borders.",

    "summary": "The Australian prime minister said the critical minerals deal takes the U.S.-Australia relationship \"to the next level.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical minerals deal at the White House on Monday, as the U.S. eyes the country's rich rare earth resources while China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own minerals abroad.",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal, which will entail up to $8.5 billion in projects, had been negotiated over several months. Albanese said the deal would take the U.S.-Australia relationship \"to the next level.\"",
      "\"In about a year from now we'll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won't know what to do with them,\" Mr. Trump said, seated alongside Albanese. \"They'll be worth $2.\"",
      "Critical minerals include some of the elements necessary for modern technology, including lithium and silicon. They also include rare earth elements, which are used to make magnets that are used in defense and aerospace technology.",
      "The White House says the U.S. and Australian governments intend to invest more than $3 billion in critical minerals projects in the next six months. But the framework released by the Australians says the two countries will invest $1 billion in the next six months. The framework the Australians released says the two countries will work together to accelerate the secure supply of critical minerals for defense manufacturing, streamline or deregulate the permitting process for critical minerals and rare earths, protect domestic critical minerals and rare earth markets from unfair trade and address gaps in key supply chains, among other things.",
      "The U.S.-Australia deal comes after Beijing announced it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain. The move led Mr. Trump to threaten an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "The Trump administration and the president himself have been focused on securing rare earths deals, in part to find alternatives to China. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump struck a deal with Ukraine to\u00a0give the U.S. access to that country's minerals.",
      "Albanese said the critical minerals deal also signals the strong partnership between the U.S. and Australia.",

      "London \u2014 Sumo's biggest international showcase in history rocked London this week, spotlighting more than 40 wrestlers across 100 bouts with blistering palm thrusts, stunning face slaps and an unforgettable lightning-fast overarm throw. The final championship clash of the Grand Sumo Tournament was a battle of giants \u2014 a Goliath versus only a slightly smaller Goliath.",
      "Colliding with the force of a few tons and sending clay into the air, 330-pound Hoshoryu Tomokatsu seized the blue silk belt \u2014 the mawashi \u2014 of 420-pound Onosato Daiki. Momentum carried the heavier man to the edge of the ring, then Hoshoryu powered him out, sealing a perfect 5-0 record in just 10 seconds. The 5,000-strong crowd inside London's sold-out Royal Albert Hall erupted in cheers.",
      "\"I'm just glad to have got through the five days with no injuries,\" Hoshoryu said backstage after claiming the championship trophy.",
      "He hadn't planned a celebration, but told CBS News he's ready to go where his career takes him.",
      "\"If someone decides that we'll do this in America, of course I'll be there,\" said the 26-year-old.",
      "For young American boys watching and dreaming of entering sumo's sacred ring, his advice was rooted in self-discipline and perseverance.",
      "\"You must work hard to be a sumo wrestler if that is your dream. Everyone has dreams \u2014 but only you can achieve them,\" he said.",
      "Sumo is a life of devotion. Wrestlers typically begin training around age 15, the minimum age to join a heya, or stable, where they live communally and train full-time under a stablemaster, a retired wrestler. To outsiders, sumo may look like a sport but for its practitioners, it is a way of life shaped by 1,500 years of ritual and discipline, rooted in Shinto prayers for a bountiful harvest.",
      "London's Royal Albert Hall \u2014 better known for the echoes of The Beatles, Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruce Springsteen than the slaps and grunts of massive muscle men \u2014 was transformed into a place of reverence to reflect that.",
      "\"I've worked here 11 years, and this is one of the most exciting weeks I've ever been part of,\" said David Gamble, head of programming at the hall, who gave CBS News a special, behind-the-scenes tour.",
      "\"We've had teams, artisans in the U.K. create this 1.5 ton roof,\" he said, gesturing to the massive hanging roof over the ring reminiscent of a Shinto shrine. \"It is more than sport \u2026 we had a ring blessing ceremony where the Sumo Association blessed the ring in the same way that they would for all of their shows in Tokyo.\"",
      "He explained the few rows of red floor mats circling the ring were the most coveted \u2014 and the riskiest.",
      "\"You're really going to have to stay focused because at any moment there might be a 400 pound sumo wrestler bearing down on you, so no time to check your phone,\" Gamble said with a grin. These seats are \"the most expensive, the best and the most dangerous.\"",
      "Big wrestlers meant big logistics. The venue brought in 10 tons of clay to build the sacred ring \u2014 the dohy\u014d \u2014 and had to procure nearly a ton of rice. The athletes consume up to 10,000 calories a day, mostly in the form of a protein-rich stew, called chanko-nabe.",
      "The heaviest sumo wrestler ever recorded remains Konishiki Yasokichi, the Hawaiian-American who weighed 633 pounds at his peak. He competed at the Royal Albert Hall in 1991, when sumo first ventured beyond Japan's shores \u2014 the last time the hall hosted the sport until now.",
      "This week's event marked sumo's first overseas tournament in 34 years, and only its second in history. The more than 40 \"rishiki\" \u2014 not all from Japan but Mongolia and Ukraine too \u2014 stopped a lot of people in their tracks outside Buckingham Palace and Big Ben, crossing Abbey Road like The Beatles and at the \"Harry Potter\" Platform 9 3/4 attraction at King's Cross station.",
      "As Hoshoryu raised his championship trophy \u2014 the ornate Emperor's Cup, flown in from Tokyo \u2014 the moment symbolized more than victory. It was a celebration of an ancient Japanese tradition finding new life \u2014 and new fans \u2014 far from home."

You leave it the way it is right now,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday on Air Force One, apparently referring specifically to the Donbas region. \"They can negotiate something later on down the line. But I said cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.\"",
      "The Donbas is a culturally and economically significant region, where many people speak Russian and have sympathies with Moscow. It is home to much of Ukraine's heavy industry and mining, accounting for about 16% of the country's GDP before the war started, according to The Associated Press.",
      "His remarks came two days after Mr. Trump met in person with Zelenskyy at the White House, which was a day after he spoke on the phone for two hours with Putin.",
      "Zelenskyy appeared to reiterate Kyiv's unwillingness to cede any territory for a ceasefire on Sunday, meanwhile, saying he had urged European leaders to apply \"the right kind of pressure\" on Russia.",
      "\"Almost every day now, we are communicating with leaders to ensure that we have a common position, all of us in Europe, on putting pressure on Russia \u2014 the right kind of pressure. We will grant the aggressor no gifts and forget nothing,\" Zelenskyy said in\u00a0a social media post.",
      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Sunday that Ukraine should not be put under pressure to make concessions on its territory.",
      "\"None of us should put pressure on Zelenskyy when it comes to territorial concessions,\" he said in a\u00a0social media post. \"We should all put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression. Appeasement never was a road to a just and lasting peace.\"",
      "In\u00a0another social media post, Zelenskyy called his Friday Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump a \"pointed conversation.\"",
      "The Financial Times newspaper reported Sunday that the meeting had descended into a shouting match on occasion, with Mr. Trump \"cursing all the time.\" Zelenskyy's delegation had brought in maps of the battlefield and Mr. Trump threw them to one side saying he was \"sick\" of seeing them, according to the FT report, which cited an official familiar with the matter.",
      "In response to a request for comment on the report of a second heated exchange between the leaders, the White House referred CBS News on Monday to Mr. Trump's remarks to reporters on Air Force One, without providing any additional description of the meeting. The Ukrainian president's office did not immediately reply to CBS News' request for comment for this story.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a post on his own Truth Social media platform that his meeting with the Ukrainian leader was \"very interesting, and cordial.\"",
      "Speaking with reporters on Sunday, in remarks that were embargoed until Monday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine shared \"President Trump's positive outlook if it leads to the end  of the war. After many rounds of discussion over more than two hours  with him and his team, his message, in my view, is positive \u2014 that we  stand where we stand on the line of contact, provided all sides  understand what is meant.\"",
      "\"I told him, as I likewise strongly suggested to President Putin, that it is time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL! Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts. They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday.",
      "The White House meeting followed Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy's\u00a0incredibly tense encounter\u00a0in front of television cameras in February.",
      "The president had spoken on Thursday with Putin by phone. Following that lengthy discussion, the White House said Mr. Trump would hold a second bilateral summit with Putin in Hungary's capital, Budapest, at a still-to-be-confirmed date to discuss a possible ceasefire deal. Mr. Trump said it would likely happen within a couple weeks.",
      "It will be their second bilateral meeting this year, following in-person talks in Alaska in August. That diplomatic effort by Mr. Trump yielded no tangible results, as Moscow has continued to press its military campaign, taking more territory on the ground and bombarding Ukrainian cities from the air. Putin has also so far declined Mr. Trump's urging to hold a three-way meeting with Zelenskyy.",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials told CBS News that\u00a0Zelenskyy had hoped Mr. Trump would agree to a deal at Friday's meeting to supply Tomahawk missiles, but that has not yet materialized. Kyiv sees the long-range, guided cruise missiles as vital to give Ukraine's armed forces the ability to hit critical military, logistical and energy targets deep inside Russia.",
      "Ukraine has ramped up its attacks on key Russian energy infrastructure in recent months. The General Staff of the Armed Services, Ukraine's military headquarters, said Sunday in\u00a0a social media post that it had struck the Orenburg Gas plant in southern Russia, one of the country's largest natural gas processing plants.",
      "\"The Defense Forces of Ukraine are consistently implementing a set of measures to damage critical enterprises involved in ensuring the needs of the Russian Armed Forces,\" the general staff staff.",
      "The Trump administration has implemented a policy of selling weapons to Ukraine via America's European NATO allies, who foot the bill for the hardware, since August. That arrangement was worked out between Mr. Trump and other NATO leaders earlier in the summer.",
      "Despite positive signals from the White House in recent months regarding a potential deal to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles, Mr. Trump demurred on the subject when asked about it by reporters Friday during his meeting with Zelenskyy.",
      "\"One thing I have to say, we want Tomahawks, also. We don't want to be giving away things that we need to protect our country,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Vice President JD Vance told reporters on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews on Sunday that Mr. Trump had not yet made a final decision on whether to grant Ukraine access to the missiles.",
      "\"If he thinks it is in America's best interest to sell additional weapons to Europe, he will do that, but right now he has not made that decision with regards to Tomahawks,\" Vance said."

    "summary": "An Israeli security official said the transfer of aid into the territory is halted \"until further notice,\" the first major test of the ceasefire.",
    "story": [
      "Gaza's fragile ceasefire faced its first major test Sunday as Israeli forces launched a wave of deadly strikes, saying Hamas militants had killed two soldiers, and an Israeli security official said the transfer of aid into the territory was halted.",
      "The military later said it resumed enforcing the ceasefire, and the official confirmed to The Associated Press that aid deliveries would resume Monday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he's not authorized to discuss the issue with the media.",
      "Earlier Sunday, Israel's military said it hit multiple targets in the Gaza Strip using aircraft and artillery, after it accused Hamas of shooting at Israeli soldiers. Military officials later said two soldiers were killed.",
      "An Israeli military official told CBS News that Hamas had targeted its soldiers with a rocket-propelled grenade and sniper fire.",
      "\"Both of the incidents happened in an Israeli-controlled area, east of the yellow line,\" the official said. \"This is a bold violation of the ceasefire.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held consultations with Israel's security heads and his office said in a statement that he had directed the military to take \"strong action\" against what he called \"terrorist targets.\" He did not threaten to return to war.",
      "Hamas said that it was not involved in any of the clashes that had been reported earlier in Rafah in southern Gaza.",
      "\"We reaffirm our full commitment to implement everything that was agreed upon, foremost of which is a ceasefire across all areas of the Gaza Strip,\" the group's Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades said in a statement. \"We have no knowledge of any incidents or clashes taking place in the Rafah area, as these are red zones under the occupation's control, and contact with the remaining groups of ours there has been cut off since the war resumed in March of this year.\"",
      "Hospital sources in Gaza told CBS News that at least 38 people have been killed in the territory since Sunday morning.",
      "Israel's military said it had struck dozens of what it called Hamas targets.",
      "Later on Sunday, Israel's military said that \"in accordance with the directives of the political echelon,\" it had begun \"re-enforcing the ceasefire following its violation by the terrorist organization Hamas.\"",
      "\"The IDF will continue to enforce the ceasefire agreement and will respond forcefully to any violation of the agreement,\" the Israeli military said in a statement.",
      "Later Sunday night, President Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that the ceasefire was still in effect, and blamed \"some rebels within\" Gaza, rather than Hamas itself, for the alleged breaches.",
      "\"But either way, it's going to be handled properly. It's going to be handled toughly, but properly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The strikes came as Israel\u00a0identified the remains of two hostages released by Hamas overnight, and the Palestinian group said talks to launch the second phase of ceasefire negotiations have begun.",
      "Meanwhile, Israel threatened to keep the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt closed \"until further notice.\" The statement from Netanyahu's office said reopening Rafah would depend on how Hamas fulfills its obligation under the ceasefire deal to return the remains of all the deceased hostages. The bodies of 16 hostages, two of them foreign nationals, are still in Gaza, according to the Israeli media.",
      "At the same time, the U.S. State Department\u00a0warned that it had received \"credible reports\"\u00a0indicating that Hamas may be planning an attack on \"Palestinian civilians\" in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The State Department did not provide any details on the timing or location of the possible attack, saying only that it \"would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts.\"",
      "On Sunday, Hamas rejected the claims, calling them \"false allegations.\" The group accused Israel of supporting armed groups operating in Israeli-controlled areas. Hamas urged the U.S. administration to pressure Israel to stop supporting the gangs and \"providing them a safe haven.\"",
      "Israel and Gaza implemented the first phase of Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan\u00a0last week, with a ceasefire taking effect in Gaza after Israeli troops pulled back to a predetermined line. Since then, Hamas has released 20 living hostages and the remains of 12 others. Meanwhile, Israel has released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The released Palestinians include 250 people who are serving life sentences, and about 1,700 others who have been detained and held without charges since the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "Israel has released 150 bodies of Palestinians back to Gaza, including 15 on Sunday, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Israel has neither identified the bodies nor said how they died.",
      "The next stages of the ceasefire are expected to focus on disarming Hamas, Israeli withdrawal from additional areas it controls in Gaza and future governance of the devastated territory."

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military struck another alleged drug-carrying vessel on Friday, killing three people, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Sunday. It is the seventh known attack since last month.",
      "Hegseth said Friday's strike targeted a boat linked to Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional, a Colombian guerrilla group that the U.S. has considered a terrorist organization since the 1990s. He alleged in a post on X that the boat \"was traveling along a known narco-trafficking route, and was transporting substantial amounts of narcotics.\"",
      "The defense secretary said the strike took place in international waters and within the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility, which includes the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are\u2014they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda,\" Hegseth wrote.",
      "At least 32 people have been killed in U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats. The Trump administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, arguing that the narcotics they smuggle kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, constituting an \"armed attack.\"",
      "\"When they're loaded up with drugs, they're fair game, and every one of those ships were,\" President Trump told reporters last week.",
      "The strikes have drawn some pushback from lawmakers who have pressed for more evidence that the boats were carrying drugs, and argue the administration hasn't made the case that the attacks are legally permitted.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that he believed the legal justification offered to members of Congress was \"very convoluted.\"",
      "\"They had a very hard time explaining to us ... the legal rationale for doing this and the constitutionality of doing it,\" Kelly said. \"The brief we got had a tremendous number of holes in it, and they had to go round and around to give us the legal rationale for doing this.\"",
      "The Venezuelan and Colombian governments have also criticized the strikes. This weekend, Colombian President Gustavo Petro accused the U.S. of hitting a fishing vessel in one of its strikes. Mr. Trump later called Petro an \"illegal drug leader\" and threatened to cut off U.S. aid to the South American country."

    "story": [
      "Thieves carried out a brazen daytime heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday morning, breaking into the famed landmark using a basket lift to force open a window, smash display cases and steal jewelry that has \"inestimable value,\" France's interior minister and the museum said.",
      "The break-in happened in broad daylight while tourists were already inside the Louvre, the world's most visited museum. It was forced to close in the aftermath of the incident as authorities began to investigate. Police sealed the museum gates and visitors were ushered out. No injuries were reported, according to spokespeople for the Louvre.",
      "\"A robbery took place this morning at the opening of the Louvre Museum,\" French Culture Minister Rachida Dati wrote on X, while the museum cited \"exceptional reasons\" for the closure.",
      "Dati called the strike the work of \"professionals,\" describing it on TF1 TV network as \"a four-minute operation carried out without violence.\"",
      "Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez previously told France Inter radio that the heist took seven minutes and the thieves used a disc cutter to slice through the panes. He said it was \"manifestly a team that had done scouting.\"",
      "The heist occurred at around 9:30 a.m., when several people broke into the Louvre through the Galerie d'Apollon and stole jewelry before fleeing the scene on motorcycles, a museum spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"An investigation has begun, and a detailed list of the stolen items is being compiled,\" the statement said. \"Beyond their market value, these items have inestimable heritage and historical value.\"",
      "France's ministers of culture and interior were at the Louvre and working with the museum's management as well as law enforcement, the statement continued, adding that \"all possible measures are being taken to recover the stolen items.\"",
      "The interior ministry similarly said that forensic work was underway Sunday morning and a precise inventory of the stolen items was being compiled.",
      "Video from the scene showed confused tourists being ushered out of the glass pyramid and surrounding courtyards as officers shut the iron gates and closed nearby streets along the Seine.",
      "The Galerie d'Apollon is a vaulted hall in the Denon wing that displays part of the French Crown Jewels beneath a ceiling painted by King Louis XIV's court artist, according to the ministry.",
      "French daily Le Parisien reported the thieves entered via the Seine-facing facade, where construction is underway, and used a freight elevator to reach the gallery. After breaking windows, they reportedly took nine pieces from the jewelry collection of Napoleon and the Empress. One stolen jewel was later found outside the museum, the paper reported, adding that the item was believed to be Empress Eug\u00e9nie's crown and that it had been broken.",
      "Security around the marquee works remains tight. The Mona Lisa is protected by bulletproof glass and a custom high-tech display system as part of broader anti-theft measures across the museum.",
      "Staffing and protection have been flashpoints at the Louvre. The museum delayed opening during a June staff walkout over overcrowding and chronic understaffing. Unions have warned that mass tourism strains security and visitor management.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear whether staffing levels played any role in Sunday's theft.",
      "In January, President Emmanuel Macron announced a decade-long \"Louvre New Renaissance\" plan \u2014 roughly \u20ac700 million to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece its own dedicated gallery by 2031 \u2014 but workers say relief has been slow to reach the floor.",
      "The theft, less than half an hour after doors opened, echoes other recent European museum raids.",
      "In 2019, thieves smashed vitrines in Dresden's Green Vault and carried off diamond-studded royal jewels worth hundreds of millions of euros. In 2017, burglars at Berlin's Bode Museum stole a 100-kilogram (220-pound) solid-gold coin. In 2010, a lone intruder slipped into Paris's Museum of Modern Art and escaped with five paintings, including a Picasso.",
      "The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous came in 1911, when the Mona Lisa vanished from its frame, stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia, a former worker who hid inside the museum and walked out with the painting under his coat. It was recovered two years later in Florence \u2014 an episode that helped make Leonardo da Vinci's portrait the world's best-known artwork.",
      "Home to more than 33,000 works spanning antiquities, sculpture and painting \u2014 from Mesopotamia, Egypt and the classical world to European masters \u2014 the Louvre's star attractions include the Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo and the Winged Victory of Samothrace.

      "The Metropolitan Police in London said it is \"actively looking into\" a newspaper report that Prince Andrew asked an officer assigned to him as a bodyguard \"to dig up dirt\" on sexual assault accuser Virginia Giuffre in 2011.",
      "The report, in The Mail on Sunday, said that Andrew provided the bodyguard with Giuffre's date of birth and confidential Social Security number to try to find out if she had a criminal record or any potentially damaging information about her just before the U.K.-based newspaper was due to publish a photo of Giuffre's first meeting with the prince.",

      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",

She has accused Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, of trafficking her to Andrew. The two\u00a0reached an out-of-court settlement\u00a0in 2022. Andrew has denied the allegations.",

      "Andrew was widely criticized for failing to show empathy for Epstein's victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with the disgraced financier.",
      "The BBC interview, in which he said he cut off contact with Epstein in 2010, came back to haunt him and sowed the seeds for his demotion when it emerged that he had emailed Epstein 12 weeks later.

    "summary": "Britain's Prince Andrew will not use his royal titles any longer, he said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Britain's Prince Andrew will not use his royal titles, including the Duke of York, any longer, he said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace on Friday. The announcement comes after the release of excerpts from a posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had repeatedly claimed to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to Andrew.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "He continued: \"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, sued Andrew in 2021, alleging that he forced her to engage in sexual acts against her will when she was 17 years old. The two reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022. Andrew has denied the allegations.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Guiffre's family said they believe Prince Andrew's decision to give up his royal titles is \"vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere.\" They called on Charles to strip him of the title of prince.",
      "\"This moment serves as victory for Virginia, who consistently maintained, 'He knows what happened, I know what happened, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me,'\" the statement said. \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by Epstein and his co-conspirators.\"",
      "Giuffre was one of the most vocal accusers of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of helping Epstein groom, recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Giuffre alleged Maxwell connected her with Epstein, which Maxwell denies.",
      "In an excerpt of her memoir published by The Guardian, Giuffre describes her alleged encounters with Andrew in detail.",
      "\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\"",
      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has long been a source of tabloid fodder because of his links to Epstein, other questionable characters and money woes.",
      "His attempt to refute Giuffre's allegations backfired during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals \u2014 such as disputing Giuffre's recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring \u2014 and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.",
      "Within days of the interview, Andrew stepped down from his royal duties.",
      "As well as no longer being known as the Duke of York, Andrew will also give up other titles: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.",
      "He will remain a prince, which he has been entitled to since birth."

      "\"President Trump ordered the Department of Justice to prosecute Mr. Comey because of personal spite and because Mr. Comey has frequently criticized the president for his conduct in office,\" Fitzgerald and Carmichael said on Monday, before ticking through a lengthy timeline of the strained relationship between Trump and his onetime FBI director.",

In order to do so, Comey's legal team must prove to the court both that prosecutors were acting with genuine animus in bringing the case against him \u2014 and that prosecutors singled him out because of that animus.",
      "Still, the filings made clear that Comey's legal team has no shortage of evidence to cite in their attempt to meet that burden \u2014 including, primarily, statements and admissions made by Trump and administration officials, as they noted Monday.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy discusses the legal challenges to the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to American cities on 'The Sunday Briefing.'",
      "The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday ruled that President Donald Trump can deploy Oregon National Guard troops into the city of Portland, delivering a significant victory to the Trump administration as it continues its effort to send federal forces into Democratic-led cities despite a string of recent setbacks in other district and appeals courts.",
      "Judges on the three-member panel ruled 2-1 to authorize Trump's deployment. Judge Ryan Nelson and Judge Bridget Bade, both appointed by Trump, sided with the administration in the majority ruling, with the lone Clinton-appointed judge, Susan Graber, dissented.",
      "\"After considering the record at this preliminary stage, we conclude that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12406(3), which authorizes the federalization of the National Guard when \u2018the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States,\u2019\" the majority said.",
      "The move has become a political flashpoint as protesters opposing his key policies have clashed with law enforcement. Oregon officials and civil liberties groups say the administration is exaggerating the threat, while Trump allies insist the Guard is needed to restore order.",

      "After a federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked Trump's attempt to deploy troops to Portland earlier this month, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to hear the Trump administration\u2019s appeal.",
      "The lower court judge had described Trump's action in her emergency order as \"untethered to reality,\" and one that she said risks \"blurring the line between civil and military federal power \u2014 to the detriment of this nation.\"",
      "The appeals court quickly stayed the lower court\u2019s order pending review.",
      "The ruling comes as Trump has sought to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities despite stated opposition from local and state leaders. Senior administration officials have argued that the deployment is a necessary step to crack down on what they say is an uptick in violent crime and protect against threats from protesters, including anti-ICE demonstrations in many downtown areas.",
      "Democrats have countered that Trump's descriptions are hyperbolic and inaccurate, and are merely a legal pretext for Trump to try to \"federalize\" Democratic-led cities. They've used news conferences to highlight declines in violent crime, and have argued in court that the effort to deploy federal troops exceeds Trump's authority as commander-in-chief.",
      "Until the matter is appealed to the Supreme Court, the burden remains on the lower courts to navigate the high-profile, politically thorny flurry of cases.",

      "In Oregon, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held about 90 minutes of arguments on the administration\u2019s appeal. Trump administration officials argued the troops' presence was necessary to quell mounting unrest and protect against future risk of violence.",
      "Judges on the three-member panel appeared largely sympathetic to the Trump administration, especially the two Trump appointees, who noted presidents do enjoy broad latitude to deploy the National Guard.",

      "What this means for you",
      "AI chat apps often feel safe and personal, but they store enormous amounts of sensitive data. When that data leaks, it can lead to blackmail, impersonation, or public embarrassment. Before trusting any AI service, check whether it uses secure encryption, access controls, and transparent privacy terms. If a company makes big promises about security but fails to protect your data, it is not worth the risk.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This leak exposes how unprepared many developers are to protect the private data of people using AI chat apps. The growing AI companion industry needs stronger security standards and more accountability to prevent these privacy disasters. Cybersecurity awareness is the first step. Knowing how your data moves and who controls it can help you stay safe before another leak puts your personal life online.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",

One by one, global giants are admitting they've been breached, from tech powerhouses like Google to insurance leaders such as Allianz and Farmers and even luxury brands like Dior. The latest company to report a breach is Discord. The popular chat platform confirmed that hackers gained access to a third-party customer support provider, 5CA, exposing user data including names, email addresses, limited billing details and even government ID images.",

      "Hackers hit Discord\u2019s support vendor, exposing sensitive user data worldwide. (Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)",
      "How the breach happened and what data was exposed",
      "The company confirmed that the breach, which occurred on September 20, did not involve a direct attack on Discord's servers. Instead, attackers gained unauthorized access to 5CA, one of Discord's third-party customer service providers. This allowed them to view information from users who had reached out to Discord's Customer Support or Trust & Safety teams.",
      "Discord is a chat app primarily used by gamers, but it has expanded to various other communities, enabling text messages, voice chats and video calls. Some even use it as a replacement for Slack. The platform currently has a monthly user base of over 200 million. The data exposed included Discord usernames, real names, emails, limited billing details such as payment type and the last four digits of credit cards, IP addresses and messages exchanged with customer service agents. In some cases, government ID images provided for age verification were also compromised. Discord estimates that around 70,000 users globally may have had government ID photos exposed.",
      "Reports suggest the attackers attempted to use this access to demand a ransom from Discord. Bleeping Computer reported that the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters (SLH) threat group claimed responsibility for the attack earlier this month. This is the same group that claims to have access to over a billion Salesforce records and is demanding ransom for those as well.",

      "Discord disclosed the incident 13 days later, on October 3. Since then, it has cut off the third-party support provider's access, launched an internal investigation with a digital forensics team and started informing affected users. It also clarified that any communication about the breach will come only from noreply@discord.com and that it will never contact users by phone regarding this incident. The company added that some data remained safe: full credit card numbers, CCV codes, account passwords and activity outside of customer support conversations were not exposed.",
      "Discord also stated that it has notified relevant data-protection authorities about the breach, is working closely with law enforcement and is auditing its third-party vendors to ensure they meet its enhanced security and privacy standards going forward.",
      "A representative at Discord issued a statement, saying in part, \"We want to address inaccurate claims by those responsible that are circulating online. First, as stated in our blog post, this was not a breach of Discord, but rather a third-party service we use to support our customer service efforts. Second, the numbers being shared are incorrect and part of an attempt to extort a payment from Discord. Of the accounts impacted globally, we have identified approximately 70,000 users that may have had government-ID photos exposed, which our vendor used to review age-related appeals. Third, we will not reward those responsible for their illegal actions.\u00a0All affected users globally have been contacted, and we continue to work closely with law enforcement, data protection authorities and external security experts.

      "6 steps you can take to stay safe after the Discord breach",
      "If you think your details might have leaked in the Discord data breach, below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra verification step when logging in, making it much harder for attackers to access your account even if they have your password. Discord supports 2FA via authenticator apps or SMS. Once enabled, you'll receive a code each time you log in from a new device. This simple step can prevent account takeovers and gives you peace of mind.",
      "The less information available about you, the harder it is for attackers to target you. Review what personal details you've shared online, and remove unnecessary data from websites and apps. A personal data removal service can help scrub your information from data broker sites, making it more difficult for attackers to connect the dots and launch identity theft or phishing attacks.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Reusing passwords across platforms makes it easy for attackers to access multiple accounts if one password is compromised. A password manager can generate long, complex passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember them all. This not only protects your Discord account but also your email, banking and other online services.",

      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if you don't see immediate signs of compromise, attackers can try to exploit stolen data later. Regularly check your email and Discord login history for unusual sign-ins. Services like identity theft protection can scan the dark web for your credentials and alert you immediately if they appear, helping you react quickly before serious damage occurs.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing attacks often spike after breaches. Attackers may send messages that look like official notifications asking you to reset your password or provide personal information. Always verify the sender, avoid clicking unknown links, and never share sensitive info. Treat every unexpected message as suspicious, even if it appears to come from Discord or another trusted service.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If the recent breaches are any indication, third-party services that companies rely on are often the weakest link in cybersecurity. Discord's steps to contain the situation are necessary, but they highlight a bigger problem. Many companies do not implement sufficient safeguards to protect sensitive user data. Weak oversight of third-party providers, delayed responses and inadequate security policies leave personal information exposed and vulnerable to attackers.",

A new survey from the Center for Democracy and Technology found that nearly one in five high school students in the United States say they or someone they know has used AI to have a romantic relationship.

Even more alarming, two-thirds of parents said they have no idea how their kids are using AI. Experts warn that while AI can simulate empathy, it has no real understanding or care. According to researchers, students need to remember that they are not actually talking to a person. They are interacting with a programmed tool that has clear limitations and cannot truly understand human emotions.",

      "AI tools are everywhere in schools. About 85% of teachers and students said they used AI during the last school year. While schools introduce AI to boost learning, this exposure may have a downside. Students who use AI more often in class are also more likely to turn to it for emotional or personal reasons.

Encourage honest discussions about how these tools work and where they fall short. Remind students that while AI can sound friendly, it's not a real companion. It's a programmed system that mirrors what people type into it.",

      "A new cybersecurity warning reveals how hackers briefly weaponized ChatGPT's Deep Research tool. The attack, called ShadowLeak, allowed them to steal Gmail data through a single invisible prompt \u2014 no clicks, no downloads and no user action required.",

      "Gmail data leaked in a zero-click attack requiring no user action.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the ShadowLeak attack worked",
      "Attackers embedded hidden instructions into an email using white-on-white text, tiny fonts or CSS layout tricks. The email looked completely harmless. But when a user later asked ChatGPT's Deep Research agent to analyze a Gmail inbox, the AI unknowingly executed the attacker's commands.",
      "The agent then used its built-in browser tools to exfiltrate sensitive data to an external server, all within OpenAI's own cloud environment, beyond the reach of antivirus or enterprise firewalls.",
      "Unlike previous prompt-injection attacks that ran on the user's device, ShadowLeak unfolded entirely in the cloud, making it invisible to local defenses.",

      "Hidden prompts expose how hackers silently hijacked ChatGPT\u2019s AI agent. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why this threat matters",
      "The Deep Research agent was designed to perform multistep research and summarize online data, but its wide access to third-party apps like Gmail, Google Drive and Dropbox also opened the door to abuse.",
      "Radware researchers said the attack involved encoding personal data in Base64 and appending it to a malicious URL, disguised as a \"security measure.\" Once sent, the agent believed it was acting normally.",
      "The real danger lies in the fact that any connector could be exploited the same way if attackers manage to hide prompts in analyzed content.",
      "What security experts say",
      "\"The user never sees the prompt. The email looks normal, but the agent follows the hidden commands without question,\"\u00a0the researchers explained.",
      "In a separate experiment, security firm SPLX showed another weakness: ChatGPT agents could be tricked into solving CAPTCHAs by inheriting a manipulated conversation history. Researcher Dorian Schultz noted that the model even mimicked human cursor movements, bypassing tests meant to block bots.",

      "Even though OpenAI has patched the ShadowLeak flaw, it's smart to stay proactive. Cybercriminals are always looking for new ways to exploit AI agents and integrations. So, taking these precautions now can help keep your accounts and personal data secure.",
      "Every connection is a potential entry point. Disable any integrations you're not actively using, such as Gmail, Google Drive or Dropbox. Fewer linked apps mean fewer ways for hidden prompts or malicious scripts to access your information.",
      "Limit how much of your personal data is floating around the web. Data removal services can automatically remove your private details from people search sites and data broker databases, reducing what attackers can find and use against you. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Treat every email, attachment or document with caution. Don't ask AI tools to analyze content from unverified or suspicious sources. Hidden text, invisible code or layout tricks could trigger silent actions that expose your private data.",
      "Stay alert for updates from OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and other platforms. Security patches close newly discovered vulnerabilities before hackers can exploit them. Turn on automatic updates so you're always protected without having to think about it.",
      "A strong antivirus program adds another wall of defense. These tools detect phishing links, hidden scripts and AI-driven exploits before they cause harm. Schedule regular scans and keep your protection up to date.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Think of your security like an onion; more layers make it tougher to breach. Keep your browser, operating system and endpoint security software fully updated. Add real-time threat detection and email filtering to block malicious content before it lands in your inbox.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI is evolving faster than most security systems can keep up with. Even when companies move quickly to patch vulnerabilities, clever attackers find new ways to exploit integrations and context memory. Staying alert and limiting what your AI agents can access is your best defense.",

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to warn about a disturbing new scam where criminals use AI to clone the voices of loved ones and trick victims into sending money.",
      "Microsoft is sounding the alarm, and this time, the warning hits home for everyday users. Hackers are now turning Microsoft Teams security threats into real-world dangers that go far beyond corporate networks. Using Teams, cybercriminals gather intel, pose as trusted contacts, trick people into sharing private data and even spread malware that can steal passwords or lock up personal files.",
      "What was once a simple video chat and collaboration tool has become a high-value target for cybercriminals and even state-backed hackers. Whether you use Teams for work, school or staying in touch, the risks are real and growing.\u00a0We'll break down how attackers abuse Teams, what Microsoft recommends and the simple steps you can take to protect yourself at home or on the job.",

      "How hackers use Teams to attack",
      "Hackers exploit Microsoft Teams at every stage of an attack, using it to spy, impersonate, spread malware and even control compromised systems, and consumers are now in their sights, too.",
      "SCAMMERS NOW IMPERSONATE COWORKERS, STEAL EMAIL THREADS IN CONVINCING PHISHING ATTACKS",
      "Hackers are finding new ways to weaponize Microsoft Teams, turning everyday chats into dangerous entry points. (David Becker/Getty Images)",
      "Attackers start by probing Teams environments to find weak spots. They look for users with open settings, public profiles or external meeting links. Microsoft warns that \"anonymous participants, guests and external access users\" can give hackers a way in. If your Privacy Mode is off, they can see when you're online, send unwanted chats, or try to join meetings outside your group, even if you're just using a free account.",
      "Hackers often pretend to be someone you trust, like an IT admin, a coworker or even a Microsoft representative. They create fake profiles and logos that look convincing to trick you into clicking a link or sharing credentials. Microsoft says attackers \"take advantage of the same resources as legitimate organizations\" to pull off their scams.",
      "Once they've earned your trust, hackers send a chat or call that includes a malicious link or file. You might get a message saying,\u00a0\"Your Teams account needs verification\" or \"Update required for better security.\" It's all bait. These links can install spyware, steal logins or deliver ransomware that locks up your data, whether you're on a company laptop or your personal PC at home.",
      "MICROSOFT SHAREPOINT BUG PUTS CRITICAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AT RISK",
      "After breaking in, attackers try to stay hidden. They might add guest accounts, install shortcuts or change permissions so they can come back later. In some cases, they use the same Microsoft tools meant for admins to move across Teams, OneDrive or even your personal files stored in the cloud.",
      "Once inside, hackers can send commands through Teams messages or hide malware in shared links. They've even been known to send ransom demands directly through Teams chat. Microsoft says one group, Octo Tempest, used Teams to taunt victims and pressure them into paying up, showing how personal these attacks can get.",
      "Tips to stay protected",
      "You don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to stay safe on Microsoft Teams. A few smart tools and habits can go a long way in keeping hackers, scammers and snoops from taking advantage of your information.",
      "Keep your online presence private. Turn on Privacy Mode in Teams to stop strangers from seeing when you're active or trying to join meetings. It's a simple setting that makes it harder for hackers to target you or your company.",
      "If you share your Teams account with coworkers or family members, don't give everyone full control. Keep admin access limited to one trusted person. This reduces the chance of someone accidentally approving a scam link or letting malware spread.",
      "Hackers often rely on personal details found online to make their scams more convincing, things like your job title, workplace or even who you've video-chatted with. That information helps them build fake Teams profiles or send messages that look legitimate. Using a personal data removal service helps wipe your private details from data broker sites, cutting off one of the main sources hackers use to impersonate you. The less they can learn about you, the harder it is for them to trick you into trusting a fake message or clicking a malicious link.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Hackers love to send fake messages pretending to be support or IT help. Never open links or attachments from people you don't recognize, even if the message looks official. Use strong antivirus software to automatically scan downloads and attachments before you open them.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Always install the latest Teams and operating system updates. Patches fix security holes that hackers exploit to sneak in.",
      "Cybercriminals often impersonate IT support or trusted colleagues to trick users into sharing credentials. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Microsoft's warning about Teams is a reminder that hackers are always searching for new ways to reach you, even through apps you use every day. What makes these attacks so dangerous is their familiarity. Messages look normal, video calls seem real, and fake tech support chats can sound convincing. That's why awareness, not fear, is your strongest defense. With privacy settings enabled, antivirus protection running, and a reliable personal data removal service scrubbing your info from the web, you're already several steps ahead of scammers. Staying alert to phishing attempts and keeping your software up to date can turn Teams back into what it's meant to be: a safe, helpful way to stay connected.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Oct 2025 15:39:48 -0400",
    "summary": "Google, Dior, Allianz and dozens of other companies lost sensitive customer data in Salesforce-related breaches affecting millions of records across multiple sectors.",
    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "You might have noticed that in the past few months, many companies have disclosed data breaches, including Google, Dior and Allianz, and one name that appeared in most cases was Salesforce. Hackers did not breach company networks directly or exploit vulnerabilities in Salesforce's core software. Instead, they targeted the tools and people around it by tricking employees into granting access, compromising third-party apps and abusing overly broad permissions.",
      "Once inside, they siphoned sensitive data from Salesforce environments on an unprecedented scale. Nearly a billion records were stolen across dozens of organizations, and now cybercriminals are extorting victims by threatening to publish the data unless hefty ransoms are paid. Let's look at the recent Salesforce incidents in detail and why this is such a big deal.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER",
      "JEEP AND CHRYSLER PARENT STELLANTIS CONFIRMS DATA BREACH",
      "Hackers are weaponizing stolen Salesforce credentials to access company secrets. (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid)",
      "Why Salesforce is the perfect target",
      "Salesforce is not just another cloud platform. It is the backbone of how thousands of companies manage relationships with their customers. The platform powers everything from sales pipelines and marketing campaigns to support tickets and partner communications. Banks use it to track client accounts, airlines rely on it to manage frequent flyer programs, and retailers store customer purchase histories and loyalty data inside it. In many organizations, Salesforce sits at the center of daily operations, acting as a single system that touches sensitive information across departments.",
      "That is why the scale of these breaches is so significant. A successful attack on a Salesforce instance becomes a window into a company's customers, business strategy and internal processes. For cybercriminals, the potential payoff is enormous, and the recent incidents showed just how much damage they can cause without ever breaking into a company's primary network.",
      "The breaches hit companies across sectors, from Adidas and Allianz to Qantas, Google and Pandora Jewelry. Attackers often use voice-phishing calls or realistic fake apps to manipulate Salesforce administrators into installing malicious software. This allowed them to steal OAuth tokens and query data directly from CRM systems, a technique linked to groups like ShinyHunters.",
      "Other attacks originated in compromised third-party integrations. One of the most damaging involved a chatbot tool called Drift, where stolen tokens gave attackers access to Salesforce instances at hundreds of companies.",
      "The fallout was enormous. Coca-Cola's European division lost more than 23 million CRM records, while Farmers Insurance and Allianz Life reported breaches affecting over a million customers each. Even Google admitted that attackers accessed a Salesforce database used for advertising leads.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Major brands like Google, Dior and Allianz are among those caught in the data fallout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Exploiting weak links in the ecosystem",
      "It's hard to break through firewalls or exploit technical vulnerabilities, but it's much easier to manipulate people. Attackers have figured this out, and they are now focusing their efforts on human behavior and the less-protected edges of cloud ecosystems. Employees with administrative privileges were often tricked into authorizing malicious apps, while default permission settings allowed those apps to operate undetected.",
      "Once they obtained the data, the hackers did not simply try to sell it. They used it as leverage. Earlier this month, a loosely organized cybercrime group known by names such as Lapsus$, Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters launched a dedicated data leak site on the dark web, threatening to publish sensitive information unless victims paid a ransom.",
      "As reported, the site is designed to pressure companies into paying to prevent their stolen data from being made public. \"Contact us to regain control of your data governance and prevent public disclosure,\" reads one message on the site. \"Do not be the next headline. All communications require strict verification and will be handled with discretion.\"",
      "The leak site lists several alleged victims, including FedEx, Hulu (owned by Disney) and Toyota Motors. It is also unclear whether some of the organizations known to have been breached but not listed on the site have paid ransoms to keep their data from being released.",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Cybercriminals are now extorting victims online, threatening to leak billions of stolen records. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Salesforce's response",
      "Salesforce told Cyberguy that it is \"aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors\" and will not engage with, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demands. A company spokesperson provided the following statement:",
      "\"We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support. At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology.\"",
      "6 steps you can take to protect your data",
      "You might think a breach like this is a company problem, something for IT teams and cybersecurity experts to deal with. However, when attackers gain access to platforms like Salesforce, the data they are after is usually not the company's. It is yours. Your contact details, purchase history, support tickets and even private conversations can end up in the wrong hands. And once that happens, the risks do not stay confined to one company. That is why it is worth taking a few proactive steps now, even if the company has not contacted you about an incident yet.",
      "If you have interacted with any of the companies mentioned in the breach, or suspect your data might be part of it, change your passwords for those services immediately. Better yet, use a password manager to generate strong, unique passwords for every site. A good tool will also alert you if any of your credentials appear in future data leaks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if a password is stolen, two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) adds a crucial extra layer of security. Enable it for your email, banking apps, cloud storage and any service that offers it. It is one of the simplest ways to block attackers from hijacking your accounts with stolen credentials.",
      "Even if your data was part of a breach, you can still limit how much of it is floating around online. Personal data removal services scan and delete your personal information from data broker websites that sell or share your details without consent. These brokers often trade in names, addresses, phone numbers and even purchase histories, the same type of data leaked in Salesforce-related breaches.",
      "By removing your records from these public databases, you make it far harder for scammers, identity thieves and marketers to find or misuse your information. Many services, like Incogni, handle the entire opt-out process automatically and keep monitoring to ensure your data stays removed.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Attackers who have CRM data often know more about you than a typical scammer. They might reference past purchases, support cases, or other personal details to make their messages sound legitimate. Treat unexpected emails, texts, or phone calls with suspicion, especially if they involve links or requests for payment.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Data breaches do not always result in immediate damage. Sometimes, criminals sit on stolen data for months before using it. These services can continuously monitor the dark web for your personal information and notify you if your data appears in new leaks. That gives you time to act before problems snowball.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "If you think your data was exposed, companies are legally obligated in most regions to inform you. Do not hesitate to contact them directly and ask for details on what was stolen and what steps they are taking to protect affected customers. The more pressure users apply, the more likely companies are to tighten security practices.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Attackers can expose your personal data even if you are careful. They gain access to corporate cloud environments and can see customer names, emails, purchase histories and other sensitive details. For users, this means it is crucial to stay vigilant. Criminal groups use this stolen information to launch targeted phishing attacks, open fake accounts, or impersonate you elsewhere. Some even cross-reference leaked Salesforce data with information from previous breaches to build disturbingly complete profiles of their victims.",

      "Road crews may soon get a major assist from artificial intelligence. Researchers at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute have developed a fabric embedded with sensors and AI algorithms that can monitor road conditions from beneath the surface. This smart material could make costly, disruptive road repairs far more efficient and sustainable.",

      "The system uses a fabric made from flax fibers interwoven with ultra-thin conductive wires. These wires detect minute changes in the asphalt base layer, signaling potential damage before it reaches the surface.",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Fraunhofer researchers test AI sensors that detect road damage beneath the surface.\u00a0 (Fraunhofer Institute)",
      "Once the fabric is laid under the road, it continuously collects data. A connected unit on the roadside stores and transmits this data to an AI system that analyzes it for early warning signs. As vehicles pass over the road, the system measures changes in resistance within the fabric. These changes reveal how the base layer is performing and whether cracks or strain are forming beneath the surface.",
      "Why AI road monitoring matters for future maintenance",
      "Traditional road inspection methods rely on drilling or taking core samples, which are destructive, costly and only provide information for a small section of pavement. This AI-driven system eliminates the need for that kind of invasive testing.",
      "Instead of reacting to surface damage, transportation agencies could predict and prevent deterioration before it becomes expensive to fix. The approach could extend road life, cut down on traffic delays and help governments spend infrastructure funds more efficiently.",

      "The smart flax-fiber fabric measures stress changes in asphalt to spot cracks early. (Fraunhofer Institute)",
      "How AI and sensor data predict road damage early",
      "The real power comes from combining AI algorithms with continuous sensor feedback. Fraunhofer's machine-learning software can forecast how damage will spread, helping engineers prioritize which roads need maintenance first. Data from the sensors is displayed on a web-based dashboard, offering a clear visual of road health for local agencies and planners.",
      "The project, called SenAD2, is currently being tested in an industrial zone in Germany. Early results suggest the system can identify internal damage without disrupting traffic or damaging the road itself.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Smarter road monitoring could lead to fewer potholes, smoother commutes and less taxpayer money wasted on inefficient repairs. If adopted widely, cities could plan maintenance years in advance, avoiding the cycle of patchwork fixes that often make driving a daily headache.",

      "Philadelphia\u2019s George Soros-backed District Attorney Larry Krasner is facing mounting backlash after a repeat offender \u2014 previously released on low bail and freed when Krasner\u2019s office dropped kidnapping and assault charges \u2014 was charged in the disappearance of Miss USA hopeful Kada Scott, 23, whose remains were found over the weekend.",
      "At a tense Friday news conference, Krasner blamed \"systemic issues\" for the suspect\u2019s earlier release on bail \u2014 a defense that drew immediate rebuke from victims\u2019 advocates and court officials, who accused the DA of dodging responsibility.",
      "Prosecutors have now filed additional charges against 21-year-old Keon King, escalating the case that has gripped Philadelphia.",

      "Kada Scott vanished on Oct. 4. Her remains were found over the weekend. (Philadelphia Police Department)",
      "King, who is already facing kidnapping, stalking and false imprisonment counts, now faces a new slate of charges including arson, conspiracy, tampering with evidence and causing a catastrophe, after police discovered Scott\u2019s body in a shallow grave behind a former school.",
      "Investigators said King used a burned vehicle to move Scott\u2019s body and that both his phone data and the vehicle link him to multiple crime scenes.",
      "Assistant District Attorney Ashley Toczylowski said, \"It's still being investigated.\" She confirmed King\u2019s digital trail places him at every major location tied to Scott\u2019s disappearance and death.",
      "The case has reignited scrutiny of Krasner\u2019s progressive policies and his handling of violent repeat offenders.",
      "Earlier this year, his office dropped an assault and kidnapping case against King when the victim failed to appear in court \u2014 a decision that allowed King to walk free on $200,000 bail, even though prosecutors had sought nearly $1 million because of the violent nature of the charges.",

      "\"Ultimately the buck stops here,\" Krasner said. \"It\u2019s not my job to throw other people under the bus. If there\u2019s a decision that is poor \u2014 and I believe that was an incorrect decision \u2014 then we have to own it and try to do better moving forward.\"",
      "Krasner said his office withdrew the earlier case because the victim and witness failed to appear, suggesting they were afraid because King was out on bail.",
      "\"What I am saying about the bail is that it could have made all the difference in the world,\" he added.",
      "Court officials pushed back, saying judges are always available for emergency bail appeals, a step the DA\u2019s office chose not to take.",
      "\"In light of this truth, the DA\u2019s comments are appallingly disrespectful \u2026 a sad attempt to find a scapegoat for his own failings,\" courts spokesperson Martin O\u2019Rourke said in a statement to The Philadelphia Inquirer.",
      "Online criticism followed quickly. Conservative account Libs of TikTok posted on X, \"Philadelphia progressive DA Larry Krasner previously DROPPED KIDNAPPING CHARGES against a career criminal with a criminal history who got out on $20k bail. Well he just kidnapped another woman whose remains were just found.\"",
      "DANIEL PENNY ATTORNEY CALLS PROGRESSIVE POLICIES 'HOMICIDAL,' SAYS CHARLOTTE TRAIN MURDER WAS PREVENTABLE",
      "Judge Pat Dugan, who is running against Krasner, also wrote on X, \"Larry Krasner wants to blame municipal court judges for the low bail \u2026 What he won\u2019t tell you is that he and his office had every chance to appeal that bail decision \u2026 and refused to do so.\"",
      "Krasner countered that late-night bail appeals are often \"fruitless,\" adding, \"The unfortunate reality is that some judges don\u2019t want you calling them in the middle of the night. And if you do, they lower the bail \u2014 they don\u2019t raise it.\"",
      "Police said Scott was likely killed soon after leaving work, based on surveillance and phone records. Court records reviewed by The Philadelphia Inquirer show King has a long record of violent offenses, including choking and assaulting his ex-girlfriend.",
      "Philadelphia DA Larry Krasner is facing backlash over his handling of Keon King, who is charged in the disappearance of Kada Scott. (Reuters)",
      "Despite that history, Krasner\u2019s office previously dropped multiple charges when witnesses failed to appear. In one incident earlier this year, King allegedly climbed a fence and tried to break into his ex-girlfriend\u2019s home, and in another, violently choked her \u2014 yet the case was dismissed.",
      "Officials read a statement from Scott\u2019s parents expressing immense grief and gratitude for public support.",

      "\"It is with profound sadness that we share the tragic passing of our beloved daughter, Kada Scott. Our hearts are shattered, yet we are deeply grateful for the outpouring of love, support and prayers from people across the nation and around the world,\" the statement read.",
      "\"We place our full trust in the Philadelphia Police Department and the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office to ensure that the truth is revealed and that those responsible are held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,\" the statement continued.",
      "City councilmember Anthony Phillips echoed that sentiment, stating that Scott's \"life mattered.\"",

      "Colorado banks are taking proactive steps to deter robberies and protect both customers and employees. Many of these security upgrades were accelerated by pandemic protocols and have continued as permanent deterrents.",
      "\"Banks are very proactive. Our number one priority is ensuring the safety of our customers and employees in any robbery situation,\" Waller said. \"One thing we saw implemented ... is where banks\u2019 doors would be locked and the customers would have to get access to come inside the bank. We've seen banks continue that as a means of security.\"",
      "Banks are also leaning on technology, including dye packs, advanced cameras and continued employee training. Some institutions have opted to employ armed guards as a further deterrent.",

      "\"It surprises me, but we\u2019re seeing a rise in old-fashioned check washing,\" Waller said. \"Law enforcement has identified organized criminal activity behind it.\"",
      "In addition to traditional bank robberies, Colorado is beginning to see a dangerous crime trend known as \"jugging,\" which had previously been more common in other parts of the country.",
      "\"We\u2019re starting to see that in Colorado,\" Waller said. \"Jugging is when an individual is robbed after taking a withdrawal or carrying cash. We\u2019re reminding customers to stay aware of their surroundings and not leave bank bags in vehicles.\"",

      "\"The FBI is extremely helpful,\" she said. \"The Task Force does a phenomenal job of identifying and convicting bank robbery. We\u2019re very pleased with the support we get.\"",
      "Waller noted that historically, about 80% of bank robberies were solved within 24 months, though she emphasized she did not have a current figure.",

      "\"Customer and employee safety is our number one priority,\" Waller emphasized.",

Mayor John Whitmire has publicly dismissed talk of a serial killer, calling drownings \"not a new phenomenon\" at a news briefing last month. He blamed drugs, alcohol and homelessness.",

      "McKissic also left a bar by herself before she vanished. And like Cutting Jr., she didn't have her phone on her. Her autopsy also found no external signs of trauma, according to the station, and she was recovered from the water about 2.5 miles from where she was last seen.",
      "\"Either there\u2019s a serial killer on the loose, or the scum of society have realized they can start dumping bodies in the bayou in the midst of the heat and they start decomposing so nobody gets caught,\" Freeman said. \"You just can\u2019t stab them or shoot them.\"",

But the film shows the ripple effects of a crime like this. I hope the victims\u2019 families feel represented. It was always our intention to make them equal participants in this story.\"",
      "Borgman said that when looking back, Rawson wondered if her father\u2019s sudden bursts of anger were glimpses into his double life. Rawson is aware she may never know the truth. Throughout the film, Rawson stressed that she and her family had no idea about her father\u2019s crimes and were blindsided when it came to light.",

I think it provided something in him that he was able to hide when he came back home. And look, I\u2019m not a psychologist. I can\u2019t diagnose him, but I do think he got something out of this \u2014 that it provided something that he wanted and needed.

I think what\u2019s healthier for her is when she\u2019s working with other families and bringing perspective on what it\u2019s like to be the daughter of a serial killer.

      "Professors from Rutgers University and beyond have flocked to an online fundraiser to donate money to fellow academic Mark Bray, who recently fled to Spain after President Donald Trump announced a crackdown on Antifa and its financiers.",
      "A Rutgers University professor nicknamed \"Dr. Antifa,\" who fled the U.S. for Spain after saying his home address had been doxxed, and his family threatened, portrayed doxxing as a legitimate tactic for use against political opponents in his seminal work.",
      "Mark Bray, who now teaches his history courses for the public New Jersey university online from abroad, is best known for his book, \"Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook,\" published in 2017.",
      "That book, which is based on 61 interviews with \"current and former anti-fascists from seventeen countries in North America and Europe,\" references doxxing in a positive light three times.",

      "'DR. ANTIFA'S' MEDITERRANEAN MOVE PARTIALLY FINANCED BY FELLOW RUTGERS PROFESSORS, OTHER AMERICAN ACADEMICS",
      "On page 87, Bray quoted a Danish Antifa interviewee named Rasmus Preston, who said doxxing is \"'a very important tool to create conflict within far-right movements' by causing a \u2018constant mental burden.\u2019\"",
      "In another instance, Bray relayed the story of Antifa Nebraska scoring a \"major victory\" by doxxing a political opponent, noting that the far-left group \"printed thousands of flyers with his name, photo, and information on his Nazism and plastered them around town, forcing him to drop out of college, take down his social media, and go into hiding.\"",
      "The book offers an appendix where Bray invited his interview subjects to provide advice to fellow or prospective Antifa members. A source named Brett A advocated in favor of doxxing as one of many tools in Antifa's political war.",
      "\"Ideally, you want a diverse squad with members who have different talents,\" Brett said. \"Some folks will be best used on the front lines in confrontations (usually strong, fit people who can fight if need be), some folks need to be really good with intel gathering (monitoring right-wing pages, doxxing, etc.), some folks need to be good at graphic design for flyer campaigns, some folks need to be well-versed in security culture, etc. The more diverse your organization is, the better equipped it will be at effectively organizing and staying safe.\"",
      "Brett alluded to another tactic supported in Bray's book: violence.",
      "Antifascism is not just one tactic, but many, and those include \"combinations of physical confrontations, doxxing, infiltration.\"",

      "VETERAN JOURNALIST FLIPS SCRIPT ON MEDIA 'RUNNING COVER' FOR ANTIFA VIOLENCE: 'ANARCHIST COMMUNISM'",
      "Fascists are defined ambiguously as the \"Far Right,\" which Bray speculated could evolve into something worse than fascism. Throughout the book, though, he referenced the MAGA movement and opposition to the Trump administration.",
      "Bray openly praised the violent riots in Ferguson, Missouri, after Michael Brown's death involving police.",
      "\"Moreover, these riots pushed police brutality and black oppression to the forefront of the national consciousness in a way that \u2018nonviolent\u2019 tactics could not have achieved on their own,\" he wrote. \"Yes, most Americans were repulsed by the sight of looting and burning, but for once they were forced to take note of the scale of injustice. Subsequently, Black Lives Matter cultivated a very significant base of popular support despite having a \u2018violent flank.\u2019\"",
      "On page 64 of the book, Bray relayed the story of Italian Antifa groups Autonomia Operaia and Lotta Continua from the 1970s. He described those groups as \"militants wearing ski masks and bandannas, armed with clubs, iron bars, Molotov cocktails, and sometimes handguns.\"",
      "He justified the groups' violent outbursts with a talking point often used in far-left circles in the U.S. today.",

      "\"While the expressed purpose of such marches may have been opposition to fascism, the state and the entire capitalist system were implicated in fascist violence, and therefore legitimate targets for widespread looting and property destruction,\" Bray wrote.",
      "The book later claims that \"anti-fascism must necessarily be anticapitalist.\"",
      "Later, he described the Autonomen in Germany, a group descended from Autonomia Operaia. He fawned over the group for inventing black bloc, the now-ubiquitous black head-to-toe uniform Antifa groups wear worldwide.",
      "He described a \"direct action\" where the group \"dressed in black with their faces covered by motorcycle helmets, balaclavas, or other masks to create a uniform, anonymous mass of revolutionaries prepared to carry out militant actions, sometimes involving weapons such as flagpoles, clubs, projectiles, and Molotov cocktails.\"",
      "Censorship is viewed as a powerful tool in fighting the people Bray calls fascists, too.",

      "\"Liberal anti-fascists,\" Bray complained, have too much \"faith in the inherent power of the public sphere to filter out fascist ideas, and in the institutions of government to forestall the advancement of fascist politics.\"",

      "As it was announced that Vice President JD Vance would visit Israel, President Donald Trump once again warned Hamas, saying the U.S.-brokered Gaza truce must hold, and issued another blunt warning to the terrorist group.",
      "During a White House meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday, Trump warned, \"We're going to eradicate them. If we have to, they'll be eradicated. And they know that,\" he told reporters, and stressed the deal\u2019s broad backing \u2014 \"59 countries that agreed to the deal\" \u2014 while insisting the ceasefire remains in place and warning that any further violence would be met with decisive action.",
      "While details of Vance\u2019s trip to Israel have yet to be announced, Washington\u2019s diplomacy is extending beyond Jerusalem, as U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner were expected to travel to Egypt from Israel for talks with\u00a0Hamas representatives, underscoring a push to move from preserving the ceasefire toward negotiating the more fraught next phase.",

      "At Monday's meeting with the Australian pm, Trump was asked by a reporter whether the U.S. would put boots on the ground, Trump said his administration does not plan to deploy troops and that other countries \u2014 and Israel itself \u2014 could act if needed.",
      "\"We don't need to, because we have many countries, as you know, signed on to this deal,\" he said. \"We've had countries calling me when they saw some of the killing with Hamas, saying we'd love to go in and take care of the situation ourselves. In addition,\u00a0you have Israel \u2014 they would go in, in two minutes. If I asked him to go in, I could tell him, go in and take care of it. But right now, we haven't said that. We're going to give it a little chance, and hopefully there will be a little less violence.\"",
      "He added a blunt warning about\u00a0Hamas' capacity and support. \"But right now, you know, they're violent people. Hamas has been very violent, but they don't have the backing of Iran anymore\u2026 They have to be good, and if they're not good, they'll be eradicated \u2014 because absolutely we can, and we have the capacity to do so.\"",
      "The comments came as senior U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with Israeli leaders to shore up the fragile, Trump-brokered, 20-step ceasefire plan after a weekend flare-up. Hamas terrorists killed two Israeli soldiers, prompting Israeli strikes against the terror group. Despite the violence, both Israel and Hamas publicly recommitted to the truce.",

      "A month later, Markus died, surrounded by his family and friends, telling them, \"See you in paradise.\"",
      "Three years later, his parents, Mike and Jennifer Schouten, are carrying the torch for Markus in a mission to block efforts to allow \"mature minors\" the right to choose to die through assisted suicide. They now work alongside a global network of like-minded advocates, including disability rights groups, who argue the assisted-suicide industry targets vulnerable people who would benefit from assisted living services. Already, in Canada, the law is expected to expand to patients with severe psychiatric disorders, as early as 2027.",
      "But they are up against a powerful, well-funded machine. A Fox Digital investigation reveals the Schoutens and other opponents of euthanasia face a multimillion-dollar global lobby that could be called Assisted Suicide Inc., a sprawling network changing laws worldwide, developing euthanasia services for funeral parlors, selling \"suicide pods,\" promoting \"suicide tourism\" and even training \"doulas for death.\"",

      "This concept, first established in a 1967 Washington Supreme Court case,\u00a0Smith v. Seibly,\u00a0once allowed limited medical discretion for minors. But over decades, it has metastasized into a sweeping jurisdiction for granting children autonomy \u2013 and\u00a0secrecy \u2013 over their medical decisions. Today, it lets minors make choices without parental involvement on gender pronouns, gender transitions, contraception and abortion.

      "Euthanasia is already legal for adults in Australia, Belgium, Colombia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and 11 U.S. states. But three countries \u2013 the Netherlands, Belgium and Colombia \u2013 have gone further, allowing \"mature minors\" to die by physician-assisted suicide.",

      "The same debate has now reached the United Kingdom, where a bill to allow adult euthanasia is\u00a0moving through the British Parliament. Earlier this year, the British House of Commons narrowly\u00a0voted 259 to 216 to bar physicians from discussing assisted suicide with youth, meaning nearly half of lawmakers supported discussing assisted suicide for youth.",

      "Birbalsingh argues that Western societies have fallen for the dangerous illusion that \"the child must lead,\" leading to thinking such as \"Oh, he wants to change his gender, or he wants to commit suicide.\"",
      "\"Once upon a time,\" she said, \"adults used to say, \u2018No, the child is not capable of leading, because he is a child.\u2018 In the West, we have forgotten that we\u2019re meant to be in charge as adults.\"",

      "\"That's why they need looking after,\" Birbalsingh added. \"That's why we need to look after them as adults. That's our job. It's our role in life, to keep and protect them, sometimes from themselves. The people making these decisions just don't understand young people.\" Lawmakers said there was a \"very real risk\" that proposed assisted suicide legislation, called the \"Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill,\" would be expanded to include children if they didn\u2019t vote for her amendment.",

In a\u00a0May report, she said that she had convened a panel of youth to discuss the issue.",
      "In Canada, the euphemism \"MAID,\" or \"Medical Assistance In Dying,\" has softened the conversation. But the statistics are stark. In 2023, about 15,000 Canadians died through \"MAID,\" about one in every 20 deaths nationwide, a 16% increase from 2022, making assisted suicide the fifth leading cause of death.",
      "The movement is also big business. Dying with Dignity Canada, based in Toronto,\u00a0reported $3 billion in expenses in 2024, including $803,555 for advertising and promotions.

You could make the case that even without the coup, the Western position was untenable, short of committing ever greater volumes of arms and munitions to a war very far away from Paris and Washington.\"",

      "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on President Donald Trump's phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin one day before Trump's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and more on 'Special Report.'",
      "The term \"special relationship\" has been used to describe the U.S.-U.K. partnership since WWII in the face of Nazi, Germany, but many have argued it was solidified during the Cold War under the close alliance of President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margret Thatcher.",
      "This week former and current diplomats, government officials and foreign policy advisers convened in London to celebrate what would have been Thatcher\u2019s centennial birthday, and to reflect on her partnership and friendship with the late U.S. president.",

      "\"They were political soul mates, in a sense. This wasn't a forced marriage,\" Fred Ryan, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the\u00a0Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute told Fox News Digital.",
      "Ryan explained that their relationship was so successful, in part, because they had formed a relationship prior to either of them becoming heads of state, and they shared a mutual dedication to revitalizing their economies and countering communism.",
      "\"I think the personal relationship made it more than just transactional \u2013 it made it something that was a kind of a relationship of exceptional trust in terms of what it's done today,\" Ryan, who also served as Chief of Staff to\u00a0Reagan starting in the late 1980s, said. \"Going forward, I think it's set a great example.\"",
      "Though the Reagan-Thatcher alliance is most known for pressing the Soviet Union, ardent anti-communist principles and ultimately ending the Cold War, experts this week in London argued that, perhaps more significantly, their partnership created a lasting obligation that future leaders would adhere to ensure the U.S.-U.K. partnership continued.",

Actions he took upon re-entering the White House, including steep tariffs and a critical tone of NATO, had some worried he was favoring American isolationism.",

      "\"[Both have] given extra weight to the special relationship, and it does appear to be something that they're both working at,\" Ryan said. \"People have seen that Keir Starmer [and] Donald Trump have been able to build a good relationship. It's an example for others to try to emulate.\"",
      "COULD TRUMP'S MEETING WITH PUTIN BE THE NEXT REAGAN-GORBACHEV MOMENT?",
      "The U.S.-U.K. relationship is once again under the microscope, not only because of how different Trump and Starmer are politically, but because both nations face the greatest threat to the West since the Cold War, once again emanating from Moscow.",

      "Both Thatcher and Reagan were able to form a strong relationship with the former and final leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, though the post-Cold War peace lasted for less time than the protracted geopolitical tussle following Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Trump has drawn raised eyebrows in his repeated attempts to diplomatically engage with Putin despite little to no action by the Kremlin chief to end his war ambitions.",

      "Ryan noted there are many differences in the threat the U.S. and U.K. are facing this time around from Russia, but said, \"I do think both sides realize the threat that Putin poses, and hopefully, through this close relationship that we've had, we can be united and allied in standing up to it.\"",

      "Comey's team argued that the indictment arose from \"multiple glaring constitutional violations and an egregious abuse of power by the federal government\" and that the \"bedrock principles of due process and equal protection have long ensured that government officials may not use courts to punish and imprison their perceived personal and political enemies.\"",
      "Halligan, a former insurance lawyer who is now interim head of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, was \u201cdefectively appointed to her office as an interim U.S. Attorney,\u201d Comey's attorneys argued, adding that her appointment \u201cviolated the congressionally designed and constitutionally compelled means for the Attorney General to appoint an official as interim U.S. Attorney.\u201d",
      "Comey's team went on to argue that \"because no properly appointed Executive Branch official sought and obtained the indictment, the indictment is equally a nullity.\u201d",
      "Comey, one of several Trump critics targeted by the Justice Department this year, has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, which focus on congressional testimony in 2020 when he stood by previous testimony he gave in 2017 regarding the authorization of leaks to the media when he was head of the FBI.",
      "One of Comey\u2019s exhibits submitted Monday is a 60-page filing with statements that Comey and Trump have made about each other.",
      "The defense further argued that the Justice Department had maintained high standards of ethics for decades and brought cases only when they were supported by the facts and the law and that the charges were a \u201csharp departure\u201d from that tradition.",
      "\u201cAmple objective evidence \u2014 much of which comes directly from government officials\u2019 own public statements and admissions \u2014 establishes that the government\u2019s animus toward Mr. Comey led directly to this vindictive and selective prosecution,\u201d Comey\u2019s team wrote.",
      "His attorneys also referred to the president\u2019s September social media post in which he called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute his political foes. His attorneys said, \u201cLess than 48 hours after President Trump\u2019s post, Ms. Halligan was sworn in as interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Ms. Halligan was a special assistant to the President and White House official.\u201d",
      "Halligan's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday's filings.",
      "Comey's attorneys noted that Halligan, who previously worked as a personal lawyer for Trump, lacked prosecutorial experience, adding that \u201cno other prosecutor from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia participated in the grand jury presentation. Ms. Halligan presented the grand jury with a three-count indictment.\"",
      "\u201cMs. Halligan\u2019s unlawful appointment tainted the structural integrity of the grand jury process. Absent Ms. Halligan\u2019s unlawful title, she would not have been able to enter the grand jury room, let alone present and sign an indictment,\u201d they wrote."

      "The Toronto Blue Jays advanced to the World Series on Monday by defeating the Seattle Mariners and winning the American League pennant.",
      "The Blue Jays survived the American League Championship Series on their home field by taking a winner-take-all Game 7, 4-3, to make the franchise\u2019s first World Series berth since 1993 and set up a matchup against the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "The pivotal moment came in the bottom of the seventh inning with Toronto trailing 3-1. With runners on second and third base with one out, George Springer crushed a sinker from Mariners pitcher Bryan Woo 381 feet to the left-center field stands for a lead that would not be relinquished.",
      "Because Toronto finished with a better regular-season record, it will have home-field advantage for the World Series, starting with hosting Game 1 on Friday and Game 2 on Saturday.",
      "The Dodgers won two of the three games the teams played this season in early August.",
      "\"It takes so much work and perseverance to get to this point, and I love this entire group,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said postgame. \"It's so fitting \u2014bottom of our order gets it done again. There's probably no other person on planet Earth that I want up other than George Springer and his October magic.\"",
      "Only eight players on Toronto\u2019s 40-man roster were alive when the team last made the World Series in 1993, when it won a second consecutive title. The championships were followed by 21 consecutive seasons without so much as a playoff berth.",
      "Including their postseason return in 2015, the club has made the playoffs five of the last 10 years but never broken through to win the pennant until this season, when it won 94 games \u2014 a 20-win improvement over 2024 \u2014 under manager John Schneider.",
      "They began the postseason by beating the New York Yankees in the divisional series, then opened the ALCS by immediately falling into an 0-2 hole. Wins in Seattle evened the series, as did another in Game 6, in which Toronto staved off elimination thanks to Vladimir Guerrero Jr.\u2019s sixth home run of the postseason, a franchise record.",
      "The Blue Jays are the first team since the 1996 Yankees to lose the first two games at home of a best-of-seven series, only to ultimately win the series."

      "Virginia Roberts Giuffre, an outspoken accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, alleged that her own father had abused her and suggested that he took hush money from Epstein in a posthumous memoir releasing Tuesday.",
      "Giuffre, 41, had been working on the book with a co-author before she died by suicide in April. In the memoir, she alleges that other men had abused her before she was groomed by Epstein at age 16.",
      "She alleges that her experience with abuse began as early as 7 by her father. Her father denied the allegation, insisting that he never abused his daughter. And in a statement in the memoir, her father said he \u201cnever knew what was going on with Epstein\u201d until he saw the news online.",
      "Giuffre\u2019s brother Sky Roberts Jr. told NBC News\u2019 Hallie Jackson that he confronted his father over the abuse allegation.",
      "\u201cI just, I said \u2014 we know,\u201d he recalled, choking up. \u201cI mean, you were Dad. You sexually abused your daughter. It\u2019s absolutely heinous what he did.\u201d",
      "Giuffre recounts in the memoir, \u201cNobody\u2019s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice,\u201d that Epstein showed her a photo of her younger brother, then in middle school, and told her to keep quiet about \u201cwhat goes on in this house.\u201d She also suggested in her book that her father may have taken money from Epstein after he began abusing her.",
      "Her brother recalled that their father would buy \u201cdecently nice things\u201d at points in their life, including a boat.",
      "\u201cIf there was a payment wired to him, like it would, would be disgusting, be disgusting that he accepted money,\u201d Roberts said.",
      "The final years of Giuffre\u2019s life were marked by her repeatedly calling for criminal charges against Epstein and his associates. Epstein died by suicide in jail in 2019 shortly after he was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring a person under 18 for prostitution. He served 13 months of an 18-month jail sentence. Federal prosecutors in New York brought new charges against him in 2019, and he died while awaiting trial.",
      "Giuffre provided federal authorities with information that led to the arrest and conviction of his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. Giuffre said she was getting her life back on track after a troubled childhood when she met Maxwell, who steered her into Epstein\u2019s path.",
      "She alleged that the two groomed her into becoming a sex slave for Epstein and that Epstein trafficked her to other prominent men in his circle. Maxwell, a former British socialite, was convicted on five counts of sex trafficking in 2021 for her role in recruiting young girls to be abused by Epstein.",
      "Other survivors have credited Giuffre\u2019s bravery for giving them the strength to come forward with their own allegations. When she died in April, Giuffre\u2019s attorney described her as \u201can incredible champion for other victims.\u201d",

      "A new trend is taking over TikTok, with social media users hoping to land a coveted spot in the exclusive \u201cgroup 7.\u201d",
      "If you have been scrolling on the social media platform lately, chances are, you have seen TikTok users posting videos and leaving comments about being in \u201cgroup 7\u201d without providing more context about the secret club. So who started the mysterious group and how can you score an invite?",
      "Well, it appears the origins of group 7 can be traced back to singer Sophia James. Last week, the music artist posted a series of videos on TikTok. In her first clip, she shared that she had recently received a parking ticket while dancing and singing along to her new song \u201cSo Unfair.\u201d James then continued to upload more clips with a goal: to get as many TikTok users as possible to see her posts and hear her song by flooding their feeds.",

      "As the night went on, more videos arrived. The seventh and final video in her algorithm experiment went viral.",
      "\u201cIf you are watching this video, you are in group 7,\u201d James explained. \u201cI have posted seven videos tonight and this is the seventh one. Just a little science experiment to see what kind of video gets the most reach.\u201d",
      "She playfully added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what that says about you, but you\u2019re in group 7!\u201d",
      "Beneath her post, which has 8.5 million views as of Oct. 20, TikTok users celebrated and joked about being in the special group.",
      "\u201cI (hereby) declare group 7 is the most elite group,\u201d one wrote in a comment.",

      "One TikTok user also used a post to explain how the joke went viral. In her video, the TikTok user complimented James for succeeding in getting millions of people to listen to and promote her new single.",
      "\u201cIt is incredible. I haven\u2019t seen anything like this in awhile. It\u2019s also immaculate marketing,\u201d the TikTok user said.",

      "A baby girl was found abandoned inside a New York City subway station during the hectic rush hour on a busy Monday morning.",
      "The baby was found alone on the southbound platform of the 34th Street-Penn Station stop of the 1/2/3 line just after 9:30 a.m. ET on Oct. 20, NBC's WNBC in New York City reported.",

      "It's unclear how long the baby had been left alone in the subway station, WNBC said.",
      "The NYPD is now investigating the case. It is a felony in New York to abandon a child under the age of 14.",
      "In July 2000, New York enacted the Abandoned Infant Protection Act, which allows a parent to anonymously abandon a newborn baby up to 30 days old legally as long as the baby is left in a safe place and in a \"safe manner.\"",
      "According to the law, the parent must leave an infant with an appropriate person or in a suitable location \u2014 such as a hospital, a staffed police station or a fire station \u2014 and immediately notify an appropriate person of the baby's whereabouts to avoid prosecution."

      "The new series of events, happening on dates in October and November, connects fans with their favorite TODAY anchors. The experiences include a sold-out Making Space wellness day with Hoda Kotb and Alicia Keys, a Taste of TODAY food event, a Read With Jenna girls\u2019 night out and a live Sunday Sitdown with Willie Geist.",
      "As part of the inaugural celebration, fans on the plaza Monday were given the opportunity to pose questions to some of the anchors: Savannah Guthrie, Craig Melvin, Sheinelle Jones, Carson Daly and Dylan Dreyer. And who better to moderate than Bravo host Andy Cohen?",
      "Here\u2019s what the TODAY anchors had been asked \u2014 and how they answered.",
      "For Savannah: Have Any Guests Made Her Starstruck?",
      "\u201cA lot of times I get very giddy like a schoolgirl,\u201d Savannah told two fans on the plaza from Rhode Island. There was one memorable star in particular, though.",
      "\u201cWhen Harrison Ford was on, I literally feel like the whole interview was me trying to flirt with him,\u201d she joked. \u201cHe was Han Solo! He is such a babe, and I just love him so much.\u201d",
      "Ford wasn\u2019t the only celebrity to give Savannah butterflies; she revealed that Kevin Costner and the \u201980s band Duran Duran also made the list.",
      "For Craig: If Not on TODAY, What Other Career Path Would He Follow?",
      "Next up, a fan from Indianapolis wondered what other job Craig could see himself doing if he wasn\u2019t a TODAY anchor. His answer was illuminating \u2014 literally.",
      "\u201cProbably candle making,\u201d he revealed, much to the surprise of Cohen and the other anchors. \u201cI have found so much peace and solace over the last few years and, like, being in my garage pouring candles.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will say, I was not expecting that,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen at TODAY Fan Fest!\u201d",
      "For Carson: What Happens Off-Camera During Commercial Breaks?",
      "A New Jersey fan asked Carson about what goes on behind the scenes when the TODAY cameras cut away to a commercial break.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of FaceTiming kids,\u201d Carson revealed. \u201cThen there immediately is an argument about the studio temperature.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you could hang beef in Studio 1A, you would. Like a freezer,\u201d Carson said of Craig\u2019s well-known preference for keeping studio temps on the frigid side, even though Savannah prefers it warmer, thus the morning battles.",
      "Other Studio 1A surprises?",
      "\u201cEverybody swears like a truck driver during the commercial break, then buttons up when we\u2019re back,\u201d said Carson.",
      "\u201cAnd a lot of grazing in the kitchen,\u201d added Savannah.",
      "For Savannah: How Does She Pick Her Outfit for the Show Each Morning?",
      "A fan from Florida called Savannah\u2019s fashion sense \u201cfabulous\u201d and then asked where she sources her wardrobe.",
      "Savannah replied by saying Craig, Al and Carson are the true fashionistas of the show, and she, like most people, stands in front of her closet in the mornings wondering what to wear.",
      "She also revealed that she buys all her own clothes and repeats outfits as necessary. And even though it appears as though she and Craig coordinate their on-air outfits ahead of time, they don\u2019t. If they match, it\u2019s a coincidence.",
      "\u201cSometimes it just works out,\u201d said Savannah.",
      "For the Group: What Is It Like Traveling Together?",
      "If you\u2019ve ever been curious what the TODAY family is like while traveling, a Connecticut fan asked about the team\u2019s respective travel personalities.",
      "\u201cJenna organizes everything and has a really fun itinerary laid out,\u201d answered Savannah, who continued by saying, \u201cI like to get to the airport early.\u201d",
      "According to Craig, Sheinelle is the one most likely to arrive late and Al dresses up, preferring to wear a sport coat to the airport. Carson said that he is the one most likely to be in the airport lounge with a bloody mary in his hand ahead of a flight.",
      "For the Group: What\u2019s An On-Air Blooper They\u2019ll Never Forget?",
      "Cohen jumped in with a question and asked if anyone had a blooper they vowed to never repeat.",
      "Carson replied with a snafu from when he was new to TODAY. He was still adjusting the teleprompter and accidentally mispronounced Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s name.",
      "\u201cI said \u2018Leonardo Di-Crap-io.\u2019 And to this day, when I see Leonardo\u2019s name in the prompter, my heartbeat starts to go,\u201d Carson said.",
      "For Sheinelle: What Piece of Advice Did She Receive That She Still Keeps Today?",
      "During the 3rd Hour of TODAY, a fan asked Sheinelle about the best career advice she\u2019s ever received and still refers to today.",
      "Sheinelle said someone gave words of wisdom while she was interning during her sophomore year in college: \u201cAsk for what you want, take what you get, and use what you get to get what you want.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s true,\u201d Sheinelle added. \u201cSometimes you take jobs you don\u2019t necessarily want, but you just use it to get where you want and you just keep on climbing, my friend.\u201d",
      "According to Dylan, her best advice came when she first arrived at TODAY.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019re not Al Roker, so don\u2019t try to be Al Roker,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cBut the moral of the story is to be yourself. We already have an Al, we need a Dylan. Be yourself.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "If there was one movie that changed Michael J. Fox's life as an actor, it was \"Back to the Future.\"",
      "During the Oct. 19 episode of Sunday Sitdown, Fox recalled how he got the role of Marty McFly in the 1985 flick. He said he was in the middle of shooting his Emmy-winning series \"Family Ties\" when the show's creator, Gary David Goldberg, called him into his office.",
      "At the time, Fox was 23 years old.",
      "\"I had just done 'Teen Wolf,' and I thought maybe he saw 'Teen Wolf' and was firing me,\" Fox said with a laugh.",
      "\"But I went into the office, and he had this envelope. He said, 'I didn\u2019t know how to tell you this, but a few months ago, Bob Zemeckis gave it to me and said they had this movie they wanted you to do,'\" Fox continued. \"He said, 'If you want to do it, we\u2019ll make it work.' And I picked up the envelope and went 'I love it.'\"",
      "Fox had signed on to one of the biggest role of his life \u2014 and he didn't even read the script beforehand.",
      "Though it was a gamble, it was a huge one that paid off. He says his life changed drastically after starring in \"Back to the Future.\"",
      "\"Huge difference,\" he said. \"And in terms of my family, they were so amazing, because they had no reference for this.\"",
      "Fox recalled this moment in his new memoir, \"Future Boy: Back to the Future and My Journey Through the Space-Time Continuum.\"",
      "In the book, he recalled a Christmas he spent with his family in Canada in 1984, a year before the film came out. He described this holiday as his \u201clast brush with the old world.\u201d",
      "\"When I won my first Emmy, I brought it home to Canada and we put it on a table. And we\u2019re all sitting around playing board games and drinking and stuff, visiting. And I went to bed, and my Emmy was on this table,\" he told Willie. \"Woke up the next morning. My Emmy was there with my dad\u2019s bowling trophy, my brother\u2019s boxing trophy, my sister\u2019s skating trophy, and they\u2019re all around it. I said, 'That\u2019s great.'\"",
      "Thanks to his family, Fox says he'll \"never get out of control.\"",
      "\"They'll keep me,\" he laughed."

      "\"Love Is Blind\" launched on Netflix in 2020, and has spawned multiple international versions, from France to Brazil. \"Married at First Sight\" was adapted from a Danish version of the show. It began in 2014 on FYI, later moving to Lifetime and, as of 2025, Peacock.",
      "Whether you've watched one or both of the series, there are some clear similarities and differences between the two. Below, we're breaking down how the shows compare.",
      "The Concept",
      "If you've never watched \"Love Is Blind,\" the concept is quite simple. Singles meet in dating pods separated by a black wall. By taking physical looks out of the equation, the show tries to see if people form deeper, more authentic emotional connections. Only by getting engaged can the couples come face-to-face.",
      "Afterwards, the engaged couples jet away on a romantic getaway then move in together. Over the course of a few weeks, they begin to meet each other's families and friends and explore how their romantic connection fares in the real world.",
      "At the end of the experiment, couples are left to decide whether they're ready to get married on their wedding day. Some couples go through with it, while others break up. Some even decide not to get married but continue dating.",
      "The name of the show says it all. Participants in \"Married at First Sight\" get married the first time they meet.",
      "Unlike \"Love Is Blind,\" couples commit to marriage before getting to know each other then start working with a group of experts to strengthen their relationship.",
      "Couples have access to pastors, marriage counselors, sexologists, sociologists and relationship specialists to explore their connection and determine if they're ready to go the distance with their new spouse.",
      "Similar to \"Love Is Blind,\" couples must make a decision at the end of the experiment and decide whether they're going to stay married or get divorced.",
      "Pop Culture Legacy",

      "Reese Witherspoon has been working with authors for years. Now, she can count herself among them.",
      "Witherspoon, who runs her own book club and has served as executive producer of many book-to-screen adaptations, collaborated with bestselling thriller author Harlan Coben to write the novel \"Gone Before Goodbye,\" out Oct. 14.",
      "Witherspoon tells TODAY.com she came out of the experience with \"more respect for writers.\"",
      "\"It's just an incredibly disciplined talent where they have to really make stuff up out of thin air,\" Witherspoon says.",
      "Coben, standing next to her, says he's not sure where his ability to write his many twists comes from. \"I think if I think about it, it'll go away,\" he says, laughing.",
      "\"Gone Before Goodbye\" began with an idea Witherspoon had about three years ago, but felt she couldn't execute on her own. She called up Coben, whom she had met about two and half years before, to help tell the story of Maggie McCabe, a former army combat surgeon who finds herself entangled with billionaire oligarchs, dark money and a dangerous scheme.",
      "Growing up the daughter of a surgeon and nurse, Witherspoon was fascinated by the medical profession and said at her Shine Away in October that she once dreamed of entering the field, per the Hollywood Reporter.",

      "\"Reese was just the perfect partner. She knew when to push me, when to back off, when to just \u2014 I could see why she'd be a great boss,\" he says, adding, \"I actually admire everything about Reese.\"",
      "Witherspoon, meanwhile, says it was \"privilege\" to watch him construct the book.",
      "\"I understood a lot as an actor about building character, but he builds entire worlds and a cast of characters that all have to intertwine to come out with this perfect result. And he managed to tie up every loose end, which I didn't think was possible,\" she says.",
      "But when it came to landing the ending, Coben credits Witherspoon's suggestion to change it.",
      "\"When she first told me, (I) was kind of like, 'No one touches my endings.' But actually she was right. I went to bed that night, I woke up the next morning, said, 'You're right.' So we made a little change in the end,\" he says.",
      "The duo played coy when asked on TODAY with Jenna & Friends whether they'd ever team up for an adaptation.",
      "As for whether Witherspoon would write another book?",
      "\"Only with Harlan Coben,\" she says."

      "Why are all the TikTok girlies typing \u201cgirl whatever\u201d on their videos?",
      "Over 27,000 posts and counting have used the hashtag #girlwhatever. The videos take on a similar format: Users post videos of themselves or their surroundings set to Charli XCX\u2019s song \u201cYou (Ha Ha Ha).\u201d",
      "The wide application of the \"girl whatever\" trend include: Horses running by a pool, footage from a Lady Gaga concert, a skydiving expedition, or eating a burrito on a beach. It's even reached the NFL: The Pittsburgh Steelers, Kansas City Chiefs and New York Giants have tapped into the trend, posting videos of their players running onto the field.",
      "But how does this two-word phrase tie all these disparate videos together? \"Girl whatever\" is everywhere \u2014 and so is confusion as to its meaning.",
      "One TikToker shared a video of her approaching the sparkling Eiffel Tower with the words, \u201cGirl whatever.\u201d But the caption was a cry for clarification: \u201cIt\u2019s not that deep \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (can someone explain this trend),\u201d she captioned the video.",

      "Other TikTokers have come to the rescue with takes.",
      "The social media agency @media.alacarte, which explains TikTok trends in videos, said you can \u201cuse this iconic Charli XCX song to show how you are loving life, despite everything going on around you. Because let\u2019s be honest..it was never *that* serious.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe \u2018girl whatever\u2019 trend is all about loving yourself and embracing your main character energy,\u201d creator Melanie Martinez said in a video.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also about leaving the drama and haters behind because the trivial problems and stress that they carry just have no place in your life,\u201d she added.",
      "TikToker Lizzy Lucamai offered another take on what the trend \u201creally means.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt means escaping the ordinary and realizing that you were meant for something more,\u201d Lucamai wrote. \u201cIt means nurturing your wild woman spirit and chasing down your dream. It means leaving behind everything that is not meant for you, clearing space for the things that are.\u201d",
      "The phrase is \u201cnot a diss,\u201d as commenters on this post from an Olivia Rodrigo concert (which got nearly 11 million views) were quick to point out. \u201cTo the people who dont understand: the girl whatever trend goes over a video of you happy living your best lifeee (sic), this is not a diss,\u201d one comment read.",
      "Like the slang term 67, \u201cgirl whatever\u201d doesn\u2019t really mean anything too deep. It's more an attitude and a mindset \u2014 enjoying your life as it passes you by."

      "PARIS \u2014 The heist cut through hushed corridors with a speed and ease that humiliated a nation. Authorities are now racing against their own clock.",
      "In the space of just seven minutes in the casual daylight of Sunday morning, four suspects stole nine pieces of France\u2019s crown jewels from the Louvre. They robbed not just the most visited museum in the world, but also the French people themselves, the government said Monday.",
      "Officials are now scrambling to reassure the public about security at key cultural sites \u2014 and find the jewels stolen from the museum before they can be broken up and melted down.",
      "The thieves used a monte-meubles \u2014 a truck mounted with a basket lift, commonly used to hoist furniture into Paris' inaccessible apartment blocks.",
      "They parked it outside the sprawling renaissance palace, rode to the balcony outside the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, and sliced through the window with cutting tools, according to officials.",
      "Their daring heist pierced the nation\u2019s self-image, too.",
      "Threatening museum staff with their angle-grinders, the otherwise unarmed thieves then smashed through two display cases, taking necklaces, tiaras and brooches from France\u2019s now dispatched royal families, officials said.",
      "This all played out just after the museum had opened, with bystanders able to video one suspect in a high-visibility vest standing at one of the glass boxes housing historical treasures.",
      "Investigators say they are puzzled why the culprits left behind the colossal, 140-carat Regent diamond, which has been valued at $60 million. Had they wandered down that opulent corridor, they would have reached the Mona Lisa \u2014 itself infamously stolen more than a century ago.",
      "As it was, they made off on two scooters, but not before they dropped two items, including the Crown of Empress Eug\u00e9nie, empress to Napoleon III in the 19th century, which was found broken near the scene, officials said.",
      "That item alone is \"worth several tens of millions of euros,\" Alexandre Giquello, president of France's leading Drouot auction house, told the Reuters news agency. \"And it's not, in my opinion, the most important item\" taken by the burglars.",
      "Some experts have said that because the items are unique they cannot be sold, and so the thieves will likely try to melt down their metals and break up their emeralds, sapphires, diamonds and pearls. That means investigators might have less than a week before the jewels are lost forever.",
      "The incident saw the Louvre shuttered Sunday and again Monday morning, with bewildered crowds evacuated from the area just after the assailants had struck.",
      "For a nation whose character is defined by proud displays of history and culture, the incident is being seen in some quarters as a national humiliation.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron called it \u201can attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our history.\u201d He vowed to \u201crecover the works and the perpetrators will be brought to justice,\u201d adding that \u201ceverything is being done, everywhere, to achieve this.\u201d",
      "The Culture and Interior ministries held an emergency meeting Monday and agreed to ask senior officials across France \u201cto immediately assess the existing security measures already in place around cultural institutions, and to strengthen them if necessary,\u201d the Interior Ministry said, according to Reuters.",
      "Justice Minister Gerard Darmanin said the heist gave a \u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cdeplorable\u201d image of France. \u201cWhat is certain is that we failed,\u201d he told the radio station France Inter. \u201cThe French people all feel like they\u2019ve been robbed.\u201d",
      "One of Macron\u2019s main political opponents, Jordan Bardella, the far-right leader who is favorite to replace him at the next presidential election in 2027, cast the crime as another example of \u201cthe disintegration of the state\u201d under Macron, and \u201can unbearable humiliation for our country.\u201d",
      "It is not the first time the Louvre has been targeted by thieves.",
      "In 1911, a museum decorator named Vincenzo Peruggia stole the Mona Lisa. And more recently French museums have been hit with a spate of thefts, including raw gold stolen from the National Museum of Natural History and porcelain works reportedly worth around $11 million taken from the Adrien Dubouche Museum in Limoges last month.",
      "After the theft at the Louvre, the union SUD Culture blamed \"destruction of jobs dedicated to security\" and funding shortfalls for security equipment.",
      "That hints at the wider disquiet percolating in France.",
      "Macron has seen multiple governments collapse as he tries to staunch the rise of Bardella\u2019s National Rally. Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in protest at public spending cuts.",
      "Now, authorities have another crisis at their door.",
      "Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on BFM TV that if the heist was commissioned by a collector, then there is a chance of getting the items back in their original condition.",
      "However, if not, the leading Dutch art detective Arthur Brand told Sky News that the police \"have a week\" before the jewels vanish forever.",
      "\"These crown jewels are so famous, you just cannot sell them,\" he said. \"The only thing they can do is melt the silver and gold down, dismantle the diamonds, try to cut them. That's the way they will probably disappear forever.\"",
      "\"It's a race against time.\"",
      "Molly Hunter and Mo Abbas reported from Paris and Alexander Smith from London."

      "LONDON \u2014 It's safe to say they're making their presence felt.",
      "Japan's top sumo wrestlers were wandering the streets of London earlier this week ahead of the sold-out Grand Sumo Tournament currently taking place at the Royal Albert Hall, the British capital's famous Victorian concert venue.",
      "Dressed in traditional Japanese clothing, the wrestlers known as rikishi, have been exploring the city in between rigorous training for what is just the second event of this type to be held outside Japan in 1,500 years.",
      "This time, the spotlight is on two highest-ranked wrestlers, known as yokozuna \u2014 Mongolian Hoshoryu Tomokatsu and Japan\u2019s Onosato Daiki. Onosato, 25, became the 75th fighter to earn that title in May, having risen to the rank in a record 13 tournaments.",
      "His rival, Hoshoryu, was the 74th man to attain the rank.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that sumo is back after so many years,\u201d Onosato told Sky News, NBC News\u2019 broadcasting partner, on Wednesday. \u201cI hope I can show the U.K. fans how fantastic sumo is.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing a yokozuna has a lot of responsibility,\u201d Hoshoryu said. \u201cMy uncle was a yokozuna \u2014 and I\u2019m happy to follow in his footsteps. But I came here to London as a yokozuna which he didn\u2019t, so I\u2019m even happier,\u201d he added.",
      "Stopping to pose for pictures with traditional souvenirs, the pair were among a group of sumo wrestlers who visited most of London's touristic landmarks, including Buckingham Palace and Westminster with its iconic Big Ben.",
      "But that didn't stop them from their rigorous training routine and their equally rigorous eating regime.",
      "Their carefully structured, high-calorie meals are vital for building the size and strength needed to compete at the highest level.",
      "\u201cWe are going through 70 kilos of rice a day,\u201d Donagh Collins, the CEO of Askonas Holt, an arts company which helped to organize the event, told Sky News. \u201cSomebody told me that the wholesaler for the noodles has run out of noodles,\u201d he added.",
      "But in a break from their traditional diet, some of the wrestlers were pictured enjoying London's street food and feeding each other hot dogs as they explored the city.",
      "While the tournament in London was completely sold out, back home Sumo has faced a series of scandals, including allegations of bullying, assault and sexism at stables where the wrestlers train. Allegations of illegal betting and links to organized crime have also cast a shadow over the image of Japan's national sport.",
      "But in London, Wednesday saw the first day of the five-day exhibition tournament \u2014 the first of its kind since one was hosted at the same venue some 34 years ago.",
      "The wrestlers, who weigh a combined six tons, slapped, gripped and lifted each other, as spectators reveled at the sight of the centuries-old Japanese sport.",
      "Around eleven tons of clay were brought into the hall to build the dohyo, the raised ring where the wrestlers compete, outlined with rice bales shaped and secured using beer bottles, according to Reuters.",
      "The two grand champions, Hoshoryu and Onosato, each secured victory in their bouts, closing the evening with weighty performances \u2014 literally."

      "The military in the Indian Ocean nation took power Tuesday right after lawmakers voted to impeach President Andry Rajoelina, who said Monday night in a speech from an undisclosed location that he had fled the country in fear for his life after an elite military unit joined the protesters.",
      "It\u2019s the second government Gen Z protesters have toppled in just over a month, after the prime minister of Nepal resigned last month in the face of protests set off by outrage over a social media ban.",
      "Young people angered by economic hardship, official corruption and perceived injustice have been central players in a recent wave of anti-government protests around the world, including in Indonesia, the Philippines, East Timor, Peru and Morocco.",
      "Despite being scattered across oceans and continents, the protests are connected by the frequent appearance of the same emblem: a pirate flag from a globally popular Japanese anime series.",
      "The flag, which features a grinning Jolly Roger skull and crossbones wearing a straw hat, is from the manga series \u201cOne Piece,\u201d whose protagonists, the Straw Hat Pirates, rebel against an unjust world and defy corrupt powers.",

      "They are likely to identify with anime protagonists \u201cwho are often depicted as minorities, who are marginalized, ignored and misunderstood by their societies,\u201d said Katsuya Izumi, a senior lecturer in language and culture studies at Trinity College in Connecticut.",
      "Frustrated by chronic power and water shortages, young people in Madagascar, an island nation off southeastern Africa, first took to the streets of the capital, Antananarivo, on Sept. 25. The protests were mobilized largely by Gen Z Madagascar, a leaderless group that is powered by social media.",

      "As in the protests in Nepal, Indonesia and elsewhere, the focus of the movement in Madagascar \u2014 a former French colony of about 30 million people that is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries \u2014 broadened from a lack of basic necessities to anger over inequality, corruption and widespread political impunity.",
      "Soon, young protesters in Madagascar, where the median age is 19, were demanding the resignation of Rajoelina, 51, who came to power in a military-backed coup in 2009.",
      "\u201cWe just can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d To Ranaivoharijao, 26, a member of Gen Z Madagascar\u2019s communications team, said in an interview this month.",
      "\u201cThe president is building a cable car in the capital, while most of the population is suffering from malnutrition, lack of clean water and power outages,\u201d he said via messaging app.",
      "Madagascar authorities responded to the protests with force, with witnesses reporting widespread use of tear gas, rubber bullets and even firearms.",
      "According to the United Nations, at least 22 people have been killed in the Madagascar protests, a figure the government has disputed.",
      "Local protesters say they have been inspired by youth-driven movements against ruling elites in Nepal and elsewhere.",
      "The protests\u2019 global spread has been aided by the pirate flag from \u201cOne Piece,\u201d whose popularity has made its ideas about resistance accessible across languages and cultures.",
      "According to Guinness World Records, the \u201cOne Piece\u201d series, which was started in 1997 by Japanese manga author Eiichiro Oda, holds the record for most published copies of the same single-author comic book series, at more than half a billion.",
      "It has been translated into 40 languages and turned into animated series, feature films, a card game, video games and a Netflix live-action version, creating a \u201cshared subcultural language,\u201d said Rayna Denison, a professor of film and digital arts at the University of Bristol in Britain.",
      "The series\u2019 main protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy, is a \u201csymbol of freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cThis makes the use of his Jolly Roger an emphatic endorsement of values.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe United States and the other guarantors remain resolute in our commitment to ensuring the safety of civilians, maintaining calm on the ground, and advancing peace and prosperity for the people of Gaza and the region as a whole,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Keeping up with food demand",
      "Two years of war and Israeli restrictions on aid have pushed the population of Gaza to the brink of starvation, with the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger declaring a famine in August in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. Israel allowed very few aid trucks in, and aid began to pile up outside the crossings.",
      "As of Thursday, Israel had allowed some 950 trucks into Gaza, according to figures Israel supplied to mediators, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, told reporters Friday.",
      "The WFP also said it was trying to ramp up food production capacity inside Gaza. Over the past two weeks, nine bakeries in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis have produced a daily average of over 100,000 bread bundles.",
      "However, it said, \u201cThe quantity of nutritious food aid entering Gaza is still insufficient to address the severe hunger conditions.\u201d",
      "Tom Fletcher, the U.N.\u2019s undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, visited bakeries in Gaza on Friday, citing the supply of ingredients and fuel to power bread-making machines as critical factors.",
      "He said in a post on X that work was underway to \u201cquickly rebuild\u201d food production with the aim of opening 30 bakeries and distributing a million meals a day across Gaza. The enclave had a population of 2 million people at the start of the war."

      "The remains were later identified as Eliyahu Margalit, 75, from Nir Oz kibbutz, who was killed in the Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack and his body taken into Gaza, the IDF said in a post on X.",
      "Israel has demanded that Hamas do more to ensure the swift return of the bodies of the remaining 18 hostages in Gaza, saying the militant group knows where they are and warning that the Israeli military would plan to resume fighting if it fails to do so.",
      "Hamas said Thursday that returning the bodies of the hostages \u201cmay take some time\u201d as some were buried in tunnels that were destroyed by Israeli bombing. \u201cOthers remain under the rubble of buildings bombed and demolished,\u201d it said in a statement.",

      "U.S. advisers have also said the process could take weeks, and that during negotiations all sides had acknowledged the difficulty of the recovery.",
      "Extracting the bodies from under the rubble requires heavy machinery and equipment, Hamas said, accusing Israel of blocking their entry.",
      "Also Thursday, the Ministry of Health in Gaza posted photos of what it said were bodies of Palestinian prisoners returned by Israel as part of the ceasefire, showing signs of torture and with various toes and fingers missing.",
      "None of the bodies came with any identification, Dr. Ahmed Edheir, Forensic Medicine Consultant and Head of Forensic Medicine in Gaza, told NBC News.",

      "The entry of vital humanitarian aid into the enclave has been another point of contention.",
      "The World Food Programme said Friday that it had brought in 560 tonnes of aid since the ceasefire began, but had not started any distribution in famine-stricken Gaza City as key northern crossings remained closed.",

    "story": [
      "A large chunk of suspected space debris has been found in a remote part of the Australian desert, the country\u2019s space agency confirmed Monday.",
      "The charred and smoldering object was found in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, according to the Australian Space Agency. It\u2019s not yet clear what the object is or where it came from, but officials said it\u2019s probably a spent rocket part.",
      "\u201cThe debris is likely a propellant tank or pressure vessel from a space launch vehicle,\u201d the Australian Space Agency wrote in a post on X.",
      "The agency did not provide details about the object\u2019s size or weight, but wrote that it is working with local authorities and other space agencies to investigate and determine \u201cthe exact nature of the debris and its origin.\u201d",
      "The agency did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for further information.",
      "The object was discovered Saturday on a remote access road by workers from a nearby mine, according to a report from Sky News, which said that local authorities did not think the debris posed any threat to public safety. NBC News has not independently confirmed these details. (Sky News is a division of Comcast, the parent company of NBC News.)",
      "Government space agencies and private space companies often let depleted or defunct rocket parts and satellites burn up in the atmosphere as a way to destroy them. Sometimes, however, pieces can survive the fiery process of atmospheric re-entry. Still, it\u2019s relatively rare for space debris to fall over land, given that the planet is mostly covered by oceans \u2014 and even more rare for pieces to fall over densely populated areas.",

      "In March 2024, a 1.6-pound piece of metal tore through a home in Naples, Florida. A subsequent investigation found that the metal debris came from a cargo pallet that had been intentionally released from the International Space Station to burn up in the atmosphere.",
      "Tens of thousands of pieces of space junk \u2014 and millions more smaller bits of orbital debris \u2014 are cluttered in low Earth orbit, the narrow band of space where many telecommunications and GPS satellites circle the planet. These objects fly through orbit at up to 18,000 mph, threatening functioning spacecraft and posing safety risks to astronauts on the International Space Station.",
      "For those reasons, experts have long warned against overcrowding in space. NASA and other space agencies have even funded research into and technology demonstrations of how to clean up the large amount of junk in orbit.",

      "People with a leading cause of blindness were able to read again thanks to a tiny wireless chip implanted in the back of the eye and specialized augmented glasses, according to study results published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The trial involved 38 European patients, all of whom had an advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) known as geographic atrophy.",
      "There is no cure for AMD, which is driven by changes in a part of the retina called the macula and caused by inflammation and a build-up of waste. The photoreceptor cells in the macula are responsible for producing sharp, detailed and colored vision. When the disease has progressed to the geographic atrophy stage, the cells deteriorate and die, and people lose their central vision \u2014 meaning an object straight ahead may appear blurry or covered up with a dark blotch.",
      "Roughly 22 million people in the United States have AMD, and about 1 million have geographic atrophy, according to the American Macular Degeneration Foundation.",
      "In the study, the participants, who had an average age of 79, were fitted with the \u201cPRIMA device,\u201d a system meant to replicate vision. Patients wear augmented reality glasses embedded with a camera that captures their visual field. What the camera \u201csees\u201d is transmitted to the chip implanted in the eye in the form of infrared light. The chip converts the light into an electrical current, which stimulates the remaining healthy cells in the macula in a realistic way, enabling the brain to interpret signals the cells send as vision.",
      "An image processor, which users must carry, lets patients zoom in and magnify the images they see, which appear in black and white.",
      "With the help of the PRIMA device, 80% of the 32 patients who returned for reassessments one year after the chip implantation had achieved clinically meaningful visual improvements. Patients did experience side effects, predominantly related to the surgical procedure: The study reported that 26 serious adverse events occurred in 19 of the patients, ranging from elevated blood pressure in the eye to an accumulation of blood around the retina. The majority of the adverse events resolved within two months of the implantation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first ever therapeutic approach that has led to an improvement in visual function in this group of patients,\u201d said Dr. Frank Holz, the trial\u2019s lead investigator and chair of the department of ophthalmology at the University Hospital of Bonn in Germany. \u201cLate-stage age-related macular degeneration is a dismal disease. Patients are no longer capable of reading, driving a car, watching TV or even recognizing faces. So [these results] are a game changer in my mind.\u201d",
      "One patient, Sheila Irvine, 70, who was fitted with the PRIMA device at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, said in a statement provided by the hospital that her life before she received the implant was akin to \u201chaving two black discs in my eyes, with the outside distorted.\u201d A self-described \u201cavid bookworm\u201d before she lost her vision, Irvine said she was now able to do crosswords and read prescriptions.",
      "Dr. Sunir Garg, professor of ophthalmology at the retina service of Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, who was not involved in the study, said the results are a breakthrough for patients with geographic atrophy. All doctors have been able to offer, he said, are visual aids, like magnifiers, and emotional support.",
      "\u201cEven with new medical therapies, the best that we can do is slow it down,\u201d said Garg, who works with several drugmakers involved in treatments for AMD, including Apellis Pharmaceuticals, the maker of pegcetacoplan. The drug, which slows the progression of geographic atrophy, was recently approved in the United States and must be injected into the eye every one to two months. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop it, and we can\u2019t do anything to bring back lost vision.\u201d",
      "Dr. Demetrios Vavvas, director of the retina service at Mass Eye and Ear in Boston, who was also not involved in the study, said the PRIMA system is not without limitations.",
      "Vavvas noted that the surgery required to implant the chip in the eye requires a high level of surgical skill and is not without risk. \u201cYou have to lift the retina off its normal position to implant this device, which increases the atrophy,\u201d said Vavvas, who is a consultant to Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals, a company working on stem cell therapies for patients with other forms of vision loss.",
      "Vavvas said it was important to note that the device is not restoring normal vision, as patients were able to see only in black and white rather than color, and that the trial participants had to undergo a significant amount of training to learn how to see with the device. He also said it was not clear whether the enhancements in visual ability had significantly improved the patients\u2019 quality of life.",
      "But at the same time, Vavvas was also optimistic about its potential, describing the current iteration of PRIMA as a key steppingstone in the field of vision restoration.",
      "\u201cThink of this device as the pre-release iPhone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe limitations are clear. We shouldn\u2019t oversell that the quality of life really improved. But there were certain [visual] tasks at which the patients were clearly better. So it shows to us that there is potential in this approach. It is still, in some ways, a prototype. They\u2019re working on iterations of this device that will be better.\u201d",
      "New upgrades to the device could be coming in the next couple of years.",
      "The PRIMA system was invented by Stanford University ophthalmology professor Daniel Palanker and is being developed by the California-based neural engineering company Science Corp.",
      "Palanker said technical improvements are being made to increase the number of pixels in the chip from 400 to 10,000. The new chips have already been tested in rats, and the upgraded chips are being manufactured for future human trials. With the aid of the camera\u2019s zoom function, Palanker said, that could theoretically enable patients to achieve 20/20 visual resolution.",
      "\u201cWe are also working on next-generation software that will allow patients to perceive not just black-and-white text, but also gray-scale natural images, such as faces,\u201d Palanker said.",
      "Palanker suggested that the technology could be trialed in other retinal diseases that cause blindness, such as Stargardt disease, which has similar symptoms to age-related macular degeneration but is genetic and usually affects younger people.",
      "Garg and Vavvas are eager to see larger trials that provide more details about how the device improves patients\u2019 ability to function day to day. Vavvas suggested that future trials should include a control arm to understand the extent to which the device yields real-world benefits, for example compared with existing electronic magnifiers.",
      "\u201cIs it something that is good enough for patients to say, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve regained my independence because I can now do my credit card bills myself, stamp and address my envelopes myself, and look at grocery store labels\u2019?\u201d Garg said. \u201cThose kinds of practical things I would like to know more about.\u201d",
      "Vavvas  said: \u201cThis is a chronic disease that you will have for life, so we need more than one year of follow-up to see other risks, other problems. Does that signal of efficacy that we see at 12 months remain two years later?\u201d",
      "While Vavvas said he would not call the device a panacea for blindness, the study showed that brain-computer interfaces can represent an important approach to tackling different kinds of severe visual impairment. \u201cAs the iterations of this device become better and better, it could become a real solution for a cohort of patients,\u201d he said."

      "President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed an agreement at the White House on Monday on rare-earth minerals, which could serve as a bargaining chip as the United States fights a trade war with China.",
      "They signed the agreement at the top of the meeting, which Trump told the media had \"been negotiated over a period of four or five months.\"",
      "\"We got it done just in time for the visit,\" Trump told reporters. \"And we work together very much on rare earths, critical minerals and lots of other things, and we\u2019ve had a very good relationship. We\u2019ve been working on that for quite a while.\"",
      "Albanese said Australia has a $8.5 billion pipeline \"ready to go\" for the deal.",
      "A White House official said that under the deal, the U.S. and Australian governments plan to invest more than $3 billion together in critical mineral projects in the next six months, with recoverable resources estimated to be worth over $50 billion.",
      "Asked whether the United States plans to lift tariffs on Australia, Trump touted his general trade policies and eventually said: \"I will say this, Australia pays very low tariffs, very, very low tariffs. Australia pays among the lowest tariffs.\"",
      "The two leaders are also expected to discuss defense cooperation, Indo-Pacific stability and the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal, Albanese\u2019s office said Sunday.",
      "Albanese, whose center-left government was re-elected in May for a second term, said he looked forward to a \u201cpositive and constructive\u201d meeting with Trump.",
      "Australia, a country of about 27 million people, hasn\u2019t figured prominently in the second Trump administration so far. Unlike many U.S. trading partners, it has a large trade deficit with the United States, earning it the minimum tariff rate of 10%.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Australia is particularly high on Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Emma Shortis, director of the Australia Institute\u2019s International and Security Affairs Program.",
      "But the rest of the world may be watching the meeting closely, she said, \u201cto see how Trump treats a traditional ally.\u201d",
      "For Albanese, the bar for success is that the meeting \u201cisn\u2019t a disaster,\u201d Shortis said, avoiding the kind of Oval Office dressing-downs Trump delivered to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.",
      "Resource-rich Australia has sensed an opportunity in recent U.S.-China tensions over rare-earth minerals, which are critical components of advanced electronics and defense technologies. China, which has a near-monopoly on their production and processing, has announced a series of export controls viewed as threatening the global supply.",
      "\u201cWe know that American companies desperately need critical minerals, and Australia is very well placed to service that need,\u201d Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers told reporters in Washington on Friday.",
      "There has been some uneasiness in Australia that it has taken nine months for Trump and Albanese to have an official meeting, though they met briefly last month on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.",
      "But there is also uneasiness about Albanese\u2019s meeting with Trump at all.",
      "Australia, whose population closely follows U.S. politics, is among the countries most critical of Trump, with 77% of survey respondents telling the Pew Research Center in the first months of his current term that they had \u201cno confidence\u201d in Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs.",
      "A poll released by the Australia Institute in May found that more than 54% of respondents preferred a more independent foreign policy over a closer alliance with the United States, an increase of 10 percentage points compared with the same poll two months earlier, shortly after Trump returned to office.",
      "Though Australian support for the U.S. alliance has historically been strong, \u201cif the United States is not seen as a democracy or a nation of laws, then the alliance with the United States will come into question,\u201d said Brendon O\u2019Connor, a professor of U.S. politics and U.S. foreign relations at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.",
      "Albanese broke with the United States last month by formally recognizing a Palestinian state. He has praised Trump over the ceasefire he brokered in the Israel-Hamas war but will be cautious not to be seen as too \u201cfawning\u201d to Trump on \u201cissues around democracy and authoritarianism and internal dissent,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.",
      "The relationship has also been tested over the future of AUKUS (which stands for Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States), a $240 billion trilateral security deal in which Australia would buy U.S. nuclear-powered submarines in 2032 and then build a new submarine class with Britain.",
      "Australian officials have expressed confidence that the deal will move forward, even though it is currently under review by the Trump administration amid concerns that the U.S. may not be able to produce enough submarines for both itself and its ally.",
      "Australian Defense Minister Pat Conroy said last week that Australia would \u201cshortly\u201d make its second of three billion-dollar payments to help accelerate U.S. nuclear submarine production.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s reasons to be pretty skeptical about whether those submarines will ever arrive,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just up to Trump. I mean, six months before delivering them in the 2030s the United States can decide it doesn\u2019t have enough submarines to sell Australia three or four.\u201d",
      "Some in Australia have suggested that Albanese could shore up Trump\u2019s support for AUKUS by offering a critical minerals deal.",
      "Shortis was skeptical, arguing that \u201cTrump\u2019s word on any issue like this is not particularly reliable and can change very quickly.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you offer Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be enough.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Iranian director Jafar Panahi puts a lot on the line for his work.",
      "Authorities could again arrest him for speaking out against the country\u2019s hard-line regime. They could send him back to the notoriously cruel Evin Prison in Tehran, which houses many of Iran\u2019s political dissidents. He could again be placed on house arrest and barred from making films.",
      "But Panahi, now 65, has largely ignored these attempts at silencing him over the years, instead focusing on doing what he loves most: making films about his homeland.",
      "When he was imprisoned and charged with \u201cpropagandizing against the government,\u201d he went on a hunger strike until authorities released him on bail. His filmmaking ban \u2014 which was supposed to last for 20 years \u2014 ended up serving as creative inspiration, fueling critically acclaimed films such as \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d and \u201cTaxi.\u201d",
      "With his latest movie, \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which was released in limited North American theaters over the weekend, Panahi once again defied the government\u2019s attempts to censor his art, though it has meant putting himself at risk.",
      "\u201cYou have to find a way around the system,\u201d Panahi said in a recent interview conducted in Farsi at a hotel in Santa Monica, California, and translated into English by NBC News. Panahi, known for the signature sunglasses that he sports at every event, was sitting in the lobby next to his translator after enjoying a smoke break outside.",
      "The filmmaker has had a busy few months traveling the world to promote his film, a buzzy Oscar contender that was picked up for distribution in North America by Neon. He has also faced several hurdles coming from Iran \u2014 including missing a New York Film Festival screening after his visa process was delayed, reportedly because of the U.S. government shutdown.",
      "While on the press tour, he has continued to champion his message of the importance of freedom of expression.",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d a revenge drama that is sprinkled with comedic moments, follows a group of Iranians who capture a man whom they suspect was their interrogator while they were in prison. They quarrel about the man they have put in the back of their van and whether he is in fact the guard, noting both have an artificial leg that makes a squeaking noise when walking. The group also grapples with the morality behind taking vengeance, and whether that makes them just as bad as those who oppressed them.",
      "Panahi reflected on how his own time in prison shaped \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which was the first film he directed after  spending seven months in Evin from 2022 to 2023.",
      "\u201cWhen you are imprisoned, it does not matter which group, which category and which party you are. We are all living with each other. And then when you go out, you can\u2019t separate from it. These all remain in your mind,\u201d he said. \u201cThis experience stays in your brain, and after you leave \u2026 you feel like you have to do something to express this.\u201d",
      "The filmmaker has previously spoken about his time at the prison, recalling how he was placed in solitary confinement and blindfolded during his hourslong interrogations. He drew from his own experiences, as well as from fellow political prisoners he met there, in writing the film, making it one of his most personal endeavors to date.",
      "But authorities in Iran oversee the media, so filmmakers must get their scripts approved to get film permits. While Panahi is no longer banned from filmmaking, he chose to shoot in secret, filming in Iran over the course of several weeks without official permission from the government because of the film\u2019s sensitive subject matter.",
      "The crew shot scenes in a remote desert location, in a van and in the streets of Tehran. Expecting trouble from authorities, the crew also took precautionary steps while moving around the city. Panahi told Vulture that in the summer of 2024, the crew was stopped by police during filming. They were asked to turn everything over but they handed over an empty memory card from a camera, rather than the actual footage of the film.",
      "They then waited a few weeks to resume the project and ended up editing part of the movie in France for safety reasons after the cast and crew had a run-in with authorities.",
      "\u201cIf you want to make a movie in Iran, you have to accept that is not possible through a regular path, you have to find an alternative path, and you either have to find it yourself or use other people\u2019s experience in doing so,\u201d Panahi said.",
      "Despite his years of political dissent and the personal price he has paid, Panahi is humble. He explained that it\u2019s the people of Iran who deserve praise for continuing to stand up to the government in the aftermath of the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody, which triggered huge, monthslong public protests that were labeled the Women, Life, Freedom movement.",
      "\u201cThey are more brave than I am,\u201d he said, noting that he\u2019s someone who is \u201cwell known\u201d and because of that has \u201csome protections in place.\u201d The activists \u201care not known to anyone,\u201d he said. They took to the streets, were jailed and released, and still continue to protest in their own ways.",
      "For example, there are women in Iran who now refuse to wear the mandatory hijab, instead walking around with their hair flowing freely. It\u2019s a subtle act of defiance that Panahi captured in his film, which shows its two female stars without headscarves in public in several scenes.",
      "It was important to Panahi to depict a \u201ctruthful picture of Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point in history where everything is measured by whether it happened before or after the Women, Life, Freedom movement. If it\u2019s before, and you were showing in your film that there was a woman without the headscarf covering, it would not be believable.\u201d",
      "Those who admire Panahi say his art serves as its own powerful form of activism, as he balances politics with a personal touch that helps breathe levity into heavier topics.",
      "At the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, Panahi won the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or after the film received a nearly eight-minute standing ovation.",
      "The win marked the second time an Iranian filmmaker took home the award (Abbas Kiarostami was the first, winning in 1997 for \u201cTaste of Cherry\u201d). Panahi has now received the top prize at all three major European film festivals, including Berlin\u2019s Golden Bear for \u201cTaxi\u201d in 2015 and the Golden Lion at Venice for \u201cThe Circle\u201d in 2000.",
      "Oscar-winning actor Juliette Binoche, who served as the 2025 Cannes jury president, said that \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d \u201csprings from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very human and political at the same time, because he comes from a complicated country,\u201d she said at the event, according to Deadline. \u201cWhen we watched the film, it stood out.\u201d",
      "At the New York Film Festival earlier this month, Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese also praised Panahi and called on more streaming services to champion Iranian cinema.",
      "As the film continues to rack up positive reviews and vies for Oscar nods, Panahi plans to continue to promote it at events.",
      "Other Iranian filmmakers, including Panahi\u2019s friend and fellow director Mohammad Rasoulof, have fled Iran to avoid facing fierce punishment.",
      "But when asked whether he fears the Iranian government lashing out at him again, Panahi appeared undeterred.",
      "\u201cWhat are they going to do that they haven\u2019t done already?\u201d he said."

      "\u201cPutin is something similar but more strong than Hamas,\u201d Zelenskyy said. The war is bigger and Russia\u2019s army is the second biggest in the world, he added, \u201cand that\u2019s why more pressure\u201d is needed.",

      "Covid vaccines may come with a tantalizing benefit that has nothing to do with the virus they\u2019re designed to protect against: boosting the immune system to better fight tumors during cancer treatment.",
      "That\u2019s according to new results presented Sunday in Berlin at the European Society for Medical Oncology conference. The research is still in the earlier stages \u2014 it has yet to be tested in a Phase 3 clinical trial \u2014 but experts say it shows promise.",
      "\u201cI am cautiously optimistic,\u201d said Stephanie Dougan, an associate professor of cancer immunology and virology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who was not involved with the work. \u201cThere is a scientific logic to why this could work.\u201d",
      "Researchers found that among cancer patients getting immunotherapy, those who got an mRNA Covid vaccine within 100 days before starting their treatment lived longer.",
      "Only about 20% of cancer patients who get immunotherapy \u2014 which harnesses a person\u2019s immune system to fight cancer cells \u2014 respond to the treatment. Finding a way to boost the effectiveness of immunotherapy drugs has been a feat researchers have been exploring for years, with little success.",
      "Typically, the immune-stimulating tactics employed in the past have either done too little to activate the immune system or done too much, triggering an overactive response that can damage the body. There\u2019s a chance that mRNA Covid vaccines could exist in a Goldilocks zone.",
      "\u201cMaybe we just needed something that was medium-strong, and this could potentially be it,\u201d said Dougan, who emphasized the need for more research.",
      "That research will soon be underway: Dr. Adam Grippin, a senior resident in radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center who co-led the study, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results.",
      "In the research presented Sunday, Grippin and his co-authors looked back at survival rates among more than 1,000 people who had advanced non-small cell lung cancer and got immunotherapy as part of their treatment from 2019 through 2023. Of those, 180 people received an mRNA Covid vaccine within 100 days of starting treatment.",
      "The median survival for the group \u2014 when exactly half of those who underwent treatment are still alive \u2014 was nearly twice as long for those who were vaccinated compared to those who were not: about three years compared to just over 1.5 years.",
      "The researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients getting immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma. Forty-three got an mRNA Covid vaccine; 167 did not. For those who didn\u2019t get vaccinated, median survival was just over two years. Those who were vaccinated prior to treatment hadn\u2019t yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up.",
      "In further experiments in mice, the researchers got an answer they believe matches the way the vaccines work in humans.",
      "\u201cIt superdrives the immune system against tumors,\u201d Grippin said.",
      "Creating a beacon",
      "Vaccines that use mRNA are already a promising area of cancer research. Scientists have developed personalized mRNA cancer vaccines that are tailored to fight a person\u2019s unique tumor, as well as ones that target genes that are commonly found in certain types of cancer, including pancreatic. (These developments come as the Trump administration has canceled half a billion dollars in funding for mRNA vaccine research for infectious diseases.)",
      "If Grippin\u2019s later trial confirms the results of the early research, it could represent the next frontier for research on mRNA vaccines and cancer.",
      "Immunotherapy drugs work by boosting the immune system\u2019s ability to fight cancer, often by enhancing the power of immune cells called T cells, which attack invaders, or by making tumors easier for T cells to find.",
      "The mouse portion of the new research found that Covid mRNA vaccination appeared to make the immune system more attuned to recognizing tumors as a threat by stimulating dendritic cells, a type of white blood cell. When dendritic cells detect a threat, they turn on a sort of beacon that leads T cells to the perceived invader so they can attack. However, not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of fighting tumors, which is why scientists believe immunotherapies only work in some of the cancer patients who take them. In these people, the immune system recognizes cancer cells as a threat, but their specific T cells are unable to stop the tumors from growing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just random chance whether you have those cells or you don\u2019t,\u201d said Jeff Coller, a professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins Medicine, who was not involved with the research.",
      "Getting an mRNA Covid vaccine doesn\u2019t change whether a person has the specific T cells needed to fight their tumors, but it does appear to make it more likely that dendritic cells will detect a tumor as a problem and direct the T cells a person does have to the tumor. If those cells happen to be programmed to be able to kill tumor cells, having an mRNA vaccine that lights up the target before a person starts an immunotherapy can give their immune system a boost that helps the cancer therapy work better.",
      "Coller said one reason mRNA technology may be the best tool to elicit this response is because every cell in the body already contains mRNA.",
      "\u201cWe are really tapping into that natural process that your body already knows how to respond to,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are using your body\u2019s natural system to fight tumors.\u201d",
      "Dougan said it\u2019s possible that other factors could have accounted for better survival among people who were vaccinated prior to immunotherapy treatment. For example, a Covid infection may have weakened an unvaccinated person\u2019s body and hindered their ability to fight off cancer cells. In the past, early studies like this one have shown promising results that didn\u2019t pan out in later trials.",
      "\u201cWe have been misled by retrospective studies before,\u201d she said.",
      "Grippin agreed the findings warrant a closer look.",
      "\u201cThis data is exciting, but all of these findings need to be validated in Phase 3 clinical trials to determine whether these vaccines should be used in our patients,\u201d he said."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 For years, pro-Beijing lawmakers in Hong Kong have been steadfastly in support of the government. That is, until the issue of same-sex partnerships came up.",
      "Last month, Hong Kong\u2019s opposition-free Legislative Council overwhelmingly voted down a government-sponsored bill that would have partially recognized same-sex unions in the Chinese territory.",
      "The rejection, which LGBTQ rights advocates said was \u201cdisappointing,\u201d has rekindled discussions about gay rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong as its leaders grow more in sync with the central Chinese government.",
      "The bill, which would have granted limited rights to same-sex couples, was a response to a 2023 order by Hong Kong\u2019s top court that gave the government until Oct. 27, 2025, to establish an alternative framework for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships, such as registered civil partnerships or civil unions.",
      "Marriage equality remains a work in progress in Asia, with only three jurisdictions \u2014 Taiwan, Nepal and Thailand \u2014 having fully legalized same-sex marriage. A 2023 survey of Hong Kong residents by the Chinese University of Hong Kong found that same-sex marriage was supported by about 60% of respondents.",
      "Though the Hong Kong legislation fell far short of fully recognizing same-sex marriage, equality campaigners said it still would have been a step forward for the international financial hub, whose global image has suffered greatly after mass anti-government protests, severe pandemic restrictions and a crackdown on dissent.",
      "However, 71 out of 86 lawmakers opposed the bill, with some blasting it as an attack on marriage and traditional Chinese values.",
      "The veto marked the legislature\u2019s first big split with the government since Beijing\u2019s \u201cpatriots-only\u201d electoral reform in 2021, which aimed to ensure \u201cconsistent\u201d and \u201cstrong\u201d legislative support for the executive after the 2019 protests. The changes have essentially shut out the pro-democracy lawmakers who traditionally challenged the government.",
      "The Hong Kong government said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the veto but that it would respect the legislature\u2019s decision and turn to administrative means to protect the rights of gay couples. The details of its next steps are not immediately clear.",
      "\u2018No enthusiasm\u2019",
      "Hong Kong, a city of 7.5 million people, had been making some progress on LGBTQ rights through a string of court victories.",
      "In 2023, Hong Kong\u2019s top court ruled that transgender people could change their gender on their official identity cards without undergoing full sex reassignment surgery. In July, a Hong Kong court ruled that transgender people have the right to use public toilets in line with their affirmed genders.",
      "And last month, a Hong Kong judge ruled in favor of a lesbian couple who wanted to include both mothers\u2019 names on their son\u2019s birth certificate.",
      "But there have also been setbacks as the space for activism in Hong Kong has diminished. Pink Dot, the city\u2019s largest LGBTQ event, said last month that it was holding its 2025 edition online after losing its usual venue with no explanation.",
      "The case that prompted the same-sex marriage legislation was brought in 2018 by Jimmy Sham, a leading local gay rights activist who took the government to the Court of Final Appeal to have his overseas same-sex marriage recognized.",
      "The 2023 court ruling in his favor came while Sham, 38, one of 47 pro-democracy figures arrested in 2021 under a Beijing-imposed national security law, was on trial on subversion charges. Sham, who like most of the defendants pleaded guilty, was released from prison in May after serving more than four years.",
      "To comply with the landmark ruling, the Hong Kong government proposed a mechanism in July by which gay couples could visit their partners in the hospital, access their medical records and make decisions about organ donation and funeral arrangements. It did not address parental or adoption rights.",
      "The protections also would have applied only to same-sex couples who had registered their partnerships outside Hong Kong, a provision that advocacy groups criticized as discriminatory.",
      "Yet the proposal met with strong objections from lawmakers, who cited a \u201clack of social consensus\u201d in Hong Kong on the \u201chighly controversial\u201d subject of same-sex partnership.",
      "They argued that the bill, even though it did not legalize gay marriage, would still lead to a \u201ccollapse of traditional family ethics and values\u201d if passed.",
      "\u201cWhy stir up trouble and break tradition for a small group, throwing the whole society into turmoil?\u201d said lawmaker Junius Ho, a vocal opponent of LGBTQ rights.",
      "Sham said that although the veto was a \u201cgreat pity,\u201d he hoped authorities would relaunch the legislative process.",
      "\u201cThe question is whether those in power have the courage and wisdom to resolve differences and seek consensus,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post.",
      "Hong Kong officials said the government had made its \u201cbest effort\u201d to secure support from the legislature, basing the proposal on what they deemed \u201csocietal common ground.\u201d",
      "However, John Burns, an emeritus professor at the University of Hong Kong who specializes in the city\u2019s politics and governance, said he saw \u201cno enthusiasm\u201d from the government to create an alternative framework for recognizing same-sex partnerships.",
      "After being forced into action by the court, Burns said, the Hong Kong government \u201cwaited until virtually the last possible moment\u201d before proposing a \u201cminimalist bill.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey had many opportunities to fix this, and they sat on their hands and looked at the sky,\u201d he added.",
      "What\u2019s next",
      "The Chinese central government and pro-Beijing lawmakers, who have denied any erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong, said the veto would not create a constitutional crisis but rather showcased the checks and balances of Hong Kong\u2019s governance.",
      "But legal experts said the government still has to find a way to comply with the court order.",
      "\u201cThe legislature rushed through this decision,\u201d said Azan Marwah, a Hong Kong barrister specializing in public law and family litigation.",
      "He said lawmakers should have proposed and debated amendments to the bill if they had concerns.",
      "\u201cBut instead of doing that, they simply abdicated their responsibility,\u201d Marwah said. \u201cNow, what will the court do? To be really frank with you, I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "The Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, which proposed the failed legislation, did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The lack of legal protections for same-sex couples may lead to a \u201cbig loss\u201d of local or foreign talent in Hong Kong, as many multinational companies value diversity and equality, said Marie Pang, deputy secretary-general of the centrist political party Third Side.",
      "\u201cIt would directly undermine Hong Kong\u2019s competitiveness as an international city, especially when other regions in Asia already have relevant systems in place,\u201d Pang said.",
      "Amid the uncertainty, many people in Hong Kong\u2019s LGBTQ community are continuing to look forward.",
      "The campaign for equality and inclusion is more than legal victories, said Louis Ng, a law student and gay rights advocate.",
      "\u201cReal change requires open communication and engagement with all sides. Only then may we persuade the strong opponents,\u201d Ng said. \u201cIt all takes time and effort.\u201d"
