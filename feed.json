      "The 2025 Grammy Award nominations are here",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Welcome toBeyonc\u00e9 country. When it comes to the 2025 Grammy Award nominations, \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d rules the nation. She leads the nods with 11, bringing her career total to 99 nominations. That makes her the most nominated artist in Grammy history.",
      "\u201cCowboy Carter\u201d is up for album and country album of the year, and \u201cTexas Hold \u2019Em\u201d is nominated for record, song and country song of the year. She also received nominations in a wide swath of genres, including pop, country, Americana and melodic rap performance categories.",
      "This is her first time receiving nominations in the country and Americana categories. Previously, she and her husband Jay-Z were tied for most career nominations, at 88.",
      "If Beyonc\u00e9 wins the album of the year, she\u2019ll become the first Black woman to do so in the 21st century. Lauryn Hill last won in 1999 for \u201cThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,\u201d joining Natalie Cole and Whitney Houston as the only Black women to take home the Grammys\u2019 top prize.",
      "Post Malone also received his first ever nominations in the country categories this year, having released his debut country album \u201cF-1 Trillion\" in August. That one is up for country album and \u201cI Had Some Help,\u201d his collaboration with Morgan Wallen, is nominated for country song and country duo/group performance. They are Wallen\u2019s first ever Grammy nominations.",
      "Malone is just behind Beyonc\u00e9, with seven nominations, tied with Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Charli XCX, who earned her first nominations as a solo artist.",
      "Lamar\u2019s ubiquitous diss track released during his feud with Drake, \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d is nominated for record and song of the year, rap song, music video as well as best rap performance. He has two simultaneous entries in the latter category, a career first: Future & Metro Boomin featuring Lamar, \u201cLike That\u201d is up for best rap performance and best rap song.",
      "This is his third time receiving two simultaneous nominations for best rap song.",
      "Taylor Swift and first-time nominees Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan boast of six nominations each.",
      "Last year, women artists dominated the major categories. This year, that continues somewhat, but the main trend seems to be a variance of genre. In the album of the year category, alongside \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d is Andr\u00e9 3000\u2019s new age, alt-jazz \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d and multi-instrumentalist Jacob Collier\u2019s \u201cDjesse Vol. 4.\u201d Rising pop stars Carpenter and Roan round it out, with \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet\u201d and \u201cThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\u201d respectively, as well as Swift\u2019s \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d Eilish\u2019s \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d and Charli XCX\u2019s rave-ready \u201cBRAT.\u201d",
      "Eilish is the only artist to have her first three albums become nominated for album of the year.",
      "Last year, Swift won album of the year for \u201cMidnights,\u201d breaking the record for most wins in the category with four. This year, she becomes the first ever woman to seven career nominations in the category.",
      "\u201cThe breadth and the variety of genres represented in the general field feels new and really exciting,\u201d says the Recording Academy CEO and President Harvey Mason jr. He credits an active and evolving voting body for its success. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very intentional in how we looked at and tried to rebalance our membership. So not just gender or people of color, different racial makeup, but also genre equity and trying to make sure that all different types of music in different regions and different locations are being represented in every way possible.\u201d",
      "Only recordings commercially released in the U.S. between Sept. 16, 2023 through Aug. 30, 2024 were eligible for nominations. The final round of Grammy voting, which determines its winners, will take place Dec. 12 through January 3.",
      "In the best new artist category, Carpenter and Roan will go head-to-head, alongside Benson Boone, Doechii, Khruangbin, RAYE, Shaboozey and Teddy Swims.",
      "In the song of the year category, Beyonc\u00e9 is joined by Eilish with \u201cBirds of a Feather,\u201d Swift and Post Malone with \u201cFortnight,\u201d Roan\u2019s \u201cGood Luck, Babe!\u201d, Carpenter\u2019s \u201cPlease Please Please,\u201d Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars\u2019 \u201cDie With A Smile,\u201d and Shaboozey\u2019s \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy).\u201d",
      "Shaboozey is also a first-time nominee. His \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy)\u201d is the biggest song of the year, having spent more weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 than any other \u2014 it is so popular, a remix of the track is also up for remixed recording.",
      "Elsewhere, Shaboozey is nominated in the melodic rap performance category for his feature on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSPAGHETTII.\u201d Linda Martell, the first commercially-successful Black woman musician in country, is also featured on the song, delivering the 83-year-old artist her first Grammy nomination.",
      "For record of the year, \u201cTexas Hold \u2019Em\u201d will compete against Swift and Post Malone\u2019s \u201cFortnight,\u201d Eilish\u2019s \u201cBirds of a Father,\u201d Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d Roan\u2019s \u201cGood Luck, Babe!\u201d, Carpenter\u2019s \u201cEspresso,\u201d Charli XCX\u2019s \u201c360,\u201d and the Beatles last new song, the AI-assisted \u201cNow and Then.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure we\u2019re keeping up with how music creators and our community are using technology. And in this case, AI enhanced the record and allowed it to be eligible in the categories that it was eligible in,\u201d Mason jr explains.",
      "Dolly Parton scored her 55th career nomination in the audio book, narration, and storytelling recording category for her \u201cBehind the Seams: My Life in Rhinestones,\u201d news The Associated Press broke to the country music legend Friday morning. \u201cNo! What did I get nominated for?\u201d she cheered over the phone. \"Oh, well, that's cool. I thought it would be for my rock album, I'd take it.",
      "\u201cIt feels good. I\u2019m always appreciative of everything. I don\u2019t work for that, but it\u2019s always good to say \u2018you\u2019ve done good work,' and for somebody to acknowledge that. So, I\u2019m always proud of every award I get and every mention I get. That just makes me feel like I\u2019m doing the right thing.\u201d",
      "She's up against producer Guy Oldfield, George Clinton, Barbra Streisand and Jimmy Carter, who could become the oldest Grammy award winner in history at 100.",
      "So, what\u2019s missing? Like last year, there\u2019s a huge dearth of Latin music \u2014 the fastest growing streaming genre in the United States \u2014 across the board, and no representation in the major categories. There are also only four entries in the best M\u00fasica Mexicana album category, despite it also being one of the fastest growing genres.",
      "And K-pop, too, seems to be absent. There are no nominations for the BTS members who\u2019ve released solo material this year: RM\u2019s \u201cRight Place, Wrong Person,\u201d J-Hope\u2019s \u201cHope on the Street, Vol. 1,\u201d and Jimin\u2019s \u201cMuse.\u201d As a boy band, BTS has received five nominations across their career.",
      "\u201cI definitely see room for improvement across many genres and we are continuing to invite people to be a part of the academy,\u201d Mason jr. says. \u201cWithout the right representation we don\u2019t get the right results. When I say right, I mean reflective and representative of what\u2019s happening in music today. So, the work continues.\u201d",
      "The 2025 Grammy Awards will air Feb. 2 live on CBS and Paramount+ from the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles."

      "It looks like the 2025 Grammy Awards may be a different kind of award show",
      "NEW YORK -- It looks like the 2025 Grammy Awards may be a different kind of award show. Beyonc\u00e9 leads the nods with 11, bringing her career total to a record-breaking 99 nominations. There's an incredible diversity of genres represented across the major categories, and women continue to succeed. So... who didn\u2019t make the cut? What were the best surprises of all? Let\u2019s take a look.",
      "Country music has bled into other prominent genres and the Recording Academy has taken note. Country hybridists \u2014 like Beyonc\u00e9, Post Malone and first-time nominee Shaboozey \u2014 lead many nominations, in country and beyond.",
      "But that means the traditionalists might not see rewards: CMA Awards favorites Cody Johnson\u2019s \u201cLeather\u201d and Luke Combs\u2019 \u201cFathers & Sons\u201d didn\u2019t see any nominations. The latter shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise: Comb\u2019s blockbuster cover of Tracy Chapman\u2019s \u201cFast Car\u201d wasn\u2019t nominated for record of the year at the Grammys in 2024, either \u2013 though it did land a nod in best country solo performance.",
      "This year also marks Malone and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first-ever nominations in the country categories.",
      "Who saw this one coming? The Beatles last new song, the AI-assisted \u201cNow and Then,\" is up for record of the year. Released in 2023, the song utilized artificial intelligence to extract John Lennon\u2019s voice from an old demo. It's the same technology used to separate the Beatles\u2019 voices from background sounds during the making of director Peter Jackson\u2019s 2021 documentary series, \u201cThe Beatles: Get Back.\u201d",
      "Last summer, the Recording Academy announced a series of changes to the Grammy Awards, including new protocols involving technological advancements in machine learning. It sparked headlines: \u201cOnly human creators\u201d could win the music industry\u2019s highest honor in a decision aimed at the use of artificial intelligence in popular music. At the 2025 Grammys, clearly, those changes are in action.",
      "Last year's album of the year category was dominated by pop women \u2014 and that continues, with Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX's rave-ready approach to the genre receiving noms. The latter is a nice surprise (more on that below), but the two men nominated are creative outliers. OutKast frontman Andr\u00e9 3000's experimental jazz-flute album \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d is a contender, as well as Jacob Collier's \u201cDjesse Vol. 4,\u201d though that one may fulfill a space left vacant by Jon Batiste.",
      "Charli XCX, having never received a solo artist nomination at the Grammys, is up for seven awards at the 2025 ceremony. Those include record and album of the year, as well as pop solo and pop duo/group performance, pop dance recording, dance/electronic album and music video. Clearly, her culture-shifting \u201cBRAT\u201d album \u2014 and the summer of memes it inspired \u2014 has continued to hold real influence.",
      "There is no shortage of first-time nominees this year. Some were expected \u2014 like Roan, Carpenter and Shaboozey \u2014 others less so. Willow Smith has received her first nomination in the arrangement, instruments and vocals category for arranging her song \u201cb i g f e e l i n g s.\u201d Linda Martell, the first commercially successful Black woman musician in country, is featured alongside Shaboozey on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSPAGHETTII,\" which is up for the melodic rap performance category. That delivers the progenitor her first-ever Grammy nomination at age 83.",
      "And lastly, Morgan Wallen \u2014 undoubtedly one of the most popular musicians in the country, and one rife with controversy \u2014 has received his first two Grammy nominations for his feature on Malone's \u201cI Had Some Help.\u201d Last year, his song \u201cLast Night\u201d was nominated for best country song, but that is a songwriter\u2019s award, and Wallen did not receive a nod.",
      "In the past, the country singer has been absent from nominations. In 2021, after video surfaced of him using a racial slur, he was disqualified or limited from several award shows and received no Grammy nominations for his bestselling \u201cDangerous: The Double Album.\u201d",
      "Just like last year, Latin music is missing from the top categories at the 2025 Grammys, despite a surplus of eligible talent: Peso Pluma\u2019s \u201c\u00c9xodo,\" Shakira\u2019s \u201cLas Mujeres Ya No Lloran,\u201d Residente, \u201cLas Letras Ya No Importan,\" Car\u00edn Le\u00f3n's \u201cBoca Chueca, Vol. 1\u201d and Bad Bunny's \u201cNadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\u201d among them.",
      "Same as above: K-pop, too, seems to be absent. There are no nominations for the BTS members who\u2019ve released solo material this year: RM\u2019s \u201cRight Place, Wrong Person,\u201d J-Hope\u2019s \u201cHope on the Street, Vol. 1,\u201d and Jimin\u2019s \u201cMuse.\u201d As a boy band, BTS has received five nominations across its career.",
      "Despite being one of the great global superstars of the current moment \u2014 regularly celebrated as one of the most streamed artists on the planet \u2014 Bad Bunny's \u201cNadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\u201d received only one nomination, for m\u00fasica urbana album.",
      "And Usher, who had a blockbuster year \u2014 including a star-studded Super Bowl halftime show \u2014 also received only one nomination, for R&B album.",
      "In pop, Dua Lipa's \u201cEternal Optimism\" is nowhere to be seen. In country, best new artist hopeful Megan Moroney received no nominations. In R&B, Normani's long-awaited debut album, \u201cDopamine,\u201d failed to make waves with voters, and in rap, Nicki Minaj's \u201cPink Friday 2\u201d and Megan Thee Stallion's \u201cMegan\u201d are absent.",
      "Last year, Jack Antonoff took home producer of the year, non-classical for a third year in a row, tying Babyface as the only other producer to do so consecutively. This year, he didn't receive a nod in that category \u2014 one he has held a place in since 2019. Who will take the mantle?",

      "A father and daughter disabled by a suicide bomber who killed 22 people after an Ariana Grande concert in England in 2017 have been awarded $58,000 against a former television producer who claimed the tragedy was a hoax",
      "LONDON -- A father and daughter crippled by a suicide bomber who killed 22 people after an Ariana Grande concert in England in 2017 were awarded 45,000 pounds ($58,000) Friday in a case against a former television producer who claimed the tragedy was a hoax.",
      "Martin Hibbert and his daughter, Eve, won their harassment suit in the High Court in London last month against Richard Hall for videos, a film and a book he produced that falsely claim the Manchester Arena bombing was staged using actors and no one was wounded or killed.",
      "Hall, an independent producer, had claimed \u201cmillions of people have bought a lie\u201d about the attack and defended his work, including surreptitiously filming the daughter, as journalism in the public's interest.",
      "Justice Karen Steyn called Hall\u2019s conduct a \u201cnegligent, indeed reckless, abuse of media freedom.\" She said he used the \u201cflimsiest of analytical techniques\u201d to dismiss \"the obvious, tragic reality to which so many ordinary people have attested.\u201d",
      "Salman Abedi blew himself up with a bomb hidden in a knapsack as fans were leaving the Grande concert on May 22, 2017. In addition to those killed, more than 260 people were wounded and hundreds of others were left with \u201cdeep psychological injuries,\u201d police said.",
      "Martin Hibbert was paralyzed from the waist down and his daughter, who was 14 at the time, nearly died and has severe brain damage.",
      "The Hibbert's also won an injunction preventing Hall from further harassment, and Hall will have to pay 90% of their legal costs that are currently estimated at 260,000 pounds ($335,000).",
      "The award, however, is meager compared to many won in U.S. lawsuits. In a case that also involved denying a major tragedy, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was ordered to pay $1.5 billion to parents of children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012 for falsely claiming it was a hoax.",
      "Martin Hibbert said that he never expects to see a penny of the award, but the victory wasn't about money.",
      "\u201cWhat this was about was bringing him down in public, in front of his own followers, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done,\" he said outside court.",
      "Hall said the trial was unfair and continued to insist the bombing didn't happen as he left the court."

    "summary": "Megan Park is just getting started as a filmmaker",
    "story": [
      "Megan Park is just getting started as a filmmaker",
      "Megan Park feels a little bad that her movie is making so many people cry. It's not just a single tear either \u2014 more like full body sobs.",
      "She didn\u2019t set out to make a tearjerker with \u201cMy Old Ass,\u201d now streaming on Prime Video. She just wanted to tell a story about a young woman in conversation with her older self. The film is quite funny (the dialogue between 18-year-old and almost 40-year-old Elliott happens because of a mushroom trip that includes a Justin Bieber cover), but it packs an emotional punch, too.",
      "Writing, Park said, is often her way of working through things. When she put pen to paper on \u201cMy Old Ass,\u201d she was a new mom and staying in her childhood bedroom during the pandemic. One night, she and her whole nuclear family slept under the same roof. She didn\u2019t know it then, but it would be the last time, and she started wondering what it would be like to have known that.",
      "In the film, older Elliott ( Aubrey Plaza ) advises younger Elliott ( Maisy Stella ) to not be so eager to leave her provincial town, her younger brothers and her parents and to slow down and appreciate things as they are. She also tells her to stay away from a guy named Chad who she meets the next day and discovers that, unfortunately, he's quite cute.",
      "At 38, Park is just getting started as a filmmaker. Her first, \u201cThe Fallout,\u201d in which Jenna Ortega plays a teen in the aftermath of a school shooting, had one of those pandemic releases that didn\u2019t even feel real. But it did get the attention of Margot Robbie \u2019s production company LuckyChap Entertainment, who reached out to Park to see what other ideas she had brewing.",
      "\u201cThey were very instrumental in encouraging me to go with it,\u201d Park said. \u201cThey\u2019re just really even-keeled, good people, which makes them great producers. They treat everybody the same, which is the vibe that I like. There\u2019s no ego, there\u2019s no hierarchy.\u201d",
      "LuckyChap even empowered her to cast Stella first and to build it out around her. In a more traditional setting, she said, you have to start with the most famous person.",
      "Park came to writing and directing after some 20 years of acting. The product of a small town in Canada (Lindsay, Ontario), she knew she loved the arts but had no connections to the industry. The only job she could imagine for herself was actor, she said. Luckily, she had some success at it, with roles in films (\"Charlie Bartlett\u201d) and television shows like \u201cLife with Derek\u201d and \u201cThe Secret Life of the American Teenager\u201d (she was Grace, the conservative cheerleader). It was on that show that she met one of her dearest friends, Shailene Woodley, and started to realize that perhaps acting wasn\u2019t quite her passion.",
      "There wasn\u2019t one \u201cah-ha\u201d moment, but she does remember seeing how passionate Woodley was about getting the role \u201cThe Descendants,\u201d which would prove to be her breakout.",
      "\u201cShe really wanted that role and she knew that it was her role and she was just like fighting for it and working so hard and was so passionate. I remember thinking that\u2019s so inspiring and so cool that she feels that way about this. And then I was like, \u2018(expletive), I don\u2019t feel that way about acting.\u2019\"",
      "Instead, Park found that spark in writing, and eventually directing, starting with shorts and music videos for the likes of Billie Eilish, Gucci Mane and even her husband, singer-songwriter Tyler Hilton, before setting off to do a feature.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really know that writing and directing movies was a viable career. So I came about it a little bit backwards,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel so lucky that I had such an education of like 20 years on a film set before I was ever behind the camera, where I was really absorbing way more than I thought I was absorbing.\u201d",
      "As a filmmaker, Park said she has two aesthetic extremes inside of her. The first is \u201cheartfelt, evergreen, nostalgic movies.\u201d Think Chris Columbus, \u201cStepmom,\u201d \u201cMrs. Doubtfire\u201d and \u201cMy Girl,\u201d she said. Her other passion is quiet, French, female-driven cinema. C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s \u201cTomboy\u201d is the only movie she has downloaded on her computer. On set, she likes to keep things calm, reminding those around her that they\u2019re not \u201csaving lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cI genuinely think that\u2019s an important mentality to have because people get so caught up in it. There\u2019s always going to be a fire, there\u2019s always going to be not enough time, but there\u2019s always going to be a fix to the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to just be clear with what I need, but also really flexible. I think the best directors are people who consider their role as not as the end-all, be-all genius behind the magic because you\u2019re not. You\u2019re the curator of creating an environment for creativity to thrive.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s seen all the extremes as an actor: The energies that work, the ones that don\u2019t and how all actors need different things from the director. And her actors appreciate that about her.",
      "\u201cI want every single movie for the rest of my life to be directed by a woman,\u201d said Stella. \u201cIt was one of my favorite experiences. I was just constantly surrounded by female energy, which was very inspiring for me and very safe. It just felt very cozy and sweet and it was very easy to work in that environment.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s been almost a year now since \u201cMy Old Ass\u201d became one of the breakout films of the Sundance Film Festival, and almost three years since she started working on it, or, basically half of her nearly 5-year-old daughter\u2019s life (she calls it \u201cthe Maisie movie\u201d). With a new 4-month-old as well, she's just started work on another film. But she\u2019s still feeling the glow from \u201cMy Old Ass\u201d and the effect it\u2019s having on audiences.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t really get your hopes that high that people are going to feel anything, let alone how deeply they seem to be feeling the movie,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of surreal, honestly and really beautiful and hard to metabolize it all.\u201d"

      "The work of African American artists explored cultural beliefs about the afterlife held by Lebou, one of Senegal's ethnic groups. The Lebou believe that in the afterlife, spirits dwell eternally in the ocean.",
      "There was also an entire new alphabet depicted on the curly hair pattern of African hair, as well as an immersive exhibit attempting to let viewers experience what it might have felt like to be a slave and be thrown into the water.",
      "The wake of slavery impacted all Americans, said Diana Baird N\u2019Diaye, the show's curator. She is based between the U.S. and Senegal. The displayed art does not only relate to the past, but also looks towards the future, she added.",
      "\u201cWe are here because they (our ancestors) survived slavery in America,\" she said. \u201cWe are here because our ancestors, our grandparents survived Jim Crow.\u201d",
      "\"And now we are at another crucial moment,\u201d Baird N\u2019Diaye said.",
      "The Dak'Art comes as several countries in the region are stepping away from traditional Western allies and turning towards new partners, such as Russia and China, with a less complicated history in the region.",
      "In a region rocked in recent years by coups and extremist violence, Senegal has managed to maintain its reputation as a stable democracy. Still, Senegal's ruling party, which is facing an election next week, has pledged to review its relationship with Western countries, but so far has not made any radical decisions.",
      "Khady Di\u00e8ne Gaye, Senegal's minister of youth, sports and culture, told reporters that the U.S. role as the guest of honor is \u201ca display of the importance of art as a tool for dialogue between peoples, the promotion of peace, mutual understanding, but most importantly as a tool for economic and social development.\u201d",
      "The Dak\u2019Art runs until Dec. 7. Originally scheduled for May, it was postponed following political tensions around the April presidential election and funding issues that the new authorities blamed on the former administration."

      "Argentine prosecutors say that three people have been charged in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction, who died after falling from the balcony of his hotel room in Buenos Aires last month",
      "BUENOS AIRES -- Three people have been charged in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction who died after falling from the balcony of his hotel room in Buenos Aires last month, Argentine prosecutors said Thursday.",
      "Prosecutor Andr\u00e9s Madrea charged the three suspects, whose identities were not revealed, with \u200b\u200bthe crimes of \u201cabandonment of a person followed by death\u201d and \u201csupplying and facilitating the use of narcotics,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s office said. Madrea also requested their arrest to judge Laura Bruniard, who ruled the three cannot leave the country.",
      "Payne fell from his room's balcony on the third floor of his hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Palermo, in the Argentine capital. His autopsy said he died from multiple injuries and external bleeding.",
      "Prosecutors also said that Payne\u2019s toxicological exams showed that his body had \"traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant\u201d in the moments before his death.",
      "Investigators said hours after Payne\u2019s death that he was by himself when he fell. But the prosecutors' office said Thursday that one of the people charged was often with the singer during his time in Buenos Aires. The second is a hotel staffer who allegedly gave Payne cocaine during his stay between Oct. 13 and 16. And the third is a drug dealer.",
      "The charges in Payne\u2019s case bear some resemblance to the U.S. cases stemming from the death of \u201cFriends\u201d star Matthew Perry a year ago. The actor\u2019s personal assistant and a longtime friend are among those charged with helping supply him with ketamine in the final months of his life, leading up to his overdose on the anesthetic.",
      "Three young men were similarly charged in the opioid-overdose death of rapper Mac Miller in 2018.",
      "Local authorities gathered, among other pieces of evidence, Payne's cell phone records, material for forensics and testimonies. They are yet to unlock the singer\u2019s personal computer \u2013 which is damaged \u2013 and other devices that were seized.",
      "Payne\u2019s autopsy showed his injuries were neither caused by self-harm nor by physical intervention of others. The document also said that he did not have the reflex of protecting himself in the fall, which suggests he might have been unconscious.",
      "Prosecutors in Argentina also ruled out the chances of Payne committing suicide.",
      "One Direction was among the most successful boy bands of recent times. It announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016 and Payne \u2014 like his former bandmates Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, and Louis Tomlinson \u2014 pursued a solo career.",
      "The singer had posted on his Snapchat account that he traveled to Argentina to attend Horan\u2019s concert in Buenos Aires on Oct. 2. He shared videos of himself dancing with his girlfriend, American influencer Kate Cassidy, and singing along in the stands. Cassidy had left Argentina after the show, but Payne stayed behind.",

      "NEW YORK -- Minneapolis musician Tyka Nelson, Prince's only full sibling, died Monday at North Memorial Health in Robbinsdale, Minnesota, her son President Nelson confirmed to The Associated Press. She was 64.",
      "A cause of death was not immediately available, and President Nelson said he doesn't expect to know \u201cfor a couple of days.\u201d",
      "Born to jazz musician John L. Nelson and Mattie Della Shaw in 1960, two years after Prince, Nelson was a singer-songwriter, releasing four albums across her career, starting with 1988's \u201cRoyal Blue.\" That album produced her biggest hits, \u201cMarc Anthony\u2019s Tune,\u201d which spent 11 weeks on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, peaking at No. 33, and \u201cL.O.V.E.,\" which spent seven weeks on the chart and topped at No. 52.",
      "At the time, she told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis, \u201cThe album is basically about love relationships between a man and a woman. I\u2019m royal blue because I can\u2019t find him,\u201d she said.",
      "It's an alternative to her brother's chosen color of purple. Of their relationship, she said: \u201cThe funniest thing is people say, \u2018How does it feel to be Prince\u2019s sister?\u2019 They don\u2019t actually realize what they\u2019re saying. I\u2019ve been Prince\u2019s sister ever since I got here on Earth.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press described her \u201cRoyal Blue\u201d album as \"mostly adult-contemporary or easy-listening\" material, \u201cfar removed from Prince and the so-called Minneapolis sound. Hers is a mature, romantic sound aimed at 25- to 45-year-olds.\u201d",
      "Then came 1992's \u201cYellow Moon, Red Sky,\u201d 2008's \u201cA Brand New Me,\u201d and finally, 2011's \u201cHustler.\u201d",
      "Nelson is survived by two sons, President and Sir, and five grandchildren.",
      "\u201cBorn 1960, the daughter of Mattie and John Nelson, she was best known as Prince\u2019s sister and worked to keep his legacy alive with his fans attending fan and industry events,\u201d President Nelson shared in a statement. \u201cServices will be private, and in lieu of flowers, the family has asked that you take care of one another.\u201d",
      "According to the Star Tribune, Nelson was scheduled to retire and perform a farewell concert at the Dakota in downtown Minneapolis in June. Illness caused her not to take the stage. A few days before the concert, she said she had a mixtape on the way and was working on a memoir.",
      "Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose in 2016 at his home in Minneapolis. He was 57. He had no will, and his six siblings inherited equal interests in the estate: Tyka Nelson and five half-siblings \u2014 Sharon Nelson, Norrine Nelson, John R. Nelson, Omarr Baker and Alfred Jackson.",
      "Tyka Nelson, Baker and Jackson, the three youngest, sold their stake to a music publishing company called Primary Wave Music, LLC, which later assigned its interests to an affiliate, Prince OAT Holdings LLC. Jackson has since died.",

      "For all the concerns about a tumultuous process that could leave Americans waiting for days to learn who its next president would be, news outlets instead experienced an election night that hewed close to tradition.",
      "Fox News Channel declared Donald Trump had reclaimed the presidency at 1:47 a.m. on Wednesday. Broadcast networks and The Associated Press had Trump on the precipice of returning to the presidency when he took the stage in Florida at 2:25 a.m. to declare victory. \u201cThis is, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time,\u201d Trump said onstage at his victory party in West Palm Beach.",
      "His opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, would speak later Wednesday morning, her campaign manager said, dispersing a crowd that had gathered to celebrate her at Howard University.",
      "Broadcast, cable news networks, digital news sites and one streaming service \u2014 Amazon \u2014 covered the count steadily into Wednesday morning. Many of their journalists had warned viewers that determining the winner could be a protracted process that could take several days, like it had in 2020.",
      "Yet from the first hints provided by exit poll results shortly after 5 p.m. Eastern time, the election night story moved methodically in Trump's direction. The dam broke at 11:18 p.m. on Tuesday, when the AP called the first of seven battleground states, North Carolina, for the former president.",
      "The networks moved quickly into the post-mortem stage.",
      "\u201cThis looks a lot more like 2016 to me than 2020,\u201d NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd said, a reference to Trump\u2019s victory that year over Democrat Hillary Clinton.",
      "Fox News Channel pointed to exit poll results that showed Trump making gains among young voters and Latinos. \u201cThe Biden-Harris people pushed them into Trump\u2019s open arms,\u201d said Fox\u2019s Dana Perino, a former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush.",
      "\u201cMaybe,\u201d Fox News' Brit Hume said, \u201cit's time for his enemies to stop it.\u201d",
      "In his speech, Trump praised his running mate, JD Vance, for \u201cgoing into the enemy camp\u201d for interviews on places like CNN and MSNBC. \u201cHe absolutely obliterated them,\u201d he said.",
      "Hours earlier, when the first exit poll results showed the unpopularity of President Joe Biden and Americans with a dim view of where the country was headed, CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace said that \u201cit would be a miracle if Harris could win with that.\u201d His colleagues, Dana Bash and Audie Cornish, warned him of jumping to conclusions that Harris would be blamed for that, but Wallace sounded more prescient as the night progressed.",
      "\u201cShe was trying to do something as a sitting vice president that had never been done before \u2014 succeed an unpopular president,\u201d Todd said.",
      "Former Sen. Claire McCaskill, an NBC News analyst, said the element of race could not be discounted. Some Americans were more comfortable with President Joe Biden, a white man, than Harris, who was attempting to be the first woman of color to be elected president, she said.",
      "\u201cCan you imagine a woman of color acting the way Donald Trump acted \u2014 even for one day?\u201d CNN analyst Van Jones said. \u201cThe kinds of stuff that he said, the kinds of stuff that he did, the way that he would insult people. If you're a person of color, you don't feel like you have the freedom.\u201d",
      "Trump had \u201ca license to just be a fool, just to be an obnoxious ass ... and he gets to be president,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Due to remarkably close pre-election polls, the outcome was considered a mystery that could take many days to resolve. In his last pre-election prediction, statistician Nate Silver said it was no better than a coin flip, giving an ever-so-slight edge to Harris.",
      "The New York Times' predictive Needle judged the contest a \u201ctoss-up\u201d in the beginning of the evening, leaning slightly toward Trump. But it moved steadily in Trump's direction, to the point where the Times by midnight judged Trump with a 90 percent likelihood of capturing the presidency again.",
      "Also by midnight, CNN's count had Trump leading Harris in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 the so-called blue wall that was central to her strategy for victory.",
      "\u201cIt's not mission impossible\u201d for Harris to come back and win Pennsylvania, CNN's John King said, looking over voter statistics. \u201cBut it's becoming mission improbable.\u201d Within two hours, CNN awarded Pennsylvania to Trump.",
      "For much of the night, the journalists who stood before \u201cmagic boards\u201d \u2014 King, Bill Hemmer on Fox News Channel, Steve Kornacki on MSNBC \u2014 took up much of the airtime with granular reports on results. State-by-state, county-by-county, they showed numbers where Trump was outperforming his 2020 campaign and Harris lagged behind Biden\u2019s results.",
      "If anything, the networks relied too much on their numbers czars than on their reporters.",
      "The presence of actual results were a tonic to news organizations that had weeks \u2014 and an excruciatingly long day of voting \u2014 to talk about an election campaign that polls have repeatedly shown to be remarkably tight. They tried to extract wisdom from anecdotal evidence.",
      "\u201cDixville Notch is a metaphor for the entire race,\u201d CNN\u2019s Alyssa Farah Griffin said, making efforts to draw meaning from the tiny New Hampshire community that reported its 3-3 vote for Harris and Trump in the early morning hours.",
      "Former NBC News anchor Brian Williams, during his one-night leading Amazon's streamcast appearance, had one unexpected guest in the California studio where he was operating. Puck reporter Tara Palmeri was supposed to report from Trump headquarters in West Palm Beach but was denied credentials to attend by the former president's team.",
      "Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita described her as a \u201cgossip columnist\u201d in a post on the social media site X. Palmeri told Williams she had accurately reported some anxiety within the Trump camp about who was voting early.",

One suggested that Harris, who is vying to become the first woman, Black woman and person of South Asian descent to be elected president, began her career as a prostitute.",
      "The speakers, Kelly said, \u201ctook what was an amazing celebration of Trump, exciting and well-attended and hugely enthusiastic, and gave themselves a big black eye.\u201d"

      "The cavernous walls of the neoclassical gem on Paris' Left Bank are coming alive with 360-degree video projections, sparkling cutting-edge technology and actors, all telling the story of the church and its place in French history.",
      "Blending centuries of intrigue, revolution and family drama, the show reimagines the Saint-Germain district during the Fronde, the 17th-century civil war, and the lead-up to the French Revolution.",
      "\u201cParis C\u0153ur de Lumi\u00e8res\u201d (Paris Chancel of Lights), which runs until Nov. 23, transforms the church\u2019s sprawling 6,000-square-meter (65,000-square-foot) interior into a digital stage through advanced video mapping.",
      "\u201cFrom a technological standpoint, it\u2019s a laser scan of the entire building that allows us to reconstruct the space in three dimensions,\u201d director Damien Fontaine explained.",
      "\u201cWe then \u2018unfold\u2019 it like origami ... and put it back into 3D to be projected as a single unified image. We have over 45 projectors, each covering a part of the vaults, a section of a pillar, or a piece of the nave. It\u2019s ... a mosaic of images to form one large picture.\u201d",
      "Projections transform stone carvings into animated storytellers, while immersive soundscapes, paired with an original score, wrap the audience in a sensory experience.",
      "The actors brought history to life. Over 350 performers and volunteers, clad in more than 500 historical costumes, move among the audience portraying local families and rivalries, threading personal narratives into the broader history.",
      "Many of those who volunteered themselves marveled at learning about little known aspects of French history.",

      "Performing in Saint-Sulpice, she added, was extraordinary: \u201cIt\u2019s exceptional. You lose track of what\u2019s happening, of where fiction ends and history begins.\u201d",
      "Her historic costume shaped her performance \u2014 literally.",

The costume really impacts how you carry your body, and that posture influences your mind, giving character to this woman of state.\u201d",
      "The production underscored a growing trend in Paris of using light technology to show off the city's storied church interiors. A similar illuminations display took place at Saint-Eustache church until September, featuring video projections, lighting effects and spatialized electronic soundtrack.",

      "Pop superstar Taylor Swift returned to Arrowhead Stadium to see the Kansas City Chiefs and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Pop superstar Taylor Swift returned to Arrowhead Stadium on Monday night to see the Kansas City Chiefs and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after wrapping up the U.S. leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.",
      "It wound up being a good night for both of them.",
      "Swift was able to celebrate Kelce's big night, which included 14 catches for 100 yards in a driving rain, along with a victory for the Chiefs. They trailed by a touchdown in the fourth quarter, scored twice to take the lead, then headed to overtime, where they won the coin toss and drove for a touchdown that gave them a 30-24 win.",
      "Kelce, who had fumbled earlier in the game, had two of his catches on the decisive drive in overtime. His total receptions was a career-best for a regular-season game, matching a 14-catch performance in a 2023 playoff win over Jacksonville, while his 16 targets from Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was just one shy of his career high.",
      "\u201cHe does a great job of finding space,\u201d Mahomes said, \u201cand I think with having DeAndre (Hopkins) out there, it takes pressure off where not all the attention is on him the entire time. And whenever he gets going, man, he's hard to stop.\u201d",
      "Swift is finally getting a chance to stop herself after playing the last of three shows at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Sunday to conclude the U.S. portion of her tour. The rest of her tour heads to Canada with the first of six shows at Rogers Centre in Toronto on Nov. 14 and three shows in December at BC Place in Vancouver, British Columbia.",
      "Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. Since then, the two have spent plenty of time together, often with cameras following every move.",
      "Swift's arrival in a black outfit and Chiefs coat Monday night came on the eve of the presidential election, in which the 14-time Grammy winner has thrown her support behind Vice President Kamala Harris. That generated a stir when Harris' rival, Donald Trump, began to reference Swift's friend and Mahomes' wife, Brittany, as a supporter of his campaign.",
      "Patrick Mahomes has declined to endorse anyone in the election, instead urging people to register to vote.",

      "An heirloom piano takes on immense significance for one family in 1936 Pittsburgh in August Wilson\u2019s \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d",
      "An heirloom piano takes on immense significance for one family in 1936 Pittsburgh in August Wilson\u2019s \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d Generational ties also permeate the film adaptation, in which Malcolm Washington follows in his father Denzel Washington\u2019s footsteps in helping to bring the entirety of The Pittsburgh Cycle \u2014 a series of 10 plays \u2014 to the screen.",
      "Malcolm Washington did not start from scratch in his accomplished feature filmmaking debut. He enlisted much of the cast from the recent Broadway revival with Samuel L. Jackson (Doaker Charles), his brother, John David Washington (Boy Willie), Ray Fisher (Lymon) and Michael Potts (Whining Boy). Berniece, played by Danielle Brooks in the play, is now beautifully portrayed by Danielle Deadwyler. With such rich material and a cast for whom it\u2019s second nature, it would be hard, one imagines, to go wrong. Jackson\u2019s own history with the play goes back to its original run in 1987 when he was Boy Willie.",
      "It\u2019s not the simplest thing to make a play feel cinematic, but Malcolm Washington was up to the task. His film opens up the world of the Charles family beyond the living room. In fact, this adaptation, which Washington co-wrote with \u201cMudbound\u201d screenwriter Virgil Williams, goes beyond Wilson\u2019s text and shows us the past and the origins of the intricately engraved piano that\u2019s central to all the fuss. It even opens on a big, action-filled set piece in 1911, during which the piano is stolen from a white family\u2019s home. Another fleshes out Doaker's monologue in which he explains to the uninitiated, Fisher\u2019s Lymon, and the audience, the tortured history of the thing. While it might have been nice to keep the camera on Jackson, such a great, grounding presence throughout, the good news is that he really makes narration shine as well.",
      "Wilson purists will certainly have opinions on these artistic choices; But they let the film breathe a bit, offering some respite from the living room with the looming piano. And most of the film stays right there, in 1936. Boy Willie and Lymon descend early one morning, uninvited, on the Pittsburgh home of Berniece and her uncle Doaker. It\u2019s a family reunion with an agenda: They\u2019ve driven a truck full of watermelons up north from Mississippi, and Willie, Berniece\u2019s younger brother, wants to sell the watermelons and then the piano. The dusty old instrument represents to him a chance to let the past go and start a future. With the money, he wants to buy the land that his enslaved ancestors worked. Berniece has other ideas about the piano, namely keeping it. It\u2019s a connection to the past, not an anchor. Besides, it might be haunted.",
      "Yes, \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d in theaters Friday and streaming on Netflix on Nov. 22, isn\u2019t just a meditation on family history. It\u2019s also a literal ghost story, with creaks, spooks and shadows lurking when the piano is disturbed. Deadwyler is electric as Berniece, who bears the brunt of the haunting, walking on eggshells in her life, trying to care for her young daughter and fend off passes from men who assume she can only be fulfilled with one at her side. Now she must deal with her somewhat manic brother who might, Doaker wisely reminds, actually, annoyingly, have a point. Perhaps the film academy will make up for their snub of her performance in \u201cTill\u201d with this turn.",
      "Regardless of your familiarity with Wilson's Pittsburgh Cycle, \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d is a worthwhile, captivating and moving watch full of charismatic performers. Talent isn\u2019t always genetic, but the Washington family is putting in the work to prove otherwise. And with \u201cFences,\u201d\u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d and now \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d they\u2019re making a mark with a bold and ambitious project that is probably long overdue. Only seven more to go.",
      "\u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d a Netflix release in theaters Friday and streaming Nov. 22, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cstrong language, violent content, some suggestive references and smoking.\u201d Running time: 125 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "The deal with federal prosecutors was described in a letter partially endorsed by a Manhattan federal judge. It calls for the entertainer to be sentenced to a month in jail, followed by a month of home incarceration, a month of home detention and a month of curfew. He would also be subject to electronic monitoring.",
      "Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said he will sentence the performer whose real name is Daniel Hernandez immediately after he admits to the violations at a Nov. 12 hearing. He said he will require each side to explain why a one-month jail sentence followed by three months of home incarceration, detention or curfew are sufficient for repeated violations of probation.",

      "Tekashi 6ix9ine, 28, was within a few months of being free from court supervision when he was arrested on Oct. 29 after his probation officer complained that he wasn't following rules about obtaining permission in advance to travel and that he had failed drug tests.",
      "In 2019, Engelmayer sentenced him to two years in prison in a racketeering case after the musician pleaded guilty that same year to charges accusing him of joining and directing violence by the gang known as the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods.",
      "In April 2020, Tekashi 6ix9ine was freed months early from his prison sentence after complaining that his ailments made him particularly susceptible to the coronavirus, which was spreading through the nation's jails and prisons.",

      "Peter Ames Carlin writes a cultural history of the rock bank in \u201cThe Name of This Band is R",
      "The best way to read \u201cThe Name of This Band is R.E.M.\u201d is with a pair of headphones and a collection of the band's albums on streaming services or CDs. Opt for the cassettes or vinyl if you want to go old school.",
      "Peter Ames Carlin's book isn't just a cultural biography of the band going back to its formation in the-then sleepy college town of Athens, Georgia. It's also a poetic meditation on what made so many of the band's songs stand out, and continue to shine.",
      "\u201cIt was a new kind of post-punk, alternative music that straddled obscurity and directness, dissent and delicacy, unapologetic and unashamed pure pop,\u201d he writes about the reaction to the band's music in the early 1980s.",
      "Carlin's book offers plenty of behind the scenes details and trivia about R.E.M.'s rise. Fans will enjoy reading about how record executives were wary of making \u201cLosing My Religion,\u201d the band's iconic hit, the first single from its album \u201cOut of Time.\u201d",
      "It's also a fascinating history of a different era in music before social media created viral stars, when bands like R.E.M. rose up through college radio. The early sections of the book offer a vivid description of the music scene in Athens and the band's beginning.",
      "The book also explores the band's political activism, including their work on environmental causes and promotion of the Rock the Vote campaign.",
      "The band members didn't agree to interviews for Carlin's book, and that's one of the few weaknesses of what is an otherwise well-researched history. Anyone hoping to discover major new revelations about the band and its members will likely be disappointed, but Carlin ably demonstrates the impact R.E.M.'s music has had and why its history is worth revisiting.",

      "Health officials say it's important to get vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when respiratory bugs tend to spread with travel and indoor celebrations.",
      "Those viruses haven't caused much trouble so far this fall. But COVID-19 tends to jump in the winter months, a rise that usually starts around Thanksgiving and peaks in January.",
      "And that coincides with flu season, which tends to start in November or December and peak in January or February.",
      "It takes the body about two weeks to build up immunity after either shot \u2014 meaning vaccination is needed before these viruses start spreading. A lot of older adults also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV.",
      "Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters \u2014 they're not just another dose of last year\u2019s protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body\u2019s immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains.",
      "While they\u2019re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 \u2014 or dying from it.",
      "\u201cIt may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to be less severe,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cI would rather have my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to the emergency room on Thanksgiving.\u201d",
      "Last year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got a COVID-19 shot.",
      "\u201cOur best defense to protect ourselves, our loved ones and all those around us is a simple shot,\u201d Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a recent statement.",
      "While it may have faded from the headlines, the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last year.",
      "\u201cMaybe we believe that it\u2019s not going to be me but let\u2019s not take a chance,\u201d said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. \u201cWhy not get a vaccine that\u2019s going to help you reduce that risk?\u201d",
      "The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge.",
      "Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year.",
      "Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu \u2013 and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too.",
      "In addition, the CDC is recommending that people 65 and older get a second COVID-19 shot six months after their fall dose to boost their year-round protection, since the coronavirus isn't just a winter threat. People with weakened immune systems are eligible for extra doses, too.",
      "Last fall\u2019s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that\u2019s no longer spreading while this year\u2019s are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older.",
      "High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot.",
      "For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics \u2014 although next year it's set to be available for use at home.",
      "All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems.",
      "The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination \u2013 but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter.",
      "And while \u201cyour arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,\u201d it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said.",
      "The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.",

      "TIRANA, Albania -- A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste was allowed to dock on Friday at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection on the orders of the prosecutor, officials said.",
      "Albania had prevented the Turkish-flagged Moliva XA443A from docking early last week at the port of Durres, 33 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital, Tirana, after a watchdog alerted authorities that it was carrying hazardous waste.",
      "Instead, the ship was kept at an anchorage place away from the port.",
      "The prosecutors then ordered the containers to be seized and stored \u201cat an environmentally\" safe place. Once unloaded, the containers are expected to be sent to an agency in Porto Romano, 6 kilometers (4 miles) away, for inspection.",
      "The prosecutor\u2019s office has asked different institutions to conduct lab tests of the cargo.",
      "The Seattle-based non-government organization Basel Action Network, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, flagged the ship to authorities in August after receiving information from a whistleblower that the containers on board are suspected to be carrying an estimated 2,100 tons of toxic dust from pollution control filters from the steel industry.",
      "The dust is suspected to have originated at an Albanian company and that it was also illegally smuggled to Albania from neighboring Kosovo and Germany.",
      "BAN said the containers left Durres on July 4 on two Maersk-chartered ships with the intended destination of Thailand. The group said it alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment.",
      "Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the containers were loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said.",
      "The customs documentation stated the containers contained iron oxide, according to local reports.",
      "\u201cThe case is under investigation from the Durres prosecutor's office and the Ministry of Tourism and Environment is cooperating for anything that the justice institution asks for,\u201d ministry spokesperson Erjon Uka told The Associated Press on Friday.",

      "Federal health officials are calling for more testing and treatment of workers on farms with bird flu",
      "Federal health officials on Thursday called for more testing of employees on farms with bird flu after a new study showed that some dairy workers had signs of infection, even when they didn't report feeling sick.",
      "Farmworkers in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered treatment even if they show no symptoms, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The new guidance comes after blood tests for 115 farmworkers in Michigan and Colorado showed that eight workers \u2014 or 7% \u2014 had antibodies that indicated previous infection with the virus known as Type A H5N1 influenza.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of these actions is to keep workers safe, to limit the transmission of H5 to humans and to reduce the possibility of the virus changing,\u201d Shah told reporters.",
      "The CDC study provides the largest window to date into how the bird virus first detected in March in dairy cows may be spreading to people. It suggests that the virus has infected more humans than the 46 farmworkers identified in the U.S. as of Thursday. Nearly all were in contact with infected dairy cows or infected poultry.",
      "Outside experts said it\u2019s notable that the study prompted the CDC to take new action. Previous recommendations called for testing and treating workers only when they had symptoms.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant move towards the assessment that these H5N1 viruses are a greater risk than the CDC estimated before,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "Every additional infection in animals or humans gives the virus the chance to change in potentially dangerous ways, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt shows yet again that we are not responding effectively to the H5N1 cattle outbreak in humans or animals and if we continue to let this virus spread and jump from species to species, our luck will eventually run out,\u201d Rasmussen said in an email.",
      "The CDC study included 45 workers in Michigan and 70 in Colorado tested between June and August. Of the eight workers with positive blood tests, four reported no symptoms. All eight cleaned milking parlors and none used respiratory protection such as face masks. Three said they used eye protection.",
      "High levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows, increasing the risk of exposure and infection, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said that efforts to monitor dairy workers for illness have been hindered by several barriers including the reluctance of farm owners and farmworkers to allow testing.",
      "Rasmussen and others have criticized the federal response to the outbreak as too slow and \u201clackluster.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese studies should have been performed months ago and should have been prioritized,\u201d she said.",
      "The virus has been confirmed in at least 446 cattle herds in 15 states. Last week, the Agriculture Department said a pig at an Oregon farm was confirmed to have bird flu, the first time the virus was detected in U.S. swine.",

      "Trent Russell, 34, of Bellevue, Nebraska, who worked at the time as a transplant coordinator for the Washington Regional Transplant Community and had access to hospital records all over the region, was convicted earlier this year of illegally accessing health care records and destroying or altering records at a jury trial.",
      "He was also charged with publishing that information on the internet in 2019, at a time when public speculation about Ginsburg's health and her ability to serve as a justice was a matter of public debate. Prosecutors said he posted the information along with a false claim that Ginsburg had already died. But the jury acquitted Russell on that count.",
      "Ginsburg served on the court until her death in 2020.",
      "Prosecutors said Russell disclosed the health records on forums that trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories, including conspiracy theories that Ginsburg was dead, but Russell's motivations for his actions were unclear. Indeed, Russell himself never admitted that he accessed the records, at one point suggesting that perhaps his cat walked across the keyboard in a way that mistakenly called up Ginsburg's data.",
      "Russell's excuses and refusal to accept responsibility prompted blistering critiques from prosecutors, who sought a 30-month sentence.",
      "\u201cHe offered completely implausible excuses with a straight face,\u201d prosecutor Zoe Bedell said.",
      "Russell's lawyer, Charles Burnham, sought a sentence of probation or home detention. He cited Russell's work saving lives as a transplant coordinator and his military record which included a deployment to Afghanistan as mitigating factors.",
      "\u201cMr. Russell has lived a quietly heroic life,\u201d Burnham wrote in court papers. He chalked up the criminal conduct to \u201cbeing stupid.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff's 24-month sentence , calling his crime \u201ctruly despicable conduct.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou chose to blame your cat,\u201d Nachmanoff said.",
      "The court records in the case are carefully redacted to remove any reference to Ginsburg, but during the trial and at Thursday's sentencing hearing, all sides openly acknowledged that Ginsburg was the victim of the privacy breach.",
      "Her status as a public figure, in fact, prompted a debate about the severity of Russell's crime. Prosecutors said her high public profile, in addition to her age and illness, made her a particularly vulnerable victim.",
      "\u201cHe went with the Supreme Court justice who was old, who was sick, and whose sickness was a public concern,\u201d Bedell argued.",
      "Russell's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that Ginsburg's high office and the power that comes with it is the opposite of vulnerability.",
      "Nachmanoff, in issuing his sentence, said he took into account the fact that Russell has a sick step parent who might need care. The judge noted \u201cwith some irony\u201d that the details of the stepparent's health problems are under seal.",
      "\u201cWhy? Because it is sensitive health information \u2014 a benefit you did not provide to Justice Ginsburg,\u201d he said.",
      "Russell and his lawyer declined to comment after Thursday's hearing on whether they plan to appeal."

      "The story of \u201cKing,\u201d who doesn't disclose his real name, is similar to that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years",
      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 \u201cKing\u201d doesn\u2019t disclose his real name. Even clients of his Sao Paulo newsstand have to call him by his moniker. The Brazilian online sports gambling addict lowered his profile after a loan shark threatened to put bullets in his head if he didn\u2019t pay up.",
      "Broke and embarrassed, King sought treatment and support earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI was once addicted to slot machines, but then sports betting was so easy that I changed. I got carried away all the time,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "King\u2019s story is that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years. The country has become the third-biggest market in the world for sports betting, following the U.S. and the U.K., a report by data analysis company Comscore said last year. But unlike those countries, rampant advertising and sponsorship have been coupled with an unregulated market. The government is now \u2014 belatedly, some say \u2014 striving to get a handle on the epidemic.",
      "On a recent evening, King's Gamblers Anonymous meeting took place in an improvised classroom inside a church, with coffee and cookies to keep everyone awake, and supportive messages scrawled onto the blackboard. One that's become ubiquitous in Brazil and beyond: \u201cOnly for today I will avoid the first bet.\u201d",
      "King and other attendees, all Christian, started a prayer and the meeting began.",
      "King said his financial problems arose from his addiction to online sports betting, chiefly on soccer.",
      "\u201cI miss the adrenaline rush when I don\u2019t bet,\" he said before the gathering. \"I have managed to stop for a couple of months, but I know that if I do it once again, even a small bet, it will all come back.\u201d",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver for Brazilians embracing sports betting. King said he transformed almost every sale during that time into a bet. His hook was the non-stop advertising on TV, radio, social media as well as sponsorship of local soccer teams' jerseys. He asked for bank loans to pay his gambling debts and then, to cover those, went to the moneylender. His total debt now amounts to 85,000 reais ($15,000) \u2014 impossible to pay off with his monthly income of 8,000 reais.",
      "Digging oneself out of debt in Brazil is especially daunting with its sky-high interest rates. Loans from Brazilian banks could add interest of almost 8% per month to the borrowed sum, and from loan sharks could be even more.",
      "Four Gamblers Anonymous meetings attended by the AP in October featured discussions about difficulties paying down debts, forcing working-class members to postpone housing payments and cancel family vacations.",
      "Some members of impoverished Brazilian families have used welfare money for betting instead of paying for groceries and housing, official data suggests. In August, beneficiaries of Brazil\u2019s flagship program Bolsa Familia spent 3 billion reais ($530 million) on sports betting, according to a report from the central bank. That was more than 20% of the program\u2019s total outlay in the month.",
      "Sports betting was made legal in 2018 in a bill signed by former President Michel Temer. The subsequent turmoil has recently been setting off alarm bells, with addicts venting on social media and media reports of people losing huge sums.",
      "On Oct. 1, the economy ministry prevented more than 2,000 betting companies from operating in Brazil for having failed to provide all the required documents. Soccer-loving President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said in an interview on Oct. 17 that he will shut down the entire market in Brazil if his administration\u2019s new regulations \u2014 presented at the end of July\u2014 fail to work. And Brazil\u2019s Senate on Oct. 25 opened an investigation into betting companies, focusing on crime and addiction.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tax evasion, money laundering of organized crime, the use of influencers to trick people into betting. These companies need to be audited,\u201d Sen. Soraya Thronicke, who proposed the inquiry, told journalists in Brasilia.",
      "S\u00e9rgio Peixoto, a ride-sharing app driver in Rio, is one of many lower-middle-income Brazilians who have reduced their spending due to sports betting debt. Peixoto\u2019s debt currently amounts to 25,000 reais ($4,400). His monthly income is four times less than that.",
      "\u201cIt stopped being a game, it wasn\u2019t fun. I just wanted to get the money back, so I lost even more,\u201d said Peixoto, 26. \u201cI could have invested that money. It would surely have given me more benefits.",
      "Pressure on people to gamble is everywhere. Current and former soccer players, including Vinicius J\u00fanior, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio and Roberto Rivellino, are among the poster boys for local and foreign brands. All but one of the top-tier soccer clubs have betting companies among their main sponsors, with their name and logo emblazoned on their kits. There have been cases of kids and teenagers setting up accounts using their parents' personal information and money, multiple local media outlets have reported.",
      "Brazil's economy ministry estimates that Brazil's sports betting market had $21 billion in transactions last year, a 71% increase compared with the first year of the pandemic, 2020.",
      "The ministry's newly presented regulations include facial recognition systems for gamblers to bet, the identification of a single bank account for transactions involving sports betting, new protections against hackers and the government-authorized domain, bet.br, which will host all betting sites that are legal in Brazil. Once they are in place, come January, between 100 and 150 betting companies will continue to operate in the South American nation.",
      "The changes in Brazil have prompted some companies to take preemptive action. A report by Yield Sec, a technical intelligence platform for online marketplaces, said several betting companies voluntarily restricted their operations in different places after the latest editions of the European Championships and Copa America in the hopes of presenting \u201cthe best possible license application face to the Brazilian authorities.\u201d",
      "Magnho Jos\u00e9 Santos de Sousa, the president of the Legal Gambling Institute, a betting think tank, said Brazil has been flooded by some legal platforms that have licenses in Malta, Cura\u00e7ao, Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, and also illegal sites based in China.",
      "De Sousa expressed hope that the new regulations for advertising, responsible gambling and qualification of sports betting companies will transform the country's deregulated arena into a more serious one that doesn't exploit the vulnerable.",
      "\"The whole operation could turn from water into wine,\u201d he said.",
      "Meantime, the demand for Gamblers Anonymous meetings in Sao Paulo has grown so much in recent years that the weekly gathering, in place since the 1990s, was no longer enough. Many groups have added a second day in the week to help new people recover, mostly sports bettors.",
      "Earlier in October, a group on Sao Paulo's northern edge admitted a man who was struggling with sports betting and card games. The 13 other people in the room stressed that he wasn't alone.",

      "An expensive campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state supreme court seats has yielded mixed results",
      "A costly campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state supreme court seats yielded mixed results in Tuesday's election, with Republicans expanding their majority on Ohio's court while candidates backed by progressive groups won in Montana and Michigan.",
      "One of the most expensive and closely watched supreme court races in North Carolina, where a Democratic justice campaigned heavily on abortion rights and Republicans hope to expand their majority, remained too early to call Thursday.",
      "Groups on both the right and left spent millions in the leadup to the election hoping to reshape courts that'll be battlegrounds for voting rights, redistricting, abortion and other issues.",
      "Abortion-rights supporters touted victories in states that Donald Trump won, saying it's a sign that reproductive rights will be key in judicial campaigns after the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. In states like Montana and Arizona, state courts may soon be tasked with interpreting how abortion-rights amendments voters passed this week would impact existing laws.",
      "\u201cState Supreme Court judges don't really have anything to say about the economy, but they certainly do have something to say about reproductive rights and voting rights and democracy and what your life is going to be like from a right to liberty perspective in your state,\" said Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer for the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cSo I think we have a real opportunity to define these judges and this level of the ballot by reproductive rights.\u201d",
      "The ACLU spent $5.4 million on court races in Montana, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Planned Parenthood and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee earlier this year announced they were collectively spending $5 million, focusing on court races in those states, as well as in Arizona and Texas.",
      "Conservative groups also spent heavily in those states, but with ads focusing on issues other than abortion such as immigration and crime.",
      "In Ohio, all three Democrats running for the state Supreme Court lost their race. The victory gives Republicans a 6-1 majority on the court, which struck down the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban in October and is expected to hear more cases aiming to undo regulations that, for example, require 24-hour waiting periods or in-person appointments for patients.",
      "\u201cOhioans made a strong statement tonight that will keep the court under Republican control for years to come,\u201d said Dee Duncan, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee's Judicial Fairness Initiative, which spent nearly $1 million on the race.",
      "Michigan Democrats won two seats on the state\u2019s Supreme Court, expanding their majority to 5-2. While the elections are nonpartisan, parties nominate the candidates.",
      "\u201cWith the liberal majority protected, Michigan Dems\u2019 hard work past and future will not be threatened by the MAGA fanatics that threaten our values here in Michigan,\u201d Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party Lavora Barnes said in a statement.",
      "In North Carolina, Justice Allison Riggs trailed narrowly Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin in their race for an eight-year term on the state\u2019s highest court. The Associated Press has not called the race, for which nearly 5.5 million ballots have been counted. Tens of thousands of additional provisional and absentee ballots still had to be reviewed by county election officials, and the trailing candidate could seek a recount if the final margin is narrow enough.",
      "Riggs' campaign focused on reproductive rights, running ads that said Griffin could be a deciding vote on the 5-2 majority Republican court for further abortion restrictions. Griffin had said it was inappropriate for Riggs to talk about an issue that could come before the court.",
      "Heated bids for a pair of seats on Montana's court were a split decision, with county attorney Cory Swanson defeating former U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerry Lynch for chief justice. State judge Katherine Bidegaray defeated state judge Dan Wilson for another open seat on the court.",
      "Progressive groups backed Lynch and Bidegaray, casting the races as key to protecting abortion rights in a state where Republicans control the Legislature and the governor's office. Republicans who complained about the court's rulings against laws that would have restricted abortion access or made it more difficult to vote supported Swanson and Wilson.",
      "A longshot effort by abortion-rights advocates to unseat three justices on Texas' all-Republican Supreme Court fell short, with Jimmy Blacklock, John Devine and Jane Bland winning reelection. The three were part of unanimous rulings rejecting challenges to the state\u2019s abortion ban.",
      "In Arizona, two justices won retention elections despite efforts to oust them over the court decision that cleared way for a long-dormant 1864 law banning nearly all abortions to be enforced. The state Legislature swiftly repealed it, and voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion access up to fetal viability, typically after 21 weeks.",
      "Conservatives also won in Oklahoma, where voters removed one of three Supreme Court justices appointed by a former Democratic governor who were up for retention. A 5-4 ruling by the court last year overturned a portion of the state\u2019s near total ban on abortion. It was the first time any Oklahoma appellate judge had been removed through a retention election.",
      "An Arkansas justice who wrote a blistering dissent when the court's Republican-backed majority blocked an abortion rights measure from the ballot was elected chief justice. That race, however, won't change the court's majority.",
      "The next big battleground comes next year in Wisconsin, where a race will determine whether liberals maintain their 4-3 majority on the court. The open race for retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley's seat comes after the court flipped from conservative control in a 2023 election marked by record-breaking spending.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like state supreme court elections are going to go back to the way they were 10 years ago anytime soon,\u201d said Douglas Keith, senior counsel in the judiciary program at the Brennan Center, which has tracked spending on state court races.",

      "British health officials say they have identified four cases of the new, more infectious version of mpox that first emerged in Congo, marking the first time the variant has caused a cluster of illness outside of Africa",
      "LONDON -- British health officials say they have identified four cases of the new, more infectious version of mpox that first emerged in Congo, marking the first time the variant has caused a cluster of illness outside of Africa. Scientists said the risk to the public remains low.",
      "Authorities announced the first case of the new form of mpox in the U.K. last week, saying the case was being treated at a London hospital after recently traveling to countries in Africa with ongoing outbreaks.",
      "This week, the U.K. Health Security Agency said it had now identified three further cases who lived in the same household as the first patient. They too are now being treated at a hospital in London.",
      "\u201cMpox is very infectious in households with close contact and so it is not unexpected to see further cases within the same household,\u201d said Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor of the U.K. Health Security Agency.",
      "The new variant of mpox was first detected earlier this year in eastern Congo. Scientists believe it causes milder symptoms that are harder to notice, which makes it easier to spread because people may not know they are infected. Its spread in Congo and elsewhere in Africa prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency in August.",
      "Britain recorded more than 3,000 cases of another type of mpox during a 2022 outbreak that hit more than 100 countries.",
      "The new variant of mpox has also caused outbreaks in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Single cases in travelers have also been reported in Sweden, India, Germany and Thailand.",
      "To date, there have been about 43,000 suspect cases of mpox in Africa, including more than 1,000 deaths, mostly in Congo.",
      "On Wednesday, WHO said it had allocated 899,900 vaccine doses to nine African countries struggling with mpox epidemics.",

      "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump is refusing to say how he voted on Florida's abortion measure \u2014 and getting testy about it.",
      "The former president was asked twice after casting his ballot in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday about a question that the state's voters are considering. If approved, it would prevent state lawmakers from passing any law that penalizes, prohibits, delays or restricts abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks.",
      "If it\u2019s rejected, the state\u2019s restrictive six-week abortion law would stand.",
      "The first time he was asked, Trump avoided answering. He said instead of the issue that he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d That was a reference to the former president having appointed three conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 2022.",
      "Pressed a second time, Trump snapped at a reporter, saying they \"should just stop talking about that.\u201d",
      "Trump had previously indicated that he would back the measure \u2014 but then changed his mind and said he would vote against it.",
      "In August, Trump said he thought Florida\u2019s ban was a mistake, saying on Fox News Channel, \u201cI think six weeks, you need more time.\u201d But then he said, \u201cat the same time, the Democrats are radical\u201d while repeating false claims he has frequently made about late-term abortions.",

      "Voters are getting a say on abortion policy in Tuesday's election with ballot measures and elections to offices from president to local prosecutors",
      "WASHINGTON -- Voters in nine states are deciding whether their state constitutions should guarantee a right to abortion, weighing ballot measures that are expected to spur turnout for a range of crucial races.",
      "Passing certain amendments in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota likely would lead to undoing bans or restrictions that currently block varying levels of abortion access to more than 7 million women of childbearing age who live in those states.",
      "The future legality and availability of abortion hinges not only on ballot measures, as policies could shift depending on who controls Congress and the presidency. Same with state governments \u2014 including legislatures that pursue new laws, state supreme courts that determine the laws' constitutionality, attorneys general who decide whether to defend them and district attorneys who enforce them.",
      "If all the abortion rights measures pass, \"it\u2019s a sign of how much of a juggernaut support for reproductive rights has become,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Law and an expert on the history of reproductive rights in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf some of them fail,\" she added, \"then you\u2019re going to see some conservatives looking for guidance to see what the magic ingredient was that made it possible for conservatives to stem the tide.\u201d",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on all seven measures that have appeared since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the nationwide right to abortion. That decision opened the door to bans or restrictions in most GOP-controlled states \u2014 and protections of access in most of those controlled by Democrats.",
      "The abortion rights campaigns have a big fundraising advantage this year. Their opponents' efforts are focused on portraying the amendments as too extreme rather than abortion as immoral.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Four more bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before women often realize they\u2019re pregnant. Despite the bans, the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen slightly, because of the growing use of abortion pills and organized efforts to help women travel for abortion. Still, advocates say the bans have reduced access, especially for lower-income and minority residents of the states with bans.",
      "The bans also are part of a key argument in the presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris calls them \u201cTrump abortion bans,\u201d noting former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in overturning Roe v. Wade. Harris, meanwhile, has portrayed herself as a direct, consistent advocate for reproductive health and rights, including Black maternal health.",
      "Trump has struggled to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights, leaning on his catch-all response that abortion rights should be left up to individual states.",
      "His shifting stances on reproductive rights include vowing in October to veto a national abortion ban, just weeks after the presidential debate when he repeatedly declined to say. Trump also has regularly taken credit for appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "After voting in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday, Trump was asked twice how he voted on the abortion measure there \u2014 and didn't answer directly. The first time he said he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d The second time, he snapped at a reporter, saying \u201cyou should stop talking about that.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s attempt to find a more cautious stance on abortion echoes the efforts of many Republican congressional candidates as the issue has emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP. In competitive congressional races from coast to coast, Republicans distanced themselves from more aggressive anti-abortion policies coming from their party and its allies, despite their records on the issue and previous statements opposing abortion rights.",
      "While the ballot questions have similar aims, each one occupies its own political circumstances.",
      "There\u2019s an added obstacle to passing protections in reliably Republican Florida: Supporters of the amendment must get at least 60% of the vote.",
      "Passing it there and rolling back a 6-week ban that took effect in May would be a blow to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, who has steered state GOP funds to the cause and whose administration has weighed in, too, with a campaign against the measure, investigators questioning people who signed petitions to add it to the ballot and threats to TV stations that aired one commercial supporting it.",
      "Nebraska has competing ballot measures. One would allow abortion further into pregnancy. The other would enshrine in the constitution the state\u2019s current law, which bars most abortions after 12 weeks \u2014 but would allow for further restrictions.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure would allow some regulations related to the health of the woman after 12 weeks. Because of that wrinkle, most national abortion-rights groups are not supporting it.",
      "In some states, notably Missouri, passing amendments may not expand access immediately. Courts would be asked to invalidate the bans; and there could be legal battles over that. Clinics would need to staff up and get licenses. And some restrictions could remain in effect.",
      "Arizona, a battleground in the presidential election, bans abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The ballot measure there gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a strict abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "In the Democratic-controlled Colorado and Maryland, the ballot measures would largely put existing policies into the state constitutions, though Colorado\u2019s version could also remove financial barriers to abortion. It would take 55% of the vote to pass there.",
      "Measures maintaining access also are on the ballot in Montana, where a U.S. Senate race could help determine control of the chamber, and Nevada, a battleground in the presidential election.",
      "In Nevada, where control of the state government is divided, the ballot measure would have to be passed this year and again in 2026 to take effect.",
      "New York also has a measure on the ballot that its supporters say would bolster abortion rights. It doesn\u2019t contain the word \u201cabortion\u201d but rather bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration.",
      "The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role.",
      "Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.",
      "A look at what Trump has proposed:",
      "\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d from his 2016 campaign has become creating \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He\u2019s pitched \u201cideological screening\u201d for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he\u2019d reinstitute first-term policies such as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall.",
      "Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman\u2019s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump\u2019s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk \u2014 a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the drug as well as the agency's relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden\u2019s guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans.",
      "Trump\u2019s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That\u2019s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change.",
      "Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It\u2019s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income \u2014 a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods \u2014 and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy \u201cessential\u201d medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of \u201cany vital infrastructure\u201d in the U.S. by Chinese buyers.",
      "Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage.",
      "On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end \u201cboys in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration\u2019s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth.",
      "The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households\u2019 utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration \u2014 even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations \u2014 though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end \u201cfrivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.\u201d",
      "The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House.",
      "He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government\u2019s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain.",
      "Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers\u2019 budget actions \u201cset a ceiling\u201d on spending but not a floor \u2014 meaning the president\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws\u201d includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress.",
      "As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work.",
      "The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding \u201cfor any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\u201d",
      "In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his \u201csecret weapon\u201d against the \u201cMarxist Maniacs and lunatics\u201d he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights.",
      "As in other policy areas, Trump isn\u2019t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online \u201cAmerican Academy\u201d offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. \u201cIt will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed\u2014none of that\u2019s going to be allowed,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.",
      "Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of \u201cmaking America healthy again.\"",
      "Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy \u2013 and transportation infrastructure spending \u2013 anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America\u2019s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden\u2019s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump \u201cthe union bosses and CEOs\u201d together as complicit in \u201cthis disastrous electric car scheme.\u201d In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield \u2014 an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them leaders,\u201d Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans \u201csee on television.\u201d He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Abortion rights advocates prevailed on seven ballot measures across the U.S. in Tuesday's election and lost on three.",
      "The losses are the first on statewide reproductive rights ballot measures anywhere in the U.S. since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a ruling that struck down the nearly 50-year nationwide right to abortion, proving that abortion opponents can win on ballot measures.",
      "There were firsts on the other sides, too: Three amendments call for rolling back abortion bans, including one in Missouri that bars it at all stages of pregnancy with exceptions only under limited circumstances to save the life of the woman.",
      "Here's a look at takeaways from the results.",
      "Missouri is the most populous state where a ballot measure could roll back a current ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy.",
      "But the work isn\u2019t done there.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri filed in a state court Wednesday seeking to invalidate the state's abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care.",
      "The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead, the measure left it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Planned Parenthood leaders said Wednesday on a Zoom call with reporters that they want to start offering abortions at clinics in Columbia, Kansas City and St. Louis if they get the judicial ruling they're requesting \u2014 starting with blocking enforcement of laws on the book.",
      "\"This is only the first step to realizing and fully implementing the protections of Amendment 3. It\u2019s certainly not the last step,\u201d said Richard Muniz, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers.",
      "Clinics had stopped providing abortions in Missouri even before the state\u2019s ban took effect in 2022. They said a list of regulations made it impossible for them to operate. In its legal filing, the Planned Parenthood affiliate that covers much of the state says the onerous requirements include clinicians who provide abortion have surgical licenses and that they conduct pelvic exams on all patients \u2014 even if they offer only medication abortions.",
      "\u201cSome of these patients choose medication abortion precisely because they do not want instruments inserted into their vagina,\u201d Dr. Selina Sandoval, an associate medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a legal filing. \u201cI cannot and will not subject my patients to unnecessary exams.\u201d",
      "Planned Parenthood also objects to laws requiring clinicians to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, mandating a 72-hour waiting period for abortions and banning telemedicine for abortion. Besides the ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, the group is calling for having other bans that kick in after eight, 14, 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy to be struck down.",
      "Abortion rights advocates heralded victories at the ballot box as a signal of widespread support for abortion rights, even in conservative states.",
      "The three states where abortion measures were defeated had special circumstances that weren't present in the others.",
      "In Florida, the threshold for passing a constitutional amendment is 60% while most states require a simple majority. Most voters supported adding abortion rights \u2014 but it fell short of the requirement.",
      "There, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, also presented a challenge to proponents by steering state GOP funds to counter the measure and defending a state agency for publishing a webpage attacking it, among other government efforts.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure is different from the others because it would have allowed the state to regulate abortion in the second trimester \u2014 but only in ways that protect the health of the woman. Because of that provision, most national abortion rights groups did not put money into promoting it, which could have been a factor in its failure in a conservative state.",
      "In Nebraska, both sides had questions on the ballot. Voters passed the one that bars abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 which is in line with current state law \u2014 and also allows the possibility of more stringent bans. They also rejected the measure that aimed to enshrine into the state constitution the right to abortion until viability, which is considered to be sometime after 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there's not a fixed time.",
      "Abortion rights advocates condemned the novel strategy by anti-abortion groups of putting a competing measure on the ballot as an attempt to confuse voters. The approach was considered by anti-abortion groups elsewhere.",
      "Republican Donald Trump reclaimed the presidency, despite his consistently shifting stances on reproductive rights.",
      "If Republicans win the House, in addition to their victories in the Senate and White House, it could open the door to the passage of a national ban.",
      "Trump has said he would veto a national ban, despite previously declining to answer questions about it.",
      "But Republicans have been accused of attempting to recast federal abortion restrictions as \u201cminimum national standards\u201d in order to distort their own stances on the issue, given the political unpopularity of the GOP\u2019s position on abortion.",
      "Judicial appointments have already shaped the national abortion landscape. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped form the majority that overturned Roe v. Wade. It's not just the Supreme Court. Trump-nominated U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk has issued rulings with nationwide consequences, including one impacting access to the abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "Through executive power, a president could also restrict abortion pills sent through the mail and declare that a law that requires doctors to stabilize emergency room patients does not require them to provide abortion. A new administration could also pull back on a federal lawsuit that challenges aspects of Idaho's ban.",
      "One interpretation of the presence of some of the ballot measures was that they were put up in part to drive turnout of Democratic voters in candidate elections.",
      "If that was the plan \u2014 and some abortion rights advocates say it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t seem to sway other statewide races.",
      "The mostly Republican states of Montana and Missouri passed abortion rights protections and also elected GOP candidates for president, U.S. Senate and governor.",
      "In Montana, Republican Tim Sheehy defeated three-term incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, who attempted to pair his campaign with the abortion rights push.",
      "Three other Republican states \u2014 Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2014 rejected abortion ballot measures and supported Trump for president and GOP senators where they were on the ballot.",
      "The Democratic states of Colorado and Maryland expanded abortion rights and voted for Democrats in statewide elections. The same is true in New York, where the ballot measure bars discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d and does not mention abortion specifically \u2014 but was championed by abortion rights advocates, who say it will preserve access.",
      "The measures also passed in Arizona and Nevada, where the presidential and U.S. Senate races had not been called by midday Wednesday.",
      "Democrats in the most competitive Senate races centered their closing argument and ads around abortion, an issue they hoped to capitalize on after it has previously motivated voters up and down the ballot. But abortion rights failed to put them over the top \u2014 including in Montana.",
      "Texas Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat, failed in his bid to defeat Sen. Ted Cruz after investing $5 million in an ad campaign focused on abortion and invoking the issue in campaign trail speeches and during an October debate. Allred leaned on the personal stories of Texas women impacted by the state's abortion ban that have sparked national outrage.",
      "In Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno defeated incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown after Brown and his allies pounced on cellphone video that emerged late in the campaign showing Moreno criticizing suburban women who base their votes on abortion rights.",
      "A hotly contested race between Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Republican Eric Hovde has also focused heavily on abortion and appeared to be close enough early Wednesday for a recount to be requested.",
      "In the Texas city of Amarillo, located in the state\u2019s conservative Panhandle region, voters overwhelming rejected an anti-abortion proposal that would have essentially banned travel for those seeking abortions out of state by allowing civil lawsuits against anyone who helps a local resident obtain an abortion.",
      "The \u201cSanctuary Cities for the Unborn\u201d ordinance was rejected by nearly 60% of voters.",
      "\u201cWe hope to set the tone for not only the state, but the nation, that we will not penalize anyone for seeking health care when they\u2019re facing an extreme travel ban in their own state,\" said Lindsay London, a nurse who helped found a group to oppose the effort.",

      "An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution could bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes.\u201d",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution that would bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes\" is up for a final vote Tuesday amid debate over how much it might affect future abortion and transgender rights.",
      "Supporters and opponents disagree sharply about the potential legal impact of the Equal Rights Amendment, also known as Proposition 1.",
      "New York\u2019s constitution currently forbids discrimination based on race, creed or religion. The amendment would add language that says someone cannot be denied civil rights because of their national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes or \u201creproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d",
      "Democratic leaders put the amendment on the ballot partly in hopes of boosting turnout by voters passionate about protecting abortion access, in an election year where U.S. House races in New York could help decide which party controls Congress.",
      "Several other states also have abortion-related constitutional amendments on their ballots Tuesday. Most of those ballot questions address head-on when it should be legal to end a pregnancy. But in New York, state lawmakers took the indirect approach of writing the amendment as an antidiscrimination measure.",
      "Democrats who support the amendment have argued that the new language would create a legal framework where any restrictions on abortion would amount to an unconstitutional form of discrimination in medical care. The New York City Bar Association has agreed with that assessment, as have some other legal experts.",
      "Still, the fact that the amendment itself does not use the word abortion has caused headaches for its supporters. It also opened the door for opponents to claim its other language would lead to a raft of unintended consequences.",
      "Republicans have run a strong messaging campaign against the amendment, choosing not to focus on what protections it might provide for abortion, but to target other parts of the proposal. Their main attack line has been to argue the amendment would provide a constitutional right for transgender athletes to play on girls\u2019 sports teams.",
      "They\u2019ve also argued that its language on national origin could result in noncitizens being allowed to vote, that its ban on age discrimination might take away price discounts for senior citizens, and that it could also wind up stopping parents from having a say in their child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Previous state court decisions have found that existing language in the state constitution bars noncitizens from voting. And the New York City Bar Association says the amendment would not block existing state laws requiring parental consent for a child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Legal battles are already underway in New York over whether existing state and federal laws give transgender people the right to play on sports teams that match the gender identity.",
      "Democrats in the state legislature voted to put the amendment on the 2024 ballot after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters elsewhere have shown support for abortion access in previous elections. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll recently found that 7 in 10 Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.",
      "Uncertainty over the New York amendment\u2019s impact on abortion was pronounced enough, however, that it caused even the state Board of Elections to throw up its hands. The board is responsible for writing simple explanations of proposed amendments that voters will see on their ballots. But rather than interpret the measure or include the word abortion in its description, the board decided to reiterate the amendment\u2019s language verbatim.",
      "Supporters of the amendment objected and filed lawsuit, but the judge in the case, David A. Weinstein, eventually declined to make the board rewrite its description, in part because he could not say for certain how courts would interpret the amendment\u2019s language.",
      "Abortion is currently legal in New York up through 24 weeks from the beginning of pregnancy. After that, it is only legal if the pregnant person\u2019s life, physical health or mental health is at risk, or if a medical provider determines the fetus is not viable. Although there is no defined time frame, viability is a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus.",
      "Democrats have firm control of state government in New York, making any new abortion restrictions unlikely in the near future.",
      "Backers of the proposal argue that if the amendment passes it would create a strong layer of abortion protections in New York that would be difficult for a future legislature to repeal. That's because New York requires the legislature to pass an amendment to the constitution two times before it goes to voters for final approval."

      "Nebraska has a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot, including two competing ones pertaining to abortion abortion rights",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Nebraska will have a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot Tuesday, including two competing ones that address abortion rights. Nebraska is the first state to feature competing abortion amendments on the same ballot since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending the nationwide right to abortion and allowing states to decide for themselves.",
      "Initiative 434, which appears at the top of the ballot list, would enshrine in the state constitution Nebraska\u2019s current 12-week abortion ban, which the Legislature passed in 2023 and which includes exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to protect the life of the pregnant woman.",
      "Appearing last on the list is Initiative 439, which would amend the constitution to guarantee the right to have an abortion until viability \u2014 the standard under Roe that is the point at which a fetus might survive outside the womb. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation. The measure includes some exceptions, including allowing abortions later in pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant woman.",
      "Because they\u2019re competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the one that gets the most \u201cfor\u201d votes would be adopted, the secretary of state\u2019s office said.",
      "Elections officials expect the competing measures to help drive high voter turnout, along with the hotly contested presidential race.",
      "Abortion is on the ballot in several other states, as well. Coming into the election, voters in all seven states that have decided on abortion-related ballot measures since the reversal of Roe have favored abortion rights, including in some conservative states.",
      "The measure that would enshrine the 12-week ban in the constitution has been bankrolled by some of Nebraska's wealthiest people, including Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts, who previously served as governor and donated more than $1.1 million. His mother, Marlene Ricketts, gave $4 million to the cause. Members of the Peed family, which owns publishing company Sandhills Global, also gave $1 million.",
      "The effort organized under the name Protect Women and Children is heavily backed by religious organizations, including the Nebraska Catholic Conference, a lobbying group that has organized rallies, phone banks and community townhalls to drum up support for the measure.",
      "The effort to enshrine viability as the standard is called Protect Our Rights Nebraska and has the backing of several medical, advocacy and social justice groups. Planned Parenthood has donated nearly $1 million to the cause, with the American Civil Liberties Union, I Be Black Girl, Nebraska Appleseed and the Women\u2019s Fund of Omaha also contributing significantly to the roughly $3.7 million raised by Protect Our Rights.",
      "Two measures, Initiative 437 and Initiative 438, would legalize the possession and use of medical marijuana, and allow for the manufacture, distribution and delivery of it.",
      "Initiative 437 would let patients and caregivers possess up to 5 ounces (142 grams) of marijuana if recommended by a doctor. Initiative 438 would create the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, which would oversee the private groups that would manufacture and dispense marijuana.",
      "The initiatives have been challenged in court over allegations that the petition campaign to put them on the ballot broke election rules. That means a judge could invalidate them even if voters approve them.",
      "Also on the ballot, Referendum Measure 435 asks voters to retain or repeal a new conservative-backed law that allocates millions of dollars in taxpayer money to fund private school tuition.",
      "And Initiative 436 would require all Nebraska employers to provide at least 40 hours of paid sick leave to their employees."

      "Some health officials say mpox cases in Congo appear to be \u201cstabilizing.\u201d",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Some health officials say mpox cases in Congo appear to be \u201cstabilizing\u201d \u2014 a possible sign that the main epidemic for which the World Health Organization made a global emergency declaration in August might be on the decline.",
      "In recent weeks, Congo has reported about 200 to 300 lab-confirmed mpox cases every week, according to WHO. That\u2019s down from nearly 400 cases a week in July. The decline is also apparent in Kamituga, the mining city in the eastern part of Congo where the new, more infectious variant of mpox first emerged.",
      "But the U.N. health agency acknowledged Friday that only 40% to 50% of suspected infections in Congo were being tested \u2014 and that the virus is continuing to spread in some parts of the country and elsewhere, including Uganda.",
      "While doctors are encouraged by the drop in infections in some parts of Congo, it's still not clear what kinds of physical contact is driving the outbreak. Health experts are also frustrated by the low number of vaccine doses the central African nation has received \u2014 265,000 \u2014 and say that delivering the vaccine to where it's needed in the sprawling country is proving difficult. WHO estimates 50,000 people have been immunized in Congo, which has a population of 110 million.",
      "Scientists also say there needs to be an urgent, broader vaccination effort for the entire continent to halt mpox's spread and avoid further worrisome genetic mutations, like the one detected earlier this year in Congo after months of low-level circulation.",
      "\u201cIf we miss this opportunity, the likelihood of another significant outbreak increases substantially,\u201d said Dr. Zakary Rhissa, who heads operations in Congo for the charity Alima.",
      "So far this year, there have been roughly 43,000 suspected cases in Africa and more than 1,000 people have died, mostly in Congo.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how past outbreaks, such as the one in Nigeria in 2017, can lead to larger global events if not effectively contained,\u201d he said. The 2017 epidemic ended up leading to the 2022 global outbreak of mpox that affected more than 100 countries.",
      "Rhissa said the decline in cases in Kamituga \u2014 where mpox initially spread among sex workers and miners \u2014 is an opening to put more programs in place for vaccination, surveillance and education.",
      "Georgette Hamuli, an 18-year-old sex worker, hadn\u2019t been aware of mpox until immunization teams arrived last week in the poor neighborhood where she works in Goma, the biggest city in eastern Congo.",
      "\u201cThey told us we're highly exposed to the the risk of infection,\u201d she said. \u201cWe insist on condoms with our clients, but some refuse ... if they don\u2019t want to use a condom, they double the amount they pay.\u201d",
      "Hamuli said she and other friends who are sex workers each received 2,000 Congolese francs ($0.70) from a charity to get vaccinated against mpox \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t the money that swayed her.",
      "\u201cThe vaccine is also necessary,\" she said. \"I think we\u2019re now protected.\u201d",
      "The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated Congo needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the virus, and another 7 million for the rest of Africa. So far, WHO and partners have allocated 900,000 vaccines to nine African countries affected by mpox and expect 6 million vaccines to be available by the end of this year.",
      "Mpox epidemics in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda had their origins in Congo, and a number of cases in travelers have also been identified in Sweden, Thailand, Germany, India and Britain.",
      "Fewer than half of the people who are most at risk in Congo have been vaccinated, according to Heather Kerr, Congo director for the the International Rescue Committee.",
      "\u201cWe only have a tiny amount of vaccines, and nothing for the kids,\u201d she said.",
      "The vaccines for Congo are largely coming from donor countries like the U.S and through UNICEF, which mainly uses taxpayer money to buy the shots.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting a charitable approach where we only see very small donations of vaccines to Africa,\u201d said Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University. \u201cWhat we need is a public health approach where we immunize populations at scale.\u201d",
      "Drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, which makes the most widely used mpox vaccine, said it would sell shots destined for Africa at the lowest price possible.",
      "The advocacy group Public Citizen published an analysis showing that UNICEF paid $65 per dose of the Jynneos mpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic, far higher than nearly all other vaccines used in public health programs.",
      "Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, an infectious diseases expert at South Africa\u2019s University of KwaZulu-Natal, said mpox outbreaks typically peak and disappear quickly because of how the virus spreads. This time, however, he said there are two complicating factors: the virus\u2019 transmission via sex and the continued spillover from infected animals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in new territory with mpox this time,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we\u2019re never going to solve this until we vaccinate most of our people.\u201d",

They knew his mental health was fragile after more than one suicide attempt. But the best officers could do in a state with some of the most expansive gun rights is suggest Harris keep the weapon in a storage unit.",

The report doesn't explain why, and police didn't respond to an email from the AP. The FBI merely provided a list of the 12 reasons for a denial with no other details.",
      "Then on Oct. 10, Harris drove to a nearby suburb to pay a man $580 in cash for the rifle used in the shooting.",
      "Harris\u2019 family grew more concerned on Oct. 15, when two packages from gun and ammunition suppliers arrived. One of his sisters, Noneeka Harris, opened them, finding a body armor vest, magazine holsters and magazines. She then searched his bedroom and found the rifle inside an old TV box.",
      "Harris' mother, Tanya Ward, called BJC Mental Health Services and staff there \u201cdeemed the situation as an immediate threat.\u201d They advised her to take the items to the police department and tell officers about her son\u2019s mental illness.",
      "Police at the station told her they couldn\u2019t take the firearm because Harris was of legal age to possess it. They said she should head home and an officer would meet them there. By the time she returned, Harris was home and insistent that he keep the gun.",
      "His mother was adamant that the gun not be in the house, so the officers suggested a storage unit. The report said the officers also advised her on steps she needed to take to have her son deemed mentally unstable.",
      "Federal law has banned some mentally ill people from buying guns since 1968, including those deemed a danger to themselves or others, who have been involuntarily committed, or judged not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.",
      "Ultimately, the firearm and other items were loaded into the trunk of Harris' sister's vehicle, including a box of ammunition that arrived the next day. She later drove her brother to a storage facility, which was about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the high school.",
      "She told police she \u201cknew something was going to happen.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 24, shots rang out as Harris entered his former high school.",
      "It is unclear why Harris targeted the school. A security officer recalled him as somewhat popular and his grade school principal said he wasn\u2019t bullied, according to the investigative report. But as he fired at a dance class, one student told police she heard someone yell, \u201cI hate this school. I hate everybody.\u201d",
      "Fatally wounded, Alexzandria Bell initially ran toward the entrance before slumping to the ground, a security officer reassuring the 10th grader that help was on the way. But then she went quiet.",
      "One class jumped out a window to escape after their physical education teacher, 61-year-old Jean Kuczka, stood between them and Harris. Kuckza was killed.",
      "Harris eventually made his way to the third floor, hiding in a computer lab. The first officer to charge into the lab had a daughter at the school.",
      "\u201cI had everything to lose,\u201d the officer, who was among those to open fire, recalled in the police report. He texted his daughter afterward, telling her, \u201cI killed him.\u201d",
      "Harris' sister told investigators that when she heard about the shooting, she started driving toward the school but then went home instead, waking up her mother who had worked overnight.",
      "Harris' mother later checked her voicemail. There was a message from a hospital asking if she still needed help with her son."

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 05:46:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution",
    "story": [
      "Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution \u2014 a vote that could cement access after the presidential battleground came close to a near-total ban earlier this year.",
      "Arizona is one of nine states with abortion on the ballot.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates are hoping for a win that could expand access beyond the state's current 15-week limit to the point of fetal viability, a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Doctors say it's sometime after 21 weeks, though there's no defined time frame.",
      "Advocates also are counting on the measure to drive interest among Democrats to vote the party line up and down the ballot. When Republicans running in tough races address the ballot measure, they generally don\u2019t dissuade voters from supporting it, though some like Senate candidate Kari Lake say they\u2019re personally voting against it. GOP U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani, whose battleground congressional district encompasses Tucson, ran an ad saying he rejects \"the extremes on abortion.\u201d",
      "Arizona has been whipsawed by recent legal and legislative battles centered on abortion. In April, the state Supreme Court cleared the way for enforcement of a long-dormant 1864 law that banned nearly all abortions. The Legislature swiftly repealed it.",
      "In addition to the abortion ballot measure itself, the issue could sway state legislative races and lead to elimination of the voice voters have over retention of state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices.",
      "Arizona for Abortion Access, the coalition leading the ballot measure campaign, has far outpaced the opposition campaign, It Goes Too Far, in fundraising. Opponents argue that the measure is too far-reaching because its physical and mental health exemption post-viability is so broad that it effectively legalizes abortion beyond viability. The measure allows post-viability abortions if they are necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the mother.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, abortion-rights supporters prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions, including in conservative-leaning states.",
      "Voters in Arizona are divided on abortion. Maddy Pennell, a junior at Arizona State University, said the possibility of a near-total abortion ban made her \u201cdepressed\u201d and strengthened her desire to vote for the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cI feel very strongly about having access to abortion,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle Lee, an independent Arizona voter, does not support the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cAll abortion is pretty much, in my opinion, murder from beginning to end,\u201d Lee said.",
      "The Civil War-era ban also shaped the contours of tight legislative races. State Sen. Shawnna Bolick and state Rep. Matt Gress are among the handful of vulnerable Republican incumbents in competitive districts who crossed party lines to give the repeal vote the final push \u2014 a vote that will be tested as both parties vie for control of the narrowly GOP-held state Legislature.",
      "Both of the Phoenix-area lawmakers were rebuked by some of their Republican colleagues for siding with Democrats. Gress made a motion on the House floor to initiate the repeal of the 1864 law. Bolick, explaining her repeal vote to her Senate colleagues, gave a 20-minute floor speech describing her three difficult pregnancies.",
      "While Gress was first elected to his seat in 2022, Bolick is facing voters for the first time. She was appointed by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to fill a seat vacancy in 2023. She has not emphasized her role in the repeal vote as she has campaigned, instead playing up traditional conservative issues \u2014 one of her signs reads \u201cBolick Backs the Blue.\u201d",
      "Another question before voters is whether to move away from retention elections for state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices, a measure put on the ballot by Republican legislators hoping to protect two justices who favored allowing the Civil War-era ban to be enforced.",
      "Under the existing system, voters decide every four to six years whether judges and justices should remain on the bench. The proposed measure would allow the judges and justices to stay on the bench without a popular vote unless one is triggered by felony convictions, crimes involving fraud and dishonesty, personal bankruptcy or mortgage foreclosure.",
      "Shawnna Bolick\u2019s husband, Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick, is one of two conservative justices up for a retention vote. Justice Bolick and Justice Kathryn Hackett King, who were both appointed by former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, sided with the high court\u2019s majority to allow the enforcement of the 1864 near-total ban. Abortion-rights activists have campaigned for their ouster, but if the ballot measure passes they will keep their posts even if they don\u2019t win the retention election."

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 10:35:49 -0500",
    "summary": "For the last six years, Mexico bragged about its oft-questioned policy of &ldquo;hugs, not bullets,&rdquo; in which the country&rsquo;s leaders avoided confrontations with drug cartels that were gradually taking control of large parts of the country",
    "story": [
      "For the last six years, Mexico bragged about its oft-questioned policy of \u201chugs, not bullets,\u201d in which the country\u2019s leaders avoided confrontations with drug cartels that were gradually taking control of large parts of the country",
      "MEXICO CITY -- For the last six years, Mexico bragged about its oft-questioned \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d strategy, in which its leaders avoided confrontations with drug cartels that were gradually taking control of large parts of the country. The thinking was that social programs, not shootouts, would gradually drain the pool of cartel gunmen.",
      "Now, a month into the term of new President Claudia Sheinbaum, a string of bloody confrontations suggests the government is quietly abandoning the \u201cno bullets\u201d part of that strategy and is much more willing to use the full force of the military and the militarized National Guard.",
      "But the challenge Mexico now faces is different from that during the country\u2019s 2006-2012 drug war. Cartels today are more diversified, more deeply entrenched in migrant smuggling and more willing to use foreign recruits and adolescents to fill their ranks.",
      "All of that has led to a string of violent clashes in which security forces who shoot at suspected drug cartel convoys wind up killing bystanders and migrants, and reporting lopsided death tolls in which soldiers aren\u2019t harmed but most of the suspects are wiped out.",
      "Sheinbaum has studiously avoided using the \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d slogan popularized by her predecessor and mentor, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office on Sept. 30. She has, after all, pledged to continue each and every one of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policies. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "But Sheinbaum has had to perform some verbal gymnastics to avoid disowning the policy entirely.",
      "\u201cClearly, it isn\u2019t a question of hugs for criminals, nobody has ever said that,\u201d Sheinbaum said soon after taking office. The hugs, she said, were meant for impoverished youths, to avoid having them recruited as cartel gunmen.",
      "\u201cThere are traces of a change in tone toward organized crime, but it\u2019s too early to call,\u201d said Falko Ernst, a security analyst. \u201cIt seems unlikely that the Sheinbaum administration would risk a politically inconvenient, steady stream of violent imagery by betting on wholesale balazos (bullets)-only strategy,\u201d but there may be more willingness to confront \u201cthe most overt and brazen displays of power\u201d by the cartels.",
      "But it is hard to imagine Sheinbaum issuing public praise for drug lords for behaving themselves, or saying \u2014 as L\u00f3pez Obrador did \u2014 that she will \u201ctell on them to their fathers and grandfathers\u201d if they cause too much violence.",
      "She has also been unwilling to tolerate criminals taking police and soldiers hostage, or to crow about reductions in Mexico\u2019s \u201clethality index\u201d \u2014 the measure of suspects killed, wounded or taken into custody, versus casualties on the law enforcement side \u2014 the way her predecessor did.",
      "L\u00f3pez Obrador famously called off the 2019 arrest of drug lord Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n, and ordered his release, after his Sinaloa cartel threatened to plunge the northern city of Culiacan into chaos to win his freedom. L\u00f3pez Obrador said he made the decision to avoid bloodshed.",
      "Sheinbaum\u2019s administration has been a tad different. On her first day in office, soldiers in the southern state of Chiapas opened fire on a truck that \u201clooked like one used by criminal groups.\u201d But after shooting up the truck, they found only migrants, six of whom were killed and 10 wounded.",
      "Ten days later, army and National Guard troops killed three innocent bystanders as they were pursuing suspected gunmen. And this weekend, the National Guard opened fire on a truck carrying migrants, killing two Colombians and wounding at least four.",
      "Then there are the lopsided death tolls: L\u00f3pez Obrador always criticized previous administrations for shootouts in which all the suspects were killed, and very few were taken alive. But in Sheinbaum\u2019s third week in office, soldiers in Sinaloa killed 19 drug cartel suspects and arrested one in a confrontation, but suffered not a scratch themselves.",
      "And toward the end of her first month in office, soldiers pursuing cartel gunmen who had killed two local policemen killed 17 of them but lost no soldiers. Most of the dead, and 10 of the 15 gunmen arrested in the confrontation, were Guatemalan.",
      "\u201cThe hugs not bullets strategy ended some time ago,\u201d said security analyst David Saucedo, pointing to an increased number of high-level drug arrests and extraditions of suspects. \u201cThe U.S. government pressured Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador to resume the capture of high-level drug lords.\u201d",
      "One of the key differences Sheinbaum faces is that Mexican cartels have gotten involved in the lucrative trade of smuggling migrants from far-away countries.",
      "In the old days, the cartels took a cut from smugglers moving Central Americans, who used to make up the vast majority of those crossing Mexico to reach the United States. Those migrants paid hundreds or a few thousand dollars apiece.",
      "Since smugglers opened up a new route through the Darien Gap, people from farther away have been crossing Mexico, and they can pay far higher smuggling fees.",
      "Simultaneously, an immigration crackdown in the U.S. and Mexico has meant a significant number of Central and South Americans now have no avenue to get into the United States, said military analyst Juan Ibarrola, noting, \u201cIt is big business, and it is a far more profitable business than drugs.\u201d",
      "Ibarrola claims the cartels are now using migrants both as human shields, and sometimes as cannon fodder for their squads of hitmen.",
      "\u201cThe recruitment of larger batches of foreign fighters is yet another sign of the gradual deepening of Mexico\u2019s armed conflicts,\u201d said Ernst. \u201cLeft unchecked \u2014 much like the employment of homemade explosive devices \u2014 it\u2019s a trend that\u2019s been allowed to expand.\u201d",
      "Expand is exactly what the cartels did during L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s six-year term from late 2018 to 2024.",
      "\u201cFor six years we were ruled by the policies of a president who did not understand, or who did not realize, that the worst thing he could have done, the worst error he could have made, was not to use legal force against criminal violence,\u201d said Ibarrola, who is convinced the policy has now changed.",
      "The other problem Sheinbaum faces is the result of her determination to continue with L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s strategy of militarizing Mexican law enforcement \u2014 essentially giving soldiers a task they weren\u2019t trained to do.",
      "Together with the mix of migrants and drug traffickers, it seems almost a certain recipe for more deaths of innocent bystanders.",
      "\u201cIt is a fact that the National Guard does not correctly apply the rules of engagement on the use of force,\u201d said Saucedo. \u201cThey tend to open fire before investigating or trying to detain criminal suspects.\u201d",

      "And Rutte insisted that the challenges posed by Russia in Ukraine affected both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "\u201cRussia is delivering the latest technology into North Korea in return for North Korean help with the war against Ukraine. And this is a threat not only to the European part of NATO, but also to the U.S. mainland,\u201d he said as he arrived at the summit.",
      "During the campaign, Trump said he could end the war in Ukraine, now well into its third year, in a single day. Ukraine and many of its European backers fear that this means a peace on terms favorable to Russian President Vladimir Putin and involving the surrender of territory.",

      "Earlier, Zelenskyy told reporters in Budapest that Europe and the U.S. need each other to remain strong.",

      "The deluge left behind a landscape of devastation, especially in Valencia, the hardest-hit region. The search for the dead and missing continues, more than a week since the Oct. 29 floods hit \u2014 as well as a gargantuan cleanup and recovery effort.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at Spain\u2019s deadliest natural disaster of the century, by the numbers:",

      "Ninety-three people have been officially declared missing, but authorities admit that the real number could be higher. Another 54 bodies remain unidentified. In total, 36,605 people have been rescued, according to authorities.",
      "The full extent of the damage is unknown, but Spain\u2019s Consortium for Insurance Compensation, a public-private entity that pays insurance claims for extreme risks like floods, estimates that it will spend at least 3.5 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in compensation.",
      "The consortium has received 116,000 insurance claims for flood damage, with 60% of the claims for cars and 31% for homes. Spain\u2019s Association of Insurance Companies anticipates the flooding will break a historic record for payouts.",

      "The central government has approved a 10.6 billion-euro ($11.6-billion) relief package for families, business and townhalls. The Valencia regional government is asking Madrid for 31 billion euros ($33 billion) in aid as well.",
      "The drought that has hit the country for the past two years and record hot temperatures helped magnify the floods, scientists say.",
      "Spain's meteorological agency says that 30.4 inches fell in one hour in the Valencian town of Turis, an all-time national record for rainfall set on Oct. 29. The devastated village of Chiva also received more rain in eight hours than the town had experienced in the preceding 20 months.",
      "The storms honed in on the Magro and Turia Rivers and the Poyo canal, turning them into swift currents that swept away everything in their path. To the human eye, it looked as if a tsunami-like wave of water and mud cut a swath through the southern outskirts of the city of Valencia.",
      "The European Space Agency said that, according to satellite images captured on Oct. 31, water covered an area of 15,633 hectares (38,600 acres). About 190,000 people were directly affected, the agency said.",

      "Dozens of Russian drones have targeted the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in a nighttime attack that lasted eight hours",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Dozens of Russian drones targeted Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, in an eight-hour nighttime attack, authorities said Thursday as Russia kept up its relentless pounding of Ukraine after almost 1,000 days of war.",
      "Lone Russian drones and also swarms of drones entered Ukrainian airspace from various directions and at a variety of altitudes, officials said, in what was an apparent attempt to stretch air defense systems and unnerve city residents.",
      "Ukrainian air defenses \u201cneutralized\u201d three dozen drones, but falling debris caused damage to a hospital as well as residential and office buildings in Kyiv, local authorities said. A fire was ignited on the 33rd floor of an apartment building.",
      "At least two people were reported injured.",
      "Drone attacks on Kyiv have recently been occurring almost every day, with nighttime explosions and the continuous buzzing sound of drones keeping the city on edge. Russia is deploying about 10 times more Iranian-made Shahed drones than it was this time last year, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s forces are struggling to match the might of Russia\u2019s military, which is much bigger and better equipped. Western support is crucial for Ukraine to sustain the costly war of attrition. The uncertainty over how long that aid will continue deepened this week with Donald Trump elected as the next U.S. president. Trump has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine.",
      "Russia, meanwhile, is trying to grind down Ukraine\u2019s appetite for the fight and sap the West\u2019s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict.",
      "The Russian barrages mostly involve Iranian Shahed drones, which terrorize civilians, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of the state Center for Countering Disinformation.",
      "Russia is aiming to save and stockpile its missiles, which are much more powerful than drones, Kovalenko claimed on Thursday, though Russia has used missiles effectively in its campaign to knock out Ukraine\u2019s power grid.",
      "Also, the drone attacks gradually wear down Ukraine\u2019s air defenses, making it more vulnerable to future missile launches.",
      "During the day on Thursday, Russia launched five attacks using missiles and glide bombs on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, killing at least four people and injuring 18. The attacks also damaged residential buildings and a hospital, Ukraine\u2019s National Police said.",

      "BEIJING -- China on Friday approved a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt, in the latest push to rev up growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy.",
      "The plan will be implemented over the next three years, Xu Hongcai, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress's financial and economic committee, said at a news conference Friday.",
      "Finance minister Lan Fo'an estimated that the hidden debt of local governments was 14.3 trillion yuan ($2 trillion) at the end of 2023. Hidden debt refers to debt that has not been disclosed publicly.",
      "Lan said 2 trillion yuan would be allocated each year from 2024 to 2026 to help local governments resolve their debts. He estimated that the amount of hidden debt will drop to 2.3 trillion yuan ($320.9 billion) by the end of 2028.",
      "Officials also said Friday that the ceiling to issue special bonds will be raised to 35.52 trillion yuan ($4.96 billion) from 29.52 trillion yuan ($4.12 billion) for local governments.",
      "Lan said that the implementation of such a large-scale replacement measure indicates a \u201cfundamental shift\u201d in China's approach to debt restructuring and said that China\u2019s government debt risk was \u201ccontrollable.\u201d",
      "Analysts have called for bold, multi-trillion-yuan measures to reinvigorate the world's second largest economy, which has yet to bounce back fully from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Local government debts have ballooned partly due to high spending and low tax revenues during the pandemic, but also due to a downturn in the property industry, since sales of land use rights, a key source of local government revenue, have sagged.",
      "The central bank loosened restrictions on borrowing in late September, sparking a stock market rally, but economists say the government needs to do more to ignite a sustained recovery. Government officials have indicated that could come at this week's meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which must give official approval to any new spending.",
      "The economy has shown signs of life in the past two months. Purchase subsidies offered to people who trade in old cars or appliances for new ones helped auto sales rebound in September. A survey of manufacturers turned positive in October after five straight months of decline, and exports surged 12.7% last month, the largest increase in more than two years.",
      "For most of the year, the ruling Communist Party appeared more focused on addressing long-term structural issues with the economy rather than short-term ones. Previous steps to boost the economy were piecemeal, seemingly aimed at keeping the economy afloat rather than sparking a robust recovery.",
      "In recent weeks, the party has signaled a growing concern about the economy's sluggishness as it tries to meet its goal of achieving growth of around 5% this year. The central bank's monetary easing was followed by government pronouncements that it still has ample funds to pump into the economy.",
      "Still, the longer-term goals of transforming China into a high-tech and green energy economy seem likely to remain the chief aims of the Communist Party, which doesn't face election pressures like the ones that toppled the Democrats and swept Donald Trump's Republicans to power in America this week.",

      "An Italian navy ship has arrived at the Albanian port of Shengjin with eight migrants who will be processed there after they were intercepted in international waters",
      "SHENGJIN, Albania -- An Italian navy ship docked Friday at the Albanian port of Shengjin with eight migrants who will be processed there after they were intercepted in international waters, a month after another group was turned away for failing the vetting process.",
      "It is only the second transfer of migrants since two migrant processing centers started operating in October under a deal sealed between Italy and Albania.",
      "The agreement allows up to 3,000 migrants intercepted by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month will be sheltered in Albania, and vetted for possible asylum in Italy or be sent back to their countries.",
      "Italy has agreed to welcome those migrants who are granted asylum, while those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania.",
      "The same Italian naval ship used on Friday transferred the first 16 migrants to Albania from Bangladesh and Egypt on Oct. 16. Four were taken to Italy the same day because they were minors or had health issues. Twelve others were brought back to Italy three days later, following a ruling by Rome judges who rejected their detention because their countries of origin weren't safe enough for them to be sent back.",
      "The naval ship Libra, which can carry 200 people besides crew, left Italy\u2019s southernmost island of Lampedusa on Wednesday with eight men on board, according to the Italian media. Italian Interior Ministry spokesperson Francesco Kamel had confirmed the Libra was heading to Albania, but declined to give out any further information until the operation was complete. He didn't say when it would arrive, nor how many people were on board.",
      "Eight migrants in black-and-purple sportswear were seen walking out of the ship, accompanied by Italian Carabinieri, police and other officials at the reception center. After being screened there, they will be taken to the Gjader center, about 22 kilometers (14 miles) to the east.",
      "The Italian media reported that out of 1,200 migrant arrivals on Lampedusa over the past two days, just eight male adults traveling without families met Albania's screening criteria, including that they come from countries deemed \u201csafe\u201d for repatriation.",
      "There is no clarification from the Italian Interior Ministry on the nationality of the migrants. Nongovernmental organizations refer to them as coming from Bangladesh and Egypt.",
      "The number of people reaching Italy along the central Mediterranean migration route \u2014 mainly from Bangladesh, Syria, Tunisia and Egypt \u2014 has fallen by 60% in 2024 compared to 2023. As of Nov. 7, according to the Italian Interior Ministry, 57,767 migrants have arrived by sea in 2024.",
      "A court ruling out of Rome had shortened the list of countries considered \u201csafe\u201d by law, meaning that Rome can repatriate migrants from those countries who didn\u2019t win asylum using a fast-track procedure. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni slammed the Rome court ruling, and said that deeming countries such as Bangladesh and Egypt unsafe means that virtually all migrants would be barred from the Albania program, making it unworkable.",
      "On Oct. 21, Italy\u2019s far-right government approved a new decree aimed at overcoming those judicial hurdles that risked derailing the contentious five-year migration deal with Albania, signed in 2023 by Meloni and her Albanian counterpart, Edi Rama.",
      "The agreement to outsource the housing of asylum-seekers to a non-European Union member country, defended by Meloni as a new model to handle illegal migration, has been hailed by some countries which like Italy are experiencing a high level of migrant arrivals.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still an extraordinary interest and some positive attention (on the Albanian migration deal) and there was also a bit of curiosity on this debate over safe countries,\u201d Meloni on Friday told reporters in Budapest during the European Political Community summit.",
      "\u201cReading some court rulings, it looks that there are no safe countries at all ... that would compromise any possibility of managing or blocking mass illegal immigration,\u201d Meloni said.",
      "Visiting Albania in October, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen refused to give her opinion of the agreement, saying only that it was being closely monitored.",
      "Human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations that are active in the Mediterranean have slammed the agreement as a dangerous precedent that conflicts with international laws.",

The military said it was investigating the incident, declining to elaborate further.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what kind of aircraft was shot down in the low-quality night video. The Houthis, in a later statement, claimed to have downed an American MQ-9 Reaper drone.",

      "Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over Yemen for years.",
      "The Houthis have targeted more than 90 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels.",
      "The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The tempo of the Houthi sea attacks also has waxed and waned over the months.",

      "Dutch authorities say Israeli fans were assaulted after a soccer game in Amsterdam by hordes of young people apparently riled up by calls on social media to target Jewish people",
      "AMSTERDAM -- Israeli fans were assaulted after a soccer game in Amsterdam by hordes of young people apparently riled up by calls on social media to target Jewish people, Dutch authorities said Friday. Five people were treated at hospitals and dozens were arrested after the attacks, which were condemned as antisemitic by authorities in Amsterdam, Israel and across Europe.",
      "Reports of antisemitic speech, vandalism and violence have been on the rise in Europe since the start of the war in Gaza, and tensions mounted in Amsterdam ahead of Thursday night\u2019s match between the Dutch team Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv.",
      "Pro-Palestinian demonstrators were banned by local authorities from gathering outside the stadium, and video showed a large crowd of Israeli fans chanting anti-Arab slogans on their way to the game. Afterward, youths on scooters and on foot crisscrossed the city in search of Israeli fans, punching and kicking them and then fleeing quickly to evade police, Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema said.",
      "On the social media platform Telegram, \u201cthere is talk of people going on a Jew hunt,\" Halsema said. \"That is so shocking and so despicable that I still cannot fathom it.\u201d Dutch Minister of Justice and Security David van Weel vowed to track down and prosecute the perpetrators.",
      "Police had to escort some fans back to hotels, according to authorities.",
      "Ofek Ziv, a Maccabi fan from the Israeli city of Petah Tikva, said someone threw a rock at his head, causing light bleeding, as he and a friend left the stadium. He said a group of men began to chase him, before he and his friend got into a taxi, picked up other fans and took shelter at a hotel.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very scared, it\u2019s very striking,\" Ziv said. \"And the police didn\u2019t come to help us.\u201d",
      "Another Israeli fan, Alyia Cohen, said upon arriving back in Israel that he would go back to Amsterdam for future matches. \u201cWe are not afraid of anything, ours is the people of Israel.\u201d",
      "Five people were treated in the hospital and released, while some 20 to 30 people suffered light injuries, police said. At least 62 suspects were arrested, with 10 still in custody, the city's public prosecutor, Ren\u00e9 de Beukelaer, told reporters at a news conference Friday.",
      "A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said he \u201cviews the horrifying incident with utmost gravity.\u201d He demanded that the Dutch government take \u201cvigorous and swift action\u201d against those involved.",
      "Condemnation of the violence poured in from around Europe. \u201cAntisemitism has absolutely no place in Europe, and we are determined to fight it and to fight all forms of hatred,\u201d said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. \"We want Jewish life and culture to thrive in Europe.\u201d",
      "Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof condemned the violence and flew home early from a European Union summit in Hungary.",
      "The attacks shattered Amsterdam\u2019s long-cherished view of itself as a beacon of tolerance and haven for persecuted religions, including Sephardic Jews from Portugal and Spain who fled to the city centuries ago.",
      "Police said security will be beefed up at Jewish institutions across the city, which has a large Jewish community and was home to Jewish World War II diarist Anne Frank and her family as they hid from Nazi occupiers.",
      "Halsema, Amsterdam's mayor, described the violence as \u201can eruption of antisemitism that we had hoped never again to see in Amsterdam.\u201d",
      "In the past, Ajax was known as a soccer club with links to Amsterdam\u2019s Jewish community because visiting fans had to pass the city\u2019s Jewish quarter to get to the club\u2019s former stadium. Ajax fans sometimes wave Star of David flags and chant the Dutch word for Jews.",
      "Israel's foreign minister, Gideon Saar, flew to Amsterdam on Friday and in a message on X he said that hatred of Jews is \u201cappearing in place after place after place.\"",
      "Saar met with the Dutch minister for security and justice, pledging Israeli help in the investigation, and also held talks with Geert Wilders, a far right, anti-Islam lawmaker whose party won national elections last year.",
      "Amsterdam police spokeswoman Sara Tillart said it was too early in their investigation to say if anybody other than soccer fans was targeted. Authorities outlawed demonstrations across the city for the weekend and gave police extra powers to frisk people.",
      "Israel\u2019s government initially ordered two planes sent to Amsterdam to bring fans home, but Netanyahu's office later said it would work to help citizens arrange commercial flights.",
      "Maccabi\u2019s CEO, Ben Mansford, spoke to reporters at Israel\u2019s international airport as some fans returned. \u201cLots of people went to watch a football game ... to support Israel, to support the star of David,\u201d he said. For them to be attacked, \u201cthat\u2019s very sad times for us all given the last year we\u2019ve had.\u201d",
      "Tensions had been brewing in Amsterdam for days ahead of the match. A Palestinian flag was torn down from a building in Amsterdam on Wednesday, Dutch broadcaster NOS reported, and authorities banned a pro-Palestinian demonstration near the stadium.",
      "Ahead of the game, large crowds of supporters of the Israeli team could be seen on video chanting anti-Arab slogans as they headed to the stadium, escorted by police.",
      "\u201cLet the IDF win, and (expletive) the Arabs,\u201d the fans chanted, using the acronym of the Israeli military, as they shook their fists. It also showed police pushing several pro-Palestinian protesters away from a Maccabi fan gathering in a square earlier in the day.",
      "Security issues around hosting games against visiting Israeli teams led the Belgian soccer federation to decline to stage a men\u2019s Nations League game in September. That game against Israel was played in Hungary with no fans in the stadium.",
      "Israel was exiled from the Asian Football Confederation in the 1970s after Arab nations refused to play against it. Israel played in European qualifying for the 1982 World Cup and has been a member of European soccer body UEFA since 1994.",
      "The violence in Amsterdam will no doubt lead to a review of security at upcoming matches involving Israeli teams. UEFA had announced Monday that a Maccabi match initially to be played in Istanbul on Nov. 28 against the Turkish team Besiktas, would be moved to a yet-to-be-decided neutral venue.",
      "Italian police said security was increased for Maccabi Tel Aviv\u2019s basketball game at Virtus Bologna Friday night, both for fans and for the Maccabi team.",
      "Israel\u2019s national soccer team is scheduled to play France in Paris on Nov. 14 in the Nations League. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said Friday the match would go ahead as planned.",
      "\u201cI think that for a symbolic reason we must not yield, we must not give up,\u201d he said, noting that sports fans from around the world came together for the Paris Olympics this year to celebrate the \u201cuniversal values\u201d of sports.",

      "STOCKHOLM -- Sweden\u2019s central bank on Thursday cut its key interest rate by half a percentage point to 2.75% in what was described as the largest reduction over a decade.",
      "Riksbanken said the cut, the fourth this year, was \u201cto provide further support to the economy and help inflation stabilize at the target.\u201d",
      "It added that \u201cif the outlook for economic activity and inflation remains the same,\u201d the policy rate may also be cut in December, and during the first half of 2025.",
      "The monetary policy was gradually eased over the course of the year, as inflation declined and economic activity remained weak, the central bank said in a statement. \u201cDespite an expectation among economic agents of better times ahead, there are still few clear signs of a recovery.\"",
      "Inflation in Sweden in October was of 1.6%, according to Statistics Sweden. It was below the central bank\u2019s 2% target. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 8.5% of the work force during the third quarter of 2024.",
      "The last time the rate was cut in Sweden was in September and it was by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "The interest rate cut was the largest reduction in over 10 years, Swedish news agency TT wrote. At its highest in February 2023, the 12-month inflation rate was 12.0%.",

    "story": [
      "The Bank of England has cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point after inflation across the U.K. fell below its target rate of 2%",
      "LONDON -- The Bank of England cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.75% on Thursday after inflation across the U.K. fell significantly, relieving some pressure on borrowers who have faced elevated mortgage and loan costs.",
      "The bank said eight of the nine members of its rate-setting panel backed the reduction \u2014 the second in three months \u2014 while one opted to keep borrowing costs on hold. The latest cut comes after inflation in the U.K. fell to an annual rate of 1.7%, its lowest level since April 2021.",
      "Though inflation has fallen below the bank's target of 2%, Governor Andrew Bailey cautioned that interest rates would not be falling too fast over coming months, partly because last week's budget measures from the new Labour government would likely see prices rise by more than they would otherwise have done.",
      "\u201cWe need to make sure inflation stays close to target, so we can\u2019t cut interest rates too quickly or by too much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the economy evolves as we expect it\u2019s likely that interest rates will continue to fall gradually from here.\u201d",
      "He added that it's very unlikely that interest rates will fall to the very low levels that persisted in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008. During the coronavirus pandemic, which erupted in early 2020, interest rates around the world fell to zero, or just above zero in the case of the Bank of England.",
      "Central banks worldwide dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues built up and then because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have recently fallen from multi-decade highs, the central banks have started cutting interest rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve is also expected to cut interest rates later Thursday.",
      "Economists have warned that worries about the future path of prices following last week's tax-raising budget from the new Labour government and the economic impact of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may limit the number of cuts next year.",
      "\u201cEven though interest rates have further to fall, the upward pressure on inflation from the budget and growing global risks, including possible new U.S. tariffs, could mean that policy is loosened more modestly than many anticipated,\" said Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.",
      "The decision comes a week after Treasury chief Rachel Reeves announced around 70 billion pounds ($90 billion) of extra spending, funded through increased business taxes and borrowing. Economists think that the splurge, coupled with the prospect of businesses cushioning the tax hikes by raising prices, could lead to higher inflation next year.",
      "Rate-setters considered the budget measures during their deliberations and concluded they would likely boost growth by 0.75 percentage points and inflation by 0.5 percentage points over the coming year.",
      "The rate decision also comes a day after Trump was declared the winner of the U.S. presidential election. He has indicated that he will cut taxes and introduce tariffs on certain imported goods when he returns to the White House in January. Both policies have the potential to be inflationary both in the U.S. and globally, thereby prompting Bank of England policymakers to keep interest rates higher than initially planned.",
      "Bailey said it was \u201cnot useful or wise to enter into speculation\u201d about what policies might be introduced by the incoming Trump administration and that the Bank of England only factors in policies that have already been announced when it compiles its economic projections."

      "\u201cThe government is not blocking Canadians\u2019 access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" Champagne said.",

      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada\u2019s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners.",

      "TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",
      "TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips.",
      "Canada previously banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. TikTok has two offices in Canada, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver.",
      "Michael Geist, Canada research chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in a blog post that \"banning the company rather than the app may actually make matters worse since the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.\u201d",
      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said \u201cthe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned\u201d by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.",
      "Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China\u2019s government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked.",
      "Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It\u2019s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell."

      "JERUSALEM -- Armed Israeli police forced their way into a French-owned church compound in the contested city of Jerusalem on Thursday, the French foreign ministry said, briefly detaining two consulate employees and prompting the top French diplomat to abandon his planned visit to the site.",
      "The unusual incident threatened to further strain relations between Israel and France weeks after French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s call for an arms embargo on Israel prompted backlash from right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "The French Foreign Ministry said it would summon the Israeli ambassador in protest in the coming days.",
      "A strongly worded statement from France said Israeli security forces had intruded on the courtyard of the Church of the Pater Noster, angering French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot and prompting him to abandon his scheduled visit there.",
      "The ministry said Israeli police detained two staff members of the French Consulate in Jerusalem despite their diplomatic status, adding that the employees were released only after Barrot intervened.",
      "\u201cThis attack on the integrity of a domain placed under the responsibility of France is likely to weaken the bonds I have, in fact, come to cultivate with Israel at a time when we all need to make progress in the region on the road to peace,\u201d Barrot told reporters in Jerusalem.",
      "Barrot was meeting with Israeli officials Thursday in the city, where he pleaded for a cease-fire to stop the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and called for a diplomatic solution in Lebanon \u2014 a former French protectorate that Israel invaded last month in its broadening military campaign against the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group.",
      "\u201cThese actions are unacceptable,\u201d the French Foreign Ministry statement said of Thursday's fracas between Israeli security forces and French diplomatic staffers. \u201cFrance condemns (these actions) all the more vigorously as they come at a time when it is doing everything it can to work towards de-escalating the violence in the region.\u201d",
      "Israeli police portrayed the controversy as a misunderstanding, saying that two church workers who declined to identify themselves had refused entry to Israeli security guards accompanying Minister Barrot on his church visit.",
      "Israeli police said they held the men for some 20 minutes and released them once they were identified as employees of the French Consulate in Jerusalem, which is the protector of French religious communities and four holy sites in the city.",
      "The Israeli police said all foreign ministers on official visits to Israel are assigned Israeli security guards for their trips. It said the logistics of Barrot's visit were worked out beforehand with the French Embassy in Israel, warning the public against contributing to \u201cmisleading narratives\" about the altercation.",
      "The compound that Barrot had planned to visit \u2014 on the Mount of Olives overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem \u2014 holds a church originally built by Crusaders that believed the site to be where Jesus taught the Pater Noster, or Lord\u2019s Prayer.",
      "It was later acquired by Princess H\u00e9lo\u00efse de la Tour d\u2019Auvergne, who had the prayer written in calligraphy in numerous languages on the walls of the cloisters and courtyard, also home to the the ruins of the Byzantine Eleona Church. The site was entrusted to French Carmelite nuns in 1874.",
      "\u201cThis domain is not only one that has belonged to France for over 150 years,\u201d Barrot said. \u201cIt's one where France has ensured security and maintenance with enormous care.\u201d",
      "Thursday's incident was reminiscent of several others skirmishes over the years between irritated French officials and assertive Israeli bodyguards.",
      "In 2020, President Macron lost his temper at Israeli security officers who had insisted on accompanying him inside another French church in Jerusalem.",
      "In 1996, then-French President Jacques Chirac accused Israeli security forces of pushing and shoving his entourage in a spat that even drew an apology from a young Prime Minister Netanyahu during his first year in office.",
      "Such stand-offs take on symbolic significance in Jerusalem, among the most fiercely contested swaths of real estate on earth.",
      "Israel has viewed Jerusalem as its \u201cunified, eternal\u201d capital since capturing east Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians want those territories for their future state, with east Jerusalem serving as their eventual capital. Israel annexed the eastern part of the city in a move not recognized internationally.",
      "Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel more than a year ago, President Macron has stressed his support of Israel and its right to defend itself. But tensions have escalated in recent weeks as Macron has demanded that Israel do more to avoid the rapidly mounting civilian casualties in its campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "Later Thursday, Minister Barrot held talks on the conflict with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank."

      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- It\u2019s Friday night in Downtown Santiago, the capital of Chile, and a group of 15 people gather around a table, sharing a bottle of wine as the smell of tobacco and incense fill the air. Black candles burn on top of an altar decorated with chalices and knives. The members of the Temple of Satan are about to start a ritual.",
      "Five years after the Satanic Temple of the United States made headlines \u2014 and unleashed a wave of panic \u2014 when it was designated a church, a similar organization in Chile, a conservative country where\u202fhalf of its population of 18 million identifies as Catholic, is asking the government to recognize them legally as a religious association.",
      "Scholars, believers and residents consulted by The Associated Press note that Chile, where a long-lasting tradition of Catholicism has played a leading role in public discussions, is experiencing a crisis of faith, following revelations of multiple sexual abuse scandals within the Catholic church over the years.",
      "\u201cThese types of organizations now feel that they have greater support to challenge what was virtually impossible before,\u201d said Luis Bahamondes, a professor at the Center for Judaic Studies at the University of Chile. And that\u2019s because, \u201cuntil very recently, the Catholic Church enjoyed an unprecedented power. It had an opinion on everything: politics, economics, geopolitics, sexuality and education.\u201d",
      "Despite its name, The Temple of Satan: Satanists and Luciferians of Chile does not embark on sacrifices nor asks its congregants to worship the devil. Among its 100 members are people who work as publicists, firefighters, police officers, lawyers and psychologists, who have found in the organization a way to defy moral norms, dogmas and religious impositions.",
      "While they embrace the term Satanist, they don\u2019t revere or believe in Satan. Instead, they worship rationality, individualism, pleasure and the mundane life.",
      "Rather than gods, they praise humankind.",
      "\u201cYou are the owner of your present and future, there is no God that makes decisions for you,\u201d said Haborym, a spokesperson for the group, during a walk through tombs and mausoleums at the General Cemetery of Santiago. He notes that the figure of Satan is purely symbolic and their rituals are performed \u201cto bring out the emotions and leave the intellect aside.\u201d",
      "Haborym and other members of the Temple of Satan in Chile spoke on condition their real names not be used, particularly with many hold public-facing jobs, citing growing threats.",
      "While Hollywood movies like \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d and TV series such as \u201cTrue Detective\u201d helped to portray the idea of Satanists as linked to sacrifice, evil, pain and death, modern groups like Chile\u2019s Temple of Satan are strongly against animal abuse, prohibit the affiliation of people with criminal records, see pleasures as a delight rather than a sin, and do not express their opinions unless asked.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want people killing in the name of Satan,\u201d said Haborym.",
      "In order to join Chile\u2019s Temple of Satan, applicants are requested to go through a lengthy process that includes filling out a form, showing proof of not having a criminal record, being interviewed by a special commission and, finally, being evaluated by a psychologist.",
      "Once they are accepted, members can choose a new name \u2014 normally that of a demon or fallen angel \u2014 with which they will be identified inside the Temple and among other associates.",
      "Founded in 2021, Chile\u2019s Temple of Satan has 100 members, and more than 400 people applied to join in the past few weeks, said Haborym. The interest spiked at the end of July, when the group formally requested the country\u2019s Ministry of Justice to legally recognize it as a religious association.",
      "A media frenzy followed, unleashing a heated debate and causing a stir among Chile\u2019s main religious denominations.",
      "\u201cThe history of Satanism is well known (and) it has often been the cause of tragedies,\u201d the leaders of several churches in Chile, including the Catholic, Anglican, Jewish and Evangelical, said in a joint statement.",
      "Following the steps of the Church of Satan founded in 1966 by Anton Szandor LaVey, modern Satanists praise skepticism and logic over celestial or supernatural beings. Its followers are free to formulate their own beliefs, rites and spiritual practices.",
      "Many self-described Satanists and Luciferians are atheists, others are witches or believe in the power of magic.",
      "\u201cWe do accept that there are certain bases, both academic and esoteric, that give meaning to our existence and reality,\u201d said Azazel, who quit Judaism four years ago and, one year later, founded the Temple of Satan of Chile.",
      "His words resonate in the darkness of the chamber and are interspersed with chants, clapping, mantras and readings of passages from the Satanic Bible and the Bible of the Adversary, the main guidelines of the group.",
      "Just like Azazel, others have turned to the Temple of Satan out of disappointment with traditional religions. The new congregants include not only occultists and esotericists, but also Catholics, Jews, Protestants and Evangelicals.",
      "\u201cIn Satanism there are no solutions or absolute truths. You are your own god and you create your own reality,\u201d said Kali Ma, a dentistry student who was born and raised in a Jehovah\u2019s Witness family. \u201cIf we compare both, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are the real sect,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t let you do certain things, they tell you how to dress, what to do, how to behave, whether or not to grow a beard.\u201d",
      "N\u00e9stor da Costa, an expert in secularism and religion at the Catholic University of Uruguay, said the influx of people seeking answers through different perspectives might be linked to the search for less dogmatic approaches.",
      "\u201cIt may be a readjustment of the religious side of people who leave Catholicism but continue to believe in something,\u201d he said.",
      "It is unclear if the Chilean government will legally recognize the Temple of Satan as a legitimate religious association, but its very existence has already helped to spark a discussion that until recently was unthinkable in this conservative society.",
      "Demanding recognition is the ultimate expression of everything praised by Satanic aesthetics: the rebellion against the status quo and the breakup with deep-rooted traditions.",
      "\u201cWe comply with everything that is requested of us as a religious entity,\u201d says Haborym. \u201cSo there would be no reason to reject us beyond the fact that we\u2019re a controversial figure.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Israeli residents of a settlement named after Donald Trump hope his return to office will breathe new life into their tiny community in the Golan Heights",
      "RAMAT TRUMP, Golan Heights -- Israeli residents of \u201cTrump Heights\u201d are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights.",
      "During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognize Israel\u2019s control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him.",
      "But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialized after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or \u201cRamat Trump\u201d in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel\u2019s more than yearlong war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation.",
      "Trump\u2019s election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements.",
      "\u201cMaybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,\u201d said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights\u2019 community manager.",
      "Ori Kallner, head of the Golan\u2019s regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,\u201d he said.",
      "Kallner stood next to a metal statue of an eagle and a menorah, symbolizing the United States and Israel, as Israeli warplanes flew overhead. Two explosions from rockets fired from Lebanon punched the hills nearby, and just across the border in Lebanon, plumes of smoke rose into the air from Israeli airstrikes.",
      "An enormous sign with the settlement\u2019s name in Hebrew and English gleamed in the sun, while two large sunbaked metal flags of Israel and the United States were faded almost beyond recognition.",
      "Surrounded by ashen ruins of villages fled by Syrians in the 1967 war, the town is perched above the Hula Valley, where Israel has amassed tanks, artillery and troops for its fight in Lebanon. Most towns in the valley have been evacuated. Trump Heights sends its kids to a makeshift daycare in a nearby settlement after the government shuttered all schools in the region in the wake of the Oct. 1 invasion of Lebanon.",
      "\u201cWe find ourselves hanging by our fingernails to be in our own community, not be evacuated, and on the other hand, we cannot work, we cannot send our kids to any kind of an education system,\u201d said Freimann.",
      "Trump Heights is only about 7 miles (12 kilometers) from Lebanon and Syria. Alerts for incoming fire gives residents about 30 seconds' head start to get to a bomb shelter.",
      "Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognized.",
      "That changed in March 2019 when Trump, without notice, tweeted that the U.S. would \u201cfully recognize\u201d Israel\u2019s control of the territory. His announcement drew widespread condemnation from the international community, which considers the Golan to be occupied Syrian territory and Israel\u2019s settlements to be illegal. The Biden administration left the decision intact, but the U.S. remains the lone country to recognize the Israeli annexation.",
      "Kallner said he hopes Trump will now persuade European countries to recognize Israeli sovereignty there.",
      "According to Israeli figures, the Golan is home to about 50,000 people \u2014 roughly half of them Jewish Israelis and the other half Arab Druze, many of whom still consider themselves Syrians under occupation.",
      "Israel has encouraged and promoted settlements in the Golan, and the Druze residents operate farms and a tourism and restaurant sector popular with Israelis. But the area has struggled to develop because of its remoteness, several hours from Israel\u2019s economic center in Tel Aviv.",
      "That economic hardship has only worsened during the war as the hospitality sector cratered. On July 28, a rocket killed 12 Druze children on a soccer field in the city of Majdal Shams, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) away. Israel invaded Lebanon months later.",
      "In June 2019, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led an inauguration ceremony for Trump Heights. The U.S. ambassador at the time, David Friedman, noted that the ceremony came days after Trump\u2019s birthday and said: \u201cI can\u2019t think of a more appropriate and a more beautiful birthday present.\u201d",
      "The Golan recognition was among a series of diplomatic gifts that Trump delivered to Israel during his first term. They included recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and moving the American embassy to the contested city, and a series of diplomatic agreements with Arab countries known as the Abraham Accords.",
      "He has vowed to bring peace to the tumultuous region during his second term, but has not said how.",
      "Netanyahu enjoyed a close relationship with Trump during his first term but ran afoul of the former president when he congratulated Joe Biden on his 2020 victory. The Israeli prime minister announced Tuesday that he was one of the first foreign leaders to call the president-elect and congratulate him on his victory. An official in his office, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal communications, said aides were upbeat and giddy.",
      "\u201cCongratulations on history\u2019s greatest comeback!\u201d the Israeli leader said in a statement. \u201cYour historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America.\u201d",
      "At Trump Heights, Kallner was optimistic too: \u201cThe Golan community is strong and resilient, and people that want to come and live here are from the same material. I believe we will overcome these challenging times and won\u2019t stop growing.\u201d"

      "Two suspected militants and two members of a government-sponsored militia have been killed in two separate incidents in Indian-controlled Kashmir",
      "NEW DELHI -- Two suspected militants were killed in a gunfight with government forces in Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials said Friday, while assailants killed two members of a government-sponsored militia elsewhere in the disputed region.",
      "The region, divided between India and Pakistan but claimed by both in its entirety, has experienced an increase in violence in recent months.",
      "The Indian military said a joint team of soldiers and police raided a village near northwestern Sopore town late Thursday following a tip about the presence of a group of militants.",
      "The militants \u201cfired indiscriminately\u201d at the troops, leading to a gunbattle in which two were killed, the military said in a statement.",
      "Troops were continuing to search the area, it said. There was no independent confirmation of the incident.",
      "Meanwhile, assailants killed two members of a government-run militia called the \u201cVillage Defense Group\u201d in the remote southern Kishtwar area late Thursday, officials said.",
      "Police blamed rebels fighting against Indian rule in Kashmir for the killings.",
      "The two, one of them a Hindu and another Muslim, were abducted from a forested area where they had gone to graze cattle on Thursday.",
      "On Friday, hundreds of people at several places in Kishtwar and Jammu district took to the streets in protest at the killings, demanding the authorities arrest the culprits. Kishtwar also observed a shutdown on the instruction of a Hindu group, the Sanatan Dharam Sabha.",
      "The Village Defense Group was initially formed in the 1990s to protect remote Himalayan villages against anti-India insurgents when government forces could not reach them quickly. As the insurgency waned in their areas and as some militia members gained notoriety for brutality and rights violations, the militia was largely disbanded.",
      "However last year, after the killing of seven Hindus in two attacks in a remote mountainous village near the highly militarized Line of Control that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan, authorities revived the militia and began rearming and training thousands of villagers, including some teenagers.",
      "The Kashmir Tigers, which Indian officials say is an offshoot of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad militant group, claimed responsibility for the killings of the two in a statement on social media. The insurgent group also released photos of the two bloodied bodies.",
      "The statement could not be independently verified.",
      "Chief Minister Omar Abdullah condemned the attack. \u201cI expect the security forces to move quickly to plug any gaps in our counter-terror grid & ensure that attacks like this stop completely,\u201d he wrote on social medial platform X.",
      "Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi\u2019s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels\u2019 goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country.",
      "India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict."

    "story": [
      "A new study says private jet carbon pollution soared 46% from 2019 to 2023",
      "Carbon pollution from private jets has soared in the past five years, with most of those small planes spewing more heat-trapping carbon dioxide in about two hours of flying than the average person does in about a year, a new study finds.",
      "About a quarter million of the super wealthy \u2014 worth a total of $31 trillion \u2014 last year emitted 17.2 million tons (15.6 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide flying in private jets, according to Thursday's study in the Nature journal Communications Earth & Environment. That's about the same amount as the 67 million people who live in Tanzania,",
      "Private jet emissions jumped 46% from 2019 to 2023, according to the European research team that calculated those figures by examining more than 18.6 million flights of about 26,000 airplanes over five years.",
      "Only 1.8% of the carbon pollution from aviation is spewed by private jets and aviation as a whole is responsible for about 4% of the human-caused heat-trapping gases, the study said.",
      "It may seem like a small amount, but it's a matter of fairness and priorities, said the study's lead author, Stefan Gossling, a transportation researcher at the business school of Sweden's Linnaeus University.",
      "\u201cThe damage is done by those with a lot of money and the cost is borne by those with very little money,\" Gossling said.",
      "The highest emitting private jet user that the team tracked \u2014 but did not identify by name \u2014 spewed 2,645 tons (2,400 metric tons) of carbon dioxide in plane use, Gossling said. That's more than 500 times the global per person average of either 5.2 tons (4.7 metric tons) that the World Bank calculates or the 4.7 tons (4.3 metric tons) that the International Energy Agency figures and Gossling cites.",
      "\u201cThis report presents further proof that billionaires are causing the climate crisis,\u201d said Jonathan Westin, executive director of the advocacy organization Climate Organizing Hub. \u201cThey are clinging to their private jets and oil profits while regular people see increasing floods, hurricanes and wildfires.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year the International Energy Agency calculated that the world's top 1% of super-emitting people had carbon footprints more than 1,000 times bigger than the globe's poorest 1%.",
      "Gossling's study counted more than 35,600 tons (32,300 metric tons) of carbon pollution from just five global events \u2014 2022\u2019s World Cup in Qatar, 2023\u2019s World Economic Forum, 2023\u2019s Super Bowl, the 2023 Cannes film festival and the 2023 United Nations climate negotiations in Dubai. That came from 3,500 private jet flights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a grim joke that the billionaire class is flying private jets to the annual climate conferences, and the United Nations should crack down on this hypocritical practice,\u201d said Jean Su, energy justice director for the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "Researchers also examined more than 1,200 flights by celebrity actors, singers and directors, but Gossling declined to give the public figures\u2019 names.",
      "Many private flights aren't even for business \u201cnor are they necessary,\u201d Gossling said. \u201cThey are very often lifestyle related.\u201d",
      "While the study \u201cdoes shine a bright light on some of the most gluttonous emitters, i.e. the very wealthy,\u201d University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann said the focus shouldn't be on individual behaviors and someone's carbon footprint. He called that \u201ca distraction from the primary task at hand, which is decarbonizing our societal infrastructure through systematic change and policy.\u201d",
      "That's the problem, Gossling said.",
      "\u201cWe have been told for a long time that it is the system that needs to change, not the individual,\u201d Gossling said. \u201cThat has meant that nobody has been responsible for their lifestyles.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe problem is that the 26,000 aircraft and the individuals using them will say \u2018We are just a small group. We are not relevant in terms of emissions.\u2019 But everybody else will look at the small group and say, 'Look these are the super-emitters, if they are not relevant, how can we be relevant?\u201d Gossling said. \u201cAnd then you have this pointing at each other of two different groups that locks us in a circular argument.\u201d",
      "About 51% of those private jets burn at least 239 gallons of fuel per hour. That's translates to more carbon emissions in two hours and one minute than the IEA's estimate of the average person's yearly 4.7 tons (4.3 metric tons) of pollutants, the study calculated.",
      "\u201cGiven that technology is not going to resolve (climate change), I think the answer is clear. We need to start at the top,\u201d Gossling said.",
      "Gossling said the way to address the high-flying emissions is to charge a tax or landing fee equivalent to the damage done by each ton of emissions. That's about $200 or 200 euros. Westin called for a private jet ban.",
      "The United States is by far the hub of private jets with more than 68% of the globe's private aircraft, about 5 per 100,000 people, the study found. But Gossling said private jets are everywhere, even in poor countries.",
      "In the United States, Alaska has the most private jet flights per person, at nearly 5,000 per 100,000 residents, according to a different study by the student travel company Rustic Pathways.",

      "When mortgage rates increase they can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, reducing homebuyers\u2019 purchasing power at a time when home prices remain near all-time highs, even though the housing market remains in a sales slump going back to 2022.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds, which lenders use as a guide to price home loans. Bond yields have been rising following encouraging reports on inflation and the economy.",

      "China has announced a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt in the latest push to rev up growth in the world's second largest economy",
      "BEIJING -- China on Friday approved a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt, in the latest push to rev up growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy.",
      "The plan will be implemented over the next three years, Xu Hongcai, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress's financial and economic committee, said at a news conference Friday.",
      "Finance minister Lan Fo'an estimated that the hidden debt of local governments was 14.3 trillion yuan ($2 trillion) at the end of 2023. Hidden debt refers to debt that has not been disclosed publicly.",
      "Lan said 2 trillion yuan would be allocated each year from 2024 to 2026 to help local governments resolve their debts. He estimated that the amount of hidden debt will drop to 2.3 trillion yuan ($320.9 billion) by the end of 2028.",
      "Officials also said Friday that the ceiling to issue special bonds will be raised to 35.52 trillion yuan ($4.96 billion) from 29.52 trillion yuan ($4.12 billion) for local governments.",
      "Lan said that the implementation of such a large-scale replacement measure indicates a \u201cfundamental shift\u201d in China's approach to debt restructuring and said that China\u2019s government debt risk was \u201ccontrollable.\u201d",
      "Analysts have called for bold, multi-trillion-yuan measures to reinvigorate the world's second largest economy, which has yet to bounce back fully from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Local government debts have ballooned partly due to high spending and low tax revenues during the pandemic, but also due to a downturn in the property industry, since sales of land use rights, a key source of local government revenue, have sagged.",
      "The central bank loosened restrictions on borrowing in late September, sparking a stock market rally, but economists say the government needs to do more to ignite a sustained recovery. Government officials have indicated that could come at this week's meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which must give official approval to any new spending.",
      "The economy has shown signs of life in the past two months. Purchase subsidies offered to people who trade in old cars or appliances for new ones helped auto sales rebound in September. A survey of manufacturers turned positive in October after five straight months of decline, and exports surged 12.7% last month, the largest increase in more than two years.",
      "For most of the year, the ruling Communist Party appeared more focused on addressing long-term structural issues with the economy rather than short-term ones. Previous steps to boost the economy were piecemeal, seemingly aimed at keeping the economy afloat rather than sparking a robust recovery.",
      "In recent weeks, the party has signaled a growing concern about the economy's sluggishness as it tries to meet its goal of achieving growth of around 5% this year. The central bank's monetary easing was followed by government pronouncements that it still has ample funds to pump into the economy.",
      "Still, the longer-term goals of transforming China into a high-tech and green energy economy seem likely to remain the chief aims of the Communist Party, which doesn't face election pressures like the ones that toppled the Democrats and swept Donald Trump's Republicans to power in America this week.",

      "Sales of the Gladiator, the pickup truck version of the Jeep Wrangler SUV, are down nearly 21% so far this year to 36,519, according to Motorintelligence.com.",
      "\u201cThese are difficult actions to take, but they are necessary to enable the company to regain its competitive edge and eventually return production to prior levels,\u201d Stellantis said.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 08:10:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Maine is testing the legal limits of restrictions on so-called super PACs",
    "story": [
      "Maine is testing the legal limits of restrictions on so-called super PACs",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- Maine residents this week overwhelmingly approved a referendum to limit donations to political action committees that spend independently in candidate elections, setting the stage for a legal showdown over caps on individual contributions to so-called super PACs that spend freely in elections.",
      "In the nation's only campaign finance reform initiative on the ballot on Election Day, residents voted to cap individual donations to super PACs at $5,000. Supporters fully expect a lawsuit that they hope will bring clarity to PAC donations after the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to unlimited spending by super PACs.",
      "The measure was carefully crafted to survive legal challenges as states try to find a way to regulate campaign spending after the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, said state Sen. Rick Bennett, a supporter of the proposal.",
      "\"We\u2019ve become a place where our democracy is being bought and sold by the richest people in our country,\" said Bennett, a Republican from Oxford. \u201cPeople of all political stripes support this measure. The only people who really oppose this are the monied interests who abuse the system.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court opened the floodgates for big business and labor unions to spend freely on elections in the Citizens United decision, and a Court of Appeals decision three months later lifted limits on individual spending.",
      "The Maine initiative doesn't attempt to limit independent spending on behalf of candidates. It focuses instead on limits on individual donations to super PACS, an area the Supreme Court has not ruled on, observers say.",
      "Cara McCormick, leader of Citizens to End Super PACs in Maine, said the goal is to reduce the outsized influence that super PACs currently enjoy through so-called \u201cdark money\u201d spending.",
      "Political nonprofit groups are not required to disclose their donors and do not have to reveal much about how they spend the donations they receive. A super PAC may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to campaign independently for candidates for federal office. Its activities must be reported to the Federal Elections Commission but is not otherwise regulated if not coordinated with the candidate or campaign.",
      "\u201cWe have the right to stand up to the big money in politics in Maine. We\u2019re asserting our right to limit the amount of money that someone can give to a super PAC to eliminate not only corruption in our politics but the appearance of corruption in our politics. We think that\u2019s something worth fighting for,\u201d McCormick said.",
      "In Maine, the limit would only apply to PACs spending money on behalf of candidates, not ballot committees involved in referendums. Maine law currently limits contributions to candidates, not PACs. For general elections, individuals can contribute a maximum of $1,950 to a gubernatorial candidate and $475 to a legislative candidate.",
      "Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, a longtime advocate for campaign finance reform, and his Equal Citizens nonprofit backed the Maine referendum. A similar citizen initiative effort in Massachusetts was blocked by the attorney general on constitutional concerns.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue of individual contributions to PACs, and long-established case law supports the notion that states can limit individual contributions to PACs despite a decision to the contrary by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Lessig said.",
      "The concern with unlimited individual contributions is the risk of a quid pro quo even when super PACs are spending independently and not coordinating directly with a candidate, Lessig said.",
      "The matter will ultimately have to be decided by the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very optimistic that the U.S. Supreme Court will apply existing jurisprudence that states are free to limit contributions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue that this case would raise is not asking the Supreme Court to change its jurisprudence, not asking them to overturn Citizens United.\u201d",
      "The Maine law goes into effect this winter, if there is no legal challenge, after an emphatic vote. Nearly 75% of voters supported the citizen initiative."

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Recent efforts to smooth the frequently volatile ties between neighbors and regional rivals Greece and Turkey are bearing fruit, their foreign ministers said Friday, although significant differences remain between the two countries as they seek ways to prevent spats from escalating dangerously.",
      "Despite both being members of NATO, Greece and Turkey have been at loggerheads for decades over a long series of issues, including complex maritime boundary disputes that led them to the brink of war in 1987 and in 1996. In 2020, tension over drilling rights led to Greek and Turkish warships shadowing each other in the eastern Mediterranean.",
      "Over the past 16 months, the two sides have made concerted efforts to reduce tensions, with the Greek and Turkish leaders meeting six times. Last December, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation deals during a meeting in Athens between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.",
      "\u201cI am not claiming that through the dialogue we have developed, all the problems in the two countries' relations have been magically resolved,\u201d Greek Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis said in statements to the media after a meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, in Athens. The ministers didn't take any questions.",
      "\u201cThere were indeed difficult moments during the past year,\u201d Gerapetritis said. \u201cBut in all cases, there was an immediate and honest channel that prevented escalation.\u201d",
      "With two brutal conflicts raging in the wider region, in Ukraine and in the Middle East, mending ties and preventing flare-ups in tension between the two neighbors has become all the more essential.",
      "\"We are working to understand each other better on critical issues. The region we are in has many problems,\" Fidan said. \"Turkey and Greece need to be able to act with mutual trust in this difficult geography. Through a win-win approach, we can contribute to the prosperity and peace of our people.\u201d",
      "Despite the positive climate, the two sides remain far apart on some of the thornier issues, notably on territorial rights in the Aegean Sea. The two disagree on the delineation of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone, which determines exploitation rights for resources, as well as on the extent of territorial waters.",
      "Turkey has said that any move by Greece to extend its territorial waters around its islands in the Aegean Sea from six nautical miles to 12 nautical miles, which Greece insists it has the right to do at any time, would be a cause for war.",
      "Turkey also doesn\u2019t recognize that Greek islands off its borders have a continental shelf, while Greece insists that position is in contravention of international law.",
      "Athens insists the issue of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone is the only dispute it has with Turkey and is willing to bring it to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.",
      "Friday\u2019s talks \u201cincluded the evaluation of the conditions for the start of a fundamental discussion for the delineation of the continental shelf and the Exclusive Economic Zone in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean,\u201d Gerapetritis said. \u201cIt is an initial, honest approach of a difficult but also crucial issue.\u201d",
      "Fidan stressed that all areas of disagreement connected to the Aegean, the sea that lies between the two countries, must be tackled.",
      "\u201cThere are many problems that are interconnected in the Aegean. These disputes cannot be reduced to the issues of the continent shelf and exclusive economic zones,\" Fidan said. \"We must address all issues that have the potential to create tensions and crises on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs Turkey, we continue to defend the principle of equitable sharing in the eastern Mediterranean,\u201d he added.",
      "Migration has been a source of tension between the two countries for years. Tens of thousands of people make their way each year from Turkey to nearby Greek islands, using European Union-member Greece as a gateway to more prosperous countries in the 27-nation bloc.",
      "While thousands of migrants continue to arrive in Greece, risking sometimes fatal sea crossings, the two ministers stressed the need to crack down on illegal migration and smuggling networks.",
      "The two \u201cemphasized the importance of acting together to combat irregular migration,\u201d Fidan said.",

      "The S&P 500 was 0.6% higher in afternoon trading and on track for its biggest weekly gain since early November 2023. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 318 points, or 0.7%, as of 2:04 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.2%.",
      "The relatively moderate trading followed big gains and more records for indexes earlier in the week after Donald Trump won the presidential election and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates again to make things easier for the economy.",
      "Axon Enterprise, which sells Tasers and body cameras used by police officers, helped lead the market. It jumped 27.7% after delivering stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also raised its revenue forecast for the full year to $2.07 billion, which would mean 32% growth.",
      "Expedia Group rose 5% after likewise topping profit expectations. It said booked room nights rose 9% from a year earlier.",
      "Helping to keep the market in check was Airbnb, which sank 8% after the online vacation rental platform posted a mixed third-quarter earnings report and issued forecasts for the fourth quarter that disappointed investors.",
      "Digital pinboard and shopping site Pinterest slid 16.1% after the company\u2019s revenue guidance came in lower than investors expected, even as it easily beat Wall Street\u2019s sales and profit targets.",
      "In the bond market, longer-term Treasury yields eased.",
      "A preliminary report in the morning suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers rose for a fourth straight month to its highest level in six months. The survey from the University of Michigan, which was conducted before Tuesday's election, also said expectations for inflation in the coming year eased to the lowest level since 2020.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.30% from 4.33% late Thursday. But it\u2019s still well above where it was in mid-September, when it was close to 3.60%.",
      "Treasury yields climbed in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it\u2019s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target.",
      "Some of the rise in yields has also been because of Trump. He talks up tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation and the U.S. government\u2019s debt higher, along with the economy\u2019s growth.",
      "Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many cuts to rates the Fed will deliver next year because of that. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel.",
      "In stock markets abroad, Trump\u2019s talk about tariffs has raised worries about possible trade tensions and disruptions to the global economy.",
      "European indexes were mostly lower and on track for a losing week.",
      "Markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai fell as investors awaited much-anticipated steps by Beijing to rev up the slowing Chinese economy following a meeting of the legislature\u2019s Standing Committee. Officials announced a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion), three-year plan to help local governments refinance their many trillions of debt that has ballooned during the COVID-19 pandemic and a collapse of the property market.",
      "Financial markets worldwide have swung sharply as investors lay bets on what Trump's plans for higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation  could mean for the global economy. But many professional investors have also urged caution, saying snaps back in prices could occur as it becomes more clear what proposals will become policy versus just negotiating starting points.",
      "U.S. banks and the stocks of more domestically focused companies have seen some of the wildest moves, as some of the poster children of the \u201cTrump trade.\u201d The stock that\u2019s become most synonymous with the president-elect, Trump Media & Technology Group, rose 15.3% Thursday and is on track for a gain this week.",

      "Amazon workers in Alabama will have the opportunity decide whether to unionize for the third time in three years",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Amazon workers in Alabama will decide for the third time in three years whether to unionize after a federal judge ruled that the retail giant improperly influenced the most recent vote in which employees rejected a union.",
      "Administrative law judge Michael Silverstein on Tuesday ordered the third vote for Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Birmingham, after determining that Amazon committed six violations leading up to the second election in March 2022.",
      "Amazon managers surveilled employees' union activities and threatened workers with plant closure if they voted with the union, Silverstein said in an 87-page decision. Amazon managers also removed pro-union materials from areas where anti-union materials were available, the judge determined.",
      "The National Labor Relations Board also found improper interference in the first election in 2021, leading to the redo in 2022.",
      "Silverstein\u2019s decision comes after months of testimony and is the latest development in a nationwide legal battle involving Amazon, the National Labor Relations Board and unions spearheading unionization efforts. Some states, like California, have fined the mega retailer for labor violations.",
      "Both Amazon and the union that organized the vote in Bessemer said that they would appeal the judge's order.",
      "The president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, Stuart Appelbaum, affirmed the court's findings that Amazon broke labor laws.",
      "But he also said that he believed Amazon was likely to commit similar violations in a third election if the court did not order \u201csignificant and meaningful remedies\u201d to protect the vote.",
      "Specifically, the union requested access to private meetings between Amazon representatives and workers, as well as training for Amazon supervisors on labor laws. The judge declined those requests.",
      "\u201cThe record reveals that there are over a hundred managers at BHM1, but my findings of unfair labor practices are limited to four managers, who each committed isolated unfair labor practice,\u201d the judge ruled, referring to the Bessemer facility.",
      "Appelbaum said that the union would appeal that decision.",
      "\u201cAmazon must be held accountable, and we\u2019ll be filing accordingly,\u201d Appelbaum said.",
      "Mary Kate Paradis, a spokesperson for Amazon, said the company vehemently disagreed with the court\u2019s ruling and indicated that there would be an appeal.",
      "\u201cOur team at BHM1 has already made their choice clear, twice that they don\u2019t want a Union. This decision is wrong on the facts and the law,\u201d Paradis said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that the NLRB and RWDSU keep trying to force a third vote instead of accepting the facts and the will of our team members.\u201d",
      "With approximately 6,000 employees, Bessemer in 2021 became the largest U.S. facility to vote on unionization in Amazon's over 20-year history. Since then, similar battles have ensued at Amazon facilities across the country.",
      "Workers in Staten Island, New York, successfully voted to unionize in 2022, becoming the first Amazon union in the U.S. But the union has yet to begin bargaining with Amazon amidst legal challenges from the country's second largest employer.",
      "The bid to unionize in Bessemer in particular was always viewed as an uphill battle: Alabama is one of 27 \u201cright-to-work\u201d states where workers don\u2019t have to pay dues to unions that represent them.",
      "Amazon\u2019s sprawling fulfillment center in Bessemer opened in 2020, right as the COVID-19 pandemic began. The city is more than 70% Black, with about a quarter of its residents living in poverty, according to the United States Census.",
      "A vote will likely be delayed until after the court hears anticipated appeals from both parties.",

    "story": [
      "The collapse of Germany\u2019s governing coalition and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s imminent return to the White House are creating new risks for the European Union's biggest economy",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 The collapse of Germany's governing coalition and President-elect Donald Trump's imminent return to the White House are creating new risks for the European Union's biggest economy, already in a troubling decline.",
      "Germany's economy has been shrinking for the past two years in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, war in Ukraine and competition from China. Amid both structural problems at home and global challenges, Chancellor Olaf Scholz's fractious three-party coalition failed to find a way forward on some key issues.",
      "The situation came to a head Wednesday night when Scholz announced he was firing Finance Minister Christian Lindner. The move effectively meant the collapse of the chancellor's coalition, which relied on Lindner\u2019s pro-business Free Democratic Party, and left the government bereft of a parliamentary majority.",
      "The coalition's breakdown followed weeks of internal disputes over how to boost Germany's ailing economy.",
      "Scholz said he planned to seek a vote of confidence in parliament on Jan. 15, a move that could lead to an early election by the end of March if he loses. Germany's next regularly scheduled election is not until September. In the meantime, he said he would reach out to opposition leader Friedrich Merz of the center-right Christian Democrats to discuss ideas for strengthening the country's economy and defense.",
      "But business leaders called Thursday for Scholz to act much more quickly to produce a stable government that is poised to tackle the crisis.",
      "\u201cEvery additional day with this federal government is a lost day. We demand new elections as soon as possible,\u201d said Dirk Jandura, president of the German wholesale lobby BGA. \u201cGermany needs an economic turnaround. We have to turn the tide before the waves get too high.\u201d",
      "The coalition's collapse came in the final hours of a day in which European leaders began to digest the certainty of another Trump presidency, which will have serious implications for European security and the economy.",
      "\u201cAt the European level, political instability in Germany is not good news,'' Antonio Villafranca, vice president of the Italian think tank ISPI, said, noting that a strong Franco-German alliance at the center of the European Union provided an important counterweight during Trump's first presidency.",
      "Trump has threatened a withdrawal of NATO commitments and a fundamental shift of support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. He has also threatened to slap tariffs of up to 20% on goods from the EU, (and even higher tariffs on goods from China), raising the prospect of a trade war with Washington's European allies.",
      "Tariffs would deal a sharp blow to German exports and serve another painful setback to an economy long powered by cheap and plentiful energy from Russia and large export markets.",
      "German industry still has not fully recovered from the shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then came Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which led Germany and other Western countries to cut themselves off from Russian gas and oil. Competition from China, including its electric vehicles, has meanwhile forced German and other and European carmakers to lower production and lay off workers.",
      "\u201cPolitical developments over the last 24 hours have further darkened the already bleak short-term outlook for the German economy,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at Dutch banking firm ING, said.",
      "\u201cA second term in office for Donald Trump in the U.S., with the expected new trade tensions, will hit the German economy, which has 10% of its exports going into the U.S.,\" Brzeski said in a note published Thursday. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t require a lot of imagination to see U.S. tariffs on European cars sending the German automotive industry into deeper problems.\u201d",
      "Other analysts say Trump\u2019s embrace of tariffs might actually benefit Germany\u2019s automobile industry, whose woes have been one of the reasons for the weakening economy. While Trump has threatened to impose new tariffs on European products, President Joe Biden already placed 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles vehicles, which are flooding the global market.",
      "\u201cTrump can save the German automotive sector\u201d by keeping the tariffs on Chinese EVs, said Daniel Gros, director of the Institute for European Policymaking at Milan\u2019s Bocconi University. \u201cThe United States is the only market in the world where German carmakers don\u2019t encounter much competition from China.\u201d",
      "Last month, Volkswagen said it planned to close at least three factories in Germany, the first domestic closures in its 87-year history.",
      "\"Some factories will have to close, but perhaps fewer,'' Gros said.",
      "Scholz's firing of the finance minister came after his center-left Social Democrats and the environmentalist, left-leaning Greens had discussed plans for massive state investments. The Free Democrats, however, rejected tax increases or changes to Germany\u2019s strict self-imposed limits on running up debt.",
      "Scholz accused Lindner of refusing to find common ground on economic issues, including by publicly calling for what the chancellor said would be tax cuts worth billions for a few top earners while at the same time cutting pensions for all recipients.",
      "\u201cThat is not decent, that is not fair,\u201d Scholz said.",
      "Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats, Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck\u2019s Greens and Lindner\u2019s Free Democrats, a party that in recent decades was mostly allied with conservatives, set out in 2021 to form an ambitious, progressive coalition straddling ideological divisions that would modernize Germany.",
      "The government can point to achievements: preventing an energy crunch after Russia cut off its gas supplies to Germany, initiating the modernization of the military and a series of social reforms. But the impression it has left with many Germans is of deepening dysfunction.",
      "\u201cIn view of the global political situation and the poor economic development of Germany as a location, we now need a new, capable government with its own parliamentary majority as quickly as possible,\" said Siegfried Russwurm, president of the Federation of German Industries.",
      "\"With the inauguration of the new U.S. government at the beginning of 2025, uncertainty is expected to increase,\u201d Russwurm said.",

      "Australia\u2019s states and territories have unanimously backed a world-first national plan to ban children younger than 16 from most forms of social media",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s states and territories on Friday unanimously backed a national plan to require most forms of social media to bar children younger than 16.",
      "Leaders of the eight provinces held a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to discuss what he calls a world-first national approach that would make platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook responsible for enforcing the age limit.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing social harm to our young Australians,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThe safety and mental health of our young people has to be a priority.\"",
      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced into Parliament within two weeks, and the age ban would take effect a year after it passes into law, giving platforms time to work out how to exclude children. The government has yet to offer a technical solution.",
      "The delay is also intended to allow time to address privacy concerns around age verification.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support to the 16-year age limit since it was announced on Thursday, suggesting the legislation will pass the Senate.",
      "The minor Greens party was critical, saying the ban would prevent the emergence in Australia of future child environmental activists like Sweden's Greta Thunberg.",
      "More than 140 academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Critics say most teenagers are tech savvy enough to get around such laws. Some fear the ban will create conflicts within families and drive social media problems underground.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, argues that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "The government likens the proposed social media age limit to the laws that restrict the sale of alcohol to adults aged 18 and older across Australia. Children still find ways to drink, but the prohibition remains.",
      "\u201cWe think these laws will make a real positive difference,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "But Lisa Given, professor of information sciences at RMIT University, described the legislation as \u201creally problematic.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of our social networks are actually about the provision of extremely critical information to kids,\u201d Given told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re also facing bullying and other challenges online, but they actually need the social supports to know how to navigate the platforms safely and so they need more support from parents, from care-givers, not less access to a single or multiple platforms,\u201d Given added.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, described the government\u2019s plan to remove 14 and 15-year-olds from their already established social media accounts was \u201cstrange.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve already developed that space in that world, to have it taken away really could do as much harm as the harms that are purportedly being fixed,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThere are so many questions about this that have yet to be answered, but even if we had solid answers about how this might work technically and how this might get implemented socially, it's still hard to believe that this would actually keep kids safe online,\" he added.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said children would retain access to online education and health services.",
      "The legislation would also include strong privacy protections surrounding age verification.",
      "\u201cPrivacy must be paramount, including that of children,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cWe should also be very clear about the realities. These platforms know about their users in a way that no one else does.\u201d",
      "Rowland said YouTube would likely be included among the mainstream platforms defined under the legislation as age restricted services.",
      "But YouTube Kids could be exempted. Gaming and messaging services would not face age restrictions, she said,",
      "\u201cThis legislation would strike a balance between minimizing the harms experienced by young people during a critical period of their development while also supporting their access to benefits as well,\u201d Rowland said."

      "Ninety-three people have been officially declared missing, but authorities admit that the real number could be higher. Another 54 bodies remain unidentified. In total, 36,605 people have been rescued, according to authorities.",
      "The full extent of the damage is unknown, but Spain\u2019s Consortium for Insurance Compensation, a public-private entity that pays insurance claims for extreme risks like floods, estimates that it will spend at least 3.5 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in compensation.",

      "Spain's meteorological agency says that 30.4 inches fell in one hour in the Valencian town of Turis, an all-time national record for rainfall set on Oct. 29. The devastated village of Chiva also received more rain in eight hours than the town had experienced in the preceding 20 months.",
      "The storms honed in on the Magro and Turia Rivers and the Poyo canal, turning them into swift currents that swept away everything in their path. To the human eye, it looked as if a tsunami-like wave of water and mud cut a swath through the southern outskirts of the city of Valencia.",
      "The European Space Agency said that, according to satellite images captured on Oct. 31, water covered an area of 15,633 hectares (38,600 acres). About 190,000 people were directly affected, the agency said.",

      "The Federal Reserve cut its key rate by a quarter-point in response to the steady decline in the once-high inflation that had angered Americans and helped drive Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory this week",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate Thursday by a quarter-point in response to the steady decline in the once-high inflation that had angered Americans and helped drive Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory this week.",
      "The rate cut follows a larger half-point reduction in September, and it reflects the Fed\u2019s renewed focus on supporting the job market as well as fighting inflation, which now barely exceeds the central bank\u2019s 2% target.",
      "Asked at a news conference how Trump's election might affect the Fed's policymaking, Chair Jerome Powell said that \"in the near term, the election will have no effects on our (interest rate) decisions.\u201d",
      "But Trump\u2019s election, beyond its economic consequences, has raised the specter of meddling by the White House in the Fed\u2019s policy decisions. Trump has argued that as president, he should have a voice in the central bank\u2019s interest rate decisions. The Fed has long guarded its role as an independent agency able to make difficult decisions about borrowing rates, free from political interference. Yet in his previous term in the White House, Trump publicly attacked Powell after the Fed raised rates to fight inflation, and he may do so again.",
      "Asked whether he would resign if Trump asked him to, Powell, who will have a year left in his second four-year term as Fed chair when Trump takes office, replied simply, \u201cNo.\u201d",
      "And Powell said that in his view, Trump could not fire or demote him: It would \u201cnot be permitted under the law,\u201d he said.",
      "Thursday\u2019s Fed rate cut reduced its benchmark rate to about 4.6%, down from a four-decade high of 5.3%. The Fed had kept its rate that high for more than a year to fight the worst inflation streak in four decades. Annual inflation has since fallen from a 9.1% peak in mid-2022 to a 3 1/2-year low of 2.4% in September.",
      "When its latest policy meeting ended Thursday, the Fed issued a statement noting that the \"unemployment rate has moved up but remains low,\u201d and while inflation has fallen closer to the 2% target level, it \u201cremains somewhat elevated.\u201d",
      "After their rate cut in September \u2014 their first such move in more than four years \u2014 the policymakers had projected that they would make further quarter-point cuts in November and December and four more next year. But with the economy now mostly solid and Wall Street anticipating faster growth, larger budget deficits and higher inflation under a Trump presidency, further rate cuts may have become less likely. Rate cuts by the Fed typically lead over time to lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "Powell declined to be pinned down Thursday on whether the Fed would proceed with an additional quarter-point rate cut in December or the four rate cuts its policymakers penciled in for 2025.",
      "Diane Swonk, chief economist at accounting giant KPMG, said she thought Powell was reluctant to provide hints about the Fed\u2019s next moves because of the uncertainty caused by Trump\u2019s election victory.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not willing to go too far out ahead of his skis, given how much could change,\u201d she said. \u201cIn an environment where you don\u2019t know how promises on the campaign trail translate to actual policies, you don\u2019t want to front-run it.\u201d",
      "Still, Matthew Luzzetti, an economist at Deutsche Bank, said there were signs that the Fed might end up announcing fewer rate cuts next year than many economists expect. The job market and the economy are looking healthier than they appeared in September, when the Fed announced an outsize half-point rate cut.",
      "\u201cNothing in the economic data,\u201d Luzzetti said, \u201csuggests that the (Fed) has any need to be in a hurry\u201d to get rates down substantially.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, Powell did express confidence that inflation, despite some recent higher-than-expected readings, would keep falling back to the Fed\u2019s target.",
      "\u201cWe feel like the story is very consistent with inflation continuing to come down on a bumpy path over the next couple of years, and settling around 2%,\u201d he said.",
      "The economy is clouding the picture by flashing conflicting signals, with growth solid but hiring weakening. Consumer spending, though, has been healthy, fueling concerns that there is no need for the Fed to reduce borrowing costs and that doing so might overstimulate the economy and even re-accelerate inflation.",
      "Financial markets are throwing yet another curve at the Fed: Investors have pushed up Treasury yields since the central bank cut rates in September. The result has been higher borrowing costs throughout the economy, thereby diminishing the benefit to consumers of the Fed\u2019s half-point cut in its benchmark rate, which it announced after its September meeting.",
      "Broader interest rates have risen because investors are anticipating higher inflation, larger federal budget deficits, and faster economic growth under a President-elect Trump. Trump\u2019s plan to impose at least a 10% tariff on all imports, as well as significantly higher taxes on Chinese goods, and to carry out a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would almost certainly boost inflation. This would make it less likely that the Fed would continue cutting its key rate. Annual inflation as measured by the central bank\u2019s preferred gauge fell to 2.1% in September.",
      "Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that Trump\u2019s proposed 10% tariff, as well as his proposed taxes on Chinese imports and autos from Mexico, could send inflation back up to about 2.75% to 3% by mid-2026.",
      "The economy grew at a solid annual rate just below 3% over the past six months, while consumer spending \u2014 fueled by higher-income shoppers \u2014 rose strongly in the July-September quarter.",
      "But companies have scaled back hiring, with many people who are out of work struggling to find jobs. Powell has suggested that the Fed is reducing its key rate in part to bolster the job market. If economic growth continues at a healthy clip and inflation climbs again, though, the central bank will come under pressure to slow or stop its rate cuts.",
      "Asked at his news conference about Americans who are feeling little relief from the pain of high prices and who helped fuel Trump\u2019s victory, Powell said:",
      "\u201cIt takes some years of real wage gains for people to feel better, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to create, and I think we\u2019re well on the road to creating that. Inflation has come way down, the economy is still strong here, wages are moving up, but at a sustainable level.",
      "\u201cI think what needs to happen is happening, and for the most part has happened, but it will be some time before people regain their confidence and feel that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "U.S. officials are proposing tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Joe Biden's administration on Friday proposed tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West to protect a declining bird species.",
      "However, it is doubtful the changes would survive under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Greater sage grouse \u2014 chicken-sized birds known for an elaborate mating ritual\u2014 were once found across much of the U.S. West. Their numbers plummeted in recent decades because of energy exploration, wildfires, disease and other pressures.",
      "A 2015 agreement shepherded by the Obama administration kept the birds off the endangered species list, by imposing limits on where and when development could occur across their 270,000-square mile range.",
      "Now officials with the Interior Department want to make the protections even stronger. Their plan would eliminate loopholes that allowed development in areas considered crucial to the bird's long-term survival. New solar and wind projects would be excluded, and oil and gas exploration could only occur from drilling platforms located outside the protected areas.",
      "Trump has pushed to open more public lands to energy development in line with his mantra to \u201cdrill baby drill.\u201d During his first administration, officials attempted to scale back the Obama-era sage grouse protections, but they were blocked in court.",
      "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Friday's proposal would boost sage grouse while allowing development on some government lands to continue. She said the plan was based on the best science to protect the bird.",
      "\u201cFor too long, a false choice has been presented for land management that aims to pit development against conservation,\u201d Haaland said in a statement.",
      "Yet the agency's attempt to find a middle ground fell flat with environmentalists, industry representatives and Republican elected officials.",
      "Most of the land at issue \u2014 about 4,700 square miles \u2014 is in Nevada and California, according to government documents. Affected parcels also are in Wyoming, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Montana and the Dakotas.",
      "Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon lamented what he called the administration's \u201cextreme indifference\u201d to his state. The Republican governor said new layers of federal regulation would hinder practical solutions for the grouse.",
      "\u201cWe have shown how to successfully manage this bird and do so in a way that allows for protection of core habitat alongside responsible development,\u201d Gordon said.",
      "Environmentalists, meanwhile, said officials had squandered a chance to put in place meaningful protections that could halt the grouse's slow spiral towards extinction. They noted that loopholes allowing development would remain in place across nearly 50,000 square miles of public lands.",
      "\u201cIt's death by a thousands cuts,\u201d said Greta Anderson with Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group involved in previous sage grouse lawsuits. \u201cThe Biden administration could have stopped the cutting, and it didn't. The fact that it's less bad doesn't mean it's not bad.\u201d",
      "Federal officials predicted only minimal economic impacts. They said energy companies already steer clear of sage grouse habitat, where there are limits on when and where work can be done near breeding areas. Those companies can still find opportunities on other public lands, the officials said.",
      "That was disputed by an energy industry representative. Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance said the Biden administration already had limited leasing in sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cSo they\u2019ve denied access and then say companies are avoiding them anyway,\u201d Sgamma said. \u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous.\u201d",

      "A related proposal to help sage grouse would block for 20 years new mining projects on more than 15,625 square miles in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. That proposal was part of the 2015 Obama-era protections. It was canceled under Trump then restored by a court.",

      "Greater sage grouse once numbered in the millions across all or portions of 11 Western states. Populations have dropped 65% since 1986, according to government scientists."

      "Alex Ovechkin scored his 130th career game-winning goal to keep his hot streak going, the Washington Capitals winning and the Nashville Predators losing",
      "WASHINGTON -- Alex Ovechkin scoring to hand the Nashville Predators another defeat and keep his Washington Capitals rolling was not surprising to the folks on the other side who have seen him a lot over the years.",
      "\u201cYou knew it was coming,\u201d said Predators coach Andrew Brunette, whose final seven seasons as a player overlapped with Ovechkin's first seven in the NHL. \"You\u2019re on the bench and I guess I\u2019ve seen him too many times. I\u2019ve played against him, I\u2019ve coached against him, I\u2019ve watched him and he just finds that and when it\u2019s on his stick it\u2019s gone.",
      "\"That\u2019s a big-time shot from obviously arguably the greatest goal-scorer of all time.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin is now six away from breaking Jaromir Jagr's record for the most career game-winning goals. His 130th helped the Capitals improve to 9-3-0 this season and sent the Predators to their ninth loss in 13 games.",
      "\u201cIt (stinks) that he scored against us tonight and got the game-winner, but a guy that is still producing at this age is impressive,\u201d said Predators forward Steven Stamkos, who played his first 16 years in the league with Tampa Bay. \u201cTo keep doing it at this age is very impressive.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin has six goals in his past five games to reach 861 for his career. He's 34 away from breaking Wayne Gretzky's career mark that for decades had seemed unapproachable.",
      "Washington's longtime captain also became just the third player age 39 or older to score in five or more consecutive games, after Johnny Bucyk in 1974 and Brett Hull in 2003.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to go down as the guy with the most goals ever at some point here,\u201d Stamkos said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a generational goal scorer and a guy that I\u2019ve always looked up to in terms of how he scores goals. It\u2019s the hardest thing to do in the NHL is score and he\u2019s found a way to do it better than \u2014 soon \u2014 anyone ever.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin also continued his streak of scoring every game the Capitals wear their black \u201cScreaming Eagle\u201d jersey, on this occasion the first time in this, their 50th season. The player known as the \u201cGreat Eight\u201d is now 8 for 8 in this uniform.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know the stats, but I love this jersey,\" Ovechkin said. \"Fans love it, so it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin set up Aliaksei Protas earlier in the game, too, and has eight goals and eight assists.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always having fun,\" Ovechkin said. \"But when you're winning games, when you're producing opportunities to have a chance to score goals, it\u2019s always fun to play.\u201d",

      "Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones says quarterback Dak Prescott wants to avoid surgery and play again this season after tearing a hamstring",
      "FRISCO, Texas -- Dak Prescott wants to avoid surgery so the star quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys can play again this season after tearing a hamstring, owner Jerry Jones said Friday.",
      "Jones confirmed on his radio show that Prescott's hamstring was partially torn off the bone, a condition known as partial avulsion.",
      "A full tear of the tendon off the bone requires surgery, and that\u2019s what happened two years ago in training camp when former Dallas left tackle Tyron Smith missed 13 games. In Prescott\u2019s case, Jones said it could be a few weeks before it is known whether surgery will be required.",
      "The injury happened in last week's 27-21 loss to Atlanta. Cooper Rush will start in Prescott's place Sunday against NFC East rival Philadelphia (6-2) with the defending division champion Cowboys (3-5) trying to to stay in the playoff race after qualifying with 12-5 records each of the past three seasons.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s got to have some weeks off of it before he can see if it really does require surgery,\u201d Jones said on his radio show. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want surgery. He wants to be on the field and go for it. He\u2019s weighing that. We\u2019re weighing that.\u201d",
      "Jones said the Cowboys don't feel the urgency to put Prescott on injured reserve because they may not need the spot on the 53-man active roster right now. Prescott would be out at least four games after an IR move.",
      "Rush was 4-1 as the starter two years ago when Prescott was out after breaking the thumb on his throwing hand in a season-opening loss. Rush also won a game in 2021 when Prescott had a calf strain.",
      "A new element to replacing Prescott is the presence of Trey Lance, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 draft by San Francisco. The 49ers traded him to the Cowboys last year after Lance lost the battle for the backup job, and he has been the third QB for Dallas since then.",
      "Lance took the vast majority of the snaps in the preseason so coach Mike McCarthy and his staff could evaluate a 24-year-old who is on an expiring rookie contract.",
      "McCarthy has indicated he would stick with Rush the same way he has with Prescott, therefore shying away from packages that might incorporate Lance, who is by far the most mobile of the three QBs.",
      "Jones suggested otherwise on his radio show for an offense that has struggled even with a healthy Prescott and has the second-worst rushing attack in the NFL.",
      "\u201cOh, there is a window for Trey Lance,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere's packages that we can work on. Let me be clear, that's not just to get Lance some play time. That's to bring to the table some offense for us.\u201d",

      "A prosecutor overseeing the case told local radio that Lozano had been under investigation for over a year. Although he has not been criminally charged, authorities ordered his arrest because they deemed he is a flight risk and could obstruct their investigation.",

      "Florida coach Billy Napier is getting a fourth season to try to get the Gators back to their winning ways",
      "GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- Florida coach Billy Napier is getting a fourth season to try to get the Gators back to their winning ways.",
      "Athletic director Scott Stricklin made the announcement in a \u201cletter to Gator Nation\u201d on Thursday that said the team is \u201cbuilding a foundation that promises greater success next season and beyond.\u201d",
      "The letter does not specicially mention the 2025 season, but a person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press that the intent was to send a message of stability for next year, not just the upcoming recruiting season. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because Florida's internal discussions are private.",
      "\u201cI wanted to let you know that Billy Napier will continue as head football coach of the Florida Gators,\u201d Stricklin wrote. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen these past several weeks, the young men on this team represent what it means to be a Gator. Their resolve, effort and execution are evident in their performance and growth each week \u2014 building a foundation that promises greater success next season and beyond.\u201d",
      "The Gators (4-4, 2-3 Southeastern Conference) have made significant strides since lopsided losses to Miami and Texas A&M during the first month of the season. Napier shored up the team's shaky defense, found a potential star in freshman quarterback DJ Lagway and developed young talent on both sides of the ball.",
      "It\u2019s the kind of progress that should help Stricklin's case to keep Napier despite his 15-18 record heading into Saturday's game at No. 5 Texas.",
      "\u201cUF's commitment to excellence and a championship-caliber program is unwavering,\u201d Stricklin wrote. \u201cIn these times of change across college athletics, we are dedicated to a disciplined, stable approach that is focused on long-term, sustained success for Gator athletes, recruits and fans. I am confident that Billy will meet the challenges and opportunities ahead.\u201d",
      "The Gators went toe-to-toe with then-No. 8 Tennessee in Knoxville last month and again with second-ranked Georgia last week in Jacksonville.",
      "Florida lost 23-17 in overtime to the Volunteers after squandering several chances to pull off a stunner. And there are plenty who believe the Gators would have beaten Georgia had Lagway not pulled his hamstring in the second quarter while leading 10-3.",
      "\u201cBefore the season started, nobody expected us to be anything,\" running back Ja'Kobi Jackson said Wednesday. \"But we\u2019re proving to people day-in and day-out that we can play in the SEC, that we\u2019re capable of beating teams.\u201d",
      "No one saw that coming in September, and it appeared Napier might not make it through the first month of the season.",
      "Florida was inept on both sides of the ball in a 41-17 loss to rival Miami to open the season and showed no improvement in a 33-20 loss to Texas A&M two weeks later.",
      "But Napier\u2019s popularity started to turn with a dominant victory at Mississippi State and then a bye week that became a series of ultra-competitive practices \u2014 on-field work that players point to as the key to getting on track.",
      "While some wondered if the Gators would start giving up or opting out, they dug in for Napier.",
      "\u201cEverything Coach Napier says, everybody\u2019s bought into it,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing for each other at the end of the day. We play for everyone that\u2019s in this building.\"",
      "Florida would owe Napier roughly $26 million by firing him in 2024. His buyout drops to around $19 million in 2025, although that figure would be considerably higher with his legion of assistants and behind-the-scenes help.",
      "Even with Napier remaining in place, staff changes are expected. And he's still likely to open next year on the proverbial hot seat \u2014 and for good reason.",
      "Florida is 2-12 against ranked teams and 1-10 against rivals Florida State, Georgia, LSU, Miami and Tennessee. And Napier\u2019s in-game mistakes continue to mount (see Tennessee), although at a much slower pace.",
      "Nonetheless, growth outweighs growing pains. And with November being a key recruiting month, Florida administrators opted to give Napier a vote of confidence, especially with his team so banged up. The Gators could be down their top two quarterbacks, including Lagway, their top two running backs, two of their top four receivers and four cornerbacks when they take the field in Austin.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Billy will meet the challenges and opportunities ahead,\u201d Stricklin wrote. \u201cNow, I call on all of Gator Nation to continue standing behind Billy and his dedicated team while we work together to build a championship program.\u201d",

      "SAN ANTONIO -- A remarkable era of parity in Major League Baseball hit a bit of a snag this October when the big-spending New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets finished as three of the top four teams in this year's postseason.",
      "Sometimes, all that money really is an advantage.",
      "Now it's time for the sport's middle-sized and small-market franchises to look for ways to counter during this offseason. Given several factors \u2014 particularly cash flow uncertainty due to the collapse of the regional sports network model \u2014 that could prove difficult.",
      "\u201cIt's going to be a challenge for Major League Baseball leadership,\u201d St. Louis Cardinals GM John Mozeliak said on Wednesday. \u201cHow do you remain with some level of competitive balance when there are so many teams that have so much higher revenues than the lower end?\u201d",
      "The fact that the Cardinals are worried about their financial future should be fairly alarming. This is a franchise that's been among baseball's most consistent over the past several decades, winning World Series titles in 2006 and 2011. They may not spend like the Dodgers, Yankees or Mets, but they've usually had reasonably deep pockets.",
      "\u201cWe've always punched above our weight, so to speak,\u201d Mozeliak said. \u201cBut now we're having the realization that we're going to be affected from our media package, our ticket sales, so our reality is changing.\u201d",
      "The Cardinals' dilemma is one shared by several other teams. MLB announced in October it will produce and distribute local broadcasts for the Cleveland Guardians, Milwaukee Brewers and Minnesota Twins next year. All three teams had contracts with Diamond Sports Group that expired at the end of the regular season.",
      "The Texas Rangers, whose deal also expired last month, announced they will no longer be partnering with Diamond. They are assessing their options for next season.",
      "The addition of the Guardians, Brewers and Twins means MLB will be handling the production and distribution of at least six teams going into 2025. The Arizona Diamondbacks, Colorado Rockies and San Diego Padres were the first three to make the switch.",
      "MLB could be taking over more teams as Diamond continues to go through bankruptcy proceedings.",
      "The Cardinals reached a new media rights on Thursday, though financial terms were not disclosed. They are one of five teams that are part owners of their regional sports network, along with the Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Angels and Miami Marlins. The stations are FanDuel Sports Network affiliates after Diamond reached a naming rights deal with FanDuel last month.",
      "MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has remained bullish about the long-term financial prospects of all 30 teams, but has also acknowledged that there might be some short-term pain as the transition continues.",
      "D-backs general manager Mike Hazen has always believed that a lower payroll is no excuse for poor performance. Arizona advanced to the World Series in 2023 despite having ranked No. 21 in the league in that category.",
      "The team spent more last offseason thanks to postseason revenue, rising to the middle of the MLB pack. He said his team is ready to be active in free agency once again, even if he conceded that there are challenges.",
      "\u201cObviously, it builds in some sort of uncertainty for us, but we get with (ownership) and figure out what we have to spend, what we can add and then we act accordingly,\u201d Hazen said.",
      "The Mets ($332 million), Yankees ($311 million) and Dodgers ($266 million) had the top three payrolls in baseball last season, though those numbers will change slightly this winter when bonuses are calculated. The Guardians ranked No. 23 at $109 million. Unlike the NFL, NBA and NHL, baseball does not have a salary cap.",
      "As the Guardians showed, it's not impossible to go deep into the playoffs with a modest payroll. But it's not easy and it's not getting any easier.",
      "\u201cYou have to scratch and claw and match up and make moves, take shots and hope that it works,\u201d Guardians manager Stephen Vogt said last month. \u201cWhereas for the other three teams, for the majorities, they set their lineup and go play.\u201d",
      "Not everyone believes that MLB teams are suffering much financial hardship. Baseball super agent Scott Boras called the regional sports network uncertainty \u201clast year's news\u201d and doesn't believe it will have much affect on the free agent market this winter.",
      "\u201cClubs have been offered contracts from RSNs and they've rejected them, they're building their own platforms, they're using different methods for streaming,\u201d Boras said. \"You've seen it with Texas, Milwaukee. They're offered money but they feel they can do better with other elements.",
      "\u201cThat should tell you about their evolution of thought \u2014 how they feel going forward with streaming.\u201d",

      "Money from name, image and likeness deals has changed what it means to be an NCAA athlete for some college players",
      "PHOENIX -- Sponsorship deals were far from Jonny Bottorff's mind when he transferred to Northern Arizona University on a football scholarship. As money-making opportunities for college athletes have boomed since then, the offensive lineman has earned a few hundred dollars through name, image and likeness deals, but nothing that has changed his life.",
      "Bottorff, 23, earned an undergraduate degree and is now working on his master\u2019s degree at the Division I school in Flagstaff, Arizona. He transferred from Missouri Western State University, a small Division II school in Saint Joseph, Missouri.",
      "\u201cI think the reality for most college athletes is things haven\u2019t really changed that much. We just got an extra little bit of cash in our pockets that probably needed to happen,\u201d Bottorff said.",
      "For some players, money from NIL deals has transformed what it means to be a college athlete. But outside the highest-profile athletes, who now can earn millions of dollars while still in school, many players say a college degree remains the ultimate prize.",
      "College athletes graduate at rates that are comparable to and often higher than non-athletes. For Division I schools, the NCAA last year reported data showing a record 91% of athletes are graduating.",
      "Before the Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that U.S.-born athletes could earn money from advertisements, autographs and university boosters, college athletes were under a simple agreement with their institutions: compete in exchange for a degree.",
      "Money received through NIL agreements has changed the equation for athletes like Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels and Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese, who leveraged their personal brands while still in college, securing endorsement deals with the likes of Reebok, Powerade and Beats by Dre.",
      "Where academics rates as a priority varies with each individual. But several Division I athletes said in interviews the money available to them through NIL remains a small consideration compared with earning a degree and competing in the sports they love.",
      "Anthony Leal, a guard for Indiana University's basketball team, said he is coming back as a fifth-year senior because of school, even though he received his undergraduate degree last year. He said earning a master's in business administration was always the goal.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m about 70% through the program in the Kelley School of Business,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to get that degree.\u201d",
      "NCAA eligibility rules allow athletes five years to compete athletically across four seasons. Under the redshirt eligibility rule, many receive an athletic scholarship and practice their first year, but do not compete in games or matches. The NCAA also allowed athletes to extend their eligibility by a year if their team was affected by the pandemic.",
      "For some athletes, NIL money is an incentive to attend and stay in college, but Leal said it's not often that athletes are completely disinterested in school.",
      "\u201cEvery student knows that it has to be a piece of the puzzle at some level. So everyone kind of understands the value of school,\u201d Leal said. \u201cBut, yeah, sure, some people may have other goals. There are plenty of people, maybe not at Indiana, but there are plenty of people throughout college basketball who don\u2019t care because you\u2019ve got NIL (money) and the transfer portal.\u201d",
      "The transfer portal has become a plug-and-play method for powerhouses and rebuilding programs alike. It has made it easy for athletes to switch colleges and play the next season, rather than sitting out a year under previous rules. And it has become a way for top athletes to shop around for more lucrative opportunities. UNLV quarterback Matthew Sluka, for one, walked away from the team in a dispute over a $100,000 NIL payment his agent says was promised but never paid.",
      "The NIL market is expected to reach $1.67 billion in the 2024-2025 school year, according to an estimate by the NIL platform Opendorse. The highest earnings go to top men's basketball and football players.",
      "Even though the NCAA now allows players to transfer without sitting out, the academic transition can be more complicated.",
      "Ray Harrison started at Presbyterian College in 2020, but transferred in 2022 to Grand Canyon University, a private Christian university in Phoenix where he is a senior guard on the basketball team. He said NIL money wasn't a factor. It was about finding a better fit for him.",
      "\u201cI just came out here because this is where God led my heart. Of course, we win two (conference) championships and that changes things,\u201d he said. But it wasn\u2019t a smooth transition \u2014 a lot of his course credits didn\u2019t transfer. \u201cWhen I got here, I had to do some catching up.\u201d",
      "Trinity San Antonio, another student who transferred to Grand Canyon, previously attended California Baptist, a private university in Riverside, California. Finding a school that would accept the majority of her previously earned college credits was harder than she expected.",
      "\u201cComing in as a freshman when you\u2019re really a junior is not ideal,\u201d said San Antonio, who also played basketball for Puerto Rico last summer in the Paris Olympics.",

    "summary": "The NCAA Division I Council has cleared the way for players with Canadian Hockey League experience to compete at U.S. colleges starting next season",
    "story": [
      "The NCAA Division I Council has cleared the way for players with Canadian Hockey League experience to compete at U.S. colleges starting next season",
      "The NCAA Division I Council approved a rule Thursday allowing players with Canadian Hockey League experience to compete at U.S. colleges starting next season, a landmark decision that has the potential of shaking up the NHL\u2019s two largest sources of developmental talent.",
      "The decision, effective Aug. 1, lifts the NCAA\u2019s longstanding ban on CHL players who were previously deemed to be professionals because they received a stipend of up to $600 per month for living expenses.",
      "The approval was expected after the council introduced a proposal to lift the ban last month. Players competing at the major junior level or on professional teams can retain NCAA eligibility as long as they are not paid more than actual and necessary expenses.",
      "The decision also applies to skiing, bringing both in line with NCAA eligibility rules for other sports",
      "In doing so, the council opened the door for a major change in how players approaching their 16th birthdays decide where to play. Rather than having to choose between one or the other, CHL players can now play NCAA hockey when they become college eligible.",
      "\u201cEveryone expected the rule to change. Now we will have to adapt,\" Central Collegiate Hockey Association Commissioner Don Lucia wrote in a text to The Associated Press. \"There may be a few issues as we transition. But hopefully, in time, it will prove to be a positive change for all involved.\u201d",
      "NHL agent Allan Walsh called the ruling a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis revolutionary development is great news for young players and their families, who will no longer be faced with the momentous decision of playing major junior or going the NCAA route,\u201d Walsh added in a text message to The AP. \u201cThe young players and their families can now make decisions based on what\u2019s best for them, not what\u2019s best for the CHL or NCAA.\u201d",
      "The CHL oversees the Western Hockey, Ontario Hockey and Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey leagues.",
      "The decision could potentially spur the CHL to invest more toward player development and education to compete with the NCAA teams or risk losing its top 18-and-older talent to U.S. colleges. Meantime, an increase of CHL players could eat up college roster spots previously filled by Americans.",
      "One option the CHL is considering in response to the ruling is increasing its current limit of two non-North American import players per roster. Otherwise, the CHL called the decision \u201ca positive development\u201d in providing players more athletic and academic opportunities.",
      "The NCAA\u2019s ruling follows a class-action lawsuit filed Aug. 13 in U.S. District Court in Buffalo, New York, challenging the ban.",
      "\u201cIt's long overdue, but this is a great result,\u201d Stephen Lagos, one of the attorneys who filed the lawsuit, wrote in an email to the AP. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to players and fans seeing the benefits of a more competitive and fair market, without the rule, beginning next season.\u201d",
      "Lagos said the attorneys will continue pursuing the lawsuit in seeking damages for players who join the class-action case affected by the ban dating to Aug. 12, 2020.",
      "The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Riley Masterson of Fort Erie, Ontario, who lost his college eligibility two years ago when, at 16, he appeared in two exhibition games for the OHL\u2019s Windsor Spitfires. It lists 10 Division I hockey programs, which were selected to show they follow the NCAA\u2019s bylaws in barring current or former CHL players.",
      "NHL agent Brian Bartlett hailed the decision for opening choices for players.",
      "\u201cJust like the transfer portal and NIL rule changes of recent years, there will be some growing pains and early chaos, but we expect it will be a positive development in the long term,\u201d Bartlett wrote in a text. \u201cWith a larger player pool, hopefully more NCAA schools will consider adding hockey programs to provide opportunities for those additional players.\u201d",
      "In September, Braxton Whitehead said he had verbally committed to Arizona State, making him the first CHL player to attempt to play hockey at the Division I U.S. college level. The 20-year-old Whitehead said he plans to play this season for the WHL Regina Pats before playing for the Sun Devils in 2025-26.",
      "The stipends CHL players receive are not considered as income for tax purposes. College players, meantime, receive scholarships and now can earn money through endorsements and other use of their name, image or likeness.",
      "The eligibility change could have a trickle down effect by impacting Canada's various junior A leagues and the USHL's ability to attract talent for those pursuing plans to play at U.S. colleges. Two recent NHL No. 1 draft picks, San Jose forward Macklin Celebrini and Buffalo defenseman Owen Power, played in the USHL.",
      "\u201cThe USHL remains the world\u2019s premier development path. All aspects of the league are focused on preparing athletes for collegiate and professional hockey, inclusive of on-ice, academic and character development,\u201d the USHL said in a statement after the NCAA ruling.",

      "The Florida Panthers often show up to work in suits",
      "SUNRISE, Fla. -- The Florida Panthers often show up to work in suits. Until further notice, they're wearing robes.",
      "Let's explain: The Stanley Cup champion Panthers got personalized bathrobes for their two-game trip to Finland last week, a gift from the team. They showed up for the two games there wearing the robes. They won both games.",
      "And since hockey streaks are never messed with, the robes are still in style. Every Panthers player showed up at the arena Thursday wearing their robes \u2014 which remain unbeaten. Florida beat Nashville 6-2.",
      "\u201cI think we're just going to ride it out until our luck runs out,\u201d Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk said.",
      "So, the robes will be worn again when the Panthers return to the ice Saturday?",
      "\u201cThere's a very good chance,\u201d Tkachuk said.",
      "It was a spur-of-the-moment idea by the Panthers to wear the robes \u2014 a nod to Finland's sauna culture \u2014 to the games in Tampere last week. The defending Stanley Cup champions decided at their morning skate Thursday to keep the new tradition alive, with captain Aleksander Barkov sending a message to the team group chat saying to wear the robes to work.",
      "\u201cYou've got to be some kind of superstitious at some point, right?\" Barkov said. \"While it\u2019s working for us, we'll keep going with that.\u201d",
      "Evidently, some were skeptical and thinking they were getting pranked. Aaron Ekblad was only convinced after Tkachuk snapped a photo of himself wearing his robe in his car on the way to the arena.",
      "\u201cEverybody thought there was a prank being played on them,\u201d Tkachuk said. \u201cI tell you what, it's the most comfortable thing ever. It's nice and we're having fun with it. We're a very professional team when it comes to work. We come to the rink and we work. But it's such a long year. You've got to have fun.\u201d",
      "Panthers general manager and hockey operations president Bill Zito said the robe idea actually started with Lucy Tallas, the wife of Florida goaltending coach Robb Tallas.",
      "\u201cWe have to give the true credit \u2014 it was Lucy's idea,\" Zito said earlier this week.",
      "Florida coach Paul Maurice loves anything that brings a team closer together, and the robe-wearing era for the Panthers seems to be something they're all enjoying.",
      "\u201cThose are the best that have nothing to do with anything but the players,\u201d Maurice said. \u201cThose are the best things that happen. It took some courage to walk into an NHL rink in a robe and I think it got them to start on time.\u201d",
      "Maurice got a robe in Finland as well. But he will arrive for work on Saturday in a suit, just as he did Thursday.",
      "\u201cNobody \u2014 nobody \u2014 needs to see that,\u201d Maurice said. \u201cThese fine people pay way too much money to be subjected to those nightmares.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has denied a motion by two NASCAR teams \u2014 one owned by NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan \u2014 to be recognized as chartered teams as they proceed in an antitrust lawsuit against the stock car series and chairman Jim France",
      "AVONDALE, Ariz. -- A federal judge on Friday denied a motion by two NASCAR teams \u2014 one owned by NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan \u2014 to be recognized as chartered teams as they proceed in an antitrust lawsuit against the stock car series and chairman Jim France.",
      "The motion was signed by federal judge Frank Whitney of the United States District Court of Western North Carolina in Charlotte at the exact same time NASCAR executives were giving their annual \u201cState of the Sport\u201d address at Phoenix Raceway.",
      "NASCAR President Steve Phelps opened the address by noting that series officials have not discussed negotiations over charters in the more than two-year process and would not start now.",
      "\u201cI know people are frustrated about that,\u201d Phelps said. \"We are not going to negotiate in the media about charters, ever. And we are very happy that 32 of the 36 charters were extended because those were race teams that where the deal that was put on the table for them, the primary big win for the race teams was money.",
      "\u201cI won't go into what the money split looks like, but what I will say is that the amount of money, it now puts the race teams, starting in '25, as the single largest beneficiary of our media deal. And we did that because the race teams were upside down financially.\u201d",
      "The court decision came down just hours before Cup cars hit the track for the first practice session of championship weekend. Tyler Reddick, who drives for the Jordan-owned 23XI Racing, is one of four drivers who is in Sunday's winner-take-all finale at Phoenix.",
      "When the ruling came out and NASCAR was informed as executives sat on the stage at Phoenix Raceway, NASCAR chief operating officer Steve O\u2019Donnell quipped: \u201cYou can't make it up, for the timing\u201d as he and Phelps declined comment on the injunction.",
      "Jeffrey Kessler, the top antitrust lawyer in the country, indicated after Monday\u2019s hearing in Charlotte that the plaintiffs can immediately appeal the ruling.",
      "At issue is that both 23XI and Front Row Motorsports refused to sign a take-it-or-leave-it charter agreement presented to teams by NASCAR in September, just 48 hours before the playoffs began. The offers came after more than two years of negotiations between NASCAR and its teams, and 13 of 15 organizations signed the deal.",
      "23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports declined to sign and have accused NASCAR of being \u201cmonopolistic bullies\u201d in what is essentially a revenue-sharing agreement between the sanctioning body and its teams.",
      "NASCAR has since rescinded the offers on charter extensions to 23XI and Front Row. Their current charters expire at the end of the calendar year. The teams are free to operate as \u201copen\u201d teams but the lack of chartered protection denies them an equal share of revenue, a guaranteed spot in the field of 38 races and other provisions under the charter agreements.",
      "23XI and Front Row have asked for things to remain status quo as their antitrust case proceeds because the new charters that begin in 2025 prevent teams from suing NASCAR. Kessler asked that the teams be released from that clause for the duration of the lawsuit.",
      "In his ruling, the judge found that Kessler failed to demonstrate that 23XI and Front Row \u201cwill face irreparable harm through several avenues.\u201d",
      "Kessler had argued the plaintiffs asserted they will \u201crisk\u201d losing sponsors while competing as open teams because the sponsors \u201ccould abandon (them) if they ... do not qualify for all of their races.\u201d",
      "For instance, Kessler said 23XI\u2019s sponsorship agreements require that each sponsored car runs in every Cup Series race, so failure to qualify for a race could reduce the amount of sponsorship money it receives.",
      "The plaintiffs also alleged they will \u201crisk\u201d the loss of their drivers if their cars are not chartered. Kessler said 23XI driver Reddick is permitted to terminate his contract with the team if there is no charter for his car \u2014 and he could leave as the reigning Cup champion should he win the title Sunday.",
      "Kessler also argued racing as open teams \u201ccould threaten (their) continued existence\" as both teams alleged they will lose substantial amounts of revenue without charters. And the plaintiffs alleged they may lose goodwill with fans and sponsors if they fail to qualify for a race.",
      "But Whitney wrote that a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must \u201cdemonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction\" and a showing of the \u201cpossibility of irreparable harm\u201d is not sufficient.",
      "Furthermore, Whitney wrote \u201cthe required irreparable harm must be neither remote nor speculative, but actual and imminent.\u201d He said \u201calthough Plaintiffs have alleged that they will face a risk of irreparable harm, they have not sufficiently alleged present, immediate, urgent irreparable harm, but rather only speculative, possible harm. That is, although Plaintiffs allege they are on the brink of irreparable harm, the 2025 racing season is months away \u2014 the stock cars remain in the garage.\u201d",
      "Whitney said \u201cPlaintiffs have not alleged that their business cannot survive without a preliminary injunction. Instead, they allege that their businesses may not survive without a preliminary injunction.\u201d",
      "Whitney found that Kessler did not meet the burden as required for a preliminary injunction, but if circumstances change, plaintiffs may file a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction. The teams were given a deadline of Dec. 2 to respond.",

He didn't play in Game 2 last week \u2014 a 2-1 Atlanta win \u2014 and now Inter Miami must win at least once without him just to extend its season and reach the second round of the MLS Cup playoffs.",
      "\u201cAt best, there are four finals left,\u201d Inter Miami coach Gerardo \u201cTata\u201d Martino said. \u201cEach of the remaining games has the characteristics of a final game and we, with the expectations we have, are ready to face it in the best way.\u201d",
      "Inter Miami hopes to have four games left this season \u2014 Saturday's conclusion to Round 1, and then a conference semifinal, conference final and the MLS Cup final.

      "The difference is that this one is an elimination match for Messi as well. And when asked this week about how Messi's numbers haven't been great in this series \u2014 no goals and one assist in the two matches \u2014 Atlanta interim coach Rob Valentino wanted no part of that storyline.",
      "\u201cMessi is fantastic,\u201d Valentino said. \"There is no slander on my end. He's a fantastic player. Whether people say he's produced, not produced, I don't want to hear it because he's fantastic.\"",
      "Atlanta is the only MLS team to beat Inter Miami twice this season, and both wins came with Messi in the lineup; the club is 2-1-1 so far this season against the No. 1 overall seed.",
      "The rest of MLS, combined, went 0-12-5 against Inter Miami when Messi was in the lineup. But Atlanta's plan against Messi seems to have worked; he has one goal on 19 shots, eight of which were on target, in the four matches between the clubs this season.",
      "\u201cWhat he brings to a game, what he brings to a team, just him standing on the field it requires your attention,\u201d Atlanta United goalie Brad Guzan said. \u201cThere's very few times that Plan A works. It's Plan B and Plan C and Plan D and you have to adjust very quickly.\u201d",

      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\u201cWe were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\u201d said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \u201cIt opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\u201d",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter \u2014 was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \u201cthe house of the golden bracelet,\u201d the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \u201cthe story that was long spun around these individuals\u201d was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\u201cThey have a better overview of what\u2019s happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \u201cWe actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\u201d",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",

      "The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would set an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would institute an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing harm to our kids and I\u2019m calling time on it,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced in Parliament during its final two weeks in session this year, which begin on Nov. 18. The age limit would take effect 12 months after the law is passed, Albanese told reporters.",
      "The platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would need to use that year to work out how to exclude Australian children younger than 16.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "The proposal comes as governments around the world are wrestling with how to supervise young people's use of technologies like smartphones and social media.",
      "Social media platforms would be penalized for breaching the age limit, but under-age children and their parents would not.",
      "\u201cThe onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access. The onus won\u2019t be on parents or young people,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "Antigone Davis, head of safety at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the company would respect any age limitations the government wants to introduce.",
      "\u201cHowever, what\u2019s missing is a deeper discussion on how we implement protections, otherwise we risk making ourselves feel better, like we have taken action, but teens and parents will not find themselves in a better place,\u201d Davis said in a statement.",
      "She added that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. TikTok declined to comment.",
      "The Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, described the age limit as a \u201c20th Century response to 21st Century challenges.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement.",
      "More than 140 Australian and international academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Jackie Hallan, a director at the youth mental health service ReachOut, opposed the ban. She said 73% of young people across Australia accessing mental health support did so through social media.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they\u2019re worried about getting in trouble,\u201d Hallan said.",
      "Child psychologist Philip Tam said a minimum age of 12 or 13 would have been more enforceable.",
      "\u201cMy real fear honestly is that the problem of social media will simply be driven underground,\u201d Tam said.",
      "Australian National University lawyer Associate Prof. Faith Gordon feared separating children from there platforms could create pressures within families.",
      "Albanese said there would be exclusions and exemptions in circumstances such as a need to continue access to educational services.",
      "But parental consent would not entitle a child under 16 to access social media.",
      "Earlier this year, the government began a trial of age-restriciton technologies. Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, the online watchdog that will police compliance, will use the results of that trial to provide platforms with guidance on what reasonable steps they can take.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said the year-long lead-in would ensure the age limit could be implemented in a \u201cvery practical way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere does need to be enhanced penalties to ensure compliance,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "\u201cEvery company that operates in Australia, whether domiciled here or otherwise, is expected and must comply with Australian law or face the consequences,\u201d she added.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support for an age limit at 16.",
      "Opposition lawmaker Paul Fletcher said the platforms already had the technology to enforce such an age ban.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really a technical viability question, it\u2019s a question of their readiness to do it and will they incur the cost to do it,\u201d Fletcher told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThe platforms say: \u2019It's all too hard, we can\u2019t do it, Australia will become a backwater, it won\u2019t possibly work.' But if you have well-drafted legislation and you stick to your guns, you can get the outcomes,\u201d Fletcher added."

    "story": [
      "As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, there was a trade war, a breach of protocol involving Taiwan\u2019s former leader, and a president-to-president bromance that turned sour.",
      "As President-elect Trump prepares to start his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology and Taiwan.",
      "Perhaps the biggest consequence for China \u2014 if Trump stays true to his campaign promises \u2014 is his threat to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "Tariffs like that would be a blow to China\u2019s already unstable economy, which is suffering from high youth unemployment, a lengthy property slump and government debt. A 60% duty on Chinese imports could shave off 2.5 percentage points, or about half, of China\u2019s projected economic growth, according to an analysis published earlier this year by UBS.",
      "During Trump's previous term in office, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020 the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A research group a couple of years later showed China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised.",
      "President Joe Biden retained most of those tariffs and added fresh duties this year on imports including steel, solar cells and electric vehicles.",
      "Like last time, tariffs could serve as a tool to force Beijing back to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University who focuses on international trade.",
      "\u201cGiven the weak economic position of China this time, I think there will be more willingness to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, while the tariff might have some short-term effects on the Chinese economy, the situation might improve once they reach a deal.\u201d",
      "Factoring into the trade talks could be Trump\u2019s appeals to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate a resolution to the Ukraine war, which Trump has boasted he\u2019ll be able to do quickly, without saying how.",
      "Trump previously sought Xi's help in dealing with North Korea's rogue leader Kim Jong Un. That dynamic could repeat itself, with Trump weighing trade grievances against seeking China's support in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization.",
      "\u201cChina is the largest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine,\" Wang wrote in a recent commentary. \"These close economic ties give China a unique opportunity to play a greater role in peace-making efforts.\u201d",
      "There is one scenario in which Trump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs \u2014 150% to 200% \u2014 on Chinese goods: if China invades Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.",
      "Trump angered Beijing in December 2016 by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan\u2019s then-president Tsai Ing-wen in a breach of diplomatic protocol. No U.S. president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since Washington and Beijing established ties in 1979.",
      "Trump's move created anxiety in China-watching circles, but ultimately, he stuck to supporting the status quo in relations between Taipei and Beijing.",
      "China expects him to continue to do so, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University.",
      "\u201cWill (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,\u201d he said.",
      "As for China\u2019s repeated threats to annex Taiwan, Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that he would not have to use military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi \u201crespects me and he knows I\u2019m (expletive) crazy.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes talked up his personal connection with Xi, which started exuberantly during his first term but soured over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "But Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense, and purchased hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. weapons this year.",
      "In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. History has shown that both sides gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, Xi said.",
      "Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe are clear about the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump began targeting Chinese technology firms over security concerns, focusing on large companies like the telecoms giant Huawei. Biden continued in that direction by placing curbs on China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors, which are needed to develop strategic industries such as artificial intelligence.",
      "But Trump has criticized Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan bill that earmarked $53 billion to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90% of the world\u2019s supply of the most advanced chips.",
      "The island\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, expanded production in Arizona, partly to respond to the CHIPS Act, and to be prepared to withstand any other protectionist policies in the U.S., said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center.",
      "Trump has promised to do away with the CHIPS Act, though critics say that would undermine his campaign to reindustrialize the U.S. The president-elect has also accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the chip industry from the U.S. decades ago.",
      "\u201cRather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan\u2019s dominance in the chip industry could actually be the source of tension between Taipei and Trump, as Taiwan\u2019s successes in the chip sector may be seen as having only been possible as a result of the United States being taken advantage of,\u201d Goto said."

      "\u201cThey are not infected with any disease whatsoever. They are harmless and a little skittish,\u201d Yemassee Police Chief Gregory Alexander said Thursday morning.",
      "The Rhesus macaque primates escaped from the Alpha Genesis facility Wednesday when a new employee didn't fully shut an enclosure, Alexander said.",
      "The monkeys are females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms) and are so young and small that they haven't been used for testing, police said.",
      "Alpha Genesis employees \u201ccurrently have eyes on the primates and are working to entice them with food,\u201d police said in a statement issued around noon Thursday.",
      "The company usually handles escapes on site, but the monkeys got outside the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee, Alexander said.",
      "\u201cThe handlers know them well and usually can get them back with fruit or a little treat,\u201d Alexander told The Associated Press by phone.",
      "But rounding up these escapees is taking some more work. Alpha Genesis is taking the lead, setting up traps and using thermal imaging cameras to recapture the monkeys on the run, the chief said.",
      "\u201cThere is almost no danger to the public,\u201d Alexander said.",
      "People living nearby need to shut their windows and doors so the monkeys can't find a place to hide inside and if they see the primates, call 911 so company officials and police can capture them.",
      "Alpha Genesis provides primates for research worldwide at its compound about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia, according to its website. The company did not respond to an email asking about Wednesday's escape.",
      "In 2018, federal officials fined Alpha Genesis $12,600 after dozens of primates escaped as well as for an incident that left a few others without water and other problems with how the monkeys were housed.",
      "Officials said 26 primates escaped from the Yemassee facility in 2014 and an additional 19 got out in 2016.",
      "The group Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture asking the agency to immediately send an inspector to the Alpha Genesis facility, conduct a thorough investigation and treat them as a repeated violator. The group was involved in the 2018 fine against the company.",
      "\u201cThe clear carelessness which allowed these 40 monkeys to escape endangered not only the safety of the animals, but also put the residents of South Carolina at risk,\u201d Michael Budkie, the executive director of the group, wrote in the Thursday morning letter."

      "Leaders of the eight provinces held a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to discuss what he calls a world-first national approach that would make platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook responsible for enforcing the age limit.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing social harm to our young Australians,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThe safety and mental health of our young people has to be a priority.\"",
      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced into Parliament within two weeks, and the age ban would take effect a year after it passes into law, giving platforms time to work out how to exclude children. The government has yet to offer a technical solution.",
      "The delay is also intended to allow time to address privacy concerns around age verification.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support to the 16-year age limit since it was announced on Thursday, suggesting the legislation will pass the Senate.",
      "The minor Greens party was critical, saying the ban would prevent the emergence in Australia of future child environmental activists like Sweden's Greta Thunberg.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re also facing bullying and other challenges online, but they actually need the social supports to know how to navigate the platforms safely and so they need more support from parents, from care-givers, not less access to a single or multiple platforms,\u201d Given added.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, described the government\u2019s plan to remove 14 and 15-year-olds from their already established social media accounts was \u201cstrange.\u201d",

      "Authorities say 43 monkeys bred for medical research that escaped a compound in South Carolina have been spotted in the woods near a fence surrounding the site and that workers are using food to try to recapture them",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Forty-three monkeys bred for medical research that escaped a compound in South Carolina have been spotted in the woods near the site and workers are using food to try to recapture them, authorities said Friday.",
      "The Rhesus macaques made a break for it Wednesday after an employee at the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee didn't fully lock a door as she fed and checked on them, officials said.",
      "\u201cThey are very social monkeys and they travel in groups, so when the first couple go out the door the others tend to just follow right along,\u201d Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard told CBS News.",
      "Westergaard said his main goal is to have the monkeys returned safely with no other problems. \u201cI think they are having an adventure,\u201d he said.",
      "The monkeys on Friday were exploring the outer fence of the Alpha Genesis compound and are cooing at the monkeys inside, police said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe primates are exhibiting calm and playful behavior, which is a positive indication,\u201d the police statement said, adding company workers are closely watching the monkeys while keeping their distance as they work to safely recapture them.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police all said the monkeys pose no risk to public health. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical and other researchers.",
      "\u201cThey are not infected with any disease whatsoever. They are harmless and a little skittish,\u201d Yemassee Police Chief Gregory Alexander said Thursday.",
      "Authorities still recommend that people who live near the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee shut their windows and doors and call 911 if they see the monkeys. Approaching them could make them more skittish and harder to capture, officials said.",
      "Eve Cooper, a biology professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who has studied rhesus macaques, said the animals have the potential to be dangerous and urged people to keep their distance.",
      "Rhesus macaques monkeys can be aggressive. And some carry the herpes B virus, which can be fatal to humans, Cooper said.",
      "However, Alpha Genesis states on its website that it specializes in pathogen-free primates. Cooper noted that there are pathogen-free populations of rhesus macaques that have been quarantined and tested.",
      "\u201cI would give them a wide berth,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThey\u2019re unpredictable animals. And they can behave quite aggressively when they\u2019re afraid.\u201d",
      "Alpha Genesis provides primates for research worldwide at its compound about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia, according to its website.",
      "Locally, it is known as \u201cthe monkey farm.\u201d And there is more amusement than panic around Yemassee and its population of about 1,100 just off Interstate 95 about 2 miles from Auldbrass Plantation, a Frank Lloyd Wright house designed in the 1930s.",
      "There have been escapes before, but the monkeys haven't caused problems, said William McCoy, who owns Lowcountry Horology, a clock and watch repair shop.",
      "\u201cThey normally come home because that\u2019s where the food is,\" he said.",
      "McCoy has lived in Yemassee for about two years and while he plans to stay away from the monkeys, he has his own light-hearted plan to get them back.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m stocking up bananas, maybe they\u2019ll show up,\" McCoy said.",
      "The Alpha Genesis compound is regularly inspected by federal officials.",
      "In 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture fined Alpha Genesis $12,600 in part after officials said 26 primates escaped from the Yemassee facility in 2014 and an additional 19 got out in 2016.",
      "The company's fine was also issued because of individual monkey escapes as well as the killing of one monkey by others when it was placed in the wrong social group, according to a report from the USDA.",
      "The group Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent a letter Thursday to the USDA asking the agency to immediately send an inspector to the Alpha Genesis facility, conduct a thorough investigation and treat them as a repeated violator. The group was involved in the 2018 fine against the company.",
      "\u201cThe clear carelessness which allowed these 40 monkeys to escape endangered not only the safety of the animals, but also put the residents of South Carolina at risk,\u201d wrote Michael Budkie, executive director of the group.",
      "The USDA, which has inspected the compound 10 times since 2020, didn't immediately respond to the letter.",
      "The facility's most recent federal inspection in May showed there were about 6,700 primates on site and no issues.",
      "In a 2022 review, federal veterinarians reported two animals died when their fingers were trapped in structures and they were exposed to harsh weather. They also found cages weren't adequately secure. Inspectors said criminal charges, civil penalties or other sanctions could follow if the problems weren't fixed.",
      "Since then, Alpha Genesis has undergone six inspections with minor problems reported only once.",
      "In January 2023, the USDA said temperatures were out of the 45 to 85 degree Fahrenheit (7.2 to 29.5 degree Celsius) required range at some of the compound's monkey cages. The inspection found moldy food in one bin, sharp edges on a gate that could cut an animal and sludge, food waste, used medical supplies, mechanical equipment, and general construction debris on the grounds.",
      "Supporters of medical research involving nonhuman primates said they are critical to lifesaving medical advances like creating vaccines against COVID-19 because of their similarities to people. Keeping a domestic supply of the animals is critical to prevent shortages for U.S. researchers.",
      "Humans have been using the rhesus macaque for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe that rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "These monkeys have been launched into space on V2 rockets, used for AIDS research, had their genome mapped and made stars of their own reality television show. They were in such high demand in the early 2000s that a shortage led to scientists paying up to $10,000 per animal.",
      "Outside of rats and mice, rhesus macaques are one of the most studied animals on the planet, said Dario Maestripieri, a behavioral scientist at the University of Chicago who wrote the 2007 book \u201cMacachiavellian Intelligence: How Rhesus Macaques and Humans Have Conquered the World.\u201d",
      "The animals are very family oriented, siding with relatives when fights break out. And they\u2019re adept at building political alliances in the face of threats from other monkeys. But they can be painful to watch. Monkeys with lower status in the hierarchy live in a constant state of fear and intimidation, Maestripieri said.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, they kind of represent some of the worst aspects of human nature,\u201d Maestripieri said.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 15:22:24 -0500",
    "summary": "U.S. officials are proposing tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West",
    "story": [
      "U.S. officials are proposing tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Joe Biden's administration on Friday proposed tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West to protect a declining bird species.",
      "However, it is doubtful the changes would survive under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Greater sage grouse \u2014 chicken-sized birds known for an elaborate mating ritual\u2014 were once found across much of the U.S. West. Their numbers plummeted in recent decades because of energy exploration, wildfires, disease and other pressures.",
      "A 2015 agreement shepherded by the Obama administration kept the birds off the endangered species list, by imposing limits on where and when development could occur across their 270,000-square mile range.",
      "Now officials with the Interior Department want to make the protections even stronger. Their plan would eliminate loopholes that allowed development in areas considered crucial to the bird's long-term survival. New solar and wind projects would be excluded, and oil and gas exploration could only occur from drilling platforms located outside the protected areas.",
      "Trump has pushed to open more public lands to energy development in line with his mantra to \u201cdrill baby drill.\u201d During his first administration, officials attempted to scale back the Obama-era sage grouse protections, but they were blocked in court.",
      "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Friday's proposal would boost sage grouse while allowing development on some government lands to continue. She said the plan was based on the best science to protect the bird.",
      "\u201cFor too long, a false choice has been presented for land management that aims to pit development against conservation,\u201d Haaland said in a statement.",
      "Yet the agency's attempt to find a middle ground fell flat with environmentalists, industry representatives and Republican elected officials.",
      "Most of the land at issue \u2014 about 4,700 square miles \u2014 is in Nevada and California, according to government documents. Affected parcels also are in Wyoming, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Montana and the Dakotas.",
      "Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon lamented what he called the administration's \u201cextreme indifference\u201d to his state. The Republican governor said new layers of federal regulation would hinder practical solutions for the grouse.",
      "\u201cWe have shown how to successfully manage this bird and do so in a way that allows for protection of core habitat alongside responsible development,\u201d Gordon said.",
      "Environmentalists, meanwhile, said officials had squandered a chance to put in place meaningful protections that could halt the grouse's slow spiral towards extinction. They noted that loopholes allowing development would remain in place across nearly 50,000 square miles of public lands.",
      "\u201cIt's death by a thousands cuts,\u201d said Greta Anderson with Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group involved in previous sage grouse lawsuits. \u201cThe Biden administration could have stopped the cutting, and it didn't. The fact that it's less bad doesn't mean it's not bad.\u201d",
      "Federal officials predicted only minimal economic impacts. They said energy companies already steer clear of sage grouse habitat, where there are limits on when and where work can be done near breeding areas. Those companies can still find opportunities on other public lands, the officials said.",
      "That was disputed by an energy industry representative. Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance said the Biden administration already had limited leasing in sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cSo they\u2019ve denied access and then say companies are avoiding them anyway,\u201d Sgamma said. \u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management will accept protests against Friday's proposal until Dec. 9. Final decisions on changes to the agency's land management plans will be made after the protests are resolved.",
      "A related proposal to help sage grouse would block for 20 years new mining projects on more than 15,625 square miles in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. That proposal was part of the 2015 Obama-era protections. It was canceled under Trump then restored by a court.",
      "An analysis of the mining ban will be published by the end of the year, according to the Interior Department.",
      "Greater sage grouse once numbered in the millions across all or portions of 11 Western states. Populations have dropped 65% since 1986, according to government scientists."

      "The Canadian government is ordering the dissolution of TikTok\u2019s Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind the social media app but said it won\u2019t block access",
      "TORONTO -- Canada announced Wednesday it won\u2019t block access to the popular video-sharing app TikTok but is ordering the dissolution of its Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind it.",
      "Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said it is meant to address risks related to ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc.",
      "\u201cThe government is not blocking Canadians\u2019 access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" Champagne said.",
      "Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information.",
      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada\u2019s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson said in a statement that the shutdown of its Canadian offices will mean the loss of hundreds of local jobs.",
      "\u201cWe will challenge this order in court,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive.\u201d",
      "TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",
      "TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips.",
      "Canada previously banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. TikTok has two offices in Canada, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver.",
      "Michael Geist, Canada research chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in a blog post that \"banning the company rather than the app may actually make matters worse since the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.\u201d",
      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said \u201cthe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned\u201d by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.",
      "Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China\u2019s government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked.",
      "Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It\u2019s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell.",

      "The messages, sent anonymously, were reported in several states, including New York, Alabama, California, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. They generally used a similar tone but varied in wording.",
      "Some instructed the recipient to show up at an address at a particular time \u201cwith your belongings,\u201d while others didn't include a location. Some of them mentioned the incoming presidential administration.",

      "TOKYO -- A robot that has spent months inside the ruins of a nuclear reactor at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant delivered a tiny sample of melted nuclear fuel on Thursday, in what plant officials said was a step toward beginning the cleanup of hundreds of tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months.",
      "Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed.",
      "The first sample alone is not enough and additional small-scale sampling missions will be necessary in order to obtain more data, TEPCO spokesperson Kenichi Takahara told reporters Thursday. \u201cIt may take time, but we will steadily tackle decommissioning,\u201d Takahara said.",
      "Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the. plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site's highly radioactive interior remains a mystery.",
      "The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit.",
      "That's led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel.",
      "The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps \u2014 the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure.",
      "On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than 3 grams (.01 ounces) from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said.",
      "Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out.",
      "On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment.",
      "The sample return marks the first time the melted fuel is retrieved out of the containment vessel.",
      "Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive melted fuel remains in them.",
      "The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target to finish the cleanup by 2051, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. Some say it would take for a century or longer.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said there have been some delays but \u201cthere will be no impact on the entire decommissioning process.\u201d",
      "No specific plans for the full removal of the fuel debris or its final disposal have been decided."

    "story": [
      "The assets of Alex Jones' Infowars are set to be auctioned off next week, and both supporters and detractors of the conspiracy theorist are expressing interest in bidding",
      "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars broadcasts could end next week as he faces a court-ordered auction of his company's assets to help pay the more than $1 billion defamation judgment he owes families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Or maybe not.",
      "Both opponents and supporters of the bombastic internet show and radio host have expressed interest in bidding on the Infowars properties he has built over the past 25 years. They include Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and Donald Trump, and anti-Jones progressive media groups. If Jones supporters buy the assets, he could end up staying on Infowars.",
      "Up for sale are everything from Jones' studio desk to Infowars' name, video archive, social media accounts and product trademarks. Buyers can even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. For now, Jones' personal social media, including his account on X, formerly known as Twitter, with 3 million followers, are not up for sale, but court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "The auctions resulted from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after the Sandy Hook families were awarded nearly $1.5 billion in damages in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas over his claims that the school shooting was a hoax. Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets also are being liquidated to help pay the judgment.",
      "The deadline to submit bids and nondisclosure agreements on the Infowars assets is Friday afternoon. After the bids are reviewed, prospective buyers deemed qualified will be invited to a live auction that could see multiple bidding rounds next Wednesday. Any items not sold will be put up at another auction on Dec. 10.",
      "Jones has expressed confidence that supporters \u2014 whom he did not name \u2014 will buy the assets of Infowars and its parent company, Free Speech Systems, allowing him to continue using its platforms. He also appears to be preparing for losing the brand because he has set up new websites and social media accounts and has been directing his audience to them.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of buyers, people that are patriots that want it and will come in,\u201d Jones said on his show in August. \u201cIf not ... we'll work with somebody else, fire something up. And it\u2019ll be a little bit of a hiccup for the crew, and things. But that will just make us bigger.\u201d",
      "Email messages to Infowars and Jones' bankruptcy lawyer were not returned.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much money the auctions might bring in. In court documents, Free Speech Systems listed the total value of its properties and holdings at $18 million. Proceeds from the sales will go to creditors including the Sandy Hook families, who have not yet received any money from Jones and his company.",
      "Confidentiality agreements and sealed bids generally are used in auctions to maximize bid amounts while preventing bidders from talking to each other and driving down the offers. The trustee in Jones' bankruptcy case said in court documents that the procedures for the Infowars auction were designed to attract the highest possible bids.",
      "Christopher Mattei, a Connecticut lawyer representing the Sandy Hook families, called the auctions an important milestone in their yearslong fight to hold Jones accountable. He also said the families will be seeking a portion of all Jones' future income.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning, the Connecticut families have sought to hold Jones fully accountable for his lies and to protect other families from him,\u201d Mattei said. \u201cStripping Jones of the corrupt business he used to attack the families while poisoning the minds of his listeners is an important measure of justice.\u201d",
      "The families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 hoax conspiracies and threats by his followers.",
      "Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the judgments.",
      "Jones has made millions of dollars from his internet and radio shows, primarily through sales of nutritional supplements, survival gear, clothing and other merchandise.",
      "Jones and other right-wing commentators once on the fringe have catapulted in popularity as many people have moved away from traditional news sources. Trump elevated them further during his 2024 campaign by repeating some of their conspiracy theories and appearing on several of their podcasts and shows. On Thursday, Jones, a long-time Trump supporter, even accepted proposals, some perhaps tongue-in-cheek, by Donald Trump Jr. and other conservatives to be the president-elect's press secretary.",
      "Stone, the Jones and Trump ally and a conservative commentator, said on his X account and on Jones' show that he would like to put together a group of investors to buy Infowars. He did not return email and social media messages on Thursday.",
      "\u201cI understand the importance of Infowars as a beacon of the truth, as a beacon of truthful information. And therefore, I would like to do whatever I possibly can to ensure, if possible, that Infowars survives,\" Stone said on Jones' show in September.",
      "People on social media also have urged billionaire Elon Musk, owner of Tesla and X, to buy Infowars, an idea Jones has backed but Musk has not publicly responded to.",
      "On the other side, Jones' detractors have shown interest in buying Infowars, kicking Jones out and turning it into something else, such as a news site that debunks conspiracy theories or even a parody site. They include officials at two progressive media sites, The Barbed Wire and Media Matters for America.",
      "An opinion piece by The Barbed Wire in September by publisher Jeff Rotkoff had a headline that read, \"Let\u2019s Buy Infowars. Alex Jones used these exact materials to exploit his viewers, peddle conspiracy theories, and damage the lives of grieving parents. We want revenge.\u201d",
      "Rotkoff urged readers to donate money to help put in bids, but he said Thursday that The Barbed Wire, based in Jones' home state of Texas, was now unlikely to make any offers.",
      "\u201cBut we have talked to a number of similarly ideologically aligned bidders and we are certain we will be outbid,\u201d Rotkoff said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that there appear to be multiple well-resourced bidders who share our interest in undoing much of the damage to our country done by Alex Jones. We\u2019ll be rooting for those folks to be successful.\u201d",
      "He declined to say who the other potential bidders were.",
      "Who exactly has submitted bids so far has not been disclosed. Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, which is helping to run the auction along with Tranzon Asset Advisors, would only say there have been a large number of inquiries.",
      "If detractors buy up Infowars' properties and Jones gets the boot, he should be able to build new platforms fairly quickly, said Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor of communication and media at Merrimack College in Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cAs long as there is an audience hungry for his content \u2014 and there is \u2014 he\u2019ll be able to utilize X and various fringe social media platforms,\" she said in an email."

      "RENO, Nev. -- Conservationists and an advocacy group for Native Americans are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources.",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.",
      "The new lawsuit says the Interior Department\u2019s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat was \u201cin danger of extinction now\u201d when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.",
      "\u201cOne cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,\u201d said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno.",
      "\u201cThe use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,\u201d said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.",
      "Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.",
      "Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and \u201cvigorously defend\u201d approval of the project, \u201cwhich was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",

      "A small facility in Cyprus is hosting senior government officials from as far as Algeria, Iraq and Georgia for training by top U.S. experts to prevent the kinds of materials used to build weapons of mass destruction from crossing their borders",
      "LARNACA, Cyprus -- From as far as Algeria, Iraq and Georgia, an assortment of senior government officials converge on this small facility for training by top U.S. experts to prevent the kinds of materials used to build weapons of mass destruction from crossing their borders.",
      "In just its third year of operation, the U.S.-funded Cyprus Centre for Land, Open Seas and Port Security (CYCLOPS) has far exceeded expectations. From the dozen courses that officials were initially hoping to hold annually, demand has skyrocketed, with scheduled training sessions for next year expected to surpass 50, says the center\u2019s director Chrysilios Chrysiliou.",
      "So far, over 2,000 officials from 20 countries including Yemen, Libya, Armenia and Ukraine, have received training on radiological and nuclear detection for customs officers, methods of smuggling weapons of mass destruction, and chemical terrorism investigations among a host of other topics.",
      "On Monday, a group of Cypriot and Egyptian officials started a two-day seminar on maritime cybersecurity led by the U.S.-based Sandia National Laboratories.",
      "\u201cThis uniqueness has actually brought ... a lot of success which could not had been foreseen when Cyclops was initially being created,\u201d Chrysiliou told the Associated Press.",
      "According to Chrysiliou, key to the center\u2019s success has been the top-notch level of instruction participants receive from U.S.-based experts, including from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, that specialize in counter-proliferation programs.",
      "The center also boasts an array of the latest in cutting-edge detectors able to sniff out radiological, chemical and biological agents and explosives that countries in the wider region don\u2019t possess or have access to.",
      "\u201cHere, the participants have the opportunity to see the latest technology in in detecting all of the range of the threats,\u201d said Chrysiliou. \u201cIt\u2019s like a showcase of what exists out in the market.\u201d",
      "For instance, trainees are taught on how to detect and properly dispose of the radiological elements of discarded medical equipment that militants could use to fashion a weapon. Another emerging threat is the possible use of off-the-shelf drones to disperse chemical or biological agents over populated centers.",
      "CYCLOPS has been the product of ever-closer Cypriot-U.S. defense and security ties, earning plaudits from U.S. officials all the way up to the White House. During Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides\u2019 meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden last week, the center figured prominently as an example of enhanced bilateral security cooperation.",
      "The center was built on a $7 million U.S. government grant, $2 million of which was for the purchase of border security equipment. The island nation's proximity to the Middle East was seen as an asset to helping train officials from the region, whose options for such training would otherwise be very limited. The Cypriot government has secured another $5.6 million in European Union funding to expand the center and purchase additional high-tech equipment.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s such a huge interest by different agencies of the U.S. and the U.N. too, because they have seen the value of utilizing CYCLOPS because of its proximity to their neighboring countries,\u201d Chrysiliou said.",
      "Another selling point for the center is that it\u2019s situated a stone\u2019s throw away from Cyprus\u2019 main international airport of Larnaca and is close to top-flight accommodations that this tourism-reliant country is known for.",
      "The center's managers want to procure an expansive virtual reality system enabling officials to safely train on biological, chemical and radiological agents. Chrysiliou liaises daily with Kevin Keeler from the U.S. State Department\u2019s Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) program, who called the VR system a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d",
      "Although the center does have small quantities of radiological and other dangerous substances for training, a virtual simulator would greatly enhance the center\u2019s training capacity.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already put the word out about this new virtual simulator and we have agencies like, okay, how can we get on the schedule next year when it\u2019s not even been built yet? Yes, because it\u2019s a big factor in today\u2019s world,\u201d said Keeler.",
      "It\u2019s still early days for the center to count on headline-grabbing cases where WMD materials have been seized at any given border. Chrysiliou said what\u2019s equally important in acting as a potent deterrent is to send out the message that trained professionals \u201chave the means and the ways to check and stop you.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo if we teach Iraqis or Yemenis or Libyans or from other countries to do a better job in controlling their borders, in controlling the dispersion of weapons of mass destruction ... it makes their citizens much safer and more secure,\u201d said Chrysiliou."

      "Japan is planning an automated cargo transport corridor between Tokyo and Osaka to make up for a shortage of truck drivers",
      "TOKYO -- Japan is planning to build an automated cargo transport corridor between Tokyo and Osaka, dubbed a \u201cconveyor belt road\u201d by the government, to make up for a shortage of truck drivers.",
      "The amount of funding for the project is not yet set. But it's seen as one key way to help the country cope with soaring deliveries.",
      "A computer graphics video made by the government shows big, wheeled boxes moving along a three-lane corridor, also called an \u201cauto flow road,\u201d in the middle of a big highway. A trial system is due to start test runs in 2027 or early 2028, aiming for full operations by the mid-2030s.",
      "\u201cWe need to be innovative with the way we approach roads,\u201d said Yuri Endo, a senior deputy director overseeing the effort at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.",
      "Apart from making up for a shrinking labor force and the need to reduce workloads for drivers, the system also will help cut carbon emissions, she said.",
      "\u201cThe key concept of the auto flow-road is to create dedicated spaces within the road network for logistics, utilizing a 24-hour automated and unmanned transportation system,\u201d Endo said.",
      "The plan may sound like a solution that would only work in relatively low-crime, densely populated societies like Japan, not sprawling nations like the U.S. But similar ideas are being considered in Switzerland and Great Britain. The plan in Switzerland involves an underground pathway, while the one being planned in London will be a fully automated system running on low-cost linear motors.",
      "In Japan, loading will be automated, using forklifts, and coordinated with airports, railways and ports.",
      "The boxes measure 180 centimeters in height, or nearly six feet, and are 110 centimeters, or 3.6 feet, by 110 centimeters in width and length, about the size of a big closet.",
      "The system, which is also intended for business deliveries, may be expanded to other routes if all goes well. Human drivers may still have to do last-mile deliveries to people's doors, although driverless technology may be used in the future.",
      "Japan's shortage of truck drivers is worsening due to laws that took effect earlier this year that limit the amount of overtime drivers can log. That's seen as necessary to avoid overwork and accidents and to make the jobs tolerable, but in Japanese logistics, government and transportation circles, it\u2019s known as the \u201c2024 problem.\u201d",
      "Under current conditions, Japan's overall transport capacity will plunge by 34% by 2030, according to government estimates. The domestic transport capacity stands at about 4.3 billion metric tons, almost all, or more than 91%, by trucks, according to the Japan Trucking Association.",
      "That's a fraction of what's moving in a massive country like the U.S. About 5.2 trillion ton-miles of freight are transported in the United States each year, and that's projected to reach more than 8 trillion ton-miles of freight by 2050. A ton-mile measures the amount of freight shipped and how far it\u2019s moved, with the standard unit being one ton being moved one mile.",
      "Demand for deliveries from online shopping surged during the pandemic, with users jumping from about 40% of Japanese households to more than 60%, according to government data, even as the overall population keeps declining as the birth rate falls.",
      "As is true in most places, truck drivers have tough jobs requiring them to be on the road for days at a time, work that most jobseekers find unappealing.",
      "In recent years, annual fatalities from delivery trucks crashing on roads have hovered at about 1,000 deaths. That's improved from nearly 2,000 deaths in 2010, but the Trucking Association, which groups some 400 trucking businesses and organizations in the nation, would like to make deliveries even safer.",
      "The association is also urging consumers to hold back on delivery orders or at least bundle their orders. Some industry experts are urging businesses to limit free delivery offers.",
      "Trucks carry about 90% of Japan\u2019s cargo, and about 60% of Japan\u2019s fresh produce, like fruits and vegetables, come from distant places requiring trucking, according to Yuji Yano, a professor at the Ryutsu Keizai University, which is funded? by deliveries giant Nippon Express Co., now called NX Holdings, and focuses on economics and liberal arts studies, including trucking problems.",
      "\u201cThat means the 2024 problem isn\u2019t just a transportation problem but really a people\u2019s problem,\u201d Yano said.",

Trump,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement announcing the charges.",
      "Shakeri emigrated to the United States but was deported in 2008 after serving prison time for robbery, according to the Justice Department. While in prison, he met Rivera and Loadholt and hired them to target an Iranian American activist living in Brooklyn, according to the complaint.",
      "While she is not named in the complaint, the activist matches the description of Masih Alinejad, a prolific journalist and human rights activist who has been critical of the Iranian government and targeted in multiple plots. Federal prosecutors announced criminal charges last month against IRGC Brig. Gen. Ruhollah Bazghandi in connection with an alleged murder plot against Alinejad.",
      "Alinejad later posted on social media that she was one of the targets, writing, \"I am shocked. I just learned from the @FBI that two men were arrested yesterday in a new plot to kill me at Fairfield University, where I was scheduled to give a talk.\"",

      "He also stated he was tasked with surveilling two Jewish-American citizens residing in New York City and was offered $500,000 by an IRGC official for the murder of either victim, according to the complaint. He was also tasked with targeting Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka, the complaint said.",
      "\"Actors directed by the Government of Iran continue to target our citizens, including President-elect Trump, on U.S. soil and abroad. This has to stop,\" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. \"Today's charges are another message to those who continue in their efforts -- we will remain unrelenting in our pursuit of bad actors, no matter where they reside, and will stop at nothing to bring to justice those who harm our safety and security.\"",

      "The high-stakes standoff has elicited questions about what Trump could do to overcome the Fed\u2019s longstanding independence, whether such maneuvers could prove effective and what it may mean for everyday Americans.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know, according to experts:",
      "What could Trump do to meddle with the Federal Reserve?",
      "The Federal Reserve Act, which founded the central bank in 1913, granted the central bank a measure of independence from the White House.",
      "In actuality, however, the Fed has only enjoyed independence since the early 1950s, when the central bank did away with a policymaking role taken up by the Treasury Department.",
      "Federal law allows the president to remove a Federal Reserve governor, including the Fed chair, \u201cfor cause.\u201d",
      "Experts who spoke to ABC News acknowledged that some legal ambiguity looms over what type of conduct warrants sufficient cause for removal, but they said a policy dispute is unlikely to meet such a standard. Still, Trump could attempt to push out Powell and test how courts interpret the law, experts added, noting that the case could end up with the conservative-majority Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cTrump could try and he might try,\u201d Alan Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton University and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that he has that authority, but if he takes this to the Supreme Court, I don\u2019t know what to think of the Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "Instead, Trump could leave Powell in his position on the Fed\u2019s 7-member Board of Governors but demote him from his role as chair, Blinder said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a subtle question that has never been tested,\u201d Blinder said, acknowledging a lack of clarity about whether it would be allowed. \u201cWe can\u2019t answer that quite as definitively.\u201d",
      "If the courts reject Trump or he wants a sure path to the removal of Powell, Trump could push Congress to amend the Federal Reserve Act in a manner that weakens or eliminates the Fed\u2019s independence, experts said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Congress\u2019s prerogative,\u201d Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project and senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, told ABC News. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something written at the top of Mount Sinai.\u201d",
      "As he did on numerous occasions over his first term, Trump could also try to influence Fed policy through public criticism of the central bank in general and Powell in particular, experts said.",
      "\"I feel the president should have at least [a] say in there,\" Trump said about interest rate policy during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in August.",
      "Could Trump successfully influence interest rate decisions, and why does it matter?",
      "Experts cast doubt on the prospect of Trump meaningfully influencing the Fed\u2019s interest rate decisions, at least in the short term.",
      "The attempted removal of Powell would likely get tied up in the courts for months, if not years, while an effort to pass new legislation would face steep odds in the Senate, where it would need to overcome a 60-vote threshold necessary to overcome a filibuster, the experts said.",
      "Powell would likely resist a campaign of public pressure undertaken by Trump, just as Powell did the first time around, experts added.",
      "Trump would also face a potentially steep decline in the stock market if he appeared to seriously threaten the independence of the Fed, some experts said. Bank executives and other business leaders would likely voice stiff opposition, fearing economic instability and runaway inflation, they added.",
      "\u201cTrying to overcome Fed independence would be highly disruptive,\u201d said Mark Spindel, chief investment officer at Potomac River Capital and co-author of \u201cThe Myth of Independence: How Congress Governs the Federal Reserve.\u201d \u201cI think the market would be an important consideration in all these efforts.\u201d",
      "Trump, however, could simply wait for his opportunity to appoint loyal personnel at the central bank, according to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed official. In 2026, Powell\u2019s term will expire and Trump will appoint a replacement, who will then require Senate confirmation.",
      "\u201cFrankly, the easy thing is to wait a year and nominate someone else,\u201d Sahm said.",
      "The status of Fed independence holds important stakes for everyday people, Sahm added. A central bank that lacks independence is more likely to throw its dual mandate of stable inflation and maximum employment out of whack, since politicians tend to prioritize short-term economic performance over long-term steadiness, Sahm said.",
      "\u201cIf you have a central bank that does what the president wants instead of what the economy needs, then we can end up with high inflation, high unemployment and financial instability,\u201d Sahm said.",

    "summary": "U.S. climate leaders met Friday to discuss their goals for progress under the new Trump administration, calling his threatened rollbacks of the IRA a \"fool's errand.\"",
    "story": [
      "Climate leaders say states will drive progress during Trump's second term.",
      "Former Biden White House National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy on Friday called any attempt to roll back Inflation Reduction Act funds by the incoming Trump administration a \"fool's errand\" during a call with U.S. climate leaders on their continued goals for climate progress.",
      "\"We'll do everything in our power to stop efforts to unwind the progress we have made, to double down on local action, and to push private sector investments and to fill the federal leadership gap so that we can achieve our country's global commitments,\" McCarthy, now managing co-chair of the U.S climate coalition America is All In, said. \"All of us stand ready to work with Democrats and Republicans to protect the Inflation Reduction Act and keep our federal agencies active, safe and secure.\"",
      "Representatives from America is All In, U.S. Climate Alliance and Climate Mayors were all on the call, discussing with reporters how they plan to \"continue protecting and building on climate progress despite the incoming Trump administration.\"",
      "McCarthy explained that billions of dollars in public and private investments in clean energy, including through the Inflation Reduction Act, have greatly benefitted Republican-led districts.",
      "\"Federal policies have led to $910 billion in public and private sector investments all across the country, as plants are being built to produce batteries, to help clean up our heavy industries and deliver more clean renewable power than ever before -- not to mention more than 330,000 good paying jobs created,\" McCarthy said. \"And the bulk of these investments in job growth can be found in Republican districts. Look that's why congressional members have been running to ribbon-cuttings. It's absolutely undeniable that clean energy is good for businesses, local economies and all Americans. That's what is telling me that any attempt to roll back the IRA is simply a fool's errand.\"",
      "President-elect Donald Trump said in September that he would \"rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act,\" during remarks at the Economic Club of New York.",
      "He spoke frequently on the campaign trail about rolling back environmental regulations and clean energy investments implemented during the Biden administration.",
      "Even before Trump was projected to win the 2024 presidential race earlier this week, climate and environmental groups have been sounding the alarm over the potential climate impacts of a second Trump administration.",
      "On Wednesday, hours after ABC News projected Trump's win, organizations including the National Resources Defense Council, World Resources Institute, Sunrise Movement, the Center for Biological Diversity, and others put out statements about their concerns around the incoming administration and reaffirming their dedication to pursuing climate progress.",
      "\"There is no denying that another Trump presidency will stall national efforts to tackle the climate crisis and protect the environment, but most U.S. state, local, and private sector leaders are committed to charging ahead,\" Dan Lashof, U.S. Director of World Resources Institute, said Wednesday. \"And you can count on a chorus of world leaders confirming that they won't turn their back on climate and nature goals.\"",
      "Earlier Friday, during the climate leaders' call, Govs. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, and Jay Inslee of Washington, echoed the sentiment that state and local governments would lead the charge on climate goals like increased development of clean energy and striving to meet emissions reductions benchmarks set out in the Paris Agreement.",
      "\"We know we have a responsibility to continue to address the climate crisis and to engage in every way possible, and to remind not just everyone in the United States, but frankly globally, that governors act as sub-nationals, irrespective of what the agenda is by leadership in the White House,\" Lujan Grisham said. \"We've been in this position before. We are going to continue our commitments.\"",
      "Lujan Grisham and Inslee are both members of the U.S. Climate Alliance, which calls itself \"a bipartisan coalition of 24 governors securing America's net-zero future by advancing state-led, high-impact climate action.\"",
      "Inslee said that in his home state of Washington, \"We look at Donald Trump as a speed bump on the road to progress towards a clean energy economy, and we are rolling big time.\"",
      "\"My number one message is progress is going to continue in the United States,\" he said. \"It will be driven by states who have already demonstrated that if you adopt clean energy policies, you will simultaneously grow your economy and reduce carbon emissions.\""

    "summary": "Claiming superior leadership and casting himself as the true agent of change were keys to Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, an ABC News exit poll found.",
    "story": [
      "Trump also led among \"double hater\" voters, poll finds.",
      "Claiming superior leadership and casting himself as the true agent of change were keys to Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election, per ABC News exit poll results.",
      "He also prevailed by a wide margin among the small group of so-called \"double haters\" -- voters with an unfavorable opinion of both candidates.",
      "In a list of four candidate qualities, 30% of voters nationally rated \"has the ability to lead\" as most important to their vote, and about as many, 28%, chose \"can bring needed change.\" Fewer picked \"has good judgment\" (20%) or \"cares about people like me\" (18%).",
      "These choices were closely tied to candidate preferences. Among those who cited leadership ability as the top candidate attribute, Trump beat Kamala Harris by 2-1, 66-33%. On bringing about change, the gap widened to 3-1, 74-24%.",
      "That huge gap on change reflects Harris' difficulties distancing herself from the unpopular Biden administration, a dynamic covered in ABC News/Ipsos pre-election polling. Seventy-four percent of Americans said they wanted Harris, if elected, to take a new direction from President Joe Biden's. Only 33% thought she would.",
      "Harris pushed back with big leads among voters who picked judgment or empathy as most important -- but there were fewer of them.",
      "Taken another way, among Trump supporters, 41% chose \"can bring needed change\" as the most important candidate attribute in their vote and 40% chose leadership, totaling to eight in 10 of all his voters.",
      "By contrast, about six in 10 Harris supporters chose judgment or caring as top qualities to them. Compared with Trump, half as many cited leadership and a third as many picked the ability to bring change.",
      "Personal favorability was another factor.",
      "In 2020, Biden was seen favorably by 52%, 6 percentage points above Trump's 46%. This year, Harris ended up rated essentially as unfavorably as Trump -- 47-52%, favorable-unfavorable, for Harris, and 46-53% for Trump. (This is a change from preliminary exit poll results, in which Trump was 11 points underwater in favorability, Harris just 2 points.)",
      "Notably, Trump won the 8% of voters who rated both candidates unfavorably, by 26 points, 56-30%.",
      "Look also at assessments of how extreme the candidates' views were: 47% said Harris' views were too extreme; 54% said that of Trump. But among those who said both were too extreme, again 8% of voters, Trump won by a broad 42 points, 63-21%.",

      "We're tracking who will win the House and other outstanding contests.",
      "The presidential race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris has been decided, but there are still several downballot races where the winner isn't yet apparent. Control of the House of Representatives is still up in the air, and while ABC News has projected that Republicans will win the Senate, the size of their majority is still TBD.

      "Nov 07, 2024, 6:16 PM ESTMore updates on the outstanding vote in Pennsylvania",
      "Maine's 2nd District will be decided in an instant runoff",
      "Late last night, the Maine secretary of state announced that no candidate for Maine's 2nd Congressional District had gotten a majority of first-place votes, so the race will be decided in an instant runoff next week. (Maine uses ranked-choice voting, whereby voters rank candidates in order of preference, the candidate with the fewest first-place votes is eliminated and that candidate's votes go to whoever their voters ranked second on their ballots. This process repeats until one candidate gets a majority.)",
      "The secretary of state also released final results for voters' first choices in the race: Democratic. Rep. Jared Golden got 196,189 first-place votes, Republican Austin Theriault got 194,030, write-in candidate Diana Merenda got 420, and 12,635 voters did not mark a first-place vote. Interestingly, that means Golden got a majority of first-place votes, but not a majority of all ballots cast \u2014 and that's enough to trigger the instant runoff (although Golden's campaign has formally lodged an objection to this). That's because, theoretically, someone could have left their first choice blank but voted for Golden or Theriault as their second choice, which might affect the final numbers. However, according to FairVote, only 6% of ballots that didn't mark a first choice in the 2022 race for this seat marked a second choice, and in 2018, it was only 9%. That suggests it's very unlikely that there are enough \"hidden\" second-place votes to vault Theriault ahead of Golden.",
      "Abortion measures and a Trump presidency",
      "On Tuesday, voters in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, New York and Nevada passed measures that would enshrine abortion rights in their state constitutions, making abortion a winning issue in 7 of the 10 states where it was on the ballot. But voters in Missouri, Montana and Nevada also voted to send Trump, who appointed the judges who overturned Roe v. Wade, back to the White House. The presidential race has yet to be projected in Arizona, but Trump leads there, too.",
      "An April survey by nonpartisan research firm PerryUndem found that 35% of Trump voters would at least lean toward voting for a constitutional amendment that protected the right to abortion in their state. That was especially true of Trump voters who were women, younger, described themselves as liberal or moderate, or were voters of color.",
      "A poll from September from The New York Times/Siena College also suggested that many of these voters also don't think Trump would try to restrict abortion nationwide if elected: 49% of all likely voters and just 27% of Republicans in that poll thought he would. So many voters may simply feel that voting to protect abortion in their state is sufficient, and that Trump will not make good on Republican calls for a national ban.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line in my view is \u2026 Abortion rights and access is more popular than Trump. It\u2019s more popular than Harris. It\u2019s more popular than the Democratic Party or the Republican Party,\u201d said Tresa Undem, a cofounder of PerryUndem. \u201cBut, among Trump voters, it wasn\u2019t the driving issue for voting for Trump.\u201d",
      "Some Republicans have waffled on whether they would try to ban abortion nationally. A 538 analysis of this year's GOP primaries found that in swing states and toss-up districts, Republican candidates were much less likely to mention abortion and more likely to say the issue was best left up to the states, while candidates in red states and solid Republican districts were very likely to support a national ban. The GOP left the endorsement of a national ban on abortion off their platform this year for the first time in nearly 40 years, and House Republicans in the current Congress did not pursue one either (though it was a moot issue since it wouldn't have passed in a Democratic Senate). But Trump has flip-flopped on a national abortion ban in the past, even as it remains a key goal of anti-abortion advocates nationwide. Such a ban by a newly elected Republican Senate, House and president (assuming House Republicans remain on track to hold their majority) could render the state-level initiatives that have passed since Roe was overturned useless \u2014 though it's far from certain that they would pursue or be able to pass such an unpopular policy.",
      "Surprising stasis as Pennsylvania Democrats hold General Assembly",
      "The 2022 elections for the Pennsylvania General Assembly were the first with new legislative maps, and the Democrats won control of the state's lower legislative chamber that year by the thinnest of margins \u2014 a single seat. They hadn\u2019t previously controlled the chamber since 2010.",
      "This year, Pennsylvania\u2019s rightward shift at the top of the ticket was very closely watched nationwide. But with conservative Democrat Frank Burns from Cambria County holding his seat, the Democrats have now managed to hold on to the General Assembly by the exact same razor-thin margin as in 2022. With the statewide vote shifting to the GOP, it's remarkable that the balance of power in the General Assembly is unchanged.",
      "While ballots are still being counted in Pennsylvania\u2019s 2024 Senate race, Republican Dave McCormick has a lead of half a percentage point at present \u2014 a notable shift from 2022, when Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman beat Mehmet Oz by almost 5 percentage points. Republicans did even better downballot in Pennsylvania \u2014 the GOP's attorney general candidate prevailed statewide by almost 5 percentage points, and their candidates for auditor general and state treasurer did even better.",
      "While this surprising stasis requires more analysis, I suspect that the distribution of Republican votes was part of the story. Higher turnout in rural, GOP-leaning parts of the state might not have helped GOP House candidates even as it may have put Trump and quite possibly McCormick over the top.",
      "Two more House holds in Pennsylvania and Oregon",
      "ABC News reports that Republican Rep. Scott Perry has held off his challenger, Democrat Janelle Stelson, in Pennsylvania's 10th District. Perry, a former chair of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, was favored to win this central Pennsylvania district that includes the state capital of Harrisburg, though the limited polling from earlier this year showed the two locked in a very close race, with Stelson even leading in some polls. With 99% of the expected vote reporting, Perry leads 50.8% to Stelson's 49.2%.",
      "On the other side of the country, Democratic Rep. Andrea Salinas is projected to keep her seat in Oregon's 6th District, which includes Salem and part of the Portland suburbs. This isn't a big surprise in the blue-leaning district, which was created after 2020 redistricting gave Oregon one more seat in the House. But Salinas had won election by just 2.5 points in 2022, so Republicans saw it as a potential pickup opportunity. This year, she faced the same opponent, Republican Mike Erickson, but she's currently poised to improve on her 2022 margin: With 72% of the expected vote reporting, she leads Erickson by 6 percentage points.",

    "summary": "The U.S. election system passed a critical test, after months of widespread public concern about security of ballots, accuracy of the count, and timeliness of results.",
    "story": [
      "Despite false conspiracies, security concerns, the U.S. election system worked.",
      "It sustained relentless attacks on its integrity up until the moment a winner was declared.",
      "In the end, the U.S. election system passed a critical test in 2024, after months of widespread public concern about the security of ballots, accuracy of the count, and timeliness of results.",
      "\"I hope we can lay to rest the question about the integrity of the American electoral system,\" President Joe Biden said in a national address Thursday. \"It is honest, it is fair, and it is transparent, and it can be trusted, win or lose. \"",
      "To be sure, Biden (and most Democrats, according to polls) never doubted the integrity of the system. It was former President Donald Trump and his Republican supporters who for years embraced unsubstantiated conspiracy theories to believe the system is rigged.",
      "Until polls began to close on Nov. 5, Trump was still raising unfounded claims of fraud. Then, suddenly, he dropped the subject when it became clear he would win.",
      "State election officials nationwide -- members of both political parties -- have since resoundingly reported no systemic disruptions or signs of widespread fraud emerging in the general election.",
      "\"Battle-tested,\" declared Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was at the center of the partisan battle over 2020 election results. \"That just shows you the resilience of our system and our people.\"",
      "The relative seamlessness of the election process followed weeks of warnings about threats of interference by foreign adversaries, potential disruptions from artificial intelligence, armies of partisan poll watchers, and unprecedented pre-election litigation.",
      "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is responsible for tracking threats to the vote nationwide, said there was \"no evidence of malicious activity impacting the security or integrity\" of the election and only \"minor\" disruptions from outside influences.",
      "Non-credible bomb threats of suspected Russian-origin were lodged in at least four states, briefly disrupting operations in some places, but not derailing the vote.",
      "Equipment malfunctions and garden-variety human errors caused long lines and processing delays at a smattering of polling places nationwide; those happen every year.",
      "Civil rights advocates cited only isolated instances of alleged voter intimidation or discrimination, despite a wave of new GOP-sponsored legislation in dozens of states tightening requirements for mail ballots and voter ID.",
      "To many observers, the urgent efforts of patriotic and nonpartisan local election administrations to modernize voting equipment, improve transparency, and educate the public on procedures deserve credit for building trust.",
      "Many of those election workers performed their duty in a highly stressful environment, often with their personal safety at risk.",
      "They \"busted their necks and took risks,\" Biden said in his remarks. \"Thank them for staffing voting sites, counting the votes, protecting the very integrity of the election. Many of them are volunteers who do it simply out of love for their country.\"",
      "One measure of their success: the absence of lawsuits contesting vote procedures or election results processing and certification. After the most litigated pre-election period in history, neither party has any major pending post-election litigation in state or federal courts.",

    "summary": "Vice President-elect JD Vance has served in the U.S. Senate for less than two years and soon the process will begin to pick his replacement in the upper chamber.",
    "story": [
      "Vance will leave a vacancy when he departs for the Trump administration.",
      "Vice President-elect JD Vance has served in the United States Senate for less than two years, but after President-elect Donald Trump's victory in Tuesday's election, Vance is about to get a promotion to president of the Senate -- and leave his post as one of Ohio's senators.",
      "When Vance becomes vice president in January, he'll leave a vacancy in the Senate that will need to be filled by a new Ohio senator. Vance was elected to the Senate in 2022, and his term in the Senate does not expire until 2028.",
      "If Vance follows the example set by past active senators who became vice president-elects, he'll likely retain his position as Ohio's junior senator until January, only resigning his seat as the inauguration approaches.",
      "Different states have different rules for how Senate vacancies are filled. In Ohio, the governor of the state has the power to appoint someone to temporarily fill the vacancy. A special election will then be held in November 2026 to fill the vacancy through the remainder of Vance's existing term in 2028.",
      "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who won't face reelection until 2026, will get to select who fills Vance's seat after he resigns. DeWine is a Republican, so the seat would probably remain safely in Republican hands -- at least until the next state election.",
      "But DeWine and Vance are ideologically quite far apart, which means a Republican DeWine appoints to the Senate could bring quite a different energy to the chamber than Vance does. DeWine is a more moderate, establishment Republican while Vance often criticizes that faction of the party.",
      "Speculation is ongoing about who DeWine could possibly select to replace Vance when the time comes. ABC News reached out to DeWine's team for comment, but didn't hear back by the time of publication.",
      "DeWine issued a statement congratulating Vance when Trump selected him as his running mate over the summer.",
      "\"President Trump has made a great choice and Senator Vance will be a great partner as they campaign together this fall,\" DeWine said.",
      "Vance's replacement won't be the only new senator from Ohio to join the incoming Congress in the new year.",
      "In one of the most closely watched Senate races of this election cycle, three-term incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown lost his race against Republican Bernie Moreno.",
      "Moreno's victory helped to deliver a Senate majority for Republicans.",
      "Depending on the timing of Vance's resignation, Moreno could be in the unique position of becoming Ohio's senior senator within moments of assuming the job.",
      "Vance, along with Trump, backed Moreno in a crowded Ohio Republican primary earlier this year.",
      "Moreno, following the news of Vance's selection as Trump's running made, issued a glowing statement on X calling him a \"brilliant selection\" and \"visionary leader.\"",
      "Though Moreno won in the primary match-up, DeWine had endorsed a different, more moderate choice: Matt Dolan.",
      "DeWine's primary endorsement could be a sign of the sort of person he'd be interested in selecting to fill the Vance vacancy.",

    "summary": "On Thursday, Judge J. Campbell Barker ruled in favor of the Republican-led effort to dismantle the Biden administration's program",
    "story": [
      "The initiative was announced by President Biden in June.",
      "A federal judge has struck down the Biden administration's program known as \"Keeping Families Together,\" dealing a major blow to the estimated half a million undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens that DHS estimates would have benefited.",
      "The administration announced the program in June, but a coalition of 16 Republican-led states -- led by Texas and Stephen Miller's America First Legal -- quickly filed a lawsuit after applications were made available in August.",
      "A federal judge put the program on hold just days after hopeful applicants filed their paperwork.",
      "The program would have provided temporary relief from deportation for undocumented spouses and stepchildren of U.S. citizens through a process known as \"parole in place.\" It would have allowed them to apply for legal status without having to leave the country.",
      "Judge J. Campbell Barker ruled Thursday in favor of the Republican-led effort to dismantle the program, agreeing with Republican states that the administration had exceeded its statutory authority because the Immigration and Nationality Act allows for paroling people \"into the United States,\" not to those already in the country.",
      "\"We strongly disagree with yesterday's ruling and we are evaluating next steps. This ruling sides with Republican state officials who are seeking to force U.S. citizens and their families,\u00a0people who have lived in the United States for more than ten years,\u00a0to either separate or live in the shadows in constant fear of deportation,\" White House spokesperson Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez told ABC News Friday. \"As the President has said, America is not a country that tears families apart. Our Administration believes in keeping American families together \u2013 this process would allow those who are already eligible for lawful permanent residency to remain in the United States with their families during that process, instead of being needlessly torn apart.\"",
      "Noncitizen spouses are already eligible for legal status under current laws but often have to apply from their home countries and face up to a 10-year ban from returning to the U.S.",
      "ABC News spoke with a 24-year-old woman in August who was one of the first people to be approved under the program. She is married to a U.S. citizen and they have a 3-year-old child.",
      "It's unclear at the moment what will happen to people who have already submitted their paperwork, like Cecilia, and if they'll be able to get their application fees refunded.",
      "\"We are deeply disappointed in today's decision. Keeping Families Together would have allowed an estimated 500,000 noncitizen spouses and 50,000 noncitizen stepchildren of U.S. citizens to remain together with their families in the United States while completing their immigration process instead of having to endure potentially indefinite separation \u2013 providing them stability, unity, and freedom from fear,\" a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said. \"We firmly believe Keeping Families Together is grounded in well-established legal authority, and its purpose is consistent with fundamental American values.\"",
      "\"District Court Judge J. Campbell Barker did not just dismantle the Keeping Families Together program, he shattered the hopes of hundreds of thousands of American families. The Biden-Harris program would have allowed noncitizen spouses and noncitizen stepchildren of U.S. citizens to stay in the country after they've contributed to our communities, helped grow our economy, and built lives with their loved ones\" Ashley DeAzevedo, president of American Families United, said in a statement to ABC News.",
      "\"We urge the Biden-Harris administration to immediately appeal Judge Barker's ruling, preventing Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 15 other Republican Attorneys General cruel lawsuit from devastating over 550,000 individuals in mixed-status families. Families like ours deserve better than this blatant attempt to stop a legal program, and we will not stop until the courts rectify this injustice,\" DeAzevedo said.",

      "The ex-mayor has been ordered to pay Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss $148 million.",
      "A federal judge in New York on Thursday raised the possibility of holding Rudy Giuliani in contempt if he fails to turn over property by next week to the two Georgia poll workers he defamed after the 2020 election.",
      "A 90-minute hearing devolved into what the judge called \"griping\" after a lawyer for former election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss accused Giuliani of \"game playing\" and an attorney for Giuliani accused the two women of being \"vindictive.\"",
      "A federal jury last year ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss nearly $150 million for defaming them with false accusations that the mother and daughter committed election fraud while the two were counting ballots in Georgia's Fulton County on Election Day in 2020.",
      "Earlier this week, Freeman and Moss' attorney claimed that Giuliani had \"secreted away\" his property after the receivership controlled by the two election workers accessed Giuliani's apartment, only to find it virtually empty.",
      "The former New York City mayor was given a Nov. 14 deadline to turn over the shares in his Upper East Side co-op apartment, valuable sports memorabilia, a Mercedes-Benz convertible, and luxury watches -- including one that belonged to Giuliani's grandfather.",
      "When defense lawyer Ken Caruso complained that forcing Giuliani to relinquish his grandfather's watch was \"vindictive,\" an exasperated Judge Lewis Liman said, \"Oh come on!\"",
      "\"The law is the law and I don't apply it differently to your client,\" Liman said. \"Don't come to me and say something is vindictive.\"",
      "The judge was equally unmoved by the defense argument that Giuliani's car, a blue Mercedes-Benz convertible once owned by the actress Lauren Bacall, was exempt from the judgment because it's worth less than $4,000.",
      "\"Monday the title and keys will be delivered as well as the physical location of the car,\" Judge Liman said.",
      "Giuliani also balked at relinquishing about $2 million dollars he is owed for legal worked performed for Donald Trump.",
      "\"They wanted that money to make a political statement,\" Caruso said.",
      "Liman did not budge and reminded Giuliani of the consequences.",
      "\"He is under an unqualified order to deliver all the receivership property to the receiver,\" Liman said. \"If he doesn't comply then I'm sure I'll get a motion for contempt. If he hasn't delivered, and there is a way in which he could have delivered, he'll be subject to contempt sanctions.\"",
      "Outside court, Giuliani accused Freeman and Moss of bringing a \"political vendetta\" that was \"financed by the Bidens.\"",
      "When ABC News asked whether he regretted defaming Freeman and Moss, Giuliani answered \"No\" before his lawyer stepped in to say the case was on appeal.",

      "The move comes after what authorities called a record summer that saw over 4 million people visiting the world-famous remains of the ancient Roman city, buried under ash and rock following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D.",
      "The park's director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said visitors to the main archaeological site now exceed an average of 15,000 to 20,000 every day, and the new daily cap will prevent the numbers from surging further.",

      "WASHINGTON -- If you missed the early fall push for flu and COVID-19 vaccines, it's not too late.",
      "Health officials say it's important to get vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when respiratory bugs tend to spread with travel and indoor celebrations.",
      "Those viruses haven't caused much trouble so far this fall. But COVID-19 tends to jump in the winter months, a rise that usually starts around Thanksgiving and peaks in January.",
      "And that coincides with flu season, which tends to start in November or December and peak in January or February.",
      "It takes the body about two weeks to build up immunity after either shot \u2014 meaning vaccination is needed before these viruses start spreading. A lot of older adults also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV.",
      "Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters \u2014 they're not just another dose of last year\u2019s protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body\u2019s immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains.",
      "While they\u2019re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 \u2014 or dying from it.",
      "\u201cIt may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to be less severe,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cI would rather have my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to the emergency room on Thanksgiving.\u201d",
      "Last year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got a COVID-19 shot.",
      "\u201cOur best defense to protect ourselves, our loved ones and all those around us is a simple shot,\u201d Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a recent statement.",
      "While it may have faded from the headlines, the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last year.",
      "\u201cMaybe we believe that it\u2019s not going to be me but let\u2019s not take a chance,\u201d said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. \u201cWhy not get a vaccine that\u2019s going to help you reduce that risk?\u201d",
      "The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge.",
      "Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year.",
      "Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu \u2013 and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too.",
      "In addition, the CDC is recommending that people 65 and older get a second COVID-19 shot six months after their fall dose to boost their year-round protection, since the coronavirus isn't just a winter threat. People with weakened immune systems are eligible for extra doses, too.",
      "Last fall\u2019s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that\u2019s no longer spreading while this year\u2019s are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older.",
      "High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot.",
      "For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics \u2014 although next year it's set to be available for use at home.",
      "All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems.",
      "The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination \u2013 but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter.",
      "And while \u201cyour arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,\u201d it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said.",
      "The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.",
      "About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access. Call your local health department to ask about options.",

      "SAVANNAH, Ga. -- A judge has blocked a Georgia county from approving larger homes in a tiny island community of Black slave descendants until the state's highest court decides whether residents can challenge by referendum zoning changes they fear will lead to unaffordable tax increases.",
      "Hogg Hummock on Sapelo Island was founded after the Civil War by slaves who worked the cotton plantation of Thomas Spalding. It's one of the South's few remaining communities of people known as Gullah-Geechee, whose isolation from the mainland resulted in a unique culture with deep ties to Africa.",
      "The few dozen Black residents remaining on the Georgia island have spent the past year fighting local officials in McIntosh County over a new zoning ordinance. Commissioners voted in September 2023 to double the size of homes allowed in Hogg Hummock, weakening development restrictions enacted nearly three decades earlier to protect the shrinking community of modest houses along dirt roads.",
      "Residents and their advocates sought to repeal the zoning changes under a rarely used provision of Georgia's constitution that empowers citizens to call special elections to challenge local laws. They spent months collecting more than 1,800 petition signatures and a referendum was scheduled for Oct. 1.",
      "McIntosh County commissioners filed suit to stop the vote. Senior Judge Gary McCorvey halted the referendum days before the scheduled election and after hundreds of ballots were cast early. He sided with commissioners' argument that zoning ordinances are exempt from being overturned by voters.",
      "Hogg Hummock residents are appealing the judge's ruling to the Georgia Supreme Court, hoping to revive and reschedule the referendum.",
      "On Monday, McCorvey granted their request to stop county officials from approving new building permits and permit applications under the new zoning ordinance until the state Supreme Court decides the case.",
      "The new zoning law increased the maximum size of homes allowed in Hogg Hummock to 3,000 square feet (278 square meters) of total enclosed space. The previous limit was 1,400 square feet (130 square meters) of heated and air-conditioned space.",
      "Residents say larger homes in their small community would lead to higher property taxes, increasing pressure to sell land held in their families for generations.",
      "McCorvey in his ruling Monday said Hogg Hummock residents have a \u201cchance of success\" appealing his decision to cancel the referendum, and that permitting larger homes in the island community before the case is decided could cause irreversible harm.",
      "\u201cA victory in the Supreme Court would be hollow indeed, tantamount to closing a barn door after all the horses had escaped,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "Attorneys for McIntosh County argued it is wrong to block an ordinance adopted more than a year ago. Under the judge's order, any new building permits will have to meet the prior, stricter size limits.",
      "Less than a month after the referendum on Hogg Hummock's zoning was scrapped, Sapelo Island found itself reeling from an unrelated tragedy.",
      "Hundreds of tourists were visiting the island on Oct. 19 when a walkway collapsed at the state-operated ferry dock, killing seven people. It happened as Hogg Hummock was celebrating its annual Cultural Day festival, a day intended to be a joyful respite from worries about the community's uncertain future.",
      "The Georgia Supreme Court has not scheduled when it will hear the Sapelo Island case. The court last year upheld a citizen-called referendum from 2022 that stopped coastal Camden County from building a commercial spaceport.",
      "The spaceport vote relied on a provision of Georgia\u2019s constitution that allows organizers to force special elections to challenge \u201clocal acts or ordinances, resolutions, or regulations\u201d of local governments if they get a petition signed by 10% to 25%, depending on population, of a county\u2019s voters.",
      "In the Sapelo Island case, McCorvey ruled that voters can't call special elections to veto zoning ordinances because they fall under a different section of the state constitution."

      "A former health care worker who illegally accessed the health records of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before she died has been sentenced to two years in prison",
      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- A former health care worker who illegally accessed the health records of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before she died was sentenced Thursday to two years in prison.",
      "Trent Russell, 34, of Bellevue, Nebraska, who worked at the time as a transplant coordinator for the Washington Regional Transplant Community and had access to hospital records all over the region, was convicted earlier this year of illegally accessing health care records and destroying or altering records at a jury trial.",
      "He was also charged with publishing that information on the internet in 2019, at a time when public speculation about Ginsburg's health and her ability to serve as a justice was a matter of public debate. Prosecutors said he posted the information along with a false claim that Ginsburg had already died. But the jury acquitted Russell on that count.",
      "Ginsburg served on the court until her death in 2020.",
      "Prosecutors said Russell disclosed the health records on forums that trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories, including conspiracy theories that Ginsburg was dead, but Russell's motivations for his actions were unclear. Indeed, Russell himself never admitted that he accessed the records, at one point suggesting that perhaps his cat walked across the keyboard in a way that mistakenly called up Ginsburg's data.",
      "Russell's excuses and refusal to accept responsibility prompted blistering critiques from prosecutors, who sought a 30-month sentence.",
      "\u201cHe offered completely implausible excuses with a straight face,\u201d prosecutor Zoe Bedell said.",
      "Russell's lawyer, Charles Burnham, sought a sentence of probation or home detention. He cited Russell's work saving lives as a transplant coordinator and his military record which included a deployment to Afghanistan as mitigating factors.",
      "\u201cMr. Russell has lived a quietly heroic life,\u201d Burnham wrote in court papers. He chalked up the criminal conduct to \u201cbeing stupid.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff's 24-month sentence , calling his crime \u201ctruly despicable conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have made it extremely difficult to understand what motivated you,\u201d Nachmanoff said. He said Russell made matters worse by lying to investigators and on the witness stand.",
      "\u201cYou chose to blame your cat,\u201d Nachmanoff said.",
      "The court records in the case are carefully redacted to remove any reference to Ginsburg, but during the trial and at Thursday's sentencing hearing, all sides openly acknowledged that Ginsburg was the victim of the privacy breach.",
      "Her status as a public figure, in fact, prompted a debate about the severity of Russell's crime. Prosecutors said her high public profile, in addition to her age and illness, made her a particularly vulnerable victim.",
      "\u201cHe went with the Supreme Court justice who was old, who was sick, and whose sickness was a public concern,\u201d Bedell argued.",
      "Russell's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that Ginsburg's high office and the power that comes with it is the opposite of vulnerability.",
      "Nachmanoff, in issuing his sentence, said he took into account the fact that Russell has a sick step parent who might need care. The judge noted \u201cwith some irony\u201d that the details of the stepparent's health problems are under seal.",
      "\u201cWhy? Because it is sensitive health information \u2014 a benefit you did not provide to Justice Ginsburg,\u201d he said.",
      "Russell and his lawyer declined to comment after Thursday's hearing on whether they plan to appeal."

      "Pollitt has said the transportation authority has not moved off its opening proposal, which he said included no wage increase and offered a $1,000 signing bonus in exchange for concessions on costs for health care coverage. The union\u2019s top demand is additional steps to improve personal safety for frontline workers \u2014 many of whom face violence and harassment \u2014 and a wage increase."

      "Republican Jeff Hurd has won the U.S. House seat in Colorado that Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert nearly lost in 2022 then left for another race, a risky but ultimately successful bet she took in the hopes of keeping the seat in GOP hands and staying in Congress herself.",
      "Hurd, more mild-mannered than Boebert and hewing to an older GOP tradition, beat Adam Frisch, the Democrat who nearly unseated Boebert two years ago in the 3rd Congressional District, which covers the state\u2019s Rocky Mountains. Boebert, meanwhile, won a seat in the 4th Congressional District.",
      "Hurd was leading by about 12,000 votes in unofficial results as of Thursday \u2014 a much larger margin than the 546 votes Boebert won by in 2022.",
      "Hurd campaigned on a platform centered around rural jobs and the cost of living, alongside more national issues such as border security. He was not endorsed by former and incoming President Donald Trump and rarely mentioned him during the campaign. That's in stark contrast to Boebert, who spoke and prayed often for Trump on the campaign trail, and swung an endorsement from him in the 4th District.",
      "\u201cI got into this race to ensure that our rural communities are not forgotten,\u201d Hurd said in a written statement. \u201cIt will be an honor and privilege to represent the district where I was raised.\u201d",

      "Hurd overcame a massive fundraising deficit against Frisch, who had one of the largest U.S. House campaign chests in the nation. Frisch\u2019s contributions were fueled by donations from around the country from Democrats who disliked Boebert. Frisch is a businessman and former city councilmember in Aspen.",
      "Frisch, in a phone call, said Trump's sweeping victory this week presented a challenge for his own prospects in the historically Republican-leaning district.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can swim against the tide,\u201d he said. As for whether Frisch would have won if Boebert hadn\u2019t left the race, he remarked, \u201cDo I think we would\u2019ve beaten Boebert? Yes. Can I guarantee that? No.\"",
      "Boebert is an ardent Trump loyalist and a rabble-rouser who\u2019s helped define an ultra-conservative flank of the House. She left the race to run in the 4th District, a Republican stronghold covering a sweep of the Great Plains, saying she didn\u2019t want to give Democrats a chance to \u201cbuy\u201d the seat in the 3rd.",
      "Boebert's move came after Frisch nearly beat her two years ago. She was later caught on tape vaping and groping with a date in a Denver theater, which rattled even loyal supporters.",
      "Justifying her change of districts, Boebert said, \u201cThere is a need for my voice in Congress.\u201d",
      "She later said she wanted a fresh start for her family after a messy and public divorce.",
      "After successfully fighting through a packed Republican primary election, where she avoided a surprise political threat with some behind-the-scenes maneuvering, Boebert is now the incumbent in a safely red seat formerly held by conservative Republican Rep. Ken Buck.",
      "When Buck resigned earlier this year, he cited the flank of the party that is known for its hardheaded politics and unwavering devotion to Trump \u2014 traits that made Boebert a name brand.",
      "Hurd's victory also bore out Boebert's hope that her move would allow Republicans to maintain control of the district that first elected her in 2020.",
      "Boebert has been criticized for her intractable politics \u2014 stonewalling the January 2023 vote to elect Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy as House speaker, for example \u2014 but has said that her actions are aimed at keeping the promises she made on the campaign trail."

      "Trump didn\u2019t mention the Jan. 6 defendants, whom he has called \u201chostages\u201d and \u201cpatriots,\u201d during his victory speech on Wednesday. But his defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris throws into doubt the future of the largest prosecution in Justice Department history over the unprecedented assault on a seat of American democracy.",
      "More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the riot that left more than 100 police officers injured and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory. More than 1,000 defendants have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial of charges, including misdemeanor trespassing offenses, assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Trump's praise of Jan. 6 defendants was a centerpiece of his campaign, with rallies honoring them as heroes featuring a song he collaborated on with a group of jailed rioters. Trump hasn't explained how he will decide who gets pardoned. But he has suggested he would consider granting them even for those accused of assault as well as the former Proud Boys leader convicted of orchestrating a violent plot in 2020 to keep Trump in power.",
      "During his first term as president, Trump deployed his pardon power in overtly political ways, granting clemency in his final days in office to a broad range of political allies -- including five defendants convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation -- as well as celebrities, Republican members of Congress and the father of Jared Kushner, his son-in-law.",
      "Jacob Lang, a Capitol riot defendant who's jailed while awaiting a trial in Washington, posted within hours of Trump's victory that he and other Jan. 6 \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d were \u201cfinally coming home.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere will be no bitterness in my heart as I walk out of these doors in 75 days on inauguration day,\u201d Lang wrote.",
      "Lawyers for some Jan. 6 defendants cited Trump's victory in requests to hold off on sentencing their clients.",
      "Defense attorney Marina Medvin said her client, Christopher Carnell, is \u201cexpecting to be relieved of the criminal prosecution that he is currently facing when the new administration takes office.\u201d Michelle Peterson, an assistant federal public defender, argued it would be \"fundamentally unfair\" to sentence a client whose case may be dismissed by Trump's Justice Department.",
      "Judges swiftly denied both requests and refused to delay separate hearings for their respective cases on Friday.",
      "Other defense attorneys on Wednesday asked for a Jan. 6 defendant's trial to be postponed. They argued that their client, Mitchell Bosch, cannot receive a fair trial in Washington so soon after the election given that voters in the nation's capital overwhelmingly supported Harris over Trump.",
      "\u201cMr. Bosch understands that the President-elect\u2019s proclamations of stolen elections and pardons for patriots are not relevant evidence in his trial. However, they are highly relevant to the ability of the jury pool to be fair and impartial,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",
      "A trial is scheduled to start next week for Steve Baker, a writer charged with Capitol riot-related misdemeanors. Baker, who has written articles about the Jan. 6 riot for the conservative outlet Blaze News, posted a photo of a press credential for him to cover Congress.",
      "\"I plan on covering J6, 2025 \u2018inside\u2019 the Capitol,\" he wrote on Wednesday, adding a winking face emoji.",
      "Of the more than 1,000 convicted rioters who have been sentenced, over 650 have received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years. Hundreds of people who went into the Capitol but did not attack police or damage the building were charged only with misdemeanors. The violence and destruction by other members of the mob have been documented in videos and other evidence heard in court, including testimony from police officers about being beaten and scared for their lives as they defended the Capitol.",
      "Trump has said he would issue pardons to Capitol rioters on \u201cDay 1\u201d of his presidency. He told Time Magazine he would consider pardoning all of the Jan. 6 defendants, though later added: \u201cIf somebody was evil and bad, I would look at that differently.\u201d He told NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last year that he would consider pardoning former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, who was sentenced to 22 years in prison after being convicted of seditious conspiracy. Trump said Tarrio was treated \u201chorribly.\u201d",
      "When pressed during an event in July, Trump said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d would pardon rioters accused of assaulting police \u2014 if they were \u201cinnocent.\u201d When the interviewer noted she was talking about convicted rioters, Trump replied that they were convicted \u201cby a very tough system.\u201d",
      "Kim Wehle, a University of Baltimore law professor and author of a book about presidential pardons, said presidents have the unfettered power to issue mass pardons.",
      "\u201cThe pardon system is set up for winners and losers. Who gets them and who doesn\u2019t get them is completely subjective. It\u2019s completely arbitrary and based on the whims of the president,\u201d Wehle said. \u201cDonald Trump could fashion the pardon however he wants to fashion the pardon, and the general public wouldn\u2019t be able to challenge it.\u201d",
      "Presidents have used their power to issue mass pardons for the sake of promoting national unity. George Washington pardoned Whiskey Rebellion rebels. Abraham Lincoln pardoned former Confederate soldiers after the Civil War. Jimmy Carter pardoned Vietnam War draft dodgers.",
      "Many of those expressing support for Jan. 6 defendants also echoed Trump's campaign talk of seeking retribution against political foes. Julie Kelly, a right-wing political commentator who calls herself a \u201cJ6 conspiracy theorist\u201d on her social media profile, posted that Washington-based U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves' \u201creign of terror is going to end soon.\"",
      "\u201cThen we turn the tables,\u201d Kelly wrote.",

      "Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, a moderate known for defying his party, is in a tight race to keep his seat in Congress against Austin Theriault, a stock car driver and Republican state lawmaker",
      "LEWISTON, Maine -- With control of the U.S. House of Representatives still in question, Maine Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, a moderate known for defying his party, led by a thin margin over Republican Austin Theriault on Thursday in a race that was still too early to call two days after voting ended.",
      "The matchup between Golden and Theriault is one of a handful of pivotal races with a chance to influence control of the U.S. House of Representatives during a competitive election year. It played out in the largest congressional district by area on the East Coast, a largely rural part of Maine where former President Donald Trump has proven very popular with voters.",
      "Thursday afternoon, Golden and Theriault were in a tight race with some of the vote yet to be counted. Theriault requested a recount Thursday, although the final tallies were not yet finished.",
      "Golden is a former Marine in his third term representing the 2nd Congressional District, which is typically described as a swing district. The district covers a vast part of Maine that includes a handful of small cities but is perhaps best known as the home of traditional northern New England industries such as lobster fishing and logging.",
      "During the campaign, Golden touted his ability to work with members of either political party along with his advocacy on behalf of the lobster industry, which is the lifeblood of the region\u2019s economy. He declared himself the winner of the race Wednesday, though it has not been called by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cAnyone who has observed this race knows that this was my toughest election yet. Across the country, no Democrat has withstood stronger headwinds from the top of the ticket, the pundits and the organized opposition,\u201d Golden said, wearing a flannel shirt and blue jeans at a news conference in Lewiston.",
      "Theriault, who was first elected to the Maine House of Representatives in 2022, spent much of the campaign portraying Golden as too liberal for the district. Although Theriault had the backing of Trump, he also attempted to portray himself as a potential uniter during a divided time in Washington.",
      "Theriault said Wednesday that he was \u201cwell within the margin\u201d where a recount was possible \u201cand every vote should be counted.\u201d Thursday, he made that request formal.",
      "Maine has no mandatory recounts even in close elections. But the state does allow candidates to request a recount. The state does not require a deposit for a recount if the margin of victory is 1% or less for statewide or multicounty races.",
      "\u201cWe must work together to ensure the Mainers\u2019 voices are heard and the final result reflects the will of the people,\u201d said Theriault campaign manager Shawn Roderick.",
      "Golden \u201chas trust and faith in the process of determining the victor, and is ready for a recount if one is necessary,\u201d said Mario Moretto, a spokesperson for the congressman.",
      "It was also possible neither candidate would crack 50% of the total vote, and that would necessitate a ranked choice count. There was no third-party candidate on the ballot, but write-in candidates were still possible, and some voters used that option.",
      "Golden was first elected to Congress in 2018, when he needed the ranked choice voting count to defeat Republican incumbent Rep. Bruce Poliquin.",
      "Golden has held onto his seat despite Trump dominating the district in recent presidential elections. Maine is one of two states to apportion electoral votes by congressional district \u2014 Nebraska is the other \u2014 and Trump has won his sole New England electoral vote in Maine\u2019s 2nd District three times.",
      "In the 1st Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree won her ninth term against Republican challenger Ron Russell and independent Ethan Alcorn."

      "Lawyers for a man charged with murder in the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students have asked a judge to take the death penalty off the table",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- Attorneys for a man charged in the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students asked a judge to take the death penalty off the table Thursday, arguing that international, federal and state law all make it inappropriate for the case.",
      "Bryan Kohberger is accused of the Nov. 13, 2022, killings of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves. Investigators said they were able to link Kohberger \u2014 then a graduate student at nearby Washington State University \u2014 to the crime from DNA found on a knife sheath at the scene, surveillance videos and cellphone data.",
      "When asked to enter a plea last year, Kohberger stood silent, prompting a judge to enter a not guilty plea on his behalf. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if he is convicted.",
      "During a pre-trial motion hearing, Kohberger's defense team made a broad range of arguments against the death penalty, saying in part that it does not fit today's standards of decency, that it is cruel to make condemned inmates sit for decades on death row awaiting execution and that it violates an international treaty prohibiting the torture of prisoners.",
      "But 4th District Judge Stephen Hippler questioned many of those claims, saying that the international treaty they referenced was focused on ensuring that prisoners are given due process so they are not convicted and executed without a fair trial.",
      "Prosecutors noted that the Idaho Supreme Court has already considered many of those arguments in other capital cases and allowed the the death penalty to stand.",
      "Still, by bringing up the issues during the motion hearing, Kohberger's defense team took the first step toward preserving their legal arguments in the court record, potentially allowing them to raise them again on appeal.",
      "The judge said he would issue a written ruling on the motions later.",
      "Kristi and Steve Goncalves, the parents of Kaylee Goncalves, attended the hearing. Afterward they said the details of the case show the death penalty is merited.",
      "\u201cYou've got four victims, all in one house \u2014 that's more than enough,\u201d Steve Goncalves said.",
      "Kristi Goncalves said she talked to the coroner and knows what happened to her daughter.",
      "\u201cIf he did anything like he did to our daughter to the others, then he deserves to die,\u201d she said.",
      "Kohberger's attorneys have said he was out for a drive the night of the killings, something he often did to look at the sky.",
      "His trial is scheduled to begin next August and is expected to last up to three months. The Goncalves family said they have rented a home in Boise so they can attend."

      "San Francisco\u2019s first Black female mayor conceded the race for mayor to Levi Strauss heir Daniel Lurie after a brutal campaign over homelessness and public safety",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco\u2019s first Black female mayor, London Breed, conceded the race for mayor to Levi Strauss heir Daniel Lurie on Thursday, pledging a smooth transition as he takes over the job.",
      "The Associated Press has not yet declared a winner because tens of thousand of ballots have not yet been counted and added to the ranked choice voting calculations.",
      "Breed, who was raised by her grandmother in public housing, could not overcome deep voter discontent and was trailing Lurie, a philanthropist and anti-poverty nonprofit founder.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, this job is bigger than any one person and what matters is that we keep moving this City forward,\u201d Breed said, adding that she had called Lurie to congratulate him. \u201cI know we are both committed to improving this City we love.\u201d",
      "While San Francisco\u2019s streets have been cleaner and homeless tents much harder to find in recent months, Breed\u2019s fellow Democratic challengers on the campaign trail repeatedly hammered her administration for doing too little, too late as homeless tent encampments, open-air drug use and brazen retail theft proliferated during her six years in office.",
      "Political analyst Dan Schnur said there\u2019s been a demand nationwide for change in leadership.",
      "\u201cLondon Breed didn\u2019t create the crime and homelessness crises, but voters blamed her for not fixing them,\u201d he said.",
      "She faced four big-name challengers, including two San Francisco supervisors and a former interim mayor.",
      "But voters flocked to Lurie, 47, a city native from a storied family who pledged to bring accountability and public service back to City Hall. He is the founder of Tipping Point Community, which says it has invested more than $400 million since 2005 in programs to help people with housing, education and early childhood.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply grateful to my incredible family, campaign team and every San Franciscan who voted for accountability, service, and change,\u201d Lurie said in a statement. \u201cNo matter who you supported in this election, we stand united in the fight for San Francisco\u2019s future and a safer and more affordable city for all.\u201d",
      "Lurie pumped nearly $9 million of his own money into his first-time bid for mayor, which drew criticism from Breed and other opponents. But he said that as a political outsider, he needed to introduce himself to voters and in the end, some voters said they liked that Lurie\u2019s financial wealth shielded him from being beholden to special interests.",
      "Lurie is an heir to the Levi Strauss & Co. fortune through his mother, Mimi Haas, who wed Peter Haas when Daniel was a child. Peter Haas, a great-grandnephew of Levi Strauss, was a longtime CEO of the iconic clothing company who died in 2005.",
      "Both the Levi\u2019s name and Haas family philanthropic foundations are deeply embedded in San Francisco\u2019s history and identity.",
      "Lurie\u2019s father, Brian Lurie, is a rabbi and longtime former executive director of the San Francisco-based Jewish Community Federation.",
      "Breed won election as mayor in June 2018 to serve out the remainder of Mayor Ed Lee\u2019s term.",
      "She was reelected in 2019 to a full term that has lasted five years instead of the typical four, after voters changed the election calendar to line up with presidential contests."

      "With his commanding victory over Kamala Harris, Donald Trump has achieved a stunning political comeback that seemed unimaginable after his refusal to accept his loss in the 2020 election ended with his supporters violently storming the Capitol",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- As he bid farewell to Washington in January 2021, deeply unpopular and diminished, Donald Trump was already hinting at a comeback.",
      "\u201cGoodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form,\u201d Trump told supporters at Joint Base Andrews, where he'd arranged a 21-gun salute as part of a military send-off before boarding Air Force One. \u201cWe will see you soon.\u201d",
      "Four years later, he's fulfilled his prophecy.",
      "With his commanding victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump achieved a comeback that seemed unimaginable after the 2020 election ended with his supporters violently storming the Capitol after he refused to accept his defeat.",
      "In the years that followed, Trump was widely blamed for Republican losses, indicted four times, convicted on 34 felony counts, ruled to have inflated his assets in a civil fraud trial and found liable for sexual abuse. He still faces fines that top more than half a billion dollars and the prospect of jail time.",
      "But Trump managed to turn his legal woes into fuel that channeled voters' anger. He seized on widespread discontent over the direction of a country battered by years of high inflation. And he spoke to a new generation \u2014 using podcasts and social media \u2014 to tell those who felt forgotten that he shared their disdain for the status quo.",
      "And he did so while surviving two attempted assassinations and a late-stage candidate replacement by Democrats.",
      "\u201cThis was a campaign of October surprises,\" Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said hours after clinching victory. \u201cWhen you think about it, whether it was indictments, convictions, assassination attempts, the switching out of the candidate \u2014 I mean it was a campaign of firsts on so many different levels.\u201d",
      "Trump had entered the general election after sweeping the GOP primaries and routing a crowded field of candidates. The indictments against him dominated news coverage and forced even his rivals to rally around him as he cast himself as the victim of a politically motivated effort to hobble his candidacy.",
      "A late June debate against President Joe Biden \u2014 which the Biden campaign had pushed for \u2014 ended disastrously for the president, who struggled to put words together and repeatedly lost his train of thought.",
      "When Trump arrived at the Republican National Convention to formally accept his party's nomination for the second time weeks later, he seemed unstoppable. Just two days earlier, a gunman had opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, unleashing a hail of bullets that grazed his ear and left one supporter dead.",
      "After the gunman had been killed, Trump stood, surrounded by Secret Service agents, his face streaked by blood, and raised his fist in the air \u2014 shouting \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d \u2014 as the crowd erupted into cheers. The moment became a rallying cry for his campaign.",
      "\u201cIf you want to make somebody iconic, try to throw them in jail. Try to bankrupt them. ... If you want to make somebody iconic, try to kill him,\u201d said Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative who has known Trump for 45 years and was pardoned by the former president. \u201cAll of those things failed. They just made him bigger and more powerful as a political force. Every one of those things turbocharged his candidacy.\u201d",
      "Trump had appeared to be on a glide path to victory. But just days later, Democrats, fearing a blowout loss and panicking over Biden's age and ability to do the job for another four years, successfully persuaded the president to step aside and end his bid, making way for Harris\u2019 history-shattering candidacy.",
      "Trump campaign aides insisted they were prepared. Videos for the convention had been cut with two different versions: One featuring Biden, the other Harris, and versions attacking both were played on the big screens in Milwaukee.",
      "But the change sent Trump into a tailspin. He had spent millions, he complained, beating Biden, and now had to \u201cstart all over\u201d again \u2014 this time facing a candidate who was not only nearly two decades younger, embodying the generational change voters had said they wanted, but also a woman who would have become the country's first female president.",
      "In one particularly hostile appearance, Trump questioned the racial identity of the first woman of color to serve as vice president and to lead a major-party ticket before the National Association of Black Journalists.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,\u201d Trump said of the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, who had attended a historically Black college and served as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.",
      "On his Truth Social site, he amplified a post that suggested Harris had used sexual favors to advance her career.",
      "Trump's campaign aides quickly pivoted to taking Harris down. They belittled her as unserious, with ads focused on her laugh. They labeled her \u201cdangerously liberal,\" highlighting the progressive policies she had embraced when she first ran for president in 2020.",
      "They argued her \u201cjoyful warrior\u201d messaging was fundamentally at odds with the sour mood of the electorate, and responded gleefully to Harris telling voters \u201cWe are not going back\" when many voters seemed to want just that.",
      "Though Trump had left office with a dismal approval rating, that number had ticked up considerably in the years that followed, amid concerns over high prices and the influx of migrants who entered the country illegally after Biden relaxed restrictions.",
      "Harris\u2019 momentum was just a sugar high, they said. Tony Fabrizio, the campaign pollster, called it \u201ca kind of out-of-body experience where we have suspended reality.\u201d Soon, they predicted, what they dubbed the \u201cHarris honeymoon\u201d would subside.",
      "Trump\u2019s campaign insisted they did not fundamentally change their strategy with Harris as their rival. Instead, they tried to cast her as the incumbent, tying her to every one of the Biden administration's most unpopular policies. Trump, the 78-year-old former president, would be the candidate of change \u2014 and one who had been tested.",
      "Harris played right into their hands. Asked during an October appearance on \u201cThe View\" if there was anything she would have done differently than Biden over the last four years, she responded that there was \u201cnot a thing that comes to mind.\u201d",
      "Trump's campaign rejoiced when they heard the clip, which they quickly cut into ads.",
      "Harris, they believed, failed to articulate a forward-looking agenda that represented a break from the unpopular incumbent. And she struggled to distance herself from some of the far-left positions she had taken during the 2020 Democratic primary \u2014 sometimes denying positions she was on record as having taken, or failing to offer a clear explanation for her change of heart.",
      "She spent much of the final stretch of the campaign reverting to Biden\u2019s strategy of casting Trump as a fundamental threat to democracy.",
      "But the country made clear it was \"ready to move in a different direction,\u201d said longtime Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski. \u201cThey want someone who\u2019s going to change. They don\u2019t have to think back 20 or 30 years. They can think back to four and five years ago. And they want that back in the White House.\u201d",
      "After his 2020 loss, Trump's campaign worked to grow his appeal beyond the white working-class base that had delivered his first victory. The campaign would court young people and Black and Latino men, including many who rarely voted but felt like they weren't getting ahead. They seized on divisions in the Democratic Party, courting both Jewish voters and Muslims.",
      "In a scene that would have seemed unthinkable eight years ago, Trump \u2014 the man who called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims\" entering the country and later pursued targeted travel bans \u2014 appeared onstage at his last rally of the campaign with Amer Ghalib, the Democratic, Arab American mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan. Days earlier, Trump had gone to the majority Arab American city of Dearborn, Michigan, for a campaign stop.",
      "\u201cThey saw him as their last hope to end these wars in the Middle East and bring back peace. And this was made very clear when he came to Dearborn,\" said Massad Boulos, the father of Trump\u2019s son-in-law, who led Trump\u2019s outreach with Arab Americans. He noted Harris \"didn\u2019t even come close to Dearborn.\u201d",
      "Trump received another boost when the International Brotherhood of Teamsters declined to endorse either candidate, citing a lack of consensus among its 1.3 million members.",
      "While much of the campaign's messaging centered on the economy and immigration, Trump also tried to court voters with giveaways, promising to end taxes on tips, on overtime pay and on Social Security benefits.",
      "And his aides seized on the culture wars surrounding transgender rights, pouring money into ads aimed at young men \u2014 especially young Hispanic men \u2014 attacking Harris for supporting \u201ctaxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners,\" including one spot featuring popular radio host Charlamagne tha God that aired predominantly during football games.",
      "\u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,\" the narrator said.",
      "Trump's campaign succeeded in its mission, picking up a small but significant share of Black and Hispanic voters, and forging a new working-class coalition crossing racial lines.",
      "\u201cThey came from all quarters: union, non-union, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, Arab American, Muslim American,\u201d Trump in his victory speech. \u201cWe had everybody and it was beautiful. It was a historic realignment, uniting citizens of all backgrounds around a common core of common sense.\u201d",
      "The campaign decided early that it would focus much of its efforts on low-propensity voters \u2014 people who rarely turn out to the polls and are more likely to get their news from non-traditional sources.",
      "To reach them, Trump began a podcast blitz, appearing with hosts who are popular with young men, including Adin Ross, Theo Von and Joe Rogan. He attended football games and UFC fights, where audiences erupted into cheers at arrivals broadcast live on sports channels.",
      "The campaign also worked to create viral moments. Trump paid a visit to McDonald's, where he donned an apron, manned the fry station and served supporters through the drive-through window. Days later he delivered a news conference from the passenger seat of a garbage truck, while wearing a yellow safety vest.",
      "Clips of those appearances racked up hundreds of millions of views on platforms like TikTok, which Trump embraced, despite having tried to previously ban the app at the White House.",
      "The appearances helped to highlight an aspect of Trump's appeal that is often lost on those who aren't supporters.",
      "Jaden Wurn, 20, a student at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania who was casting his ballot for Trump, said he was drawn to the former president in part because of his sense of humor.",
      "\u201cTrump is able to just chat,\" he said. \u201cIt can be policy. It can be culture. It could be golf. It could be whatever it is, and he\u2019s just able to sit down and have a nice, good conversation. Be relatable. Crack some jokes. He\u2019s a funny guy. It\u2019s refreshing.\u201d",
      "Unlike past campaigns marked by backstabbing and turnover, Trump's operation was widely praised for being his most competent and disciplined, with credit given to Florida operative Susie Wiles, who will now serve as his White House chief of staff.",
      "Haunted by lessons from 2020, aides were careful to save money for the race's final stretch even as they were dramatically outraised by Democrats and shelled out millions on legal expenses.",
      "And they took risks, including outsourcing a large portion of their paid get-out-the-vote operation to outside groups, taking advantage of an FEC ruling that allowed unprecedented coordination with a PAC formed by billionaire Elon Musk, his newest benefactor, and Charlie Kirk's Turning Point group.",
      "As the race headed into the race's final stretch, Trump's team continued to project confidence, even as public polling showing a dead heat. They were on offensive, scheduling rallies in Democratic states like Virginia and New Mexico, as well as what was intended to be the marquee event of the campaign's end: a rally at New York's Madison Square Garden.",
      "But the event \u2014 which Trump had talked of for years \u2014 was derailed long before he even took the stage as a series of pre-show speakers delivered vile, crude and racist insults, including a comedian who called Puerto Rico \u201ca floating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "Trump was livid, angry that the event had been overshadowed by vetting failures and he was being attacked for something he hadn't said.",
      "While aides insisted they saw no impact on their polling \u2014 their internal data had him leading through the final three weeks of the race, albeit with a razor-thin margin \u2014 even Trump's most diehard supporters expressed concerns that the fallout was resonating with undecided friends and family members.",
      "\u201cA couple of them were making the comment that he was against Puerto Rico or he\u2019s racist and I\u2019ve been trying to educate them,\u201d said Donna Sheets, 51, a caregiver who lives in Christiansburg, Virginia, describing friends who had yet to make up their minds in the race's final stretch.",
      "But yet again Trump caught a break. Biden, in a call organized by a Hispanic advocacy group, responded to the insults by calling Trump's supporters \u201cgarbage.\u201d",
      "Trump quickly seized on the gaffe, coming up with the idea of hiring a garbage truck to ride in. Aides quickly scrambled to find a truck and print a \u201cTrump\u201d campaign decal to tape to its side.",
      "They also presented him with an orange worker's vest \u2014 which he decided he liked so much that he continued to wear it onstage at a subsequent rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Supporters began showing up at his rallies wearing their own vests and garbage bags.",
      "Still, Trump continued what felt, at times, like self-sabotage. He doubled down on his controversial pledge to \u201cprotect women,\" saying he would do so whether they \u201clike it or not.\u201d He railed against former Rep. Liz Cheney, saying she would be less inclined to send Americans into war if she experienced what it felt like to be standing with nine rifles \u201ctrained at her face.\u201d",
      "And on the Sunday before the election, at a rally in Pennsylvania, an exhausted Trump, fully unleashed, abandoned his stump speech altogether to deliver a profane and conspiracy-laden diatribe in which he said he \u201cshouldn\u2019t have left\u201d the White House after his 2020 loss and wouldn't mind much if reporters were shot.",
      "The performance was so unhinged that Wiles was spotted coming out to stare at Trump as he spoke.",
      "While aides were alarmed, they urged him to stick with the plan. Trump, onstage the next day, seemed to acknowledge their efforts as he repeated a familiar complaint about how he\u2019s not allowed to call women \u201cbeautiful\u201d anymore, and then asked that it be struck from the record \u2014 saying, \u201cSo I\u2019m allowed to do that, aren\u2019t I, Susan Wiles?\u201d",
      "As his top aides huddled upstairs in his office at Mar-a-Lago, Trump spent much of election night holding court with friends and club members as well as Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 leaders of a new Make America Great Again majority that bears little resemblance to the Republican Party of old.",
      "While aides described him as confident, Trump watched the TVs that had been set up in the ballroom intensely as he mingled. This was more than an election, friends noted. He was fighting for his freedom. He will be able to end the federal investigations he faces as soon as he takes office.",
      "After Fox News had called the race, Trump emerged, flanked by campaign staff and family.",
      "\u201cThis will forever be remembered as the day the American people regained control of their country,\u201d he said."

      "The mayor of Mississippi\u2019s capital city, the top prosecutor in the state\u2019s largest county and a Jackson City Council member have been indicted on conspiracy and bribery charges",
      "JACKSON, Miss. -- The mayor of Mississippi's capital city, the top prosecutor in the state's largest county and a Jackson City Council member have been indicted on conspiracy and bribery charges in a case that has already forced the resignation of another city council member, according to federal court records unsealed Thursday.",
      "The charges against Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, Hinds County District Attorney Jody Owens and council member Aaron B. Banks were brought after two people working for the FBI posed as real estate developers who wanted to build a hotel near the convention center in downtown Jackson and provided payments to officials, including $50,000 for the mayor\u2019s reelection campaign, according to court documents.",
      "Lumumba, Jody Owens and Banks each pleaded not guilty Thursday during an appearance before a magistrate judge, with supporters of the mayor filling the small courtroom. The three men will remain free while awaiting trial.",
      "Outside the courthouse, Lumumba said he is grateful to people who have reached out to him locally, nationally and internationally.",
      "\u201cI am not guilty, and so I will not proceed as a guilty man,\u201d Lumumba said. \u201cI will continue to handle the business of the city of Jackson while my attorneys continue to handle the business of these court proceedings.\u201d",
      "The mayor released a video statement Wednesday saying the indictment is a \u201cpolitical prosecution\u201d to hurt his 2025 campaign for reelection. He also said: \u201cI have never accepted a bribe of any type.\u201d",
      "Owens told reporters outside the courthouse Thursday that the indictment is \u201ca horrible example of a flawed FBI investigation\u201d and \u201can assassination attempt on my character.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe think the truth has to come out, that cherry-picked statements of drunken, locker-room banter is not a crime,\u201d Owens said. He said he will fight the charges, \u201cbut right now, I'm going to get back to protecting Hinds County and being the district attorney that you've elected us to be.\u201d",
      "Banks declined to speak to reporters as he left the courthouse.",
      "Lumumba and Banks were elected in mid-2017. Owens was elected in 2019 and took office in 2020. All three are Democrats.",
      "Jackson City Council member Angelique Lee, a Democrat, first elected in 2020, resigned in August and pleaded guilty to federal bribery charges as the result of the same FBI investigation. Her sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 13.",
      "In May, FBI agents raided Owens' office and a cigar bar he owns in downtown Jackson. Among the items found in the district attorney's office was a lockbox made to look like a book labeled as the U.S. Constitution, containing about $20,000 in cash, with about $9,900 showing serial numbers confirming it was paid by the purported developers to Owens, according to the newly unsealed indictment.",
      "Owens boasted to the purported developers about having influence over Jackson officials and \u201cfacilitated over $80,000 in bribe payments\u201d to Lumumba, Banks and Lee in exchange for their agreement to ensure approval of the multimillion-dollar downtown development, according to the indictment.",
      "The document also says Owens \u201csolicited and accepted at least $115,000 in cash and promises of future financial benefits\u201d from the purported developers to use his relationships with Lumumba, Banks and Lee and act as an intermediary for the payments to them.",
      "Lumumba directed a city employee to move a deadline to favor the purported developers\u2019 project, and Banks and Lee agreed to vote in favor of it, according to the indictments unsealed Thursday.",
      "Sherik Marve Smith \u2014 who is an insurance broker and a relative of Owens, according to court documents \u2014 waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a federal bribery charge in the case on Oct. 17. He agreed to forfeit $20,000, and his sentencing is set for Feb. 19.",
      "Smith conspired to give cash payments and campaign contributions to two Jackson elected officials, and the money came from the purported developers who were working for the FBI, according to court documents.",
      "Owens, Lumumba, Smith and the purported developers traveled in April on a private jet paid by the FBI to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, according to the newly unsealed indictment.",
      "During a meeting on a yacht that was recorded on audio and video, Lumumba received five campaign checks for $10,000 each, and he called a Jackson city employee and instructed that person to move a deadline for submission of proposals to develop the property near the convention center, the indictment says.",
      "The deadline was moved in a way to benefit the purported developers who were working for the FBI by likely eliminating any of their competition, the indictment says."

      "The Mountain Fire started Wednesday morning in Ventura County and had grown to 32 square miles (about 83 square kilometers). It was 7% contained Friday morning.",
      "Some 10,000 people remained under evacuation orders Friday morning as the fire continued to threaten about 3,500 structures in suburban neighborhoods, ranches and agricultural areas around Camarillo in Ventura County.",
      "At least 88 additional structures were damaged in addition to the 132 destroyed. Officials did not specify whether they had been burned or affected by water or smoke damage. The cause of the fire has not been determined.",

    "story": [
      "A military judge has ruled that plea agreements struck by alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants are valid",
      "WASHINGTON -- A military judge has ruled that plea agreements struck by alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants are valid, voiding an order by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to throw out the deals, a government official said.",
      "The official spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday because the order by the judge, Air Force Col. Matthew McCall, has not yet been posted publicly or officially announced.",
      "Unless government prosecutors or others attempt to challenge the plea deals again, McCall's ruling means that the three 9/11 defendants before long could enter guilty pleas in the U.S. military courtroom at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, taking a dramatic step toward wrapping up the long-running and legally troubled government prosecution in one of the deadliest attacks on the United States.",
      "The plea agreements would spare Mohammed and two co-defendants, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, the risk of the death penalty in exchange for the guilty pleas.",
      "Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense attorneys under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at the Guantanamo Bay naval base had approved the agreements.",
      "The plea deals in the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people spurred immediate political blowback by Republican lawmakers and others after they were made public this summer.",
      "Within days, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin issued a brief order saying he was nullifying them. Plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary, Austin said at the time.",
      "The agreements, and Austin's attempt to reverse them, have made for one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays and legal difficulties. That includes years of ongoing pretrial hearings to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants given their years of torture in CIA custody.",
      "The Pentagon is reviewing the judge's decision and had no immediate further comment, said Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary.",
      "Lawdragon, a legal news site that long has covered the courtroom proceedings from Guantanamo, and The New York Times first reported the ruling.",
      "Military officials have yet to post the judge's decision on the Guantanamo military commission's online site. But Lawdragon said McCall's 29-page ruling concludes that Austin lacked the legal authority to toss out the plea deals, and acted too late, after Guantanamo's top official already had approved the deals.",
      "Abiding by Austin\u2019s order would give defense secretaries \u201cabsolute veto power\u201d over any act they disagree with, which would be contrary to the independence of the presiding official over the Guantanamo trials, the law blog quotes McCall as saying in the ruling.",
      "While families of some of the victims and others are adamant that the 9/11 prosecutions continue until trial and possible death sentences, legal experts say it's not clear that could ever happen. If the 9/11 cases ever clear the hurdles of trial, verdicts and sentencings, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit would likely hear many of the issues in the course of any death penalty appeals.",
      "The issues include the CIA destruction of videos of interrogations, whether Austin\u2019s plea deal reversal constituted unlawful interference and whether the torture of the men tainted subsequent interrogations by \u201cclean teams\u201d of FBI agents that did not involve violence.",

      "This fall could happen if the President-elect went through with his repeated campaign promise to levy a 20% tax on all imports, and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports.",

      "Although Trump's aggressive pledges could be a negotiating tactic, the \"possibility of these tariffs being imposed is certainly there\", researcher Nicolo Tamberi said in a blog post.",

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey have both said they will continue to make the argument for free trade.",
      "The UK might be in a position to have to choose whether to try to cut a side deal with the Trump White House to avoid tariffs.",
      "Alternatively the UK could join with other Western and European allies to send a clear message to Trump and the US Congress that American exporters would also be badly hit by such policies.",
      "The CITP numbers only assume that the US sets tariffs on the world, and do not assume a likely trade retaliation from Europe or Asia.",
      "The IMF recently warned that a large scale trade war would drive up inflation and lead to the world economy shrinking 7%, effectively the size of the French and German economies combined."

    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

      "\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,\" he said.",
      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban would apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus would be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",
      "Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.",
      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",
      "While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.",

      "Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements.",
      "One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as \"too blunt an instrument\".",
      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",

      "Prof Miles said the OBR estimated employers would only take around a quarter of the hit from the NI changes in terms of lower profits, and suggested that the rest would be felt by workers.",

      "Sir Keir Starmer has responded to a letter from Sir Alan Bates calling for faster compensation payments for postmasters impacted by the Post Office scandal, the prime minister's spokesman has said.",
      "Sir Alan wrote to the PM twice in the past month, urging him to ensure victims receive full financial redress by March next year.",
      "The former sub-postmaster told MPs earlier he was still awaiting a response, before the prime minister's spokesman said later on Tuesday that a reply had been issued.",
      "Last week, the government announced that \u00a31.8bn has been set aside for people affected by the Horizon IT  scandal, in addition to various compensation schemes already announced.",
      "Between 1999 and 2015 hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted after the faulty Horizon IT accounting system made it look like money was missing from branch accounts.",
      "Sir Alan, portrayed in a ITV drama which thrust the scandal back into the spotlight earlier this year, leads the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance and was giving evidence to a parliamentary committee on Tuesday.",
      "The hearing is considering fast and fair redress for victims of the Post Office scandal and a key point for Sir Alan, which he has made before, is that the government needs to set deadlines for compensation to be paid.",
      "He told MPs he had twice written to the prime minister in the past month to say \"it needs to be finished by the end of March 2025\".",
      "A No10 spokesman said the PM responded to Sir Alan earlier on Tuesday, and added the government is committed to getting quick redress for victims, but is wary of setting an \"arbitrary cut-off\" date that could see some claimants miss out.",
      "\u201cWe want redress as quickly as possible,\" he said. \"What we don\u2019t want to do is set an absolute cut-off date which would result in some claimants missing the deadline.",
      "\"But each postmaster eligible should receive substantial redress by the end of March.\"",
      "Campaigners have criticised the amount of time it is taking for those affected to receive compensation. Many sub-postmasters were wrongly sent to prison for false accounting and theft, and several more were financially ruined. Some have died waiting for justice.",
      "The PM's spokesperson said as of 31 October, approximately \u00a3438m had been paid to more than 3,100 claimants across the four compensation schemes.",
      "'Like a battle'",
      "Janet Skinner, now in her 50s, is still waiting for her compensation. Her claim has been in the system for more than two years.",
      "\"This is supposed to help people. It\u2019s more like a battle,\u201d she said of the compensation process.",
      "She was handed a nine-month sentence in 2007 over an alleged shortfall of \u00a359,000 from her Post Office branch in Bransholme, Hull.",
      "She served three months in prison before being released with an electronic tag, but eventually had her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal in April 2021.",
      "The stress of the scandal left her with neurological problems, leading to paralysis in parts of her body which she is learning to move again. She said she has been asked for a fifth time for a medical report to prove her disability was as a result of the scandal.",
      "How do the Post Office compensation schemes work?",
      "'Just pay up,' says Post Office scandal victim",
      "'The Post Office has ruined every happy moment of my life since 2005'",
      "At the committee, lawyers were asked about their experience of the Horizon Shortfall compensation scheme, which is overseen by the Post Office.",
      "This compensation scheme is for sub-postmasters who were not convicted, or part of the Group Litigation Order (GLO) court action, but who believe they experienced shortfalls because of Horizon.",
      "David Enright, whose law firm represents hundreds of Post Office victims, said there is no funding for legal advice at the start, with claimants presented with a \"DIY questionnaire\".",
      "Then, six to nine months later, he said there is a request for more information which often involves 50-150 further questions that can only be answered by the likes of a forensic accountant.",
      "\"The system is designed to wear people down,\" he told MPs.",
      "Another lawyer said some of his sub-postmaster clients were being asked to provide proof of losses in claims that are 20 years old, but cannot to do so because the evidence had been previously seized by the Post Office and not given back.",
      "The GLO scheme is for the 555 former postmasters who won their group lawsuit, but received relatively small payouts after legal costs were paid. The scheme is funded and managed by the government."

      "\"Now entrepreneurs can breathe freely without fear of repercussion, without fear of corrupt inspectors, without fear of a filthy justice sector that commits crazy abuses.\"",
      "Mr Vocks agrees that Moldova is now a much easier place in which to do business than when he first set up his company there back in 2007.",
      "\"Back then, it was extremely bureaucratic. It was hard to get a residence permit. It was painful to register a company, especially as a foreigner.",

      "The MITP has also simplified immigration procedures through the IT Visa program.",
      "More than 2,000 companies are now registered with the MITP, 300 of which have come from overseas. The most common countries these have moved from being the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Ukraine.",

      "The UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\u2019s first digital dyeing process.",
      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",
      "NTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\u2019s interview request.",
      "Kirsi Niinim\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \u201cquite promising\u201d \u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.",
      "But even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.",
      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",
      "The company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.",
      "They will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.",
      "Big fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.",
      "And that\u2019s just one company - there will be many, many more in need.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 00:01:32 GMT",
    "summary": "A growing global movement is seeing people object to data centres in their locality.",
    "story": [
      "Environmental campaigner Julie Bolthouse points out that Northern Virginia has the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centres. This is not something she is thrilled about.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re the Wall Street of the data centre industry,\u201d says Ms Bolthouse, who is a director of local Virginian charity and campaign group Piedmont Environmental Council.",
      "Data centres are vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Northern Virginia, the northern region of the state of Virginia, has been a key location for data centres since the 1990s. This is thanks to its immediate proximity to Washington DC, yet with historically cheap electricity and land prices.",
      "Centred on the city of Ashburn, which is 35 miles (56km) west of the US capital, there are more than 477 data centres in the state. This is by far the largest number in the US, with Texas in second place on 290, and California third with 283.",
      "In fact, some studies say that 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic goes through Ashburn and the surrounding area, which has been dubbed \u201cData Centre Alley\u201d.",
      "Thanks in large part to the continuing boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires more computing power, demand for data centres is rocketing. As a result, global data centre capacity is expected to double over the next five years, according to a recent study by business analysis firm Moody\u2019s.",
      "Ms Bolthouse and other environmentalists in Northern Virginia are opposed to the continuing expansion of the data centre sector in their region, saying it is already having a major negative impact on their quality of life.",
      "She points to new electricity cables being built over conservation land, parks and neighbourhoods, increased water demand, and the facilities\u2019 back-up diesel generators affecting air quality.",
      "Ms Bolthouse also cites the fact that households in Virginia and neighbouring Maryland are being expected to help pay for the electricity network upgrades that the data centres require.",
      "She and fellow campaigners are fighting back. \u201cWe\u2019re working directly on the ground, opposing each data centre application and working on the local zoning, and trying to educate our local planning commission and supervisors about the issues that we see. But we're also working at the state level.\u201d",
      "Similar campaigns against data centres are springing up all over the world, including in the Republic of Ireland, where such facilities use 21% of the country\u2019s electricity.",
      "\"Our main objections to data centres revolve around their potential negative impacts on our climate, their sustainability, and local infrastructure,\" says Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment. \"When data centres rely on fossil fuel, they potentially strain the electricity grid and can undermine national renewable energy commitments.\"",
      "The group is continuing to challenge plans for a new \u20ac1.2bn ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) data centre in County Clare on Ireland\u2019s west coast.",
      "Mr Lowes adds that while Friends of the Irish Environment would prefer to see data centre development halted altogether, there are various mitigations that might help, including sites prioritising renewable energy, and implementing energy and cooling efficiency measures.",
      "The big players in the global data centre industry are trying to allay people\u2019s concerns. This summer, for example, Microsoft launched its Data Center Community Pledge.",
      "Microsoft is promising that by next year it will procure 100% renewable energy globally. And that by 2030 it will \u201cachieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting\u201d, and become \u201cwater positive\u201d. The latter means that it aims for its data centres to return more water to the local supply than they use.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already uses recycled water for cooling in 20 of its 125 data centres around the world, and also says it will be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030.",
      "Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, which represents dozens of data centre operators including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, says that data centres are leading the way on clean energy use.",
      "\"For example, wind and solar capacity contracted to data centre providers and customers represented two-thirds of the total US corporate renewables market last year, and four of the top five purchasers of renewable energy in the US are companies that operate data centres,\" he says.",
      "\"The data centre industry is also unlocking greater energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users \u2013 everything from smart thermostats to grid-enhancing technologies require the digital infrastructure provided by data centres.\"",
      "The protests against data centres have also extended to South America, where campaigners say they have achieved successes.",
      "In Uruguay, for example, Google changed the design of a new facility now under construction. It was initially due to be water cooled, but the US giant switched to an air-cooled system.",
      "This followed protests in a country that has been experiencing droughts and a shortage of drinking water.",
      "\"Water use by Google in the initial proposal would have been equivalent to the daily consumption of drinking water by 55,000 people in our country,\" says Mar\u00eda Selva Ortiz of Friends of the Earth Uruguay.",
      "\"This threat to the right to water amidst a water crisis raised strong criticisms, leading Google to change the proposed technology to cool down its equipment, so the project was modified. Chillers will cool down with air instead of water.\u201d",
      "In Chile, meanwhile, Google has halted plans for a data centre over similar water use concerns.",
      "Back in Virginia, Ms Bolthouse says the firms need to do more to boost sustainability. In the long run, she says, it will be in the industry's own interests to improve data centres' environmental impact.",
      "\"What's going to happen if we continue with business as usual is that electrical prices are going to skyrocket for everybody, including the data centre industry - and that's their biggest bill, so that's going to impact them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe water scarcity issue is also going to impact them.",
      "\u201cSo I am optimistic that we're going to see a little bit of progress, but I think it's going to take time.\"",

      "More than 3,900 students - 38% of the total college population at Leeds City - have at least one form of bespoke exam arrangements.",
      "And while the \"holistic approach\" allows students to perform better in exams, Mr Stables says a lot of planning is needed to make sure every exam runs smoothly.",
      "In the past, the college has had to hire out a community centre to fulfil extra space requirements on exam days.",

      "A 17-year-old girl in China hailed as a genius in a mathematics contest cheated, competition organisers have said - ending months of scepticism over her stellar results.",
      "Jiang Ping, a fashion design student from a rural town in Jiangsu province, made headlines in June when she came 12th in the qualifiers of an international maths contest run by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.",
      "She was the first finalist since the competition began in 2018 to have come from a lowly vocational school, Chinese media reported. The vast majority of the 800 finalists came from elite universities.",
      "Jiang's results turned her into an overnight sensation, and she was labelled a \"prodigy\" in the press and on social media.",
      "Under China's notoriously cut-throat education system, academic excellence is lauded. Many people online were encouraged by Jiang's results, seeing them as proof that students from vocational institutes could still excel academically.",
      "However, as doubt surrounding her abilities snowballed, competition organisers  said last Sunday that Jiang had violated competition rules in the preliminary round, by receiving help from her teacher, who was also a contestant himself.",
      "\u201cThis has exposed problems like inadequacies in the competition format and the lack of rigour in supervision. We sincerely apologise,\u201d organisers said in a statement.",
      "According to the final results announced on Sunday, neither Jiang nor her teacher was among 86 winners in the competition.",
      "The rise of a maths sensation",
      "The annual mathematics contest is open to contestants from institutions worldwide and hosted by Damo Academy, Alibaba\u2019s research institute.",
      "This year, Jiang, a student at Jiangsu Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, outperformed other finalists from some of the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions \u2014 including Peking University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Oxford.",
      "She had chosen to study at the vocational school both because she was interested in fashion design, and because her sister and friends were there, said local media outlets.",
      "Jiang's results and unconventional educational background soon grabbed nationwide attention. Her story was featured in a video produced by Damo Academy and she was interviewed by news outlets across the country.",
      "\u201cLearning maths is bumpy, but every time I solve the problems I feel quite happy,\u201d she told the state-run People\u2019s Daily. \u201cNo matter what the future holds, I will keep learning.\u201d",
      "Jiang\u2019s teacher, Wang Runqiu, was also thrust into the spotlight, hailed as an educator who noticed and encouraged her passion for maths. Speaking to the media, he described her as an attentive student who had learnt advanced mathematics herself.",

      "China's education system focuses much of its resources on those taking the \"Gaokao\" - the notoriously difficult exam that students need to take in order to get into university. Those in vocational schools had long faced restrictions in taking the gaokao and enrolling in regular universities, until an education reform in 2022 offered vocational school students an alternative university entrance exam.",
      "An earlier op-ed in state-news media outlet Xinhua said that Jiang's results \u201chint[ed] at an awkward truth: even youths as talented as her may be easily buried without good education credentials\u201d.",
      "'She was not the mastermind'",
      "But as Jiang\u2019s fame burgeoned, criticism and scepticism surrounding her skills also started to bubble.",
      "In June, dozens of other finalists published a joint letter they wrote to the competition organising committee demanding an investigation into Jiang. They also called for her answers to the preliminary test questions to be made public.",
      "The finalists alleged that Jiang had made \u201cseveral apparent writing mistakes\u201d in an online video and that she \u201cseemed unfamiliar with these mathematical expressions and symbols\u201d.",
      "While the preliminary round of the competition allowed participants to use programming software, the final round was a closed-book exam. The results of the finals, which were initially set to be released in August, were postponed for several months.",
      "When the results were finally made public on Sunday, Jiang was not among the 86 winners of the final round.",
      "Her school also confirmed in a statement on Sunday that Jiang had been helped by her teacher Wang, and that Wang had been given a warning and disqualified from teachers\u2019 awards for the year. The statement also called for leniency and protection for the teenager.",
      "Attempts by the BBC to contact Jiang's family were unsuccessful. A social media account once used by her mother is now defunct, and a phone number linked to her father has been deactivated. Multiple phone calls by the BBC to Jiang's school went unanswered, and a village official declined to discuss Jiang when contacted by the BBC.",

      "Adopted children are likely to be allowed much closer contact with their birth families in the future as part of \u201cseismic\u201d changes recommended in a report published today. Some families say the changes are long overdue - but others worry they may deter people from adopting.",
      "Angela Frazer-Wicks\u2019 two sons were removed from her care and adopted in 2004, when they were aged five and one. She was in an abusive relationship and had problems with addiction and her mental health.",
      "By 2011 Angela had recovered, she was in a new relationship, and had a baby daughter. The local authority was not involved in her daughter\u2019s care.",
      "Angela\u2019s sons and their adoptive parents had stayed in touch with her - writing letters and sending photos once or twice a year. But when the older of the two boys became a teenager, he told his adoptive mother he no longer wanted to write to his birth mother. Angela carried on sending cards, but heard nothing back for years.",
      "Then out of the blue, in 2020, Angela received an email from her eldest son. It turned out he had been trying to contact her, but the local authority had told him that wasn\u2019t possible.",
      "Last month, Angela met her eldest son in person - it was the first time she had seen him for 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt was amazing for me,\" Angela says, \"even more so for my daughter - she\u2019s waited her entire life to meet her brother.\u201d",
      "Adoption is the state\u2019s most powerful intervention in family life. It is a permanent break between a child and their birth family, and alters the child's identity forever.  In law they are no longer the child of their birth parents, and most adopted children grow up without seeing or knowing any of their birth family.",
      "Around 3,000 children are adopted in England each year. It\u2019s a process that must be authorised by judges in family courts, who set out the level of contact the child will have with their birth parents - usually just letters, sent twice a year, via an intermediary.",
      "While adoption law has evolved over the years - allowing children to know more about their history than they once did, in some ways, families say, adoption is still very much stuck in the past.",
      "Now a new report from a group set up by the most senior judge in the family court says wholesale reform of the system is needed.",
      "\u201cLetterbox\u201d contact between adopted children and birth families is outdated, the report says, instead recommending face-to-face contact where that is safe.",
      "The extremely detailed report is strongly supported by Sir Andrew McFarlane who says there is no need to change the law for this to happen.",
      "The report is likely to influence family court adoption hearings throughout England and Wales.",
      "Angela Frazer-Wicks describes her experience of adoption as a \"life sentence\u2026 without any right to appeal\". As chair of trustees of the charity Family Rights Group, she is pleased mothers like her will have more chance to continue seeing their children after they have been adopted.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a seismic shift,\u201d Angela says. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a long time coming. My hope is that we start to see just a bit more compassion towards birth families - they are so often seen as the problem.\u201d",
      "While meeting birth family can be very positive for some adopted children, face-to-face meetings aren\u2019t good for all children in this position.",
      "When Cassie was adopted aged three, she constantly worried about the mother she\u2019d been take away from.",
      "Out shopping with her adoptive parents Dee and John, Cassie would even ask if she could buy groceries for her birth mum.",
      "Dee was advised it would be reassuring for Cassie to meet her birth mother face-to-face.",
      "Their reunion, in a noisy contact centre, went well \u2013 but the following day Cassie was very tired, pale and limp. Dee decided to take Cassie to the doctor, and by the time they arrived at the surgery Cassie was trembling and vomiting uncontrollably.",
      "But there was nothing physically wrong the doctor said - Cassie was in shock.",
      "For nearly two years Cassie and Dee went to specialist therapy. Cassie still seemed to worry about her birth mother, and would try to call her on a toy telephone.",
      "Another meeting was arranged, in a quieter environment, with support. After that, Cassie, who is now aged 30, says she didn\u2019t want to see her birth mother again.",

      "\u201cThe children become very emotionally mixed up,\u201d says Sir Andrew McFarlane, the head of the Family Court in England and Wales.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to work out who you are you in the world, and you have some memory of the family you lived with until you were four or five\u2026 it\u2019s almost natural to try and trace them and be in touch with them.\u201d",
      "Without expert help, this can have disastrous consequences.",
      "In 2021 one couple told the BBC it was \u201cdevastating\u201d to see their two adopted sons turn against them and get drawn into crime, after they had been reunited with their birth family.",

      "Woman wins six-figure payout after adoption broke down",
      "Following a four-year review and consultation, the 170-page report published today says greater consideration should be given to whether adopted children \u201cshould have face-to-face contact with those who were significant to them before they were adopted\u201d.",
      "The report is intended as a review of the adoption process and a \"catalyst for positive changes\".",

      "Many adoptive parents agree the current \"letterbox\" system of contact is not effective.",

      "A Department for Education spokesperson said the value of children growing up in a loving family \"cannot be underestimated\". And for many children in care, \"adoption makes this happen\".",

      "The Scottish Covid Inquiry is being told about the impact of the pandemic on all levels of education.",
      "The body representing school leaders said its members had reported a rise in parents simply not accepting their children were behaving badly since the pandemic.",
      "School Leaders Scotland (SLS) suggested that some parents were taking \"the path of least resistance\" with their kids.",
      "The inquiry started its hearings last year and has already covered the impact of the pandemic on people using health and social care services.",
      "It is now hearing from people on the frontline of education.",
      "Graham Hutton, general secretary for the SLS and a former head teacher in Dundee, told the inquiry that pupil behaviour and attendance problems had been one of the \"hidden consequences\" of the pandemic.",
      "Mr Hutton said: \"What I\u2019m hearing from my colleagues is there has been a rise in the amount of arguments they are having with parents which they probably wouldn\u2019t have had in the past.\"",
      "Mr Hutton said scenarios where parents were \"absolutely adamant that their child is right even when evidence is put to them\" were now more common.",
      "He added: \"In many ways it looks to us as if they take the path of least resistance.",
      "\"They have maybe not been able to deal appropriately with young people when they have been off school and therefore they have allowed young people to do as they wish or been rather weak with setting parameters.\"",
      "Scotland's schools faced years of disruption during the Covid pandemic, including full and partial closures, home learning and major changes to the way pupils were assessed.",
      "Mr Hutton said: \u201cThe pandemic did have negative impact right across the board, we were not prepared for it. In many ways we were fumbling around in the dark to make sure we did the best by our young people.\u201d",
      "The SLS claimed the Covid pandemic had proved that the current way Scotland's schools are arranged and pupils tested is no longer fit for purpose and requires major changes.",
      "Inquiry chairman Lord Brailsford described these arguments as \u201cforceful and potent\u201d and said they would be considered by the investigation he is leading.",
      "'Breakdown of trust'",
      "Earlier the inquiry had heard how the pandemic impacted higher and further education.",
      "Matt Crilly, who was the National Union of Students of Scotland president from July 2020 to June 2022, said fears over missing out on income from international student fees was a driver behind reopening Scotland\u2019s universities during the pandemic.",
      "He said: \u201cThe highest single source of income for many of our universities comes from international students and my understanding at that time is that there was a fear that (if) learning was to be delivered exclusively or predominately online... many international students may not want to enrol on a \u00a320,000 a year fee-paying course.\u201d",
      "Mr Crilly added that at this time there had been a \"breakdown of trust\" in those in authority by students who felt they had been told to attend in person only to find themselves in \"semi-official lockdown\".",
      "He added that students in this position felt \"isolated from the rest of society\".",
      "He told the inquiry: \"Essentially, they felt like they were being seen as the cause of the pandemic and the cause of the virus spreading.",
      "\"They felt that they were being judged because of that, despite the fact that they were told that they had to be there, and they had to arrive on campus to take part in their education.\"",
      "The inquiry also heard how many higher and further education students didn\u2019t have their own computers to be able to access learning online when face-to-face teaching was again suspended.",
      "This included one example of a student trying to write a dissertation on their mobile phone.",

      "For seven years, she'd built The Receipts alongside Audrey Indome and Tolani Shoneye, collecting more than 100,000 weekly listeners on the way.",
      "Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, Milena says quitting was a difficult decision but her mental health had deteriorated to a point where she couldn't carry on.",
      "\"It wasn't one I took lightly - even though it might have seemed like that,\" says Milena, 33.",
      "Audrey and Tolani said in January they were blindsided by Milena's decision to leave but Milena claimed it came after a rift that had lasted for years.",
      "There were also rumours - denied by the podcasters - that Milena was bullied and squeezed out of the group.",
      "\"Ultimately, I had to be true to who I was and remove myself from that space,\" Milena tells Newsbeat.",

      "\"Financially, I could've shut my mouth and stayed and collected the bag,\" says Milena.",

    "summary": "India\u2019s ban on the import of Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses is under scrutiny - here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Is it legal to import Sir Salman Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses in India?",
      "This question has been puzzling legal experts since the Delhi High Court suggested this week that the notification banning the novel\u2019s import - issued in 1988 - might no longer be valid, as the government couldn't locate it.",
      "The Satanic Verses, criticised by some Muslims as blasphemous, was banned in India shortly after its release, sparking protests worldwide. Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989, calling for Rushdie\u2019s assassination. This forced the Indian-born Booker Prize-winning author into hiding for nearly a decade.",
      "Although the book remains officially banned in India, some legal experts now believe it could be imported unless the government reaffirms the ban. Others, however, caution that practical obstacles may still exist.",
      "The ban on the book came under scrutiny after Sandipan Khan, a resident of West Bengal state, tried to buy the book but learnt that it was not published in India nor could it be imported.",
      "In 2017, he filed a Right to Information (RTI) request for the official notification banning the book\u2019s import, but was sent through a series of departments without finding it.",
      "In 2019, Khan took the matter to the Delhi High Court, arguing that the ban impacted his freedom to read.",
      "Over five years, government departments repeatedly failed to produce the notification, despite customs having similar records from as far back as 1968.",
      "Finally, on 5 November, the court declared it had no option but to \u201cpresume\u201d that no such ban notification exists and therefore couldn\u2019t assess its validity.",
      "The case raises a perplexing question: is a notification valid if no copy of it can be found?",
      "The simple answer is, we don't know yet.",
      "The court has not clarified if the book could be accessed in India but advised Mr Khan to pursue any legal options to obtain it.",
      "Uddyam Mukherjee, Mr Khan\u2019s lawyer, told the BBC that federal departments couldn\u2019t provide a clear answer either, when asked by the court.",
      "\u201cI have never come across a situation like this,\u201d said Madan Lokur, a former judge of the Supreme Court.",
      "If the notification is not found then \u201ctechnically no ban exists\u201d and the book can be imported.",
      "\u201cHowever, the government may pass a fresh notification [banning the book's import],\u201d Mr Lokur added, since the court has not declared the ban to be unconstitutional, but only said that the notification is presumed to not exist.",
      "Mr Mukherjee argued that the book could now be imported \u201cas there is no legal impediment\u201d against the book.",
      "However, some legal experts disagree.",
      "Raju Ramachandran, a senior lawyer, said he found the suggestion a \u201clittle extreme\u201d.",
      "\u201cAll that the high court says is that this particular petition has become infructuous [invalid] since the notification could not be found,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has not given the right to the petitioner to import the book.\u201d",
      "Senior lawyer Sanjay Hegde said the book could have been published in India if \u201csomeone was brave enough to print it\u201d as only its import was banned, not its publication.",
      "\u201cBut after all the brouhaha, nobody wanted to print it in India.\"",
      "In 2012, the government of Rajasthan state sought the arrest of four Indian authors - Hari Kunzru, Ruchir Joshi, Amitava Kumar and Jeet Thayil - after they downloaded a few passages from the Satanic Verses and read them out at a literary festival in the city.",
      "At the time, many legal experts were of the opinion that downloading a book whose import had been banned could not be considered a crime. But online copies of the book have been hard to find in India.",
      "Rushdie, 76, continues to face threats over his outspoken views on Islam.",
      "In 2022, he lost an eye and spent six weeks in hospital after being stabbed up to 10 times on stage at an event in New York state. The suspect, Hadi Matar, has been charged with attempted murder.",
      "In his recent memoir, the writer has criticised the response to his book, noting that \"no properly authorised body [in India] had reviewed the book, nor was there any semblance of a judicial process\"."

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 13:58:27 GMT",
    "summary": "The actress was the last surviving original cast member of BBC Radio 4 serial The Archers.",
    "story": [
      "June Spencer, who has died aged 105, was the last surviving original cast member of The Archers.",
      "For nearly 70 years, she played Peggy Woolley in the long-running radio drama: one of the best-loved matriarchs in British broadcasting.",
      "Spencer helped launch BBC Radio's \"everyday story of country folk\" on 1 January 1951. Clement Attlee was Prime Minister, and meat, cheese, sugar, and petrol were still being rationed after World War Two.",
      "As Peggy, she weathered the ups and downs of life in Ambridge, with plot lines including alcoholism, gambling, and dementia, until Spencer\u2019s retirement in 2022 at the age of 103.",
      "At the time, her colleagues paid tribute to an actor who never fluffed a line.",
      "\u201cI have rarely worked with such an inventive, focused and technically brilliant actor,\u201d said Jeremy Howe \u2013 the editor of the programme, \"or with such a lovely person\".",
      "The Archers radio star June Spencer dies aged 105",
      "June Rosalind Spencer was born on 14 June 1919, just six months after the end of World War One.",
      "Her acting career began at the age of three, when she was cast as King of the Land of Nod in a school play. When she heard the audience laugh, June knew it was the life for her.",
      "She went to Nottingham High School for Girls, which she found \u201cvery stark, grey and cold\u201d.",
      "She was forced to give up sport \u2013 her favourite lesson \u2013 when a doctor somehow misdiagnosed a heart condition.",
      "An only child, her father was a \u201csensible and supportive\u201d biscuit salesman, but her mother was another story.",
      "A \u201ccomplex woman\u201d, Mrs Spencer had once aspired to the stage herself, but \u2013 according to her daughter - \u201cjust gave up on life... and decided she was an invalid at the age of 40\u201d.",
      "June Spencer had little choice but to leave school to look after her mother \u2013 who eventually lived until she was 94.",
      "Miserably, mother and daughter sat together in a darkened room in case Mrs Spencer had \"an attack\".",
      "Her headmistress was angry, complaining that her former pupil was throwing her life away. \u201cI was frightened of her,\u201d June later recalled.",
      "\u201cShe told me, \u2018Of course, you can't expect to get anywhere without your School Certificate\u2019.",
      "\"I have thought of those words many times since, particularly when I received my OBE.\u201d",
      "In her teens, the aspiring actress enjoyed writing comic monologues - performing them as part of the after-dinner entertainment at local Masonic lodges.",
      "But with her heart set on the stage, her mother was obstructive: refusing to let her daughter sit the exams for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.",
      "\u201cI think my mother thought I would fall in with a bad lot,\u201d Spencer said. \"When I did finally get in [to the theatre] she said: 'Oh well, I suppose it was inevitable'.\"",
      "She joined a drama club, studied for a London Guildhall drama school certificate, and finally joined a local theatre company in 1942.",
      "The same year she married a \u201cfair-haired, blue-eyed boy with the cheekiest grin I\u2019d ever seen\u201d.",
      "She had first met Roger Brocksom when she was 17 years old, on holiday near Skegness \u2013 but he didn\u2019t have the money to buy her a ring.",
      "The wedding took place while he was on leave from the army; wartime shortages meant they had rice paper rather than icing on the cake.",
      "A series of small parts on BBC radio programmes followed, and \u2013 by the time her husband returned from the war \u2013 Spencer was finding regular work.",
      "Then came the moment that changed her life.",
      "The founder of The Archers, Godfrey Baseley, is said to have talked openly in meetings about who was going to be in his new programme \u2013 and news travelled fast.",
      "It reached a mystified June Spencer while she was getting lunch in the BBC canteen.",

      "In 1950, there were a few pilot episodes and then the big launch on New Year\u2019s Day, 1951 \u2013 with June Spencer playing a heavily pregnant Peggy Archer.",
      "The series hoped to be a public service for farmers, with gentle storylines that brought urban listeners into rural surroundings \u2013 almost as if they were eavesdropping on farmers and their wives.",
      "To start with, Spencer had a 13-week contract and little idea that she was helping to create a unique slice of British life.",
      "The shows were then broadcast live, with producers creeping in and scribbling alterations on scripts, moments before she read them.",
      "But The Archers was an instant hit with the actors \u2013 despite never having their credits read out on air \u2013 in demand for local appearances.",
      "\"I remember going down to a gathering of all the Women's Institutes in Cornwall,\u201d June recalled, \u201cand I was mobbed. It was quite frightening.\"",
      "There was a brief break from the show when June and Roger adopted two children in the late 1950s. Thelma Rogers took over the part for a while, but soon returned to the theatre.",
      "On taking back the role, Spencer insisted she had little in common with Peggy, who rather lacked a sense of humour, but her on-air journey from young barmaid to grieving widow saw them both involved in some of the show's strongest storylines.",
      "Peggy\u2019s first husband, Jack Archer, succumbed to alcoholism, while her second husband Jack Woolley \u2013 with whom she hoped to enjoy a happy retirement - was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.",
      "The show\u2019s slow-moving plot lines meant each disease unfolded over years - as they do in real life. And both issues were close to June\u2019s heart.",
      "Around the time of her Golden Wedding anniversary, Spencer had noticed that Roger\u2019s memory \u201cwas playing him false\u201d and \u201cthen the repetitive questions started,\u201d she said.",
      "When Peggy Woolley\u2019s husband was given the same disease in The Archers, June was supportive and \u2013 with her experience of Roger\u2019s gradual disintegration \u2013 was often consulted by the scriptwriters.",
      "Roger passed away in 2001. Five years later, June saw her son David \u2013 a ballet dancer who had lost his career through injury - die of alcohol abuse. He was 55 years old.",
      "For Spencer, such things were not unusual occurrences of life imitating art. Her attitude was that every family experiences traumas and disasters, and drama helps them to deal with it.",
      "\u201cWe tackle difficult situations that come up in real life, and treat them without being sensational,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI think people appreciate that. When they have the same sort of problems, they hear how the Archers coped, and I think it helps them.\"",
      "June Spencer was made an OBE in 1991 and a CBE in Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Birthday Honours List in 2017.",
      "Interviewers who came to her home in rural Surrey were routinely charmed.",
      "\u201cIt's hard not to go overboard with admiration for a nonagenarian who remains so unaffected by her fame on the one hand,\u201d wrote one, \u201cand some of the awful things life has thrown at her on the other.\u201d",
      "She held a special place in the nation\u2019s heart as queen of its longest-running radio drama, and was thought of with enormous affection by her fellow cast members.",
      "June \u201cshone through sadness without a word of complaint,\" recalled Charles Collingwood - who plays Brian Aldridge, her fictional son-in-law, \u201cand always remained immense fun\"."

      "But when Payne fell to his death, Cassidy had already left the country.",
      "What happened on the day he died?",
      "Payne had been staying in the upmarket Casa Sur hotel for three days before his death.",
      "A call was made to emergency services around 17:00 local time (21:00 BST) on 16 October by staff, with requests to respond to a hotel guest \"who is overwhelmed by drugs and alcohol\" and \"destroying his room\".",

      "They also ruled out self-harm or physical intervention by a third party.",

      "Then aged 41, Jones had already made an indelible mark on American music as a performer, arranger, songwriter, producer, soundtrack composer and record executive.",
      "He started out in the jumping jazz clubs of the 1950s; mastered soul, swing and pop on recordings by Dinah Washington, Frank Sinatra and Lesley Gore; and reached the top 10 in his own right.",
      "Some of the biggest entertainers in America agreed to perform at his memorial.",

      "Even more exciting things were yet to come.",
      "Jones went on to forge an era-defining partnership with Michael Jackson; oversee 1985's We Are the World, one of the biggest-selling songs of all time; craft hits for acts like Chaka Khan and Donna Summer; and work with the biggest names in hip-hop.",
      "Few branches of American popular music were immune to his influence.",
      "Jones had always been a survivor.",
      "He grew up in the shadow of the Great Depression in the 1930s on the South Side of Chicago. His mother was taken to a psychiatric institution when he was seven and his father worked as a carpenter for notorious gangsters the Jones Boys.",
      "Young Quincy wanted to be a gangster too. \"You want to be what you see, and that's all we ever saw,\" he said.",
      "He and his brother were \"street rats\" and, when he strayed into the wrong neighbourhood at the age of seven, a rival gang member \"nailed my hand to a fence\". Another injury came from an ice pick to the face.",
      "His father took the family to Washington state, where one night Quincy and some friends broke into a community centre, looking for food. Inside, there was a piano.",
      "\"I touched it and every cell in my body said, this is what you'll do [for] the rest of your life,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Front Row in 2016.",
      "The encounter \"changed my life\", he said in conversation with rapper Kendrick Lamar for a 2018 Netflix documentary, adding that, \"I would have been dead or in prison a long time ago\" if he hadn't discovered music.",
      "Quincy immediately began experimenting with instruments at school, settling on the trumpet, and began playing in nightclubs.",
      "At the age of 14, he made friends with another then-unknown musician called Ray Charles, who became a lifelong collaborator.",
      "He also played with Billie Holiday at 14, and got taken under the wings of bandleader Count Basie and trumpeter Clark Terry. He went on to accompany Dizzy Gillespie and appeared in the band during Elvis Presley's first TV appearance.",
      "After showing a talent for arranging songs while touring the world with Lionel Hampton's big band, he was soon in demand in that capacity, too.",
      "But after running up a $145,000 debt on a European tour, he took a day job with Mercury Records in 1961, becoming the first African-American vice-president of a major record label.",
      "While there, he discovered and produced the million-selling single It's My Party by Lesley Gore. He also released the Big Band Bossa Nova compilation album, which included his own infectious track Soul Bossa Nova, which has since become a staple of parties and film soundtracks, including Austin Powers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sinatra had been impressed with Jones's work and called on him to arrange and conduct two of his albums in the 1960s. The pair formed a fertile partnership, with Sinatra calling him \"a giant\" and \"one of the finest musicians I've ever known\".",
      "The pair became firm friends outside the studio, too. \"Seven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying,\" Jones recalled.",

      "In Cold Blood's author Truman Capote reportedly tried to have Jones removed from the film because he was black. But he remained, and the score earned Jones the first of seven Oscar nominations.",
      "Another soundtrack was The Wiz, the 1978 film musical version of the Wizard of Oz, which starred Diana Ross and a 19-year-old Michael Jackson, who was looking to branch out after finding childhood fame in The Jackson 5.",
      "Jones saw a superstar quality in Jackson and became his producer and mentor, first on 1979's Off the Wall, which was a major hit, and then 1982's Thriller, which reached new heights of commercial and critical success, and made Jackson the undisputed King of Pop.",
      "The album was not just the fulfilment of Jackson's talent, but the culmination of Jones's career, as he used his peerless musical expertise to define the 1980s with a sleek and polished fusion of R&B and pop.",
      "Jones listened to hundreds of songs to decide which nine should go on the album, and employed a dream team of musicians and songwriters that he had been assembling over the years.",
      "His choice of collaborators was one example of his knack for knowing how to make a good song great. For Beat It, he thought the single needed a rockier edge, so he recruited Eddie Van Halen to contribute a guitar solo. Legend has it that the solo was so explosive that a speaker caught fire in the studio.",
      "And when it came to the title track, Jones didn't like the original name Starlight, so he asked its writer, Rod Temperton, to come up with something different. Temperton renamed it Thriller and recast it with a spooky theme. Jones topped it off by asking his wife's friend, horror actor Vincent Price, to record a spoken-word outro.",
      "The album earned Jones and Jackson the Grammy Award for producer of the year, while Thriller was named album of the year and Beat It won record of the year.",
      "Jones used his winning formula in the 1980s with George Benson, Donna Summer and Patti Austin, and produced the decade's best-selling single when Jackson and Lionel Richie assembled 35 of America's biggest names for the 1985 charity song We Are the World.",
      "Jones famously posted a message on the studio entrance telling the stars: \"Check your egos at the door\".",
      "He had further success under his own name with his albums The Dude and Back on the Block. The latter, released in 1989, featured an all-star cast including many friends from his early career like Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Ray Charles.",
      "But as well as revisiting his past, he was also firmly in the present, enlisting rappers like Ice-T and Grandmaster Melle Mel to appear on the title track.",
      "It earned Jones another album of the year award at the Grammys.",
      "Although he was in his 50s, he embraced rap music because he saw similarities with the energy of bebop jazz, and because may of its stars had risen out of hardship on the streets.",
      "\"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "And rap stars reciprocated his affection, looking on Jones as an inspirational elder statesman of black American music. Even Kendrick and Dr Dre were awestruck when meeting him for the Netflix documentary, which was titled Quincy and directed by his daughter, actress Rashida Jones.",
      "Jones used his status to try to stem the violence in the hip-hop world, convening the Quincy Jones Hip-Hop Symposium in 1995, where he addressed a room full of the nation's rap stars.",
      "\"I want to see you guys live at least to my age,\" he told them.",
      "For Jones, social activism went hand-in-hand with his music.",
      "He met Martin Luther King in 1955, and \"from then on, my life was never the same\", he said.",
      "\"Civil rights work and political involvement was no longer an activity to do on the side. It became an essential part of life and humanity.\"",
      "He set up the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation and launched the We Are the Future project, among support for other causes.",
      "Elsewhere, his redoubtable work ethic saw him launch a record label and hip-hop magazine Vibe, as well as producing films like The Color Purple and TV shows including The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.",
      "With that workload, and an accompanying longstanding drink problem, his family life and his health both suffered.",
      "He married and divorced three times, having a nervous breakdown after splitting from third wife Peggy Lipton. To recover, he went to stay on the Pacific island owned by actor Marlon Brando, whom he first met in a jazz club at the age of 18.",
      "Jones was also in a relationship with actress and model Nastassja Kinski in the 1990s, and he had seven children in total.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 13:20:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The musician, who has died aged 91, was one of the most consequential producers in jazz and pop.",
    "story": [
      "\"Music is sacred to me,\" Quincy Jones once said. \"Melody is God's voice.\"",
      "He certainly had the divine touch.",
      "Jones, who has died at the age of 91, was the right-hand man to both Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson, and helped to shape the sound of jazz and pop over more than 60 years.",
      "His recordings revolutionised music by crossing genres, promoting unlikely collaborations and shaping modern production techniques.",
      "Here are 10 songs that showcase his versatility and brilliance in the studio, and his ability to draw the best out of the musicians he worked with.",
      "1) Michael Jackson - Billie Jean",
      "Michael Jackson met Quincy Jones on the set of the 1978 movie The Wiz, and asked him to produce his next album. That record was Off The Wall - a disco extravaganza that established Jackson as a solo star.",
      "They teamed up again for 1982's Thriller, which arguably remade the pop business. Not only did it produce seven top 10 singles; but it crossed racial barriers, appealing equally to black and white audiences.",
      "Key to the success was Billie Jean, a dark tale about the groupies Jackson met while touring with his brothers. As a producer, Jones wasn't keen on the track at first - arguing with Jackson about the long instrumental opening.",
      "\"I said, \u2018Michael we\u2019ve got to cut that intro,\u2019\u201d he later recalled.",
      "\"He said, \u2018But that\u2019s the jelly! That\u2019s what makes me want to dance.' And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That\u2019s what makes me want to dance,' well, the rest of us just have to shut up.\"",
      "With those words ringing in his ears, Jones kept the arrangement lean and funky. He even instructed sound engineer Bruce Swedien to create a drum sound with a \"sonic personality\" that no-one had ever heard before. The result is one of the most recognisable intros in the history of pop.",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "2) Frank Sinatra - Come Fly With Me (Live at The Sands)",
      "\"The friendship was so strong. You can't describe it,\" said Jones of his partnership with Frank Sinatra - which extended far beyond the recording studio.",
      "\u201cSeven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying.\"",
      "After establishing their relationship on 1964's It Might As Well Be Swing, Jones helped Sinatra re-arrange his signature songs for a four-week residency at the Copa Room in The Sands hotel, Las Vegas.",
      "\"It was probably the most exciting engagement I have ever done in my life, since I started performing,\" Sinatra later recalled.",
      "Accompanied by the Count Basie Orchestra, the star sounds perfectly at ease, breezing around standards like I've Got You Under My Skin, Fly Me To The Moon and You Make Me Feel So Young.",
      "But it's Come Fly With Me that most perfectly captures the vitality of Jones's new arrangements, especially in the charismatic interplay between Sinatra and the brass section.",
      "No wonder that it was chosen as the show's opening number - as captured on the award-winning live album, Sinatra At The Sands.",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "3) Lesley Gore - It's My Party",
      "Lesley Gore was just a teenager when her vocal demos made their way into Quincy Jones's hands in the early 1960s. Up to that point, he'd been working with jazz singers like Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan - but he heard something he liked on Gore's tape.",
      "\"She had a mellow, distinctive voice and sang in tune, which a lot of grown up rock \u2018n\u2019 roll singers couldn\u2019t do, so I signed her,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography.",
      "For their first session, Jones picked It's My Party out of a pile of 200 demos and got to work. He double-tracked Gore's voice, adding little flourishes of brass and unexpected chord changes that perfectly evoke the song's adolescent angst.",
      "He then rush-released the single, after discovering that Phil Spector had plans to record the same song with the Crystals. It duly topped the US charts and went to number nine in the UK.",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "4) Quincy Jones - Summer In The City",
      "Recorded by The Lovin' Spoonful, Summer In The City is a 1960s rock classic, full of ominous organ chords and powerful drum hits that capture the sticky filth of an oppressive heatwave.",
      "Quincy Jones version, recorded for his 1973 album You've Got It Bad Girl, is almost unrecognisable as the same song. Lazily chilled-out, the Hammond organ is played with a featherlight touch, and the drums are gently brushed.",
      "Most of the lyrics are excised and, when they arrive at the 2'30\" mark, they're sung with almost heavenly serenity by Valerie Simpson (of Ashford and Simpson fame).",
      "Originally released as a b-side, it's become one of Jones's most influential songs. According to WhoSampled.com, it's been sampled on 87 other songs, including tracks by Massive Attack, Eminem, Nightmares on Wax and The Roots.",
      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "5) Dinah Washington - Mad About The Boy",
      "Another example of how Jones's skill as an arranger could completely change a song.",
      "Mad About The Boy was written by Sir No\u00ebl Coward, for the 1932 revue Words and Music. In the original, it was sung by four different women, each expressing their love for an unnamed film star (rumoured to be Douglas Fairbanks Jr) as they wait in line to see one of his films.",
      "It's funny and quirky and clever - but when Dinah Washington covered the song in 1961, Jones slowed it down and switched the time signature from 4/4 to 6/8, allowing the singer to prowl through the lyrics with a newfound carnality.",
      "Overlooked at the time, it gained a new lease of life in 1992 when it was used to soundtrack a Levis advert and crept into the UK charts for the first time.",

      "6) Quincy Jones - Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Written in just 20 minutes, Soul Bossa Nova was inspired by an early-60s fad for Brazilian music, sparked by the success of Jo\u00e3o Gilberto and Stan Getz's Desafinado.",
      "Jones is in his element here - with chirruping flutes and big trombone slides that capture the joie de vivre of the carnival. He also makes prominent use of a cu\u00edca, the Brazilian drum that produces what sounds like a very happy monkey in the opening bars.",
      "The bossa craze may have been short-lived, but Jones's song endured, most memorably in the opening dance sequence of Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery.",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "7) Michael Jackson - Beat It",
      "From the beginning, Jones and Jackson planned to make Thriller a blockbuster pop album.",
      "\"We went through 800 songs to get to nine,\" Jones said. \"That's not casual.\"",
      "The work was exhausting. At one point, they were working in three studios simultaneously... until the speakers caught fire.",
      "Beat It was crucial to the project - because it was designed to get Jackson played on US rock radio, an unheard of prospect in the heavily segregated music industry of the 1980s.",
      "Jones had told Jackson to write \"a black version\" of The Knack's My Sharona - the 1979 hit song that sold more then 10 million copies. But Jackson was one step ahead. He had a demo that fitted the bill, albeit without a hook or lyrics.",
      "While Jackson worked on those elements (you can hear his first, wordless attempt at the melody on his YouTube channel), Jones called on Eddie Van Halen to perform the guitar solo.",
      "\"He came in and he stacked up his Gibson [guitars],\" Jones later recalled.",
      "\"I said, 'I'm not going to sit here and try to tell you what to play... Let's try three or four takes. Some of it will be over-animated, some of it will be long, and we'll sculpt it.",
      "\"And he played his ass off.\"",
      "The song, with its West Side Story-inspired video, landed just as MTV took off, making Jackson a permanent fixture in living rooms across America.",
      "But for all the commercial focus of the Thriller project, Jones always maintained that the music came first.",
      "\"I've never, ever in my life done music for money or fame - because that's when God walks out of the room,\" he said.",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "8) The Brothers Johnson - Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Jones discovered guitarist George Johnson and bassist Louis Johnson when he heard them playing on a demo by Chaka Khan's sister, Taka Boom.",
      "He hired them to play on the soundtrack for the celebrated TV mini-series Roots, placed them in his touring band, and helmed their 1976 debut album Look Out For #1 (including a sublime cover of The Beatles' Come Together).",
      "But the brothers didn't achieve mainstream success until 1977, with the release of Strawberry Letter #23.",
      "Originally recorded by Shuggie Otis, Jones's version toughens up the production, with a strutting bassline and soaring backing vocals - but George Johnson struggled to recreate Shuggie's original guitar solo, which was full of complicated triplet notes.",
      "Frustrated, Jones called up session musician Lee Ritenour for help.",
      "\"Quincy was walking down the hallway tearing his hair out,\" Ritenour later recalled. \"He said, 'I'm going to lunch, Ritenour. Get it done.'",
      "Released in the middle of the punk and disco boom, the song's romantic psychedelia still found an audience - reaching number 13 in the charts. It was later re-popularised by Quentin Tarantino in the film Jackie Brown.",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "9) Sarah Vaughan - Misty",
      "Early in his career, Jones was one of the most in-demand arrangers in jazz, working with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee.",
      "In 1958, he recorded an entire album with Sarah Vaughan in Paris, backed by a 55-piece orchestra. Among the highlights is the lovestruck ballad Misty - originally recorded by pianist Erroll Garner, and made famous by Johnny Mathis.",
      "Unlike their syrupy and sentimental versions, Vaughan and Jones (along with producer Jack Tracy) give the lyrics some pathos. She might be \"as helpless as a kitten up a tree\", but you're never entirely convinced she's happy about the situation.",
      "Jones adds beguiling touches - from the cascading strings when Vaughan sings \"a thousand violins begin to play\", to the beautifully muted saxophone line, played by Zoot Sims.",
      "Vaughan died of lung cancer in 1990. In 2019, on what would have been her 95th birthday, Jones posted a tribute to the singer, using his pet name for her - Sassy.",
      "\"Dear sweet Sassy was all about sophistication and chord changes and, man, I\u2019m telling you she thought like a horn and SANG like a horn!\" he wrote on Facebook..",
      "\"We had quite the journey together, & I will never forget each moment we had, because every moment was a special one.\"",
      "Listen to Misty",
      "Listen to Misty",
      "10) USA For Africa - We Are The World",
      "\"Check your egos at the door,\" said the hand-written sign that Quincy Jones pinned to the door of his recording studio in 1985.",
      "The occasion was the recording of We Are The World - a star-studded charity single that aimed to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia.",
      "Written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, the record featured vocals from Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen, Dionne Warwick and Bob Dylan, all recorded in a single night.",
      "Herding the singers was a massive headache, as the recent Netflix documentary The Greatest Night In Pop revealed.",
      "At one point, Stevie Wonder insisted that some of the lyrics should be rewritten in Swahili - despite the fact that the people of Ethiopia, who would be the main beneficiaries of the famine-relief fundraiser, largely speak other languages.",
      "Jones oversaw the whole session with the patience and wisdom of a producer who'd seen it all.",
      "The results aren't particularly great - the song is sickly and overlong - but the fact that it's coherent at all is a testament to his skill as a producer, arranger, mentor and referee.",
      "In the end, the song raised more than $63m ($227m or \u00a3178m adjusted for inflation); and Jones looked back on it as one of his proudest achievements.",
      "\u201cI have never before or since experienced the joy I felt that night working with this rich, complex human tapestry of love, talent, and grace,\" he wrote in his 2002 autobiography.",

      "He suggests that actors should look for established agencies, read any contracts carefully and speak to current clients if looking for representation.",

      "The guidance includes a new discussion aid to help GPs give patients the most useful information they can about the HRT drugs and what they do.",
      "HRT replaces the hormones oestrogen or progestogen, or both, when women's periods stop - normally between the ages of 45 and 55.",

      "She said the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and ovarian and endometrial cancer was no higher among women aged 45 and over taking combined HRT, compared to those who had never taken it.",

      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:05:01 GMT",
    "summary": "David Lammy is on his first visit to the continent since he became foreign secretary.",
    "story": [
      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy is coming to the end of his maiden tour of Africa with the aim of resetting relations with the 54-nation continent.",
      "\"Our new approach will deliver respectful partnerships that listen rather than tell, deliver long-term growth rather than short-term solutions and build a freer, safer, more prosperous continent,\" he said as he set out the agenda for his trip to the continent's two biggest powers - Nigeria and South Africa.",
      "Lammy's visit follows his appointment as foreign secretary in the Labour government that took office earlier this year.",
      "Since Labour was last in office in 2010, relations between African states and other world powers have changed massively.",
      "Today, China is the largest trade partner for many African countries, while Russia has increasingly made inroads, including by offering military support to West African states battling jihadists.",
      "Oil-rich Gulf nations, along with Turkey,  have also been increasing their influence on the continent by striking business and military deals.",
      "In contrast, UK-Africa relations have been \"a lot more lacklustre\", says Alex Vines, the head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "This is particularly the case between the UK and its  biggest trading partner on the continent, South Africa, and the trip is an \"attempt to reboot that\", he adds.",
      "\"I want to hear what our African partners need and foster relationships so that the UK and our friends and partners in Africa can grow together,\" Lammy said.",
      "Britain is no newcomer to the continent. A long \u2013 and at times chequered \u2013 history underpins many of its relationships with African countries.",
      "Almost all its former colonies on the continent are part of the Commonwealth, although countries that did not have this historical link to the UK have joined the group, including Rwanda, Togo and Gabon. Angola has also applied to join.",
      "\"The Commonwealth will likely continue to be a key platform,\" says Nicole Beardsworth, an academic at South Africa's Wits University.",
      "As its former colonies gained independence in the middle of the last century, Britain continued to play a sort of \"big brother\" role.",
      "But this is now changing.",
      "Dr Vines says Africa did not feature significantly in a major document released last year to outline the UK's priorities on the global stage.",
      "\"There were name checks to countries like Nigeria and South Africa and Kenya in it, but there wasn't much written,\" he says.",
      "Dr Vines adds that he expects South Africa-UK relations to improve under Labour because of its historic ties with the anti-apartheid movement that fought white-minority rule.",
      "\"That comes from the anti-apartheid struggle and the solidarity that Labour and people that were the Labour movement provided for combating apartheid,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth, however, notes that former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May tried to bolster ties with Africa, but her efforts were \"scuppered\" after she resigned in 2019 following turmoil in the then governing party.",
      "The UK then had an unprecedented turnover of prime ministers who had to deal with domestic crises, the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, and the Covid pandemic.",
      "\"Africa fell off the radar,\" Dr Beardsworth says, adding that the exception was the controversial, and now-scrapped, deal to send some asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda.",
      "Being the world\u2019s youngest continent \u2013 with a median age of 19 \u2013 Africa presents opportunities for the future, the UK Foreign Office said.",
      "\"Africa has huge growth potential, with the continent on track to make up 25% of the world\u2019s population by 2050,\" read a statement from the office.",
      "With an ageing population in the UK - as with much of the developed world - Dr Vines says that the sharing of skills will increase.",
      "He adds that migration is an \"emotive and complicated issue\", but the UK and other Western nations should avoid \"cherry-picking the best and corroding African states from being successful themselves\".",
      "The UK Foreign Office said that \"growth is the core mission of this government and will underpin our relationships in Nigeria, South Africa and beyond\".",
      "That will mean \"more jobs and more opportunities for Brits and Africans alike,\" it added.",
      "The UK's Africa policy has long focused on development aid, but this has been slashed in recent years as the country faces its own economic crisis.",
      "Dr Vines says aid can be important to deal with humanitarian crises, climate shocks and to finance projects aimed at expanding the private sector in Africa, but he does not see the Labour government increasing funding.",
      "\"When you had a previous Labour government under Tony Blair, Britain saw itself as a global superpower for international development - that\u2019s no longer the case,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth says relations are expected to move towards being more economically focused, and \"much more mutually beneficial\".",
      "She says this could also see the normalisation of the UK's relations with Zimbabwe and Harare being welcomed back to the Commonwealth after relations broke down during the rule of the late Robert Mugabe.",
      "Differences over international affairs such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East could also play out less in the public.",
      "South Africa\u2019s position on both conflicts has been at odds with much of the West.",
      "But South African analyst Yanga Molotana does not see this as a major problem.",
      "\"Two things can exist at the same time - I can still hold my position, I can still hold my views, and we can still have a mutually beneficial relationship without the moral pressure of you saying that I have to agree with everything that you say,\" she adds.",
      "Dr Vines agrees, saying he expects the UK to continue promoting multi-party democracy in Africa, but there will be \"less finger-wagging, and more quiet diplomacy\".",
      "\"The concern is probably going to be more regularly raised in private,\" he says.",

    "story": [
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like week zero,\u201d a government insider suggests. A new Conservative leader today. A whopper of a Budget on Wednesday.",
      "Add those two events together and it feels like this is the week that everything changed \u2013 the clock restarts.",
      "The tramlines are now set for the battles ahead, a member of the cabinet tells me. A Labour government that\u2019s now unabashed in the big choices it\u2019s made, the winners and losers they\u2019ve picked.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative boss, is unashamed in saying what the softer fringes of the Tory party has felt squeamish about until now.",
      "And maybe we\u2019ve entered a new era when the fabled centre ground of politics feels a bit emptier \u2013 and the differences between the two main parties are sharper.",
      "The consequences of the Budget are still emerging, and the real effect won\u2019t be clear for many months. There has been no huge unravelling, but ministers are still incredibly aware they\u2019ll still need to explain it.",
      "If your doorbell rings this afternoon and it\u2019s a grinning person with a red rosette and a leaflet, you\u2019ll know what they\u2019re up to.",
      "The party knows the decisions, particularly to whack billions on employers\u2019 national insurance, have caused some anxiety among some voters. This will also hit GP practices and charities, which have flagged fears about the cost of the change - and no government wants to go to war with them.",
      "No minister wants to have to defend a decision that looks to many voters and their rivals, like they were misled, after promises not to raise National Insurance in the election.",
      "The government rejects the charge - insisting they only promised to not raise the National Insurance paid by employees, rather than employers.",
      "But Labour is having to learn what it\u2019s like to take the flak. To wobble on the big decisions would be politically disastrous. And in Downing Street there\u2019s confidence the public is broadly onside.",
      "Insiders say No 10\u2019s focus groups - which have been asked about the Budget in the last few days - have understood the decisions, reporting some grumbles but not much sign of outrage.",
      "One government source says, \u201cpeople looked at the Budget and said, \u2018that makes sense\u2019. That is a platform we can build on.\u201d",
      "The decisions, and the government\u2019s true motivations \u2013 are out there now in black and white. The source says \u201cit\u2019s the first time \u2013 certainly in government, probably in the whole project \u2013 we have been able to show, rather than just tell.\u201d",
      "However, after all of Labour\u2019s schmoozing of the business world, and all their emphasis in the election of growing the economy, there\u2019s been some surprise that those arguments were a lot less prominent on Wednesday.",
      "Sources say phase one was concentrating on the public finances and public services, then the next part will be more emphasis on growth with a big speech from Rachel Reeves at the Mansion House in the City soon.",
      "How the Budget will affect you and your money",
      "Rachel Reeves doesn\u2019t mind if you don't like her Budget",
      "A senior business leader told me, \u201cthey\u2019ve done part one well, in a more traditional Labour way, but to get a real shape, they need a very strong part two... creating the vision, energy and specific incentives and plan for growth and wealth creation \u2013 that still needs work.\u201d",
      "On the other side, Labour\u2019s union backers are pleased with extra cash for some public services, and the tweaking of the borrowing rules so more money is available to spend on long-term projects.",
      "But there\u2019s concern, as one leader puts it, that the NI rise for employers will be \u201craised in every negotiating room\u201d, as an excuse for lowering wages. And unhappiness on the left about the two-child benefit cap, and the winter fuel allowance, remains - with a judicial review of the decision on those pensioner payments in the offing.",
      "But forget the inevitable skirmishes and stresses. The Budget has filled in many of the blanks about this government, answering part of that common question: what does Keir Starmer really stand for?",
      "And the response could almost be a line from a Gordon Brown Budget of days gone by \u2013 economic stability, more public spending, with schools and hospitals at the top of the list.",
      "Starmer\u2019s backers says the discipline on day-to-day spending - even cuts to some departments - makes it different to Labour Budgets of the past, claiming they have taken the Conservatives\u2019 mantle for being the party you can trust with public money.",
      "But no doubt the Budget illuminates the priorities of classic Labour instincts, not the mushy middle.",
      "A government source suggests none of it should really be a surprise.",
      "\u201cTraditional centre-left arguments were were all there in the election \u2013 ending non-doms, VAT on private schools - overall it passes the fairness test and that is the most important thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cLabour in its veins,\u201d says a cabinet minister. And in the next few weeks Labour will publish what\u2019s been described as a \u201cprogramme for government\u201d that will make it even more clear.",
      "New Conservative chapter",
      "The sharper shape makes life both easier and harder for the brand new Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch.",
      "It\u2019s more straightforward perhaps if Labour\u2019s stripes are more red, the Tories can portray themselves a deeper blue.",
      "Kemi Badenoch has been deliberately light on policy, but her principles are clear. She believes in free markets and a smaller state. It\u2019s not going to be hard for her to draw a contrast to the government. \u201cIt\u2019s back to the future,\u201d one Tory source tells me.",
      "\u201cWe can go back to first principles, as we did in the 70s and the early 2000s,\u201d opposing bigger government and bigger taxes.",
      "Another senior party figure suggests the Budget has already sketched out an obvious path telling me, \u201cthe government has positioned itself as distinctly post-new Labour.",
      "\u201cIt is workerist, it\u2019s not very nice to farmers or rural areas \u2013 with pensioners and farmers you see that you have a coalition where the Tories can get back to 250 seats.\u201d",
      "Badenoch\u2019s backers are sure that she can satisfy the first task of opposition, getting noticed. Opposition parties don\u2019t have an automatic right to get attention.",
      "One supporter was convinced that \u201cwhatever happens, she will be an attention-gatherer.\u201d But Labour reckons their Budget choices have sent plenty of traps for the brand new leader.",
      "It might seem natural to the Tories to vote against the government\u2019s tax rises in the Budget. But it\u2019s a lot less comfortable to oppose extra cash for public services.",
      "It\u2019s one thing to stand against charging private schools VAT. But will the Conservatives oppose the new teachers for state schools the tax rise is meant to support? That is a far harder argument to make.",
      "Labour\u2019s decisions mean, despite Badenoch\u2019s broad-brush approach, the Tories are going to be expected to have something to say about schools and hospitals - services the public relies on.",
      "A senior Conservative figure warns that this week has \u201cset up a public services Parliament \u2026 you can\u2019t go through a sustained period of time when you just rely on the vibes.\u201d",
      "As Chris has written, the task for Badenoch is massive. Not just because of the July\u2019s battering that depleted their numbers so much, but because the Conservatives have been in the groove of attacking each other for many years now.",
      "The party is described by sources as \u201cfractious\u201d, and  \u201cdeeply sceptical\u201d. Getting rid of leaders became almost the norm.",
      "One of the contenders for the job joked when courting votes they\u2019d even been told by one former minister: \u201cI\u2019m more interested in the leadership race in two years time.\u201d",
      "Badenoch has won a clear mandate, but by a smaller margin than in races that have gone before.",
      "There is no doubt she is a politician that stands out, another Conservative says, referencing an old TV ad: \u201cShe has the potential to be Heineken \u2013 reaching the parts of the electorate other Tories cannot.\u201d",
      "But her style has risks - \u201clike a can of Heineken, if shaken up too much, it can froth everywhere,\u201d and make a terrible mess.",
      "Today we start a new chapter. One Conservative source suggests we\u2019re back in a \u201cclassic left-right era\u201d.",
      "Kemi Badenoch: Who is new Tory leader and what does she stand for?",
      "Chris Mason: Badenoch will need all her political savvy to transform Tory fortunes",
      "A Labour government that has expressed its priorities with big borrowing, big spending and big tax that believes the public is on board, after years when Budgets at home and in Whitehall have been under so much pressure.",
      "And an opposition with a new leader who believes in something completely different. Don\u2019t forget of course the smaller parties, Reform, the Lib Dems, the SNP and Greens, have important roles too.",
      "But the contours of the central contest feel sharper now.",
      "For years politicians, whether Labour or Conservative, have liked to suggest that we can drift towards lower taxes and still have the kind of public services of countries where the government spends much more cash.",
      "Perhaps this week might mark the moment when our politicians stop telling us we can have it all.",

    "summary": "Kemi Badenoch is a political trailblazer with a combative style and a mission to renew her party.",
    "story": [
      "Like her political heroine Margaret Thatcher, Kemi Badenoch - who is the new Conservative leader - divides opinion even within her own party.",
      "Her robust views, \"anti-woke\" values and no-nonsense style have made her a darling of the Conservative right and the party's grassroots and they have chosen her over fellow right-winger Robert Jenrick.",
      "As the first black woman to lead a major UK political party she has made history, but she is no fan of identity politics and is not likely to make much of that as she sets to work on the formidable task of restoring her party's battered fortunes.",
      "The former business secretary's analysis of what went wrong for the Conservatives at the general election is that they \"talked right, but governed left\", and need to \"stop acting like Labour\" to win back power.",
      "It is a pledge she put at the heart of her Tory leadership campaign, which focused on changing the underlying mindset of the British state rather than setting out detailed policies.",
      "Born in Wimbledon in 1980, Olukemi Adegoke was one of three children of Nigerian parents. Her father worked as a GP and her mother was a physiology professor.",
      "Badenoch - she married banker Hamish Badenoch in 2012 and they have three children - grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, and in the United States where her mother lectured.",
      "She returned to the UK at the age of 16 to live with a friend of her mother because of the worsening political and economic situation in Nigeria, and studied for her A-levels at a college in south London while working in a McDonald's restaurant and elsewhere.",
      "After completing a degree in computer engineering at Sussex University, she worked in IT while also gaining a second degree in law.",
      "She then moved into finance, becoming an associate director of private bank  Coutts and later worked as the digital director of influential Conservative-supporting magazine The Spectator, a non-editorial role.",
      "According to Blue Ambition, a biography written by Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, it was at Sussex University that Badenoch got a taste for right-wing politics - becoming \"radicalised\" by the left-wing campus culture, in the opposite direction.",
      "She later described student activists there as the \"spoiled, entitled, privileged metropolitan elite-in-training\".",
      "Badenoch and Jenrick wait for results of Tory leadership race",
      "Chris Mason: Challenges ahead for Kemi Badenoch",
      "Badenoch joined the Conservative Party in 2005 - aged 25 - and stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in 2010 and the London Assembly in 2012.",
      "When two Tory Assembly members, including Suella Braverman, were elected MPs in 2015, she took a vacant Assembly seat.",
      "She backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum before achieving her ambition of becoming an MP a year later, for the safe Conservative seat of Saffron Walden in Essex.",
      "Badenoch had spent three years bouncing around junior government roles when in 2022 she joined the rapid ministerial exodus which brought down Boris Johnson.",
      "To the surprise of many of her colleagues, Badenoch then joined the sprawling contest to succeed Johnson despite never having been in the cabinet.",
      "What began as a longshot campaign with the support mostly of loyal friends who also entered Parliament in 2017 quickly gained momentum, and heavyweight support in the form of Michael Gove.",
      "Badenoch ultimately came fourth with the backing of 59 MPs - more than the 42 MPs who were enough for her to finish top in the parliamentary stage of the current leadership election.",
      "Her direct approach, instructing her colleagues to \u201ctell the truth\u201d, won Badenoch a bigger role in the Conservative Party and it was inevitable that Liz Truss chose to appoint her to the cabinet - making her international trade secretary.",
      "Rishi Sunak retained her in post, adding the business and women and equalities briefs.",
      "Her time in Parliament has been characterised by her straightforwardness and willingness to engage in controversial issues.",
      "As a junior equalities minister under Johnson, she enraged many on the left when she challenged the notion there was widespread institutional racism in Britain.",
      "In an LBC interview, she said she had experienced prejudice only from left-wingers.",
      "\"I came to this country aged 16 and now I am standing for prime minister - isn't that amazing? I was born in this country but I didn't grow up here.",
      "\"I don't understand why people want to ignore all of the good things and only focus on the bad things, and use the bad things to tell the story,\" she added.",
      "She calls herself a gender-critical feminist, and has been an outspoken opponent of moves to allow self-certification of transgender identity.",
      "As the cabinet minister in charge of women and equalities, she spearheaded the UK government's blocking of Scotland's Gender Recognition Reform Bill.",
      "Responding to the Cass report on gender identity services in the NHS, she said they had been \"hijacked by ideologues\" while critics were \"gagged\", resulting in children being harmed.",
      "She has also opposed gender-neutral toilets.",
      "In 2021, members of the government's own LGBT+ advisory panel urged her to \"consider her position\" over the failure to deliver a manifesto pledge to ban so-called conversion therapy.",
      "Badenoch is often labelled a \"culture warrior\" but she disputes the tag.",
      "Sometimes accused of wanting to start a fight in an empty room, she says she does not like to fight - but is prepared to fight to defend Conservative principles.",
      "That is simultaneously what endears her to Conservative MPs and what makes some of them anxious.",
      "During the early stages of the leadership election several Conservative MPs told the BBC they were inclined to support Badenoch but were put off by fractious interactions while she was in government.",
      "To her supporters, that\u2019s the point: unlike other ministers she was willing to tell MPs what she believed and make the case for it forthrightly.",
      "On the eve of this year's party conference in Birmingham, she made headlines with a claim that not all cultures were \"equally valid\", citing as an example \"cultures where women are told that they should not work\".",
      "She also got attention in Birmingham for quipping that 5-10% of civil servants were so bad they should be in prison. She has previously strongly denied bullying officials.",
      "But she backtracked after an interview in which she appeared to suggest the current level of maternity pay was \"excessive\". She claimed her words had been \"misrepresented\", saying she had been talking about excessive business regulation and maternity pay was \"a good thing\".",
      "In 2018, Badenoch admitted that, a decade earlier, she had hacked into the website of then-Commons leader and deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman as a prank. Harman accepted her apology.",
      "Among public spats, in February, she accused the Post Office chair she had sacked of seeking \"revenge\" by \"making up\" claims he been told to delay compensation payments for sub-postmasters affected by the Horizon IT scandal.",
      "Henry Staunton said he had been told to stall pay-outs to allow the government to \"limp into the election\", apparently to ease the public finances.",
      "Conservatism 'in crisis'",
      "Nor has Badenoch shied away from public clashes with MPs on her own side - including when she rejected calls to make it illegal to discriminate against people going through the menopause.",
      "Appearing before a Commons committee, she told chair Caroline Nokes \"loads of people\" wanted to use equalities law as \"a tool for different personal agendas and interests\".",
      "During her leadership campaign, Badenoch has spoken of Conservatism being \"in crisis\" - under attack from a new \"progressive ideology\" involving \"identity politics\" (politics based on a particular identity such as race, religion or gender), constant state intervention, and \"the idea that bureaucrats make better decisions than individuals\" or elected politicians.",
      "Despite the Tories being in office for 14 years, she argues that increases in government regulations and public spending have crippled economic growth and polarised the country.",
      "She rejected Robert Jenrick's call for key party policies to be settled now, saying the UK's \"system is broken\" and requires a reset.",
      "The Conservative Party, she adds, needs to return to its core values and come up with new policies that recognise this reality."

      "He said this company was interested in sponsoring the COP29 summit but wanted to discuss investment opportunities in Azerbaijan's state energy firm, Socar, in return. An online meeting with Soltanov was arranged.",
      "During the meeting, Soltanov told the potential sponsor that the aim of the conference was \"solving the climate crisis\" and \"transitioning away from hydrocarbons in a just, orderly and equitable manner\".",
      "Anyone, he said, including oil and gas companies, \"could come with solutions\" because Azerbaijan\u2019s \"doors are open\".",
      "However, he said he was open to discussions about deals too \u2013 including on oil and gas.",
      "Initially, Soltanov suggested the potential sponsor might be interested in investing in some of the \"green transitioning projects\" Socar was involved in - but then spoke of opportunities related to Azerbaijan's plans to increase gas production, including new pipeline infrastructure.",
      "\"There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established,\" Soltanov says on the recording. \"Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.\"",
      "Soltanov then described natural gas as a \"transitional fuel\", adding: \"We will have a certain amount of oil and natural gas being produced, perhaps forever.\"",
      "The UN climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledges there will be a role for some oil and gas up to 2050 and beyond. However, it has been very clear that \"developing\u2026 new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C\".",

    "story": [
      "It is now \"virtually certain\" that 2024 - a year punctuated by intense heatwaves and deadly storms - will be the world's warmest on record, according to projections by the European climate service.",
      "Global average temperatures across the year are on track to end up more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which would make 2024 the first calendar year to breach this symbolic mark.",

      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",

      "How is climate change linked to extreme weather?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "Global temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set.",
      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",

      "But, with levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere still rising quickly, scientists warn it is likely only a matter of time before new records are set.",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 00:51:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Why are still no closer to unmasking the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto?",
    "story": [
      "Bitcoin underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry, is now traded by the world's biggest investment houses and is even an official currency in one country.",
      "But despite its meteoric rise, a deep mystery remains at its heart: what is the true identity of its founder, the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto?",
      "Many have tried to answer that question, but so far all have failed. In October, a high-profile HBO documentary suggested that a Canadian bitcoin expert called Peter Todd was he. The only problem: he said he was not, and the crypto world largely shrugged it off.",
      "So, inevitably, ears pricked up across our newsroom - and the crypto world at large - when on Thursday a call went out that the mysterious creator of Bitcoin was to, finally, unmask himself at a press conference.",
      "There is deep interest in who Satoshi Nakamoto is in part because they are considered a revolutionary programmer who helped spawn the crypto industry.",
      "Their voice, opinions and world view would be extremely influential on an industry with such a devoted and zealous fanbase.",
      "But the fascination also stems from the fact that, as the holder of more than one million bitcoins, Satoshi would be a multi-billionaire, not least because the price of the coins is currently close to an all-time high.",
      "Given that vast wealth, it was somewhat unusual to be asked by the organiser of Thursday\u2019s press conference to pay for my seat at his grand unveiling.",
      "A front row seat would be \u00a3100. It was another \u00a350 if I wanted unlimited questions. Organiser Charles Anderson even encouraged me to spend \u00a3500 in exchange for the privilege of interviewing \"Satoshi\" on stage.",
      "I declined.",
      "Mr Anderson said I could come along any way but cautioned there might not be a seat for me, such was the level of anticipation.",
      "As it happened, seating wasn\u2019t a problem.",
      "Only around a dozen reporters turned up to the prestigious Frontline Club - which interrupted proceedings at one point to stress it only provided a room, and not any official endorsement.",
      "Very soon it became clear that all attendees were extremely sceptical.",
      "After some digging it emerged both the organiser and the purported Satoshi were currently embroiled in a complex legal fight over fraud allegations - linked to claims to be Satoshi.",
      "It was an unpromising start, and things only got worse from there.",
      "Mr Anderson invited \"Satoshi\" to come on stage.",
      "A man called Stephen Mollah, who had been sat silently on the side the whole time walked up and resolutely declared: \u201cI am here to make a statement that yes: I am Satoshi Nakamoto and I created the Bitcoin on Blockchain technology.\u201d",
      "Over the following hour, reporters went from amused to irritated as he failed to provide any of the promised evidence for his claims.",
      "Mr Mollah promised that he would make the Hail-Mary move of unlocking and interacting with the first-ever Bitcoins to be created - something that only Satoshi could do.",
      "But he didn't.",
      "I departed, along with other bemused reporters, taking with us any lingering doubts that this would prove to be yet another dead-end in the quest to unmask Satoshi.",
      "What is Bitcoin? Key crypto terms and what they mean",
      "Not another one",
      "The list of those identified - unsuccessfully - as Satoshi Nakamoto is long.",
      "In 2014, a high-profile article in Newsweek said it was Dorian Nakamoto, a Japanese-American man living in California.",
      "But he denied it and the claim has largely been debunked.",
      "A year later, Australian computer scientist Craig Wright was outed as Satoshi by reporters.",
      "He denied it, before saying it was true - but then failed over many years to produce any evidence.",
      "In the spring the High Court in London ruled that Mr Wright was not the inventor.",
      "Tech billionaire and crypto enthusiast Elon Musk also denied he was behind the cryptocurrency after a former employee at one of his firms, SpaceX, suggested it.",
      "Which brings us to the question: does it really matter?",
      "The crypto market's current valuation means it is worth more than Google. And it seems inconceivable that the tech giant would play such a big role in our lives without people knowing who founded it, and owned a sizeable chunk of the firm.",
      "Perhaps there\u2019s good reason for the real Satoshi to keep schtum though. That bitcoin stash would make them worth an estimated $69bn and their life and character would no doubt be heavily scrutinised if they were found.",
      "Peter Todd, who was named by the HBO documentary as being Satoshi, said the unwelcome attention he's received has made him fearful for his safety.",
      "Many in the crypto world enjoy the fact that the mystery remains unsolved.",
      "\"No-one knows who Satoshi is and that's a good thing,\" Adam Back, one of its core developers (and another potential Satoshi candidate) posted on X recently.",
      "Natalie Brunell, a Bitcoin podcaster, thinks Satoshi's anonymity is not only deliberate but essential.",
      "\"By concealing his true identity, Satoshi ensured that Bitcoin wouldn\u2019t have a leader or central figure, whose personal agenda could influence the protocol,\" she told me.",
      "\"This allows people to trust Bitcoin as a system, rather than placing their trust in an individual or company.\"",
      "Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University - who lectures on the history of Bitcoin - is less sure.",
      "In her view, the circus around who Satoshi Nakamoto is distracts from people looking into - and getting to grips with - the more serious question of how cryptocurrencies might upend the way the economy works.",
      "As I left the Frontline Club it was hard to compute the bizarre press event, beyond one obvious fact.",
      "For now - and perhaps forever - the search for Satoshi continues.",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 01:19:58 GMT",
    "summary": "Once millions used it to find out about their family histories - this week it was almost delisted. What went wrong?",
    "story": [
      "Three years ago, the DNA-testing firm 23andMe was a massive success, with a share price higher than Apple's.",
      "But, from those heady days of millions of people rushing to send it saliva samples in return for detailed reports about their ancestry, family connections and genetic make-up, it now finds itself fighting for its survival.",
      "Its share price has plummeted and this week it narrowly avoided being delisted from the stock market.",
      "And of course this is a company that holds the most sensitive data imaginable about its customers, raising troubling questions about what might happen to its huge \u2013 and extremely valuable \u2013 database of individual human DNA.",
      "When contacted by the BBC, 23andMe was bullish about its prospects - and insistent it remained \"committed to protecting customer data and consistently focused on maintaining the privacy of our customers.\"",
      "But how did what was once one of the most talked-about tech firms get to the position where it has to answer questions about its very survival?",
      "DNA gold rush",
      "Not so long ago, 23andMe was in the public eye for all the right reasons.",
      "Its famous customers included Snoop Dogg, Oprah Winfrey, Eva Longoria and Warren Buffet - and millions of users were getting unexpected and life-changing results.",
      "Some people discovered that their parents were not who they thought they were, or that they had a genetic pre-disposition to serious health conditions.  Its share price rocketed to $321.",
      "Fast forward three years and that price has slumped to just under $5 - and the company is worth 2% of what it once was.",
      "What went wrong?",
      "According to Professor Dimitris Andriosopoulos, founder of the Responsible Business Unit at Strathclyde University, the problem for 23andMe was twofold.",
      "Firstly, it didn\u2019t really have a continuing business model \u2013 once you\u2019d paid for your DNA report, there was very little for you to return for.",
      "Secondly, plans to use an anonymised version of the gathered DNA database for drug research took too long to become profitable, because the drug development process takes so many years.",
      "That leads him to a blunt conclusion: \u201cIf I had a crystal ball, I\u2019d say they will maybe last for a bit longer,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "\u201cBut as it currently is, in my view, 23andMe is highly unlikely to survive.\u201d",
      "The problems at 23andMe are reflected in the turmoil in its leadership.",
      "The board resigned in the summer and only the CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki \u2013 sister of the late YouTube boss Susan Wojcicki and ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergei Brin \u2013 remains from the original line-up.",
      "Rumours have swirled that the firm will shortly either fold or be sold - claims that it rejects.",
      "\"23andMe\u2019s co-founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki has publicly shared she intends to take the company private, and is not open to considering third party takeover proposals,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "But that hasn\u2019t stopped the speculation, with rival firm Ancestry calling for US competition regulators to get involved if 23andMe does end up for sale.",
      "What happens to the DNA?",
      "Companies rising and falling is nothing new - especially in tech. But 23andMe is different.",
      "\"It's worrying because of the sensitivity of the data,\" says Carissa Veliz, author of Privacy is Power.",
      "And that is not just for the individuals who have used the firm.",
      "\"If you gave your data to 23andMe, you also gave the genetic data of your parents, your siblings, your children, and even distant kin who did not consent to that,\" she told the BBC.",
      "David Stillwell, professor of computational social science at Cambridge Judge Business School, agrees the stakes are high.",
      "\u201cDNA data is different. If your bank account details are hacked, it will be disruptive but you can get a new bank account,\" he explained.",
      "\"If your (non-identical) sibling has used it, they share 50% of your DNA, so their data can still be used to make health predictions about you.\u201d",
      "The company is adamant these kinds of concerns are without foundation.",
      "\"Any company that handles consumer information, including the type of data we collect, there are applicable data protections set out in law required to be followed as part of any future ownership change,\" it said in its statement.",
      "\"The 23andMe terms of service and privacy statement would remain in place unless and until customers are presented with, and agree to, new terms and statements.\"",
      "There are also legal protections which apply in the UK under its version of the data protection law, GDPR, whether the firm goes bust or changes hands.",
      "Even so, all companies can be hacked - as 23andMe was 12 months ago.",
      "And Carissa Veliz remains uneasy - and says ultimately a much robust approach is needed if we want to keep our most personal information safe.",
      "\"The terms and conditions of these companies are typically incredibly inclusive; when you give out your personal data to them, you allow them to do pretty much anything they want with it,\" she said.",
      "\"Until we ban the trade in personal data, we are not well protected enough.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 00:01:32 GMT",
    "summary": "A growing global movement is seeing people object to data centres in their locality.",
    "story": [
      "Environmental campaigner Julie Bolthouse points out that Northern Virginia has the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centres. This is not something she is thrilled about.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re the Wall Street of the data centre industry,\u201d says Ms Bolthouse, who is a director of local Virginian charity and campaign group Piedmont Environmental Council.",
      "Data centres are vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Northern Virginia, the northern region of the state of Virginia, has been a key location for data centres since the 1990s. This is thanks to its immediate proximity to Washington DC, yet with historically cheap electricity and land prices.",
      "Centred on the city of Ashburn, which is 35 miles (56km) west of the US capital, there are more than 477 data centres in the state. This is by far the largest number in the US, with Texas in second place on 290, and California third with 283.",
      "In fact, some studies say that 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic goes through Ashburn and the surrounding area, which has been dubbed \u201cData Centre Alley\u201d.",
      "Thanks in large part to the continuing boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires more computing power, demand for data centres is rocketing. As a result, global data centre capacity is expected to double over the next five years, according to a recent study by business analysis firm Moody\u2019s.",
      "Ms Bolthouse and other environmentalists in Northern Virginia are opposed to the continuing expansion of the data centre sector in their region, saying it is already having a major negative impact on their quality of life.",
      "She points to new electricity cables being built over conservation land, parks and neighbourhoods, increased water demand, and the facilities\u2019 back-up diesel generators affecting air quality.",
      "Ms Bolthouse also cites the fact that households in Virginia and neighbouring Maryland are being expected to help pay for the electricity network upgrades that the data centres require.",
      "She and fellow campaigners are fighting back. \u201cWe\u2019re working directly on the ground, opposing each data centre application and working on the local zoning, and trying to educate our local planning commission and supervisors about the issues that we see. But we're also working at the state level.\u201d",
      "Similar campaigns against data centres are springing up all over the world, including in the Republic of Ireland, where such facilities use 21% of the country\u2019s electricity.",
      "\"Our main objections to data centres revolve around their potential negative impacts on our climate, their sustainability, and local infrastructure,\" says Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment. \"When data centres rely on fossil fuel, they potentially strain the electricity grid and can undermine national renewable energy commitments.\"",
      "The group is continuing to challenge plans for a new \u20ac1.2bn ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) data centre in County Clare on Ireland\u2019s west coast.",
      "Mr Lowes adds that while Friends of the Irish Environment would prefer to see data centre development halted altogether, there are various mitigations that might help, including sites prioritising renewable energy, and implementing energy and cooling efficiency measures.",
      "The big players in the global data centre industry are trying to allay people\u2019s concerns. This summer, for example, Microsoft launched its Data Center Community Pledge.",
      "Microsoft is promising that by next year it will procure 100% renewable energy globally. And that by 2030 it will \u201cachieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting\u201d, and become \u201cwater positive\u201d. The latter means that it aims for its data centres to return more water to the local supply than they use.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already uses recycled water for cooling in 20 of its 125 data centres around the world, and also says it will be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030.",
      "Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, which represents dozens of data centre operators including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, says that data centres are leading the way on clean energy use.",
      "\"For example, wind and solar capacity contracted to data centre providers and customers represented two-thirds of the total US corporate renewables market last year, and four of the top five purchasers of renewable energy in the US are companies that operate data centres,\" he says.",
      "\"The data centre industry is also unlocking greater energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users \u2013 everything from smart thermostats to grid-enhancing technologies require the digital infrastructure provided by data centres.\"",
      "The protests against data centres have also extended to South America, where campaigners say they have achieved successes.",
      "In Uruguay, for example, Google changed the design of a new facility now under construction. It was initially due to be water cooled, but the US giant switched to an air-cooled system.",
      "This followed protests in a country that has been experiencing droughts and a shortage of drinking water.",
      "\"Water use by Google in the initial proposal would have been equivalent to the daily consumption of drinking water by 55,000 people in our country,\" says Mar\u00eda Selva Ortiz of Friends of the Earth Uruguay.",
      "\"This threat to the right to water amidst a water crisis raised strong criticisms, leading Google to change the proposed technology to cool down its equipment, so the project was modified. Chillers will cool down with air instead of water.\u201d",
      "In Chile, meanwhile, Google has halted plans for a data centre over similar water use concerns.",
      "Back in Virginia, Ms Bolthouse says the firms need to do more to boost sustainability. In the long run, she says, it will be in the industry's own interests to improve data centres' environmental impact.",
      "\"What's going to happen if we continue with business as usual is that electrical prices are going to skyrocket for everybody, including the data centre industry - and that's their biggest bill, so that's going to impact them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe water scarcity issue is also going to impact them.",

    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",

    "summary": "Start-up firms are looking for ways to dye clothes using less water and heat.",
    "story": [
      "In a small corner of rural Taiwan, set amongst other dye houses and small factories, the start-up Alchemie Technology is in the final phase of rolling out a project it claims will upend the global apparel industry and slash its carbon footprint.",
      "The UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\u2019s first digital dyeing process.",
      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",
      "NTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\u2019s interview request.",
      "Kirsi Niinim\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \u201cquite promising\u201d \u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.",
      "But even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.",
      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",
      "The company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.",
      "They will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.",
      "Big fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.",
      "And that\u2019s just one company - there will be many, many more in need.",

      "Nigeria has announced that free emergency Caesarean sections will be made available to \"poor and vulnerable\" women in an ambitious plan to bring down the high number of mothers dying in childbirth.",
      "At 1,047 deaths per 100,000 live births, Africa's most populous nation has the fourth highest maternal mortality rate in the world and the lack of access to Caesareans is thought to be one of the reasons.",
      "Many pregnant women, particularly in rural Nigeria are unable to receive emergency medical care partly due to the cost.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 11:14:58 GMT",
    "summary": "It is an embarrassing critique for Hamas, which has used religious arguments to  justify its actions.",
    "story": [
      "The most prominent Islamic scholar in Gaza has issued a rare, powerful fatwa condemning Hamas\u2019s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered the devastating war in the Palestinian territory.",
      "Professor Dr Salman al-Dayah, a former dean of the Faculty of Sharia and Law at the Hamas-affiliated Islamic University of Gaza, is one of the region\u2019s most respected religious authorities, so his legal opinion carries significant weight among Gaza\u2019s two million population, which is predominantly Sunni Muslim.",
      "A fatwa is a non-binding Islamic legal ruling from a respected religious scholar usually based on the Quran or the Sunnah - the sayings and practices of the Prophet Muhammad.",
      "Dr Dayah\u2019s fatwa, which was published in a detailed six-page document, criticises Hamas for what he calls \u201cviolating Islamic principles governing jihad\u201d.",
      "Jihad means \u201cstruggle\u201d in Arabic and in Islam it can be a personal struggle for spiritual improvement or a military struggle against unbelievers.",
      "Dr Dayah adds: \u201cIf the pillars, causes, or conditions of jihad are not met, it must be avoided in order to avoid destroying people\u2019s lives. This is something that is easy to guess for our country\u2019s politicians, so the attack must have been avoided.\u201d",
      "For Hamas, the fatwa represents an embarrassing and potentially damaging critique, particularly as the group often justifies its attacks on Israel through religious arguments to garner support from Arab and Muslim communities.",
      "The 7 October attack saw hundreds of Hamas gunmen from Gaza invade southern Israel. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage.",
      "Israel responded by launching a military campaign to destroy Hamas, during which more than 43,400 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",

      "Israel Gaza war: History of the conflict explained",
      "What is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza?",
      "Dr Dayah argues that the significant civilian casualties in Gaza, together with the widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure and humanitarian disaster that have followed the 7 October attack, means that it was in direct contradiction to the teachings of Islam.",
      "Hamas, he says, has failed in its obligations of \u201ckeeping fighters away from the homes of defenceless [Palestinian] civilians and their shelters, and providing security and safety as much as possible in the various aspects of life... security, economic, health, and education, and saving enough supplies for them.\u201d",
      "Dr Dayah points to Quranic verses and the Sunnah that set strict conditions for the conduct of jihad, including the necessity of avoiding actions that provoke an excessive and disproportionate response by an opponent.",
      "His fatwa highlights that, according to Islamic law, a military raid should not trigger a response that exceeds the intended benefits of the action.",
      "He also stresses that Muslim leaders are obligated to ensure the safety and well-being of non-combatants, including by providing food, medicine, and refuge to those not involved in the fighting.",
      "\u201cHuman life is more precious to God than Mecca,\u201d Dr Dayah states.",
      "His opposition to the 7 October attack is especially significant given his deep influence in Gaza, where he is seen as a key religious figure and a vocal critic of Islamist movements, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.",
      "His moderate Salafist beliefs place him in direct opposition to Hamas\u2019s approach to armed resistance and its ties to Shia-ruled Iran.",
      "Salafists are fundamentalists who seek to adhere the example of the Prophet Muhammad and the first generations who followed him.",
      "Dr Dayah has consistently argued for the establishment of an Islamic caliphate that adheres strictly to Islamic law, rather than the political party-based systems that Hamas and other groups advocate.",
      "\u201cOur role model is the Prophet Muhammad, who founded a nation and did not establish political parties that divide the nation. Therefore, parties in Islam are forbidden,\u201d he said in a sermon he gave at a mosque several years ago.",
      "He has also condemned extremism, opposing jihadist groups like Islamic State and al-Qaeda, and has used all of his platforms to issue fatwas on various social and political issues, ranging from commercial transactions, social disputes over marriage and divorce, to the conduct of political violence.",
      "The fatwa adds to the growing internal debate within Gaza and the broader Arab world over the moral and legal implications of Hamas\u2019s actions, and it is likely to fuel further divisions within Palestinian society regarding the use of armed resistance in the ongoing conflict with Israel.",
      "Sheikh Ashraf Ahmed, one of Dr Dayah\u2019s students who was forced to leave his house in Gaza City last year and flee to the south of Gaza with his wife and nine children, told the BBC: \u201cOur scholar [Dr Dayah] refused to leave his home in northern Gaza despite the fears of Israeli air strikes. He chose to fulfil his religious duty by issuing his legal opinion on the attack\u201d.",
      "Ahmed described the fatwa as the most powerful legal judgment of a historical moment. \u201cIt\u2019s a deeply well researched document, reflecting Dayah\u2019s commitment to Islamic jurisprudence,\u201d he said."

      "Initially, Soltanov suggested the potential sponsor might be interested in investing in some of the \"green transitioning projects\" Socar was involved in - but then spoke of opportunities related to Azerbaijan's plans to increase gas production, including new pipeline infrastructure.",
      "\"There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established,\" Soltanov says on the recording. \"Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.\"",
      "Soltanov then described natural gas as a \"transitional fuel\", adding: \"We will have a certain amount of oil and natural gas being produced, perhaps forever.\"",
      "The UN climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledges there will be a role for some oil and gas up to 2050 and beyond. However, it has been very clear that \"developing\u2026 new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C\".",

    "story": [
      "Botswana\u2019s new president has told the BBC that he wants undocumented Zimbabweans to be legalised by granting them temporary work and residence permits.",
      "\"They do jobs that would otherwise not get done,\" Duma Boko told the BBC Africa Daily podcast before his historic inauguration on Friday.",
      "Botswana hosts the world\u2019s second-largest community of Zimbabweans fleeing their country\u2019s economic woes - and they are often resented, with deportations taking place daily.",
      "The decision is not likely to be popular in the diamond-rich southern African nation, but Boko, 54, who has just unseated the ruling party that was in power for 58 years, said it was part of his plans to revive the economy.",
      "LISTEN: BBC Africa Daily interviews President Duma BokoBotswana's politician who did the unthinkable",
      "LISTEN: BBC Africa Daily interviews President Duma Boko",
      "Botswana's politician who did the unthinkable",
      "President Boko said it was a challenge when thousands of Zimbabweans entered Botswana through the long and porous border between the two countries.",
      "\"They come in and are undocumented. Then their access to amenities is limited, if it is available at all, and what they then do is they live outside the law and they commit crimes - and this brings resentment,\" he said.",
      "\"So what we need to do is to formalise, have a proper arrangement that recognises that people from Zimbabwe are already here.\"",
      "It is unclear exactly how many Zimbabweans are in Botswana, but thousands have been coming back and forth since Zimbabwe's economy imploded because of hyperinflation two decades ago. Some have also sought political refuge.",
      "Statistics that are available show that Zimbabweans account for 98% of what is termed \"irregular migrants\".",
      "Responding to a parliamentary question earlier this year, a minister said that from 2021 to 2023, out of a total of 13,489 recorded, 13,189 were Zimbabwean nationals.",
      "Every day, police stations around the country organise deportations of Zimbabweans arrested for not having papers or involvement in crimes.",
      "They tend to work doing cheap labour often as domestic workers and farm workers.",
      "\"A lot of these workers from Zimbabwe perform tasks that the citizen finds unattractive... they do jobs that would otherwise not get done and so there's no conflict there,\" Boko said.",
      "However, there was a backlash against the government late last year after it was proposed that identity cards be used instead of passports for those travelling between Botswana and Zimbabwe.",
      "The overall sentiment was that the move would lead to the arrival of more Zimbabweans.",
      "But President Boko told the BBC Africa Daily podcast that his initiative would also be an opportunity for his countrymen to learn basic skills, like welding and plumbing, from Zimbabweans.",
      "\"In any and every construction site in Botswana the majority of people with those skills are from Zimbabwe, so we need to do a twin programme of allowing them to come in and we utilise the skills that they have and in the process of utilising these skills we also engage in some sort of skills transfer,\" he said.",
      "\"We can\u2019t stop people with skills from coming in when we don't have the skills ourselves - we need to develop these skills and it takes time, so in the interregnum we need to have them come in properly, come in legally and be rewarded appropriately for the skills that they bring.\"",
      "Boko, a human rights lawyer who founded the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) party in 2012, is at pains to show he is a man of the people, encouraging colleagues around him to take selfies.",
      "He says his intention is to break down barriers and \"make sure everybody has easy access, not just access to come close, but also bring ideas and suggestions\".",
      "His main focus - and the reason behind his victory - is his promise to improve the economy.",
      "He says amongst his first moves will be to to sign new deal with global diamond giant De Beers.",
      "Boko believes the agreement has been in jeopardy because of how his predecessor handled negotiations over diamond sales.",
      "With diamond revenues assured, investors would have confidence in Botswana, which would bring in money to the country, Boko told the BBC Africa Daily podcast.",
      "This would aid his ambition to create jobs - 100,000 a year over the next five years.",
      "\"We are facing a crisis of unemployment - for a population that's 2.4 million when you have almost 30% of those people unemployed, it is a crisis. It\u2019s a ticking time bomb,\" he said.",
      "Twinned with his proposal of sharing skills brought in by Zimbabweans, the new president added that he wanted young people to engage in business \"to become entrepreneurs, employ themselves and employ others\".",
      "\"What they need from government is access to affordable finance and access to markets, and government should facilitate these,\" Boko said.",

      "Before the US election, Scholz allies argued that now was not the time for early elections and political instability in Germany.",

      "Susie Wiles and campaign co-chair Chris LaCivita were the masterminds behind Trump's landslide victory over Kamala Harris.",
      "In his victory speech on Wednesday, he called her \"the ice maiden\" - a reference to her composure - and claimed she \"likes to stay in the background\u201d.",
      "Wiles was confirmed the next day as the first appointee of his second term - as his White House chief of staff. She will be the first woman ever to hold that job.",
      "Chief of staff is often a president's top aide, overseeing daily operations in the White House West Wing  and managing the boss's staff.",
      "Wiles, 67, is considered one of the most feared and respected political operatives in the country.",
      "Less than a year after she started working in politics, she worked on Ronald Reagan\u2019s successful 1980 presidential campaign and later became a scheduler in his White House.",
      "In 2010, she turned Rick Scott, a then-businessman with little political experience, into Florida\u2019s governor in just seven months. Scott is now a US senator.",
      "Wiles met Trump during the 2015 Republican presidential primary and she became the co-chair of his Florida campaign, at the time considered a swing state. Trump went on to narrowly defeat Hillary Clinton there in 2016.",
      "Wiles has been commended by Republicans for her ability to command respect and check the big egos of those in Trump's orbit, which could enable her to impose a sense of order that none of his four previous chiefs of staff could.",
      "Attorney general",
      "No personnel decision may be more critical to the trajectory of Trump's second term than the appointee to lead the Department of Justice.",
      "After uneven relationships with both Jeff Sessions and William Barr, Trump is widely expected to pick a loyalist who will wield the agency's prosecutorial power to punish critics and opponents. Department officials are currently working to wind down two federal prosecutions brought against him by Special Counsel Jack Smith's office.",
      "Among the names being floated for the cabinet post are Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who was both indicted and impeached like Trump; Matthew Whitaker, the man who took over for three months as acting attorney general after Sessions stepped down at Trump's request; and Mark Paoletta, former legal counsel to then-Vice-President Dick Cheney, who served in Trump's budget office and argues there is no legal requirement for a president to stay out of justice department decisions.",

      "The secretary of homeland security is responsible for handling immigration and border enforcement, and leading the government response to natural disasters.",
      "Tom Homan, a chief proponent of Trump's immigration approach, stands out as the most likely pick.",
      "He served as the acting director of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) during the first Trump administration, where he backed separating migrant children from their parents as a way to deter illegal crossings. He also made headlines for saying politicians who support sanctuary city policies should be charged with crimes.",

      "\"It's not going to be a mass sweep of neighbourhoods. It's not going to be building concentration camps. I've read it all. It's ridiculous,\" he said.",
      "Though the plan could cost billions of dollars, Homan, 62, has responded: \"What price do you put on national security?\"",
      "Secretary of state",
      "The US secretary of state is the president's main adviser on foreign affairs, who acts as America's top diplomat when representing the country overseas.",
      "Florida Senator Marco Rubio is a major name floated for the position.",
      "Rubio, 53, was most recently under consideration to be Trump's vice-president - a role that ultimately went to his colleague from Ohio, JD Vance.",
      "A senior member of the Senate foreign relations committee and vice-chairman of the chamber's select intelligence panel, the Cuban American lawmaker is a China hawk who opposed Trump in the 2016 Republican primary but has since mended fences and worked closely with him.",
      "But some Trump allies criticise him as a \"neo-conservative\" who fits poorly with Trump's \"America First\" agenda. Other possibilities for the position include Trump's former national security adviser Robert O'Brien and Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty, who was previously Trump's ambassador to Japan.",
      "A dark horse for the nomination, however, is Richard Grenell, who served as Trump's ambassador to Germany, special envoy to the Balkans and his acting director of national intelligence.",
      "Grenell, 58, was heavily involved in the efforts to overturn Trump's 2020 election defeat in the swing state of Nevada and the president-elect prizes his loyalty.",
      "In September, he sat in on Trump's private meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The former president often claims he will end the war in Ukraine \"within 24 hours\" of taking office and Grenell has advocated for setting up an autonomous zone in eastern Ukraine as a means to that end - an idea seen as unacceptable by Kyiv.",
      "But Grenell's combative style will likely make him a better fit for national security adviser - a position that does not require Senate confirmation.",
      "Also rumoured for major national security posts are former Trump Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe; Keith Kellogg, a national security adviser to Trump's first Vice-President Mike Pence; and Kash Patel, a loyalist who staffed Trump's national security council and later helped block the transition to the incoming Joe Biden administration as chief of staff to the acting secretary of defence. Patel could be the next Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) chief.",
      "Trump also said he would fire Federal Bureau of Intelligence (FBI) Director Chris Wray, who he nominated in 2017. Jeffrey Jensen, a former Trump-appointed US attorney, is under consideration to replace Wray.",
      "Defence secretary",
      "Ex-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is among the few former Trump cabinet members who could return for his second term as secretary of defence, where he would oversee the US military.",
      "The former Kansas congressman, 60, served first as Trump's director of the CIA before becoming his chief diplomat.",
      "A foreign policy hawk and a fierce supporter of Israel, he played a highly visible role in moving the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He was among the key players in the implementation of the Abraham Accords, which normalised relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.",
      "He remained a loyal defender of his boss, often tangling with the press and even joking that there would be \"a smooth transition to a second Trump administration\" amid Trump's false claims of election fraud in late 2020.",
      "Another name being discussed is Michael Waltz, a Florida lawmaker who sits on the armed services committee in the US House of Representatives.",
      "Treasury secretary",
      "To be the chief financial officer of his incoming administration, Trump is reportedly considering Robert Lighthizer, a free trade sceptic who led the Republican's tit-for-tat tariff war with China as the US trade representative.",
      "But at least four others may be under consideration for the role, including Scott Bessent, a billionaire hedge fund manager who has become a major fundraiser and economic adviser to the president-elect; John Paulson, another megadonor from the hedge fund world; former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Jay Clayton; and Fox Business Network financial commentator Larry Kudlow, who ran Trump's national economic council.",
      "Interior secretary",
      "North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum was not well-known on the national scene until he launched a bid for president in the 2024 Republican primary.",
      "After making little impact, he dropped out and endorsed Trump, quickly impressing him with his no-drama persona, executive-level competence and wealth.",
      "A software entrepreneur who sold his small company to Microsoft in 2001, he is considered a top contender to lead the interior department, where he will be responsible for managing federal lands and natural resources.",
      "That is an opportunity for him to support Trump's vows to \"drill, baby, drill\" and overhaul US energy policy.",
      "Press secretary",
      "The Trump 2024 campaign's national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, 27, previously served in his White House press office, as an assistant press secretary.",
      "The 27-year-old Gen-Zer made a bid to become the youngest woman ever elected to the US Congress in 2022, to represent her home state of New Hampshire, but fell short.",
      "She is tipped to become the White House press secretary - the most public-facing position in the cabinet.",
      "Others: Elon Musk, Robert F Kennedy Jr",
      "The past two years have been quite a journey for the nephew of former President John F Kennedy.",
      "An environmental lawyer by trade, Robert F Kennedy Jr, 70, ran for president as a Democrat, with most of his family speaking out against his anti-vaccine views and conspiracy theories as they endorsed Joe Biden's re-election.",
      "He then became an independent but, failing to gain traction amid a series of controversies, dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump.",
      "In the last two months of the 2024 election cycle, he spearheaded a Trump campaign initiative called \"Make America Healthy Again\".",
      "Trump recently promised he would play a major role related to public health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Safety Administration (FDA).",
      "RFK Jr, as he is known, asserted he would push to remove fluoride from drinking water because \"it's a very bad way to deliver it into our systems\" - though this has been challenged by some experts.",
      "And in an interview with NBC News, Kennedy rejected the idea that he was \"anti-vaccine\", saying he wouldn't \"take away anybody's vaccines\" but rather provide them with \"the best information\" to make their own choices.",
      "Rather than a formal cabinet position, Kennedy used the interview to suggest he could take on a broader role within the White House.",
      "The world's richest man, Elon Musk, 53, announced his support for the former president earlier this year, despite saying in 2022 that \"it's time for Trump to hang up his hat and sail into the sunset\".",
      "The tech billionaire has since emerged as one of the most visible and well-known backers of Trump and donated more than $119m (\u00a391.6m) this election cycle to America PAC - a political action committee he created to support the former president.",
      "Musk, the head of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of the social media platform X, also launched a voter registration drive that included a $1m (\u00a3771,000) give-away to a random swing-state voter each day during the closing stretch of the campaign.",
      "Since registering as a Republican ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, Musk has been increasingly vocal on issues including illegal immigration and transgender rights.",
      "Both Musk and Trump have concentrated on the idea of him leading a new \"Department of Government Efficiency\", where he would cut costs, reform regulations and streamline what he calls a \"massive, suffocating federal bureaucracy\".",

      "A state case against him for allegedly conspiring to interfere with Georgia\u2019s election in 2020 will go on hold until after his term in office ends - if it's still alive by then.",
      "But next week, the fate of the remaining case \u2013 his conviction on 34 felony counts in New York \u2013 will be determined. It could stand, or it could be swept away in the same political and legal tide that has allowed him to escape the others.",
      "Justice Juan Merchan will decide by Tuesday whether to grant Trump\u2019s pre-election request to throw out his conviction. Should Justice Merchan side with Trump, it would almost wipe clean his slate of criminal woes.",
      "But should the judge uphold the conviction, he would proceed to sentencing later this month. It would likely spark even more delay attempts from Trump and open up an unprecedented new front for America\u2019s criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cThis is truly uncharted territory,\u201d said Anna Cominsky, a professor at the New York Law School.",
      "Will Trump\u2019s case get thrown out?",
      "In May, a New York jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records. The convictions stemmed from Trump\u2019s attempt to cover up reimbursements to his ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, who in 2016 paid off an adult film star to remain silent about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s lawyers argue that a recent US Supreme Court ruling granting presidents a degree of immunity from criminal prosecution applies to certain aspects of his New York case, and therefore the indictment and conviction should be tossed.",
      "During the trial, Justice Merchan dismissed attempts by Trump\u2019s lawyers to throw out the case on immunity grounds. But that was before the US Supreme Court ruled in Trump\u2019s favour this summer \u2013 and before Trump decisively won re-election.",
      "Justice Merchan has set a deadline of 12 November to decide whether to grant Trump\u2019s request.",
      "If he throws out the conviction, that will be the end of the case.",

      "Todd Blanche, Trump\u2019s lead attorney, did not respond to inquiries about whether he planned to seek a delay.",
      "Because Trump will be tied up with a presidential transition and the legal questions about sentencing a president are so complex, some scholars see very little chance it will stay on the calendar.",
      "\u201cI think the most likely outcome in the state case is the judge putting off sentencing until after Trump's term in office,\u201d said Daniel Charles Richman, a professor at Columbia Law School.",

      "Under the law, Trump faces a range of sentences, including fines, probation and up to four years in prison. But many options are rendered impractical by his imminent return to the White House.",
      "\u201cSentencing a sitting president may be one of the most complicated, fraught sentencing decisions you can imagine,\u201d Ms Cominsky said.",

    "summary": "The mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would face legal and practical challenges - and cost billions.",
    "story": [
      "US President-elect Donald Trump has doubled down on his campaign promise of the mass deportation of illegal immigrants, saying the cost of doing so will not be a deterrent.",
      "In some of his first public remarks since winning the election, Trump said his priority upon taking office in January would be to make the border \u201cstrong and powerful\".",
      "\"It\u2019s not a question of a price tag. It\u2019s not - really, we have no choice,\" Trump told NBC News.",
      "But how would Trump\u2019s campaign pledge of mass deportations of migrants actually work and what are the hurdles he may face?",
      "What are the legal challenges?",
      "The latest figures from the Department of Homeland Security and Pew Research indicate that there are around 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US, a number that has remained relatively stable since 2005.",
      "Most are long-term residents - nearly four-fifths have been in the country for more than a decade.",
      "Immigrants who are in the country without legal status have the right to due process, including a court hearing before their removal. A drastic increase in deportations would likely entail a large expansion in the immigration court system, which has been beset by backlogs.",
      "Most immigrants already in the country enter into the deportation system not through encounters with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents but through local law enforcement.",
      "However, many of the country\u2019s largest cities and counties have passed laws restricting local police co-operation with Ice.",
      "Trump has pledged to take action against these \u201csanctuary cities\u201d, but America\u2019s patchwork of local, state and federal laws further complicates the picture.",

      "Analysis - Why Kamala Harris lost",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, or MPI, said that co-operation between Ice and local officials would be a \"critical\" aspect of any mass deportation programme.",
      "\"It's much easier for Ice to pick someone up from a jail if local law enforcement co-operates, instead of having to go look for them,\" she said.",
      "As an example, Ms Bush-Joseph pointed to an early August declaration from the sheriff's offices of Florida's Broward and Palm Beach counties, in which they said they would not deploy deputies to help any mass deportation plan.",
      "\"There are many others who would not co-operate with a Trump mass deportation plan,\" she said. \"That makes it so much harder.\"",
      "Any mass deportation programme is also likely to be almost immediately met with a flurry of legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists.",
      "A 2022 Supreme Court ruling, however, means that courts cannot issue injunctions on immigration enforcement policies - meaning they would continue even as the challenges work their way through the legal system.",
      "But can it be done, logistically?",
      "If a US administration was able to legally move ahead with plans for mass deportations, authorities would still have to contend with enormous logistical challenges.",
      "During the Biden administration, deportation efforts have focused on migrants recently detained at the border. Migrants deported from further inland in the US, from areas not located near the border, are, overwhelmingly, those with criminal histories or deemed national security threats.",
      "Controversial raids on worksites that were carried out during the Trump administration were suspended in 2021.",
      "Deportations of people arrested in the US interior - as opposed to those at the border - have hovered at below 100,000 for a decade, after peaking at over 230,000 during the early years of the Obama administration.",
      "\"To raise that, in a single year, up to a million would require a massive infusion of resources that likely don't exist,\" Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council, told the BBC.",
      "For one, experts are doubtful that Ice's 20,000 agents and support personnel would be enough to find and track down even a fraction of the figures being touted by the Trump campaign.",
      "Mr Reichlin-Melnick added that the deportation process is long and complicated and only begins with the identification and arrest of an undocumented migrant.",
      "After that, detainees would need to be housed or placed on an \"alternative to detention\" programme before they are brought before an immigration judge, in a system with a years-long backlog.",
      "Only then are detainees removed from the US, a process that requires diplomatic co-operation from the receiving country.",
      "\"In each of those areas, Ice simply does not have the capacity to process millions of people,\" Mr Reichlin-Melnick said.",
      "Trump has said he would involve the National Guard or other US military forces to help with deportations.",
      "Historically, the US military's role in immigration matters has been limited to support functions at the US-Mexico border.",
      "Aside from the use of the military and \"using local law enforcement\", Trump has offered few specifics on how such a mass deportation plan could be carried out.",
      "In an interview with Time magazine earlier this year, the former president said only that he would \"not rule out\" building new migrant detention facilities, and that he would move to give police immunity from prosecution from \"the liberal groups or the progressive groups\".",
      "He added that there could also be incentives for state and local police departments to participate, and that those who do not \"won't partake in the riches\".",
      "\"We have to do this,\" he said. \"This is not a sustainable problem for our country.\"",
      "Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA - an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls - said that any deportation programme from the interior would only be effective if coupled with increased border enforcement.",
      "\"That has to be the priority. You're going to make very little progress in the interior if that's not the case,\" he said. \"That's what keeps people showing up.\"",
      "Additionally, Mr Ruark said that a crackdown on companies that hire undocumented migrants would also be necessary.",
      "\"They're coming for jobs,\" he said. \"And they're getting those jobs because interior enforcement has basically been dismantled.\"",
      "The financial and political costs",
      "Experts estimate that the total bill for one million or more deportations would run into tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars.",
      "The Ice budget for transportation and deportation in 2023 was $420m (\u00a3327m). In that year the agency deported slightly more than 140,000 people.",
      "Thousands of immigrants would be detained while awaiting court hearings or deportations, and the Trump campaign has envisioned building large encampments to house them all.",
      "The number of removal flights would also need to be dramatically expanded, possibly requiring military aircraft to augment current capacity.",
      "Just a small expansion in any of these areas could result in significant costs.",
      "\"Even a minor change is in the tens of millions, or hundreds of millions,\" Mr Reichlin-Melnick said. \"A significant change is in the tens or hundreds of millions.\"",
      "Those costs would be in addition to the expense of other border enforcement efforts that Trump has promised: continuing work on a southern US border wall, a naval blockade to prevent fentanyl entering the country, and moving thousands of troops to the border.",
      "Adam Isacson, a migration and border expert from the Washington Office on Latin America, said that \"nightmarish images\" of mass deportations could also cost a potential Trump administration politically from a public relations standpoint.",
      "\"Every community in the US would see people they know and love put on buses,\" Mr Isacson said.",
      "\"You'd have some very painful images on TV of crying children, and families,\" he added. \"All of that is incredibly bad press. It's family separation, but on steroids.\"",
      "Have mass deportations happened before?",
      "Under the four years of the previous Trump administration, around 1.5 million people were deported, both from the border and the US interior.",
      "The Biden administration - which had deported about 1.1 million people up to February 2024 - is on track to match that, statistics show.",
      "During the two terms of the Obama administration - when Mr Biden was vice-president - more than three million people were deported, leading some immigration reform advocates to dub Barack Obama the \"deporter-in-chief\".",
      "The only historical comparison to a mass deportation programme came in 1954, when as many as 1.3 million people were deported as part of Operation Wetback, named after a derogatory slur then commonly used against Mexican people.",
      "That figure is disputed by historians, however.",
      "The programme, under President Dwight Eisenhower, ran into considerable public opposition - partly because some US citizens were also deported - as well as a lack of funding. It was largely discontinued by 1955.",
      "Immigration experts say that the earlier operation's focus on Mexican nationals and lack of due process makes it incomparable to what a modern-day mass deportation programme would look like.",
      "\"Those [deported in the 1950s] were single, Mexican men,\" said MPI's Kathleen Bush-Joseph.",
      "\"Now, the vast majority of people coming between ports of entry are from places that are not Mexico, or even northern Central America. It makes it so much harder to return them,\" she added.",
      "\"Those are not comparable situations.\"",

      "The attack, which also destroyed a centuries-old Ottoman building, highlighted what some archaeologists say is the risk of irreparable damage to historical sites across Lebanon from the current war between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "\"Baalbek is the major Roman site in Lebanon. You couldn't replace it if someone bombed it,\" says Graham Philip, an archaeology professor at Durham University.",
      "\"It would be a huge loss. It would be a crime.\"",
      "Since late September, Israel has pummelled Lebanon with thousands of air strikes in an escalation of its campaign against Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group it has been fighting in nearly a year of cross-border strikes.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has largely been targeting southern Lebanon, suburbs in the capital Beirut and the eastern Bekaa Valley.",
      "But in the past fortnight, the campaign has moved into new areas, or rather, very old ground.",
      "The IDF told the BBC that it only targets military sites. But those targets are incredibly close to the Baalbek temples and Roman ruins in Tyre, a major port of the Phoenician Empire around 2,500 years ago.",
      "According to legend, Tyre is the place where purple pigment was first created - the dye crushed out of snail shells to embroider royal robes.",
      "On 23 October, the IDF issued evacuation orders for neighbourhoods close to the city's Roman ruins, including the remains of a necropolis and a hippodrome.",
      "Hours later it began striking targets. More bombing of the sites was reported last week.",
      "Videos from the strikes showed huge clouds of black smoke rising from seafront areas only a few hundred metres from the ruins.",
      "There is no evidence that the Roman sites in Tyre and Baalbek have been damaged by the Israeli strikes. But Lebanese archaeologists are alarmed at how close the fighting has been to the millennia-old ruins, recognised by Unesco as having outstanding value to humanity.",
      "\"For Baalbek it was even worse than Tyre, because the temples are located within the area that is targeted and [the IDF] did not make any exemption for the temples,\" says local archaeologist Joanne Farchakh Bajjaly.",
      "She says there are no Hezbollah facilities at the Baalbek site: \"No one knows what the excuse or the message behind the hit is.\"",
      "The IDF disputes this. In a statement, it told the BBC it targets military sites in accordance with strict protocol, adding that it is \"aware of the existence of sensitive sites and this is taken into account and constitutes an essential part of the planning of strikes\".",
      "\"Each strike that poses a risk to a sensitive structure is weighed carefully and goes through a rigorous approval process as required.\"",
      "Some ordinary Lebanese attempting to escape Israeli bombing reportedly fled to the Baalbek ruins, judging that ancient sites would not be targeted by Israel and would therefore offer protection.",
      "Ms Farchakh Bajjaly says \"those who didn't have a car to flee\" moved closer to the ruins, in the belief that the Unesco sites are considered more valuable than their lives.",
      "It prompted the local government to issue a warning urging people against travelling to the ruins.",
      "\"They see the site as their shelter. But the site is not a shelter,\" Ms Farchakh Bajjaly says.",
      "The war puts Israel in a \"difficult situation\", says Israeli archaeologist Erez Ben-Yosef.",
      "He said that war damage to important archaeological sites would be a \"huge loss to the cultural heritage of Lebanon and indeed the entire world.",
      "\"However, I know personally that Israel is doing everything it can to prevent such damage.",
      "\"Many of my fellow archaeologists, both colleagues and students, serve in the army and participate in the war... they actively work to prevent such damage, in accordance with the general guidelines of our military.\"",
      "Graham Philip, the Durham University archaeology professor, says he doesn\u2019t believe Israel would intentionally hit Baalbek or other sites.",
      "\"It's hard to see what they would gain in a military sense, bombing a Roman temple.\"",
      "But he cautioned about the risk of some bombs or missiles going off target and hitting the ruins, even unintentionally: \"If you drop enough ordnance, not all of that lands within 25 metres of the target.\"",
      "Mr Philip has been closely monitoring the impact of Israel's strikes on heritage sites in Gaza where it is fighting Hamas, leading a British university team documenting archaeological destruction across the territory.",
      "He says it is still too early to assess how much damage has been done by the current wars in Lebanon and Gaza. But a Unesco survey published in September found that 69 cultural heritage sites in Gaza had been damaged by the war, which was triggered by the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023.",
      "The oldest mosque in Gaza, the Great Omari Mosque, is one. It was built on the site of an ancient Philistine temple before being converted into a church and then a mosque. It was reportedly mostly destroyed by an Israeli strike in December 2023.",
      "Mr Philip says these ancient sites are not only important anchors to the classical past, but are \"almost like the soul of a population\".",
      "\"Imagine how people would feel in Britain if the Tower of London or Stonehenge were destroyed.",
      "\"It's part of their identity.\""

    "story": [
      "A 17-year-old girl in China hailed as a genius in a mathematics contest cheated, competition organisers have said - ending months of scepticism over her stellar results.",
      "Jiang Ping, a fashion design student from a rural town in Jiangsu province, made headlines in June when she came 12th in the qualifiers of an international maths contest run by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.",
      "She was the first finalist since the competition began in 2018 to have come from a lowly vocational school, Chinese media reported. The vast majority of the 800 finalists came from elite universities.",
      "Jiang's results turned her into an overnight sensation, and she was labelled a \"prodigy\" in the press and on social media.",
      "Under China's notoriously cut-throat education system, academic excellence is lauded. Many people online were encouraged by Jiang's results, seeing them as proof that students from vocational institutes could still excel academically.",
      "However, as doubt surrounding her abilities snowballed, competition organisers  said last Sunday that Jiang had violated competition rules in the preliminary round, by receiving help from her teacher, who was also a contestant himself.",
      "\u201cThis has exposed problems like inadequacies in the competition format and the lack of rigour in supervision. We sincerely apologise,\u201d organisers said in a statement.",
      "According to the final results announced on Sunday, neither Jiang nor her teacher was among 86 winners in the competition.",
      "The rise of a maths sensation",
      "The annual mathematics contest is open to contestants from institutions worldwide and hosted by Damo Academy, Alibaba\u2019s research institute.",
      "This year, Jiang, a student at Jiangsu Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, outperformed other finalists from some of the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions \u2014 including Peking University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Oxford.",
      "She had chosen to study at the vocational school both because she was interested in fashion design, and because her sister and friends were there, said local media outlets.",
      "Jiang's results and unconventional educational background soon grabbed nationwide attention. Her story was featured in a video produced by Damo Academy and she was interviewed by news outlets across the country.",
      "\u201cLearning maths is bumpy, but every time I solve the problems I feel quite happy,\u201d she told the state-run People\u2019s Daily. \u201cNo matter what the future holds, I will keep learning.\u201d",
      "Jiang\u2019s teacher, Wang Runqiu, was also thrust into the spotlight, hailed as an educator who noticed and encouraged her passion for maths. Speaking to the media, he described her as an attentive student who had learnt advanced mathematics herself.",
      "\"I have encountered many setbacks in the process of learning maths,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I want to do everything I can to help my students and let them know that there are other possibilities in the future.\u201d",
      "But along with an outpouring of praise for Jiang and her teacher, the student\u2019s story also sparked a discussion about whether China\u2019s education system did enough to support gifted students in less academic pathways - especially those who may not have received similar recognition by their teachers.",
      "China's education system focuses much of its resources on those taking the \"Gaokao\" - the notoriously difficult exam that students need to take in order to get into university. Those in vocational schools had long faced restrictions in taking the gaokao and enrolling in regular universities, until an education reform in 2022 offered vocational school students an alternative university entrance exam.",
      "An earlier op-ed in state-news media outlet Xinhua said that Jiang's results \u201chint[ed] at an awkward truth: even youths as talented as her may be easily buried without good education credentials\u201d.",
      "'She was not the mastermind'",
      "But as Jiang\u2019s fame burgeoned, criticism and scepticism surrounding her skills also started to bubble.",
      "In June, dozens of other finalists published a joint letter they wrote to the competition organising committee demanding an investigation into Jiang. They also called for her answers to the preliminary test questions to be made public.",
      "The finalists alleged that Jiang had made \u201cseveral apparent writing mistakes\u201d in an online video and that she \u201cseemed unfamiliar with these mathematical expressions and symbols\u201d.",
      "While the preliminary round of the competition allowed participants to use programming software, the final round was a closed-book exam. The results of the finals, which were initially set to be released in August, were postponed for several months.",
      "When the results were finally made public on Sunday, Jiang was not among the 86 winners of the final round.",
      "Her school also confirmed in a statement on Sunday that Jiang had been helped by her teacher Wang, and that Wang had been given a warning and disqualified from teachers\u2019 awards for the year. The statement also called for leniency and protection for the teenager.",
      "Attempts by the BBC to contact Jiang's family were unsuccessful. A social media account once used by her mother is now defunct, and a phone number linked to her father has been deactivated. Multiple phone calls by the BBC to Jiang's school went unanswered, and a village official declined to discuss Jiang when contacted by the BBC.",
      "While Sunday\u2019s revelation unleashed a wave of criticism of Jiang and her teacher, many social media users also spoke up for the teenager, arguing the bigger responsibility lay with her school and teacher.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:01:59 GMT",
    "summary": "The birth of a great Indian bustard chick through artificial insemination has given hope to conservationists.",
    "story": [
      "Last month brought good news for the great Indian bustard, a critically endangered bird found mainly in India.",
      "Wildlife officials in the western state of Rajasthan have performed the first successful hatching of a chick through artificial insemination.",
      "A lone adult male in one of two breeding centres in Jaisalmer city was trained to produce sperm without mating, which was then used to impregnate an adult female at the second centre some 200km (124 miles) away.",
      "Officials said the development was important as it has opened up the possibility of creating a sperm bank.",
      "Over the years, habitat loss, poaching and collisions with overhead power lines have effected great Indian bustards. Their numbers have fallen from more than 1,000 in the 1960s to around 150 at present.",
      "Most of them are found in Jaisalmer and hence, conservation activists say that the bird's habitat in the city should be protected. But this land is also prime real estate for renewable energy firms, presenting authorities with a unique conservation challenge.",
      "The great Indian bustard may not be as well known as the peacock (India's national bird) but it's just as impressive, says Sumit Dookia, a conservation ecologist who has been studying the bird for close to a decade. The massive bird, which weighs between 15kg and 18kg, is one of the biggest flying birds in India.",
      "It once had a prolific presence in the country and was found in at least 11 states, but today, its population is confined to Rajasthan, while a handful might be spotted in the southern state of Karnataka and the western state of Gujarat.",
      "The shy bird plays an important role in the food chain by preying on rodents, snakes and other pests and is also the state bird of Rajasthan, where it is called 'Godawan' by locals.",
      "But some of the bird's unique evolutionary traits are clashing with human interventions, making it vulnerable to extinction.",
      "For one, the great Indian bustard has good peripheral vision but poor frontal vision, making it difficult for them to spot power lines until they fly too close to them. Their large size makes it difficult for them to quickly change their flight path and they end up colliding with the cables and dying.",
      "\"Their vision could have developed like this as the bird spends a large amount of time on land,\" says Mr Dookia. It also lays its eggs on the ground, without a nest or any other form of protection except for the watchful eye of the mother and this might have caused it to develop good side vision, he adds.",
      "The great Indian bustard also has unique breeding habits. The bird lays just one egg at a time and spends the next two years caring for its offspring.",
      "\"Since it reaches maturity at around four years of age and lives for 12-15 years, it lays just about four-five eggs in its lifetime and many of these eggs are destroyed by predators,\" Mr Dookia says.",
      "Conservationists say that over the past few years, the great Indian bustard's habitat in Jaisalmer has been overrun by solar and wind energy farms, leading to an increase in flying accidents.",
      "\"The increased human presence has also created more filth, attracting stray dogs who kill the birds or destroy their eggs,\" Mr Dookia says.",
      "To boost the bird's population, the government of Rajasthan collaborated with the federal government and the Wildlife Institute of India to launch a conservation breeding centre at Sam city in 2018. Another breeding centre was set up at Ramdevra village in 2022, says Ashish Vyas, a top forest official in Jaisalmer.",
      "As a first step, researchers collected eggs found in the wild and hatched them in incubation centres. \"Currently, there are 45 birds in both the centres,14 of which are captive-bred chicks (including the one born through artificial insemination),\" he adds.",
      "The plan is to further boost the bird's population and then eventually release them into the wild. But conservationists say that this is easier said than done.",
      "This is because the birds born in these breeding centres have imprinted on human researchers (in other words, they have formed close bonds with their human caretakers) and have lost about 60-70% of their ability to survive in the wild, says Mr Dookia.",
      "\"Human imprinting is necessary for feeding and handling the birds but it also makes them lose their natural instincts. It will be extremely challenging to re-wild them, especially if there's no habitat left for the birds to be released into,\" he adds.",
      "The loss of habitat has also resulted in another problem: researchers have noticed that the birds, which used to migrate across states, have almost completely stopped doing so. Even in Jaisalmer, where the birds are found in two pockets - Pokhran in the eastern part of the city and the Desert National Park in the west - there's hardly any cross-migration, says Mr Dookia.",
      "It's likely that the birds have stopped migrating over large distances in response to flying accidents, he adds. This increases the risk of inbreeding, which could result in birth defects.",
      "\"Thus, the only solution to conserve the great Indian bustard is to preserve its natural habitat,\" he says.",
      "But a Supreme Court judgement from April has made conservationists uneasy.",
      "The court overturned an earlier interim order, which had instructed Rajasthan and Gujarat to prioritise moving power cables underground in great Indian bustard habitats. The order had created a furore among renewable energy firms, who said that this would cost them billions of rupees and virtually kill their business.",
      "In its latest judgment, the court observed that people had the right to be free from the harmful effects of climate change and that shifting large sections of power cables underground may not be feasible for firms from a monetary and technical standpoint.",
      "It also directed that a committee be set up to look into the feasibility of moving power lines and the efficacy of bird diverters - devices that have reflectors and are attached to power cables to alert birds about their presence.",
      "While corporates have hailed the top court's judgment, conservationists and some legal experts say that it's problematic as it pits one good cause against another.",
      "\"The judgment brings into focus a flawed understanding of the interplay between climate change, biodiversity and development issues,\" ecologist Debadityo Sinha wrote in a column.",
      "He noted that many highly-populated cities in India have underground power lines and that other states have taken such a step to protect other bird species in the past. He also pointed out that although moving power cables underground is expensive, it's likely to amount to a fraction of a firm's total earnings.",
      "Mr Dookia says that one of the reasons renewable energy companies are flocking to Rajasthan is because of the low cost of land.",
      "\"There's also not much research on how these renewable energy farms will impact the state's climate and ecology in the long run,\" he says.",

      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",

Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",

      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 03:22:24 GMT",
    "summary": "It is also set to be the world's first breach of 1.5C of warming across an entire calendar year.",
    "story": [
      "It is now \"virtually certain\" that 2024 - a year punctuated by intense heatwaves and deadly storms - will be the world's warmest on record, according to projections by the European climate service.",
      "Global average temperatures across the year are on track to end up more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which would make 2024 the first calendar year to breach this symbolic mark.",
      "These high temperatures are mainly down to human-caused climate change, with smaller contributions from natural factors such as the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "How is climate change linked to extreme weather?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "Global temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set.",
      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",
      "Over the past week, global average temperatures have set new records for the time of year every day, according to Copernicus data.",
      "Many scientists expect the opposite, cooler phase, La Ni\u00f1a, to develop soon. This should, in theory, lead to a temporary drop in global temperatures next year, although exactly how this will play out is uncertain.",
      "\"We will watch with interest what happens going into 2025 and beyond,\" says Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.",
      "But, with levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere still rising quickly, scientists warn it is likely only a matter of time before new records are set.",
      "\"The warmer temperatures [are making] storms more intense, heatwaves hotter and heavy rainfall more extreme, with clearly seen consequences for people all around the world,\" says Prof Hawkins.",
      "\"Stabilising global temperatures by reaching net zero emissions is the only way to stop adding to the costs of these disasters.\"",

      "Kenya's refugee commissioner John Burugu declined to comment about the expulsions, but senior foreign ministry official Korir Sing'oei highlighted the dilemma the government faced when he said it needed to perform a \"crucial balancing of interests for the bigger good\".",
      "\"Harbouring the subversive elements accused of undertaking activities detrimental to a friendly country posed both a diplomatic and humanitarian dilemma to Kenya,\" he added.",

      "Compared to its neighbours, Kenya has enjoyed peace and stability for many years, making it a prime destination for refugees and asylum seekers, from various conflict-hit or authoritarian countries in the region such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Rwanda and South Sudan.",
      "East Africa's biggest economy, Kenya is home to more than 800,000 refugees, according to Burugu.",
      "But rights groups fear that the country has in recent years become an increasingly unsafe for those fleeing persecution in their home countries.",
      "Kenyan police have also been accused on numerous occasions of colluding with foreign security agencies trying to apprehend people they regard as threats.",
      "The latest example of this came when it was accused of being complicit - as Uganda's Observer newspaper put it - in the \"brazen cross-border abductions\" of 36 Ugandan opposition supporters in July.",

      "Uganda's police accused the suspects of being \"engaged in covert activities that are suspected to be subversive, drawing the attention of Kenyan security forces\".",
      "But the group denied any wrongdoing through their lawyer.",

      "One person, who authorities say spent time with Payne every day while he was in Buenos Aires, is charged with abandonment of a person followed by death, a charge that carries a sentence of five to 15 years in prison, according to a\u00a0news release\u00a0from Argentina's National Criminal and Correctional Prosecutor's Office released Thursday.",
      "The other two charged are accused of supplying Payne with drugs, including cocaine, and have been charged with two acts each of supplying narcotics. Officials did not say what the sentence for those charges could be.",

      "The release also stated that Payne died from a fall, and had not jumped from the balcony.

      "\"For the prosecution, this situation would also rule out the possibility of a conscious or voluntary act on the part of the victim,\" the prosecutor's office said.",
      "The investigation included nine raids on homes in the region and dozens of interviews with hotel staff, Payne's family and friends and experts in the fields of medicine, biochemistry and psychiatry, the prosecutor's office said. Investigators also reviewed more than 800 hours of video footage from the hotel and public roads and conducted a forensic analysis of Payne's cell phone to review his digital footprint in the period leading up to his death.",
      "An autopsy was also conducted. After that, Payne's body was returned to his father, Geoff Payne, who had been in Argentina since the day after his son's death.",
      "Toxicology tests conducted as part of the autopsy showed that Payne \"only had traces\" of drug use in his system. There were \"traces\" of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant, the prosecutor's office said. Medical experts found that Payne only had injuries from his fall.",
      "All of the information gathered by investigators was summarized into a 180-page report presented to Judge Laura Bruniard, who oversees criminal cases. Bruniard approved the charges against the three people, but the investigation will continue, the prosecutor's office said, as investigators continue to try to access Payne's other personal devices.",

    "story": [
      "For the last 17 years, a worldwide army of online sleuths obsessively tried to figure out the title of what has been dubbed \"the most mysterious song on the internet.\"",
      "Now, they have the answer after a chance discovery by one intrepid researcher who triumphantly reported his breakthrough on online forum Reddit: it is called \"Subways of Your Mind\"\u00a0and was recorded by a little-known 1980s German band called FEX.",
      "The former band members are \"absolutely overwhelmed\" by the news, 68-year-old Michael Haedrich, who played keyboard and guitar and sang back-up vocals for FEX, told Der Spiegel magazine.",
      "The band had been oblivious to the online phenomenon, he admitted.",
      "How the mystery unfolded",
      "The mystery began in 2007, when a German brother and sister uploaded a track online that they had digitized after originally recording it as teenagers on a cassette from the radio. As Rolling Stone\u00a0reported in 2019, the tape mostly featured songs from popular bands like XTC and The Cure, as well as one particular song that remained a mystery \u2014 until now.",
      "The German siblings asked for help to identify it and audiophiles soon took up the challenge.",
      "The track did not show up in any music databases, but online sleuths tried to work out what instruments could be heard and analyzed the lead singer's accent.",
      "Initial attempts to identify the song, soon classified by many as being in the 1980s' \"New Wave\" genre, yielded little.",
      "It was only when the track was uploaded onto Reddit in 2019 that global interest exploded.",
      "A Reddit subforum called \"r/TheMysteriousSong\" attracted tens of thousands of members, and the hunt was reported on in German media and beyond.",
      "The big breakthrough finally came earlier this week when a user called \"marijn1412\" said he had identified the song as \"Subways of Your Mind.\"",
      "He said he came across former FEX members while researching an event for up-and-coming bands that had been organized in the 1980s by a public broadcaster in northern Germany.",
      "The Reddit user wrote that he had reached out to members of what was a four-piece outfit from the northern city of Kiel, who sent him a version of the mystery song, and revealed its long-sought-after name.",
      "Marijn1412 wrote: \"After I emailed him back that the song is actually quite a famous 'lost song,' he asked me not to go public with it until he spoke with his old band members. In the meantime, though, the song did get registered at [the German performance rights organization] GEMA and people found out about it. But I'm happy to say that the band members agreed for me to go public with it.\"",
      "Haedrich, who is still a musician, told Spiegel that it was the first time he had heard about the massive search effort.",

      "Charlotte, N.C. \u2014 NASCAR issued $600,000 in fines and suspended nine team members from three different teams on Tuesday for alleged race manipulation at Martinsville Speedway.",
      "The penalties came down after a contentious final battle Sunday at the Virginia track in which Christopher Bell initially qualified for the championship final four but his move to hit the wall and use it for momentum violated a banned safety rule and was disallowed.",
      "That gave the final spot in this week's winner-take-all finale at Phoenix Raceway to William Byron.",
      "The race itself was won by Ryan Blanely.",
      "But, NASCAR was clear in disqualifying Bell that it would take a hard look at the actions other drivers played in the sequence of events as Bell and Byron battled for the final spot in the championship flat.",
      "In the case of Bell, NASCAR determined fellow Toyota driver Bubba Wallace faked a flat tire in order to give Bell the leeway to move out of the way and hit the wall.",
      "In the case of Byron, NASCAR ruled that Ross Chastain and Austin Dillon both ran interference to help fellow Chevrolet driver Byron not lose any position on the track that would cost him a spot in the championship.",
      "Elton Sawyer, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said the sanctioning body considered suspending the drivers as well as taking action against manufacturers Chevrolet and Toyota. He said there was nothing in the rulebook that would call for the manufacturers to be punished, but NASCAR planned to meet with the leaders of Ford, Chevy and Toyota to discuss the situation.",
      "Because the penalties were issued the week of the season finale, the teams have until Wednesday afternoon to ask for an expedited appeal. The appeals would likely be heard Thursday.",
      "Trackhouse Racing, which fields Chastain's Chevy, said it would appeal, as did 23XI for the Wallace's Toyota.",
      "\"We feel strongly that we did not commit any violations during Sunday's race,\" 23XI said in a statement.\"",
      "The team is currently embroiled in a lawsuit against NASCAR over the charter system and has Tyler Reddick racing Sunday for the Cup Series title.",
      "The penalties that were issued",
      "A $100,000 fine for Chastain, a $100,000 fine for Trackhouse, and one-race suspensions for team executive Tony Lunders, crew chief Philip Surgen and spotter Brandon McReynolds. Chastain is the defending race winner at Phoenix. The team also lost 50 points.",
      "Dillon was fined $100,000, as was Richard Childress Racing. One-race suspensions were given to team executive Keith Rodden, crew chief Justin Alexander and spotter Brandon Benesch. The team also lost 50 points. Richard Childress Racing also said it would appeal.",
      "Wallace was fined $100,000, as was 23XI. The one-race suspensions went to team executive Dave Rogers, crew chief Robert Barker and spotter Freddie Kraft. The team also lost 50 points.",
      "Sawyer had said Sunday that NASCAR would review the Martinsville finish to see if there was indeed any race manipulation with rival drivers helping others that are aligned with the same manufacturer.",
      "But he said he hoped the penalties were harsh enough to curb the manufacturer alliances and race manipulation.",
      "\"We took and looked at the most recent penalty that we had written for an infraction very similar... we wanted to ramp this one up,\" Sawyer said, \"and we did. We did that in a way that included team leadership and this is something that we felt like we wanted to get our point across that it is a responsibility of all of us.... to uphold the integrity of the sport.\"",

      "Online bidding has started and will continue through Dec. 7, Heritage Auctions in Dallas announced in a news release Monday.",
      "The auction company received the sequin-and-bead-bedazzled slippers from Michael Shaw, the memorabilia collector who originally owned the footwear at the heart of the beloved 1939 musical. Shaw had loaned the shoes in 2005 to the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota.",
      "That summer, someone smashed through a display case and stole the slippers. Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018.",
      "\"It's become an infamous thing for us,\" said Janie Heitz, executive director of the Judy Garland Museum. \"We will forever be known as a place where the ruby slippers were stolen, which comes with a lot of bad but can also come with some good because it put us on the map.\"",

    "summary": "Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music legend who collaborated with everyone from Michael Jackson to Frank Sinatra, has died at 91, his family announced.",
    "story": [
      "Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson's historic \"Thriller\" album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.",
      "Jones' publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family.",
      "\"Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones' passing,\" the family said in a statement. \"And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.",
      "\"He is truly one of a kind and we will miss him dearly; we take comfort and immense pride in knowing that the love and joy, that were the essence of his being, was shared with the world through all that he created. Through his music and his boundless love, Quincy Jones' heart will beat for eternity.\"",
      "Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary music catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song.",
      "For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who didn't own at least one record with his name on it or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who didn't have some connection to him.",
      "Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for \"Roots\" and \"In the Heat of the Night,\" organized President Bill Clinton's first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of \"We Are the World,\" the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa.",
      "Lionel Richie, who co-wrote \"We Are the World\" and was among its featured singers, would call Jones \"the master orchestrator.\"",
      "Jones' work with Michael Jackson",
      "In a career that began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 RPM, the top honors he received are likely the ones for his productions with Jackson: \"Off the Wall,\" \"Thriller\" and \"Bad\" were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones' versatility and imagination helped set off Jackson's explosive talent as he transformed from child star to the \"King of Pop.\" On such classic tracks as \"Billie Jean\" and \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,\" Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For \"Thriller,\" some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing \"Beat It\" and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.",
      "\"Thriller\" sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles' \"Greatest Hits 1971-1975\" among others as the best-selling album of all time.",
      "\"If an album doesn't do well, everyone says 'it was the producers fault'; so if it does well, it should be your 'fault,' too,\" Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. \"The tracks don't just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.\"",
      "The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography \"Q\", including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for \"Roots.\" He also received France's Legion d'Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, \"Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones\" and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author.",
      "Music as Jones' savior",
      "Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, once telling Oprah Winfrey that \"There are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don't. Nothing's in between.\" Jones' mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem \"senseless\" for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting.",
      "\"They nailed my hand to a fence with a switchblade, man,\" he told the AP in 2018, showing a scar from his childhood.",
      "Music saved him. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano.",
      "\"I went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,\" he wrote in his autobiography. \"That's where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.\"",
      "Within a few years, he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band.",
      "\"We had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,\" Jones later told Musician magazine. \"That's when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.\"",
      "Jones, the businessman",
      "As a music executive, he overcame racial barriers by becoming a vice president at Mercury Records in the early '60s. In 1971, he became the first Black musical director for the Academy Awards ceremony. The first movie he produced, \"The Color Purple,\" received 11 Oscar nominations in 1986 but, to his great disappointment, no wins.",
      "In a partnership with Time Warner, he created Quincy Jones Entertainment, which included the pop-culture magazine Vibe and Qwest Broadcasting. The company was sold for $270 million in 1999.",
      "\"My philosophy as a businessman has always come from the same roots as my personal credo: Take talented people on their own terms and treat them fairly and with respect, no matter who they are or where they come from,\" Jones wrote in his autobiography.",
      "Jones, the epitome of versatility",
      "He was at ease with virtually every form of American music, whether setting Sinatra's \"Fly Me to the Moon\" to a punchy, swinging rhythm and wistful flute or opening his production of Charles' soulful \"In the Heat of the Night\" with a lusty tenor sax solo. He worked with jazz giants (Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, Duke Ellington), rappers (Snoop Dogg, LL Cool J), crooners (Sinatra, Tony Bennett), pop singers (Lesley Gore) and rhythm and blues stars (Chaka Khan, rapper and singer Queen Latifah).",
      "On \"We are the World\" alone, performers included Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen. He co-wrote hits for Jackson - \"P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing)\" - and Donna Summer - \"Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger) - and had songs sampled by Tupac Shakur, Kanye West and other rappers. He even composed the theme song for the sitcom \"Sanford and Son.\"",

    "story": [
      "For 42-year-old Kieran Culkin, visiting the building in Manhattan's Yorkville neighborhood where he spent the first eight years of his life brings back unusual memories. \"I remember my mom baking a cake and it would come out slanted because the whole apartment was on a slant,\" he said. \"We used to put cars on one end of the kitchen and let go and see them roll!",
      "\"We lived in a tight space where it was just seven of us running around. It was like a sort of little wolf-pack mentality,\" he said.",
      "His father \"Kit,\" himself a former actor, and mother Patricia, a telephone operator, raised their seven kids in a four-room apartment. Kieran came fourth in the birth order. \"Whenever the door would open to let the kids in, I used to stand aside and make sure, and I used to count to make sure all six of them got in before I got in,\" he said. \"That's how I remember growing up, too, was I couldn't fall asleep until they all fell asleep. Like, I only existed because they did around me.\"",
      "He got into acting because neighbors of theirs ran an off-off-Broadway theater on the Upper East Side: \"And they knew that there was this family that had a bunch of kids. And whenever they needed a kid they were like, 'Uhm, you know, we might need a kid for this show.' And my parents were more or less like, 'Okay, yeah, what gender? What age? We got a whole bunch.'\"",
      "Soon enough, Macaulay, two years older than Kieran, became world famous as the star of \"Home Alone.\" Kieran also had a small role in that movie, and a year later played Steve Martin's son in \"Father of the Bride.\"",
      "Kieran was cute and charismatic. But making it as a grownup actor meant learning how to act. He says when he was 18 and starring in the movie \"Igby Goes Down,\" the director, Burr Steers, wanted to break him of his \"kid acting habits\" \u2013 to unlearn the tricks that had served him so well as a child.",
      "\"He really didn't like kid actors, and he was like, 'You still have a few bad habits,'\" Culkin said. \"He was like, 'You're doing something with your eyes.' He would say, 'Soulful eyes.' Or sometimes he would say, you know, 'That was Nickelodeon,' or something like that. 'You're doing kid stuff.'\"",
      "And when that didn't work, \"He bought me a six-pack of beer and he goes, 'I want you to take this beer and do the scene in front of the mirror.' And I was like, 'I don't think I can do that \u2026 I'm gonna be too self-conscious.' He goes, 'That's what the beer's for.'\"",
      "Culkin got praise for \"Igby.\" But he wasn't sure he wanted to keep acting. For one thing, he was worried about becoming famous. \"Definitely. I feel like any rational person [who] got to experience fame second-hand, they would not pursue it. It's not a nice thing.\"",
      "His brother, Macauley, has become an international movie star at a young age. \"And I saw that and went, 'Oh, I got it. That's awful. Let's never do that!'\"",
      "Kieran worked on stage and only sporadically on film for years, before landing the part he's best known for: Roman Roy, the filterless, fast-talking middle child scheming to inherit a media empire in \"Succession.\"",
      "Even as a member of the fictional Roy family, though, Culkin's real family played a role. Back in 2008, his older sister, Dakota Culkin, was struck and killed by an automobile. He said, \"After a couple seasons on 'Succession,' I realized there was some stuff that Roman did that I was like, 'Oh, that's my sister. That was her sense of humor.'

      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it would seek to pull a widely used ingredient in cough and cold medicines from the market, after the agency's scientists concluded that the oral version of the drug is ineffective as a nasal decongestant.",
      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",
      "A number of common over-the-counter nasal decongestants have relied on phenylephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients for years, including some cold and cough versions of Advil, NyQuil, Sudafed, Robitussin, Tylenol and Theraflu.",

      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",

      "The FDA's proposal caps a push by pharmacy professors at the University of Florida who have urged the agency for years to pull the product, pointing to new data showing phenylephrine did no better than a placebo when swallowed.",
      "The latest data shows that only a tiny fraction of phenylephrine is absorbed into the body when digested from a pill or syrup containing phenylephrine. This is different from other formulations like the inhaled nasal spray versions of the drug, where larger percentages of the drug can make it into the bloodstream.",

    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

      "The two rate cuts so far this year, which have reduced the federal funds rate by a combined 0.75 percentage points, but the larger impact will be felt if the Fed continues to cut rates at its December meeting and into 2025, experts say.",

      "During Trump's first term in office, from 2017-2021, immigration detention expanded at record levels, according to an ACLU report. In 2019, ICE detained an average of over 50,000 people each day. At times, that number exceeded 56,000 \u2014 about 50% more than peak levels during the Obama administration, according to the report. During his first term in office, Trump expanded the federal government's use of private prison companies to detain immigrants.",
      "As of January 2020, 81% of people detained in ICE custody across the U.S. were held in facilities owned or managed by private prison corporations, according to the ACLU report.",
      "In his second term, President-elect Trump promises a radical shift in policy at the U.S.-Mexico border from his predecessor. That includes a pledge to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history, which could bring significantly more business to CoreCivic and Geo Group.",
      "For the first nine months of 2024, ICE accounted for 30% of each company's revenue.",
      "Both Geo Group and CoreCivic said they currently have excess capacity to accommodate a larger population of detainees. CoreCivic executives noted that they're taking steps to prepare to activate additional capacity to meet ICE's needs. That could include reconfiguring facilities to accommodate a bigger intake area, they noted.",
      "\"There is room for an uptick in occupancy from a capacity standpoint and both companies expect an ask from the Trump administration for more beds. The question is how much, and we just don't know right now,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Brian Violino told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Monitoring",
      "Geo Group also provides monitoring services for ICE under its Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), a monitoring program using wearable technology that serves as an alternative to detention.",
      "\"If there is a finite number of beds and a significant number of people are detained, which Trump is discussing in his plans, there could be an increased usage in this alternative to detention,\" Violino said.",

While Republicans won the Senate majority in Tuesday's election, it remains to be seen which party will obtain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "\"That's a big part of the story, and if it's a Republican sweep, it will be easier for Trump to get funding from Congress to support this operation he's looking to do,\" Violino said.",

      "In the last year, job scams have been on the rise, according to Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers when their identities are compromised.",
      "Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information.",
      "\"We've really seen tremendous growth in job scams,\" Velasquez said. \"I think that's just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people.\"",
      "It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did.",
      "After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment she'd need for the job.",
      "A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. That's when she learned the job was a scam.",
      "\"I'm a little traumatized,\" said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers.",
      "If you're a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers:",
      "Job scams are a type of\u00a0impersonation scam.",
      "Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.",
      "\"They're going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,\" she said. \"And they're often saying it's a 100% remote position because that's so appealing to people.\"",
      "Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver's license details.",
      "The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.",
      "Other details don't generally need to be shared with an employer until after you've gotten an offer.",
      "Whether you're replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didn't initiate the conversation, Velasquez said.",
      "Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message.",
      "Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company:",
      "\u2014 Don't respond to the message right away.",
      "\u2014 Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website.",
      "\u2014 Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence.",
      "\u2014 If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website.",
      "If you receive a message from a recruiter, it's best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire.",
      "In Islam's case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information.",
      "A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "\"If you deposit a check and it's fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check,\" Puig said.",
      "So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back.",
      "When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people.",
      "\"Don't let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust,\" Velasquez said.",
      "After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiter's email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly.",
      "\"This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I can't just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are,\" Islam said.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 14:04:53 -0500",
    "summary": "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" says Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanse.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",
      "Most social media companies have policies that bar children under the age of 13 from setting up accounts, but a 2022 study conducted by the U.K.'s media regulator Ofcom found that nearly 80% of children in the country had social media accounts by the age of 12.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 13:41:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election is likely to have a major impact on the economy. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the November 5 election highlights the frustrations of millions of voters, with many Americans noting in\u00a0exit polls on Tuesday that they're still hurting from the highest inflation in 40 years and dissatisfied with the nation's economic trajectory.",
      "Trump ran on a campaign that vowed to tackle those issues, pledging to end the \"inflation nightmare\"\u00a0and to bring prices down \"very quickly.\" He also offered a myriad of tax cuts to various groups, ranging from senior citizens to homeowners, as well as to finance some of those cuts through new tariffs on imports from China and other nations and to\u00a0deport millions of undocumented immigrants.",
      "In the aftermath of Trump's win, economists and policy experts are assessing how those policies might impact the economy as well as consumers' wallets. Already, Wall Street is predicting that his policies could boost corporate growth, sending the S&P 500 higher by as much as 2.2% on Wednesday.",
      "But some experts note Trump's plans may also boost inflation, potentially hurting consumers who are hoping for relief at the checkout counter.",
      "\"The devil will be in the details,\" Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at investment bank Raymond James, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump tax, trade, tariff and immigration agenda could have significant economic impacts and raise concerns about a second wave of inflation.\"",
      "However, compromises or alterations to his plans \"could mitigate the impact,\" Mills added.",
      "To be sure, whether Trump can respond to voters' most pressing economic issues isn't certain, especially if the House of Representatives flips to Democratic control, which could stymie his plans to extend tax cuts that were enacted in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA) as well as to enact other changes.",
      "Here are five ways Trump's policies could impact the economy and your money.",
      "Your money under Trump's tax plans",
      "The core of Trump's tax plan is to extend the provisions in the TCJA that are set to expire at the end of 2025. These include the law's lowered tax brackets and expanded standard deduction.",
      "Trump also wants to provide deeper tax cuts for some individuals and businesses, with his campaign proposing lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%. He's floated the idea of eliminating personal income taxes on many types of earnings, from tips to Social Security benefits, but has yet to offer details.",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts, would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "If Trump is able to enact these tax code changes, personal income taxes would decline for all income groups. But the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model (That research assesses Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.)",
      "That means a middle-class family with earnings of about $80,000 a year would get a tax break of about $1,740 in 2026, the analysis found. Top-earning households, with incomes of more than $14 million, would see their taxes reduced by $376,910, according to Penn Wharton.",
      "What could happen with inflation?",
      "Consumers rank inflation as one of their biggest economic concerns, with many still feeling impact of soaring prices during the pandemic. Although the U.S. inflation rate has now fallen close to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal, many Americans still describe it as high because prices haven't come down; rather, prices are simply rising more slowly than they did during the pandemic.",
      "Economists have cautioned that Trump's plans could reignite inflation. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by American consumers, rather than the countries that export goods to the U.S. On top of that, Trump's plan to deport millions of immigrants could also boost inflation as employers would likely face higher wages due to a labor crunch.",
      "\"Two main pillars of his policy proposals, tariffs and mass deportations, are likely to cause prices to rise as they will make it more difficult for businesses to produce goods,\" Jacob Channel, chief economist at LendingTree, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Trump's plan to levy a 10% tariff on all imports and 60% or more on Chinese goods shipped to the U.S. could add $1,700 a year in additional costs for a typical middle-class household, according to the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Trump's plans could boost the inflation rate by as much 1 percentage point, bringing it to an annual rate of about 3.4% \u2014 above the Fed's 2% goal \u2014 according to Andrzej Skiba of RBC Global Asset Management.",
      "\"If you add 1% to next year's inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts,\" Skiba said.",
      "Could the economy grow faster?",
      "The economy could initially grow slightly faster under Trump's plans to cut corporate taxes, but that impact could fade over time, especially due to the impact of deporting millions of immigrants, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Real GDP growth could be 0.3 percentage points higher in 2026 than if current economic policies continued, wrote Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a November 6 research note.",
      "But, he added, GDP growth could eventually fall to 0.6 percentage points lower in 2028 than earlier projections due to the impact of deportations and higher tariffs.",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Probably not, according to Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant.",
      "First, if Trump's plans reignite inflation as some economists are forecasting, the Federal Reserve may not continue lowering its benchmark rate. Without further cuts in borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, mortgage rates aren't likely to fall, she added.",
      "Second, deporting millions of undocumented immigrants could impact the housing sector \u2014 which already faces a severe shortage of homes \u2014 because it relies on these workers to build new homes, Sturtevant said.",
      "\"His mass deportation proposal would have a chilling effect on the construction industry, shrinking the already constrained labor force and stalling badly needed new housing construction,\" she said. \"At the same time, proposed tariffs will increase building costs.\"",
      "Will Trump's policies help your 401(k)?",
      "Possibly, given that Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts and support for lighter regulations on businesses, if enacted, could bolster company profits and lift the stock market.",
      "On Wednesday, indices including the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average,\u00a0soared on Wall Street optimism for stronger corporate growth.",
      "\"Lower corporate taxes and/or deregulation of the energy and financial sectors under a Trump administration could provide additional support,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Other financial instruments could also get a boost, including cryptocurrencies, due to Trump's pledge to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "At the same time, much of these forecasts depend on Trump pushing through changes to the tax code, regulations and other laws, Channel noted.",
      "\"Virtually all of these policies will be tough to implement, even with Republican control over the House, the Senate and the presidency,\" he said. \"With that in mind, we might not see much change at all in the broader economy.\"",
      "He added, \"Inaction from the next Trump administration could mean that the economy continues to chug along its current course.\"",

      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",
      "A number of common over-the-counter nasal decongestants have relied on phenylephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients for years, including some cold and cough versions of Advil, NyQuil, Sudafed, Robitussin, Tylenol and Theraflu.",
      "\"Based on our review of available data, and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant,\" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release.",
      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",

    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump's vow to raise tariffs could have Americans paying more for goods, from toys to auto parts, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "As President-elect Donald Trump readies to return to the Oval Office, U.S. retailers that depend on foreign suppliers are prepared to pass along the cost of his proposed import tariffs to consumers, potentially leading to higher prices for a range of products.",
      "Americans stand to lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods due to the new tariffs, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released Monday.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said\u00a0in a statement. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",

      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy - and your money",
      "For example, a $40 toaster oven would retail for $48 to $52 after the tariffs, while a $50 pair of running shoes would jump to to $59 to $64, according to the industry trade group. A $2,000 mattress and box spring set would cost $2,128 to $2,190, the NRF said.",
      "During President-elect Trump's first term in office, his administration imposed tariffs of up to 25% on more than $360 billion in products from China. President Joe Biden's White House kept most of those tariffs and added more onto goods including Chinese electric cars and microchips.",
      "Now, Trump has said he plans to impose a 60% tax on goods from China and a 10% to 20% levy on all of the $3 trillion in foreign goods the U.S. imports annually. Such sweeping tariffs would reignite inflation, as they would mostly be paid by U.S. consumers, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned, offering a general view widely\u00a0shared by\u00a0other economists on both sides of the political aisle.",
      "\"A consistent theoretical and empirical finding in economics is that domestic consumers and domestic firms bear the burden of a tariff, not the foreign country,\" the nonpartisan Budget Lab at Yale University stated in an\u00a0analysis published in mid-October.",
      "Trump has repeatedly contended that foreign companies would foot the bill, telling a gathering last month at the Economic Club of Chicago that \"the countries will pay\" the tariffs. In reality, American importers pay the tariffs to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency when their goods cross the border.",
      "\"These policy steps would amount to regressive tax cuts, only partially paid for by regressive tax increases,\" and cost a typical middle-income household about $1,700 in increased taxes a year,\" according to economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The proposed tariffs would shift tax burdens from the well-off to lower-income Americans, the nonprofit also stated in a policy\u00a0brief\u00a0published in August.",
      "For now, it is unclear when the new Trump regime could seek to stiffen tariffs. The process to complete legislation required to raise the levies could take nearly a year, so any adverse impact might not be felt until 2026, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Harvard University professor and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers questioned the wisdom of taxing imports, noting the potential impact on prices. \"For parents, we're coming up on the holiday season and most of our toys are imported from China,\" Summers tweeted on Thanksgiving Day.",
      "Trump has argued that tariffs compel American companies to make goods on U.S. soil rather than purchasing from foreign suppliers.",
      "But some companies have other plans.",
      "\"If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer,\" Philip Daniele, CEO of vehicle parts supplier AutoZone,\u00a0told\u00a0Wall Street analysts in an earnings call in late September. \"We'll generally raise prices ahead of \u2014 we know what the tariffs will be \u2014 we generally raise prices ahead of that,\" Daniele said.",
      "Major suppliers to AutoZone include companies based in China, India and Germany, according to the company.",
      "Stanley Black & Decker CEO Donald Allan Jr.\u00a0said\u00a0last week his tool-producing company has been planning for the possibility of additional tariffs on imports since the spring. \"Obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we [would] put into the market.\"",
      "Allan downplayed the idea of moving manufacturing back to the U.S., saying it would not be cost-effective. The company's options could include \"moving production and aspects of the supply chain to different parts of the world,\" including from China to other parts of Asia and possibly Mexico, the executive said.",
      "Such a shift has already been made by Shelton, Connecticut-based Acme United, which now has its Westcott brand products like rulers made in Thailand and the Philippines, avoiding the tariffs targeting China, CEO Walter Johnsen said in an October earnings call.",
      "Acme has switched production of certain medical products to India, Egypt and U.S. plants in Florida, North Carolina and Washington state, the executive said.",
      "Businesses have also stocked up, placing bigger-than-usual import orders ahead of new tariffs taking hold, as the U.S. imported 11% more Chinese products in July and August than they did during the same two-month period a year ago, according to the Census Bureau.",

      "Even so, borrowers should see some relief. Already, credit card rates are slightly lower, although they still remain close to record highs, according to Schulz.",
      "\"While they'll almost certainly continue to fall in coming months, no one should expect dramatically reduced credit card bills anytime soon,\" he added. \"Unless the Fed dramatically accelerates its pace of rate cuts, it'll still be a while before these reductions add up to more than just a few dollars per month coming off your bill.\"",
      "Will mortgage rates drop?",
      "Despite the Fed's September cut, mortgage rates have increased over the last month, with the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan sitting at about 6.72%, according to Freddie Mac. That's up from a September low of 6.08%.",
      "Even though the Fed's rate decisions impact mortgage rates, home borrowing costs are also affected by economic trends such as unemployment. Meanwhile, Treasury yields have been on the rise due to concerns about rising U.S. debt and the presidential election.",

      "Donald Trump's Trump Media & Technology Group had an eventful Election Day 2024, with its DJT stock halted three times after the shares suddenly plunged. At the end of the trading day, the Truth Social owner released its third-quarter earnings, showing a continued decline in revenue.",
      "The company's third-quarter results, disclosed in a U.S. Securities & Exchange filing, shows that the fledgling social media business continues to lose money, while its revenue slipped 5.6% compared with a year earlier. Still, that marks an improvement from the prior quarter, when Trump Media's sales tumbled 30%.",
      "Donald Trump's stake in DJT",
      "DJT stock has been on a rollercoaster since going public in March, with the shares surging or falling in line with news about Trump, its largest shareholder, with about 57% of the company's shares. The erratic fluctuations of the shares have prompted comparisons with so-called meme stocks, which trade on social media buzz rather than the fundamentals that investors prefer, such as revenue and profitability growth.",
      "\"This has been an extraordinary quarter for the company, for Truth Social users, and for our legion of retail investors who support our mission to serve as a beachhead for free speech on the internet,\" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a statement.",

      "How DJT stock performed on Election Day",
      "DJT stock initially surged almost 19% on Election Day before giving up those gains and closing down 1%. Trading in the stock was also halted three times on Tuesday by the New York Stock Exchange due to sudden drops in its price.",
      "The shares have been on a wild ride since going public in March, initially surging and giving former president's 57% stake a value of\u00a0$5.2 billion.

    "story": [
      "If history is any guide, one stock market gauge suggests that Vice President Kamala Harris will defeat former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race.",
      "In all but two elections since 1944, the party in the White House has retained power when the U.S. stock market advances before Election Day, or the period between the end of July and Halloween, according to an election predictor devised by Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, based out of Allentown, Pennsylvania.",
      "In 2020, the S&P 500 fell 0.04% from July 31 to October 31, with then-President Donald Trump losing the election to President Joe Biden. While the outcome in the 2024 election is not yet known, the S&P 500 rose 3.3% during that three-month span this year.",
      "\"You can say there is sort of an overlap \u2014 the market usually goes up on an annual basis and voters tend to give the incumbent the benefit of the doubt, so it makes sense if the market goes up most of the time and the incumbent gets re-elected most of the time,\" Stovall told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even more reliable are periods when the stock market falls during the period from July 31 to October 31, in which case the incumbent has been replaced 89% of the time. That predictor failed only once, in 1956, according to Stovall, pointing to the year when incumbent President Dwight Eisenhower defeated Adlai Stevenson, despite the S&P 500 tumbling 7.7% in the period ahead of the election.",
      "Still, Stovall notes a mathematician might scoff at basing a model on such a limited sample, in this case the 21 presidential elections held in the U.S. since World War II.",
      "\"Is this really statistically significant? I think the answer is no, but it makes for interesting copy,\" the strategist said. \"You can have data tell whatever story you want.\"",

      "Trump, who is the biggest shareholder of Trump Media with a 57% stake, said the business has been the target of \"probably illegal rumors and/or statements\" that he said allege he plans to sell shares of the company, which owns the Truth Social platform. In September, Trump had vowed not to sell his stake after a lock-up period expired for Trump Media insiders, allowing them to sell for the first time since the stock went public in March.",

      "Trump's call for an investigation into trading of the stock highlight potential conflicts of interest between his role as the nation's chief executive and his business interests, with his holdings in the company valued at $3.6 billion as of Friday afternoon.

A blind trust is managed by an independent trustee, and the president or other official who created the trust isn't allowed to advise or consult with the trustee on business decisions.",

But Trump can't pardon himself from his New York conviction in a case stemming from a \"hush money\" payment because that's a state offense.

      "In February, Trump said he had a \"couple of choices\" for Fed chair, but didn't say who those options might be.",
      "Trump has accused Powell of being \"political.\" However, in July, he told Bloomberg Businessweek, \"I would let him serve it out,\" Trump said, and he added, \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\"",
      "Beyond the question of who would lead the Fed is a bigger issue: Trump has previously said he thinks the U.S. president should have more influence on Fed decisions \u2014 a risk to the central bank's historical independence from political meddling, according to experts.",
      "\"I feel the president should have at least a say in there. Yeah, I feel that strongly,\" Trump said in an Aug. 8 press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. \"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman.\"",
      "Trump will expect the Fed to support economic growth by continuing to ease borrowing costs for consumers and businesses while containing inflation. That amounts to a delicate balancing act, given some of the president-elect's key economic policies, like imposing stiff new tariffs, boosting federal spending and deporting undocumented immigrants, could lead to higher prices.",
      "Nominating new Supreme Court justices",
      "Supreme Court justices sometimes try to time their retirements with a presidential administration corresponding to the party of the president who appointed them. When Trump takes office, there will be three justices who were appointed by previous Republican presidents \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Trump nominated the other three members of the conservative wing during his first term \u2014 Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.",
      "Thomas is the longest-serving member of the court, having been nominated by President George H.W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate in 1991. Roberts and Alito were both tapped for the court by President George W. Bush in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Thomas, 76, and Alito, 74, are also the two oldest members of the Supreme Court.",
      "None of those three justices have publicly indicated an interest in leaving the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump's Supreme Court nominations during his first term widened the court's conservative majority from 6-3, and replacing any of the three other members would maintain that ideological split.",
      "Any nominations during Trump's second term would likely be of younger judges who could serve for decades, ensuring a conservative hold on the court for years to come. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were in their 50s when he nominated them, and Barrett was 48.",
      "Trump told CBS News in August that he'd release a list of potential Supreme Court nominees ahead of the election, but that list never arrived.",
      "Deporting undocumented migrants en masse",

      "\"I don't want to do that. I'm not looking to do that,\" Trump said. \"I think it's terrible to do, but we have no choice.\"",
      "Nearly 80% of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. have been in the country a decade or more, and millions of them work and have families here. A concerted effort to round up, detain and deport people by the millions would not only raise legal and human rights concerns, it would cost billions of dollars a year.",
      "But Trump told NBC News after winning the election that there is \"no price tag.\"",
      "\"It's not a question of a price tag,\" he told NBC, adding, \"We have no choice. When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries and now they're going to go back to those countries because they're not staying here. There is no price tag.\"",
      "Trump has said he may start with deporting undocumented migrants in Springfield, Ohio, and Aurora, Colorado \u2014 two communities targeted by his campaign rhetoric. He said in his debate with Harris that in Springfield, migrants were \"eating the dogs\" and cats, and said of Aurora that it was being overrun by Venezuelan gangs. Local and state officials of both parties disputed Trump's claims.",
      "Rolling back climate and clean energy policies",
      "Trump has long cast doubts on the threat of climate change and prioritized increasing U.S. oil and gas production. \"Drill, baby, drill\" became a refrain at campaign rallies. He has vowed to unlock new lands for drilling, expedite drilling permits and speed up approval of natural gas pipelines.",
      "Trump has also expressed desire to dismantle the Inflation Reduction Act and redistribute any unspent climate funds, which, among other things, support electric vehicle production, EV tax credits, and incentives for battery production and critical mineral mining.",
      "Such a move could prove unpopular with consumers, the automotive industry and even some members of his own party, who have recently supported certain programs funded by the IRA that have brought major manufacturing projects and jobs to conservative districts. Eliminating the individual tax credits for EV could be catastrophic for the automotive industry, which continues to see EV sales numbers grow, and many companies are basing production goals on these growing sales numbers. If the tax incentive is revoked, it would make EVs more expensive and harder to sell.",
      "One of Trump's most prominent backers, billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, has benefitted from EV incentives.",
      "During his first term, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, which included national goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Biden later rejoined the accords.",
      "Trump's record on climate issues has prompted warnings from scientists and climate activists about the accelerating dangers of failing to move rapidly toward clean energy and more sustainable development. \"The science on climate change is unforgiving, with every year of delay locking in more costs and more irreversible changes,\" said Rachel Cleetus, the policy director and lead economist for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS.",

      "Putting vaccine denier Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in charge of health care",
      "Kennedy's name has been floated to oversee a variety of health-related issues in a second Trump administration, including to run the Department of Health and Human Services. It's unclear, though, whether a nomination to a Cabinet position would receive the necessary support from Senate Republicans.",
      "Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, told CNN that the Senate will \"give great deference to a president that just won a stunning, what I think is an Electoral College landslide when all is said is done and a mandate.\"",
      "\"He's being given a mandate to govern, and I think presidents who are given a mandate to govern deserve from the Senate the opportunity to surround themselves with people who are going to execute their policies,\" Rubio said.",
      "Kennedy has spent years promoting false information and fears about vaccines, baselessly linking vaccines to autism long after such claims were disproven. He also falsely claimed COVID-19 was \"ethnically targeted\" to attack certain ethnic groups while sparing Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people \u2014 a conspiracy theory that drew accusations of antisemitism and racism. Kennedy also claimed Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water, a pet project of Kennedy's.",
      "Kennedy has said recently that he doesn't want to take vaccine options away from Americans, but his skepticism of them and conspiracy-laden views on science and medicine alarm public health experts.",
      "Kennedy has also campaigned against pesticide use in agriculture and processed food additives.",
      "During a rally in Henderson, Nevada, Trump suggested Kennedy would \"work on health and women's health,\" and said on election night that Kennedy is \"going to go make America healthy again.\"",
      "In an interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson last week, Trump said Kennedy \"can do whatever he wants,\" adding that he'd like the one-time independent presidential candidate to look at pesticides and vaccines.",

      "Cutting taxes and business regulations",
      "Trump has said he would boost economic growth through a combination of cutting taxes and eliminating regulations on business. Specifically, he is expected to push Congress to extend the sweeping tax cuts enacted under the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), many of which are set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "Trump has also proposed lowering corporate taxes to 15% from their current level of 21%; reversing a $10,000 deduction cap on state and local property taxes; ending taxes on tipped wages and overtime pay; and eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "If Congress extends the TCJA cuts, income taxes would decline under Trump for Americans of all incomes, but the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to an analysis by the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model.",
      "Overall, Trump's tax cuts would lower federal revenue by $5.8 trillion over the next 10 years, adding to the nation's mounting debt, Penn Wharton estimates. The national debt has grown significantly under both Trump and Mr. Biden in the last eight years.",
      "On the regulatory front, Trump has pledged to remove federal restrictions on fossil fuel production, eliminate red tape in housing construction and ease rules on cryptocurrencies, among other efforts. Investors expect such moves to drive up corporate profits and, in turn, stock prices.",
      "Imposing massive tariff hikes",
      "Trump has said he wants to impose tariffs on all international imports, which economists generally believe will lead to an increase in the price of goods.",
      "Trump pledged to impose 10% across-the-board levies on all products imported to the U.S. from overseas, something he says will protect American jobs and raise more federal revenue, which suggests that he believes that high tariffs would force companies to bring production back to the U.S., creating American jobs, and therefore more taxable revenue.",
      "But most economists say that would likely backfire. Manufacturers would pass costs on to consumers, effectively creating\u00a0 a new tax on Americans. Trump also proposed a levy of 60% or more on Chinese imports \u2014 so, in total, if these tariffs were enacted, a typical middle-class household\u00a0 would face an estimated $1,700 a year in additional costs, according to the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Rolling back protections for LGBTQ+ people",
      "Trump has been inconsistent on questions surrounding LGBTQ rights, but during his first term, he rolled back protections for LGBTQ people \u2014 especially transgender individuals \u2014 and anti-trans rhetoric became a theme of his 2024 campaign. His campaign spent tens of millions on one such high-visibility ad that ran during the World Series, NFL and college football games with the memorable tagline \"\"Kamala is for they/them. Trump is for you.\"",
      "The Trump administration reversed a policy that required schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. His administration banned some transgender people from serving in the military \u2014 a policy that Mr. Biden reversed. And he also tried to repeal health protections for transgender people and sought to end protections for transgender individuals in federal prison, among other policies.",
      "During his campaign, Trump pledged to use his second term to punish doctors who provide gender affirming care for minors and impose consequences for teachers who discuss it with their minor students.",
      "Leaving abortion access to be decided by states",
      "The president-elect's stances on abortion\u00a0have been contradictory in the years since he began running for the presidency. He's touted the Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade, taking credit for appointing three of the justices who joined the majority ruling.",
      "He frequently says the issue should be left up to the states \u2014 some of which have imposed near-total abortion bans. Trump has also pledged not to sign a national abortion ban.",
      "\"My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,\" Trump said in April.",
      "At the presidential debate with Harris, Trump said, \"I'm not signing a ban,\" adding that there's \"no reason to sign a ban because we've gotten what everybody wanted.\" In October, he went further, saying he'd veto a national abortion ban.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates have called for further restrictions on abortion through a law already on the books. They believe the Comstock Act, which concerns the the shipping of materials deemed as \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile,\" could be applied to ban anything used to aid an abortion \u2014 not just the mailing of abortion pills. Trump told CBS News in August that he would not enforce the Comstock Act.",
      "On IVF, another reproductive rights issue that has come to the fore in recent months, Trump has pledged to expand access to the expensive fertility treatments. The pledge came in response to backlash following a ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court that determined that frozen embryos created during the IVF process could be considered children, raising the possibility of infanticide prosecutions if they're destroyed. This prompted clinics in the state to temporarily halt treatments. Democrats have warned that Republicans want to restrict access to the procedures, while blaming the Alabama ruling and threats to fertility treatments in other states on Trump.",
      "Trump announced last month a new plan that would require the federal government to pay for the fertility treatments or require insurance companies to cover costs associated with IVF. He has not said how the government would pay for the high cost of IVF, and the idea of an insurance mandate for IVF treatments runs counter to one of the main pursuits of his first term, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. He did succeed in killing the law's individual mandate through the enactment of his 2017 tax cuts.",
      "Changing U.S. policy on Israel's war with Hamas and Hezbollah",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was among the first foreign leaders to hail Trump's victory.",
      "\"Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America,\" Netanyahu said in a tweet even before Trump's election win was confirmed.",
      "Netanyahu spoke to Trump in a \"warm and cordial\" phone call, his spokesperson said, adding that the two men \"agreed to work together for Israel's security\" and also discussed \"the Iranian threat.\"",
      "Trump has not said how he'll address Israel's still-expanding wars against Iran-backed Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon, but he's suggested he can end the conflagration in the heart of the Middle East quickly.",
      "Netanyahu, under intense domestic and international pressure over his handling of the multi-front war, has relied heavily on Washington, Israel's closest ally, for military and diplomatic backing to continue the fight. He will be urging Trump to keep that vital support coming amid intense international pressure over the humanitarian crises in Gaza and Lebanon, and growing domestic pressure over his handling of the war.",
      "But veteran Israeli diplomat, government adviser and now journalist Alon Pinkas told CBS News ahead of the U.S. election that in his view, Trump is a \"very transactional man\" who fails to understand the complexities of the wars Israel is fighting and the motivation behind them.",
      "\"He's war averse,\" Pinkas said of Trump, adding that the president-elect's isolationist tendencies presented \"a great risk\" for Israel.",
      "Even if Trump were to decide to back away from active support for Israel and essentially let Netanyahu do as he sees fit, without criticism or threats of suspending aid, Pinkas said that wouldn't be enough to ensure Israel's security.",
      "\"If you look at the last six months, about American involvement in intercepting Iranian ballistic missiles in April, in deploying a THAAD missile system in Israel just three weeks ago, in deterring Iran to the best of their ability and providing Israel hardware and munitions that otherwise Israel may not have received,\" said Pinkas, \"it's not enough that they write, the Congress\u2026a blank check of $3.8 billion, which is the annual military aid, and say, 'leave us alone, do with it what you want.' There needs to be active American diplomacy.\"",
      "Pressuring Ukraine to cede ground to Russia to end war",
      "Trump will take over as the U.S. commander-in-chief amid the deadliest conflict on the European continent since World War II. He's said he can end the nearly three-year war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine before he even takes office.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had an \"excellent\" conversation with Trump after the election, adding that they had agreed to \"advance\" cooperation.",
      "But on the campaign trail, Trump never said how he would end the war, and Ukrainians have voiced fear for months that he could do so by curbing the U.S. military and financial support \u2014 already worth more than $50 billion \u2014 which has been a lifeline for the country's defense, and force Zelenskyy to meet Russia's demands to cede occupied territory.",
      "Any fresh attempt to end violence like this is likely to involve peace talks of some kind, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has said repeatedly that the war will not end until the areas his forces have unilaterally and illegally annexed \u2014 around a fifth of Ukraine's territory \u2014 are recognized as part of Russia.",
      "Zelenskyy insists that all of Ukraine's land must be returned, and he's warned repeatedly that allowing Putin to seize ground will embolden the Russian leader, with direct implications for America.",
      "\"This aggression, and Putin's army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they're the NATO members,\" Zelenskyy told CBS News early this year.",
      "Heaping pressure on NATO allies to cough up more cash",
      "There is clear precedent for Trump's stance on the U.S.-led NATO alliance that was born out of the military partnerships formed during World War II. During his first term and since, Trump has made it clear that he feels America's European NATO allies slipped into complacency, relying on their superpower partner for theoretical defense in what had been decades of peacetime.",
      "He demanded publicly, repeatedly that some of America's oldest and closest allies meet their NATO membership commitment to devote at least 2% of their annual GDP to their defense budgets. Trump accused some allies of freeloading - benefitting from the guarantee of NATO's collective defense principle without paying their fair share.",
      "While the European jitters over the Ukraine war are undoubtedly a factor, his reprimands seem to have worked, to some degree. The majority of NATO member states now meet at least the 2% threshold. It's little wonder, perhaps, that the only two countries that devote more than the U.S. to defense, proportionally, are Poland, which borders Ukraine, and Estonia, which borders Russia.",
      "There are still wider concerns, meanwhile, among NATO partners over the level of Trump's commitment to the alliance, and he vowed on the campaign trail to \"fundamentally reevaluate NATO's purpose and mission.\"",

    "story": [
      "An operative working for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps told federal investigators that he was tasked in September with \"surveilling, and, ultimately, assassinating\" President-elect Donald Trump, according to court records unsealed Friday.",
      "Prosecutors say Farhad Shakeri, who is believed to be residing in Iran, told investigators in a phone interview that unnamed IRGC officials pushed him to plan an attack against Trump last month. If the plan could not come together in time, the Iranian officials directed Shakeri to delay the plot until after the presidential election because the official \"assessed that [Trump] would lose the election,\" charging documents revealed.",
      "Shakeri and two individuals living in the U.S. \u2014 Carlisle Rivera of Brooklyn, New York; and Jonathon Loadholt of Staten Island \u2014 were charged as part of a broad Iran-backed scheme to allegedly surveille and ultimately assassinate individuals inside the U.S. who opposed the Iranian regime.",
      "FBI investigators wrote that Shakeri immigrated to the U.S. as a child from Iran, but was deported in 2008 after serving more than a decade in prison on robbery charges. They alleged the IRGC ultimately used Shakeri to recruit criminal contacts inside the U.S. to carry out specific operations like targeting an unnamed Iranian American journalist and activist living in New York.",
      "In February, prosecutors alleged Shakeri paid Rivera and Loadholt about $1,000 to monitor the activist \u2014 who has spoken out against Iran's regime \u2014 at an event at Fairfield University in Connecticut. The surveillance operations continued into March, according to court documents, when the pair allegedly traveled multiple times to the activist's Brooklyn home. Text messages, security camera footage and cell site location data revealed their numerous trips.",
      "\"On or about April 1, 2024, 9 SHAKERI and RIVERA exchanged voice notes discussing RIVERA and LOADHOLT' s efforts to locate and murder\" the Iranian American, court records said.",
      "\"This b**** is hard to catch, bro,\" Rivera allegedly said to Shakeri. \"There ain't gonna be no simple pull up, unless there['s] the luck of the draw.\"",
      "According to court records, Shakeri allegedly responded later, \"you just gotta have patience and don't, kicking, kick in the door is not an option because that's a fail, that's a fail maneuver. You gotta wait and have patience to catch her either going in the house or coming out, or following her out somewhere and taking care of it. Don't think about going in. In is a suicide move.\"",
      "Investigators searched online accounts belonging to Rivera and Loadholt in the course of the federal probe and uncovered numerous images of firearms and other weapons.",
      "In April, Shakeri agreed to pay Rivera and Loadholt $100,000 to \"finish the work\" and said he was tasked by the IRGC to hire individuals to assassinate the journalist. And by July, according to charging documents, the Iranians were growing impatient, instructing their U.S. assets to \"take care of it already.\"",
      "The alleged plot to kill the activist did not succeed.",
      "Rivera and Loadholt are not accused of being part of the plot to target Trump. They made their initial appearance in federal court on Thursday and were ordered detained, according to the Justice Department. Shakeri remains at large.",
      "\"We will not stand for the Iranian regime's attempts to endanger the American people and America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.",
      "The charges announced Friday are not the first brought against alleged operatives of the IRGC for plotting to kill Trump. Earlier this year, the FBI arrested Asif Merchant for planning to assassinate U.S. government officials, including potentially the president-elect. Merchant remains in custody and pleaded not guilty.",
      "On at least five occasions between September and November, Shakeri participated in \"voluntary telephonic interviews with FBI agents\" in exchange for a sentence reduction for another individual serving time in the U.S, court records said.",
      "During the interviews, he allegedly told the FBI of the IRGC's desire to kill the Iranian American activist and target Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka with a mass shooting event. Shakeri also told investigators that the IRGC tasked him with surveilling two Jewish American citizens living in New York, but he did not provide the Iranian officials with information about the unnamed targets.",
      "During the interview, Shakeri also allegedly told the FBI about the effort to target Trump.",
      "In a statement, FBI Director Christopher Wray said, \"The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \u2014 a designated foreign terrorist organization \u2014 has been conspiring with criminals and hitmen to target and gun down Americans on U.S. soil and that simply won't be tolerated.\"",
      "The charges and allegations announced Friday are part of broader posture by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement to publicly bring attention to Iran's alleged efforts to quiet dissidents on U.S. soil and target U.S. government figures after the killing of IRGC General Qasem Soleimani by American forces in 2020. Trump and former members of his administration have been forced in recent years to increase his security due to the threats.",

      "San Francisco Mayor London Breed conceded the mayoral race to Daniel Lurie Thursday afternoon with a social media post that congratulated her competitor.",
      "The mayor also thanked the city and its residents for \"the opportunity to serve the City that raised me\" in the post on X just after 4:30 p.m. Thursday.",
      "There had been rumblings that Breed might concede the race earlier Thursday having come in behind Lurie in the last vote count released Wednesday morning.",
      "\"Today, I called Daniel Lurie and congratulated him on his victory in this election,\" the post read. \"Over the coming weeks, my staff and I will work to ensure a smooth transition as he takes on the honor of serving as Mayor of San Francisco. I know we are both committed to improving this City we love.\"",
      "Breed spoke at a press conference less than an hour after the social media post to answer questions from reporters about her decision, reiterating some of what she said in her social media post.",
      "\"The city is on the rise. The office is bigger than just one person, and I called Daniel Lurie earlier today to congratulate him,\" the mayor said. \"And made it very clear my team and I stand ready to support him during his transition. We will always do everything we can to ensure the success of the city and that there is a smooth transition, so that the important work that has been done and needs to continue in San Francisco moves forward.\"",
      "When asked if this was the hardest speech she'd ever given, Breed quickly dismissed that idea.",
      "\"No, it's not. There's been other harder speeches. I mean I had to make a hard decision to close the city down during a global pandemic. I had to deal with\u2026the racial reckoning that happened after the tragic death of George Floyd. I had to go out in the middle of the night and tell people that Mayor Ed Lee had passed away. There are numerous occasions.\"",
      "Six years ago, incumbent London Breed became the first Black woman to serve as mayor of San Francisco after the death of Mayor Ed Lee in late 2017. The then president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors was automatically appointed as the city's acting mayor early the morning after Lee's death.",
      "In June of 2018, Breed won the special election that was held to fill the office, defeating her main opponent, former state senator Mark Leno.",
      "Breed faced a number of major challenges during her first term in office, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the city's ongoing issues with drug abuse and homelessness, rising housing costs and a spike in retail crime that some chains cited as the reason behind closing stores in San Francisco.",
      "While Breed has touted progress in reducing the number of homeless encampments and pushed programs to fill vacant business spaces downtown, the mayor's struggles have led to 11 other candidates entering the race to challenge her for the job.",
      "\"Over the coming weeks, I plan to reflect on all the progress we've made. But today, I am proud that we have truly accomplished so much and my heart is filled with gratitude,\" Breed's message said in closing. \"During my final two months as your Mayor, I will continue to lead this City as I have from Day One \u2013 as San Francisco's biggest champion.\"",
      "Daniel Lurie has announced that he will speak to the media about the latest developments Friday morning.",

    "summary": "The ruling is a major defeat for the outgoing Biden administration, which argued the policy promoted family unity among mixed-status households.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Thursday struck down a Biden administration program that would allow unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens to get legal status and a streamlined path to U.S. citizenship, declaring the policy illegal.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge J. Campbell Barker, an appointee of President-elect Donald Trump, found the program violates U.S. immigration law, agreeing with a lawsuit filed by Texas and more than a dozen other Republican-led states.",
      "The ruling is a major defeat for the outgoing Biden administration, which argued the policy, known as Keeping Families Together, promoted family unity among mixed-status households. When it was announced earlier this year, officials said roughly half-a-million undocumented immigrants were likely eligible for the program.",
      "The Justice Department can appeal Thursday's ruling, but the Keeping Families Together program is likely to be in the crosshairs of the incoming administration of Trump, who has vowed to dismantle President Biden's immigration policies. Trump has separately promised to seal and militarize the U.S.-Mexico border and oversee the largest mass deportation in American history.",
      "Representatives for the White House and Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Keeping Families Together initiative was announced by Mr. Biden in June, just weeks after he took a different executive action to sharply limit asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The program would give work permits and deportation protections to undocumented immigrants who are married to American citizens and have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years without committing serious crimes.",
      "Most importantly, the policy would also allow these immigrants to apply for permanent residency, also known as a green card. After three years, green card holders married to U.S. citizens can apply for citizenship.",
      "Immigrants who marry U.S. citizens are already eligible for a green card on paper. American immigration law, however, requires those who entered the U.S. illegally to leave the country and re-enter legally to be eligible for a green card. But leaving the U.S. after living in the country unlawfully for some time can trigger a 3 or 10-year exile, prompting many families to refrain from pursuing that option.",
      "The Biden administration's program would allow eligible immigrants to apply for a green card without having to leave the country by granting them an immigration benefit known as parole, which effectively cancels out their illegal entry.",
      "In his ruling, Campbell Barker said the Biden administration did not have the legal authority to grant parole to unauthorized immigrants who are already in the U.S.",

Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female chief of staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.\"",

      "\"Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable,\" President Biden said. \"A defeat does not mean we are defeated.\"",
      "He urged Americans to embrace unity, and said he accepted the results of the election.",
      "\"We accept the choice the country made,\" he said. \"I've said many times, you can't love your country only when you win. You can't love your neighbor only when you agree,\" and he called for unity after the bitterly partisan election.",

      "He said he'd direct his administration to work with the president-elect's team for a \"peaceful and orderly transition\" of power.",
      "\"For over 200 years, America has carried on the greatest experiment in self-government in the history of the world,\" the president said in an address in the White House Rose Garden, continuing, \"where the people, the people vote and choose their own leaders and they do it peacefully. And where in a democracy, the will of the people always prevails.\"",
      "The president also praised Harris' campaign during his brief remarks, which lasted about six minutes.",
      "\"She ran an inspiring campaign, and everyone got to see something that I learned early on to respect so much \u2014 her character,\" Mr Biden said. \"She has a backbone like a ramrod, she has great character, true character. She gave her whole heart and effort, and she and her entire team should be proud of the campaign they ran.\"",
      "It was only four months ago that Mr. Biden was seeking reelection himself, before exiting the race and passing the baton to Harris. Now, he'll be handing off to Trump.",
      "The president also said he hopes this election quiets doubts about the integrity of the election and election workers, a reference to misinformation spread by Trump and Republicans about the 2020 election.",
      "\"I also hope we can lay to rest the question about the integrity of the American electoral system \u2014 it is honest, it is fair, and it is transparent,\" Mr. Biden said. \"And it can be trusted, win or lose.\"",
      "Mr. Biden spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris over the phone on Wednesday to congratulate her on her campaign, despite the loss. In a statement Wednesday he said when he backed her to become the nominee that selecting Harris as his running mate was \"the best decision I made.\"",
      "In his conversation with Trump, the president said he also invited the president-elect to a meeting at the White House. The Trump campaign said the former president \"looks forward to the meeting\" and that Trump \"very much appreciated the call.\"",
      "Throughout the campaign, Mr. Biden repeatedly framed a possible Trump return to the White House as a threat to democracy, and the two men have been bitter rivals since they faced off in the 2020 presidential election. After Mr. Biden's victory, Trump stalled the transition of power as he refused to accept the results of the election.",

      "Trump ally and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani got a tongue-lashing Thursday in federal court after missing a deadline to turn over valuables to two election workers he defamed, including one asset, a vintage Mercedes, that he took for a drive to vote in Florida. He owes the women, Ruby Freeman and daughter Wandrea Moss, millions in damages.",
      "U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman, upon being informed that Giuliani is the only person named on a list of people who have knowledge of Giuliani's assets \u2014 and that he wants his name removed \u2014 called the request \"farcical.\"",
      "\"My expectation is you're going to answer that question truthfully and fully,\" Liman said, adding that someone else \"in the world\" must have knowledge of Giuliani's various assets.",
      "Hearings in the matter were being conducted remotely, but Liman ordered Giuliani to appear Thursday in person after learning that Giuliani had not met his obligations to the two women. Lawyers for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea Moss, said they went to Giuliani's Manhattan apartment last week and discovered that it had been emptied out, frustrating their efforts to catalog and obtain his assets.",
      "\"That's the one piece of property sitting here in Manhattan that can't be moved. Everything else has been game playing,\" said Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for Freeman and Moss.",
      "\"We've asked over and over where this stuff is, and the defendant has refused to answer,\" Nathan said.",
      "Kenneth Caruso, one of Giuliani's lawyers, said some of the items are now in a storage facility in suburban Ronkonkoma, New York, and claimed Giuliani has \"no control\" of it.",
      "Liman warned Caruso to \"consider your words\" about access to the storage facility, because it could end up the subject of a contempt hearing if Giuliani doesn't turn over the property he owes.",
      "A jury in December 2023 awarded the pair $148 million in damages for lies Giuliani spread about them after the 2020 presidential election. The massive award sent Giuliani into bankruptcy, and entitled the defamed women to much of what he owns.",
      "Asked by a reporter after Thursday's hearing if he regretted defaming Freeman and Moss, Giuliani exclaimed, \"No!\" He then denied defaming them.",
      "Liman had given Giuliani until Oct. 29 to surrender a long list of possessions, including the Mercedes, two dozen high-end watches, a jersey signed by New York Yankees Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio \u2014 long featured prominently above the fireplace in Giuliani's $5 million apartment \u2014 as well as other furniture and sports memorabilia. The women are also entitled to some $2 million that Giuliani has said President-elect Trump's 2020 campaign owes him.",
      "In another tense moment, Caruso called it \"vindictive\" that Giuliani must turn over a watch that's an heirloom previously owned by his grandfather. Liman raised his voice, saying \"Oh, come on,\" before pointing to other cases he hears regularly, such as people \"who run bodegas and short their employees' wages.\"",
      "\"If they have a debt, they have to pay the debt. It doesn't matter if it's an heirloom.\" Liman said. He later said Moss and Freeman had been willing to let Giuliani keep the watch, but he never filed paperwork asking to do so.",
      "Giuliani was in the passenger's seat of a Mercedes convertible that appeared to be the 1980 classic once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall when he arrived to vote in Florida on Tuesday.",
      "Later that day, a spokesperson for the former New York City mayor and disbarred ex-attorney for Trump seemed to confirm it was the same vehicle, and said they've attempted to turn it over.",
      "In court on Thursday, Kenneth Caruso, a lawyer for Giuliani, said he believed the half century old car could be appraised as being worth less than $4,000. He noted that a court order allows him to keep a vehicle to that value.",
      "Caruso had asked Liman to allow Giuliani to attend the hearing remotely, as he had previously. Caruso said Giuliani is under contract to do evening radio appearances on Thursdays and Fridays. Caruso said Giuliani uses \"broadcasting equipment\" in his Florida home.",
      "Liman rejected that request. On Thursday, he gave lawyers for the women until Nov. 11 to instruct Giuliani on how to turn over his property, and Giuliani four days after to comply.",

      "While many economists expect an additional cut at the Fed's December meeting and more reductions in early 2025, any future moves by monetary policy makers appear more uncertain following the election amid concerns that some of Trump's key economic proposals could stoke inflation.",
      "\"With additional inflation and employment data in, the Fed went 25 basis points as expected.

Trump has been found liable for sexual abuse\u00a0and defamation, and his vice president, former Ohio senator JD Vance, has previously referred to some women as \"childless cat ladies.\" The Harris campaign also ran on a platform of supporting a woman's right to abortion, something that has been jeopardized in many states after the fall of Supreme Court decision\u00a0Roe v.

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's\u00a0defeated\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and although he ran for president three times, this is the last term he can serve.",
      "The Constitution rules that even if the terms aren't consecutive, a person can only hold the office of the president twice.",
      "Here's everything to know about presidential term limits.",
      "How many terms can someone serve as president?",
      "A person can serve two four-year terms as president, as outlined in the Constitution's 22nd Amendment. The terms do not have to be consecutive.",
      "A vice president who serves as president can run for two terms after that service if they held the office of president for less than two years. So if a vice president took the office of president one year into a term, they could only run for office one more time. If they took power in the back half of the term, they could be elected to the presidency twice. In recent history, President Lyndon Johnson took over in 1963 when President John F. Kennedy was killed, making him eligible to run in 1964 and 1968. He ultimately opted not to run in 1968, although he was in the race until after the New Hampshire primary.",
      "The two terms don't need to be consecutive: Until Trump's victory this week, Grover Cleveland was the only president to serve non-consecutive presidential terms.",
      "But this means that Donald Trump, who was elected to office in 2016 and in 2024, cannot be elected president again in 2028.",
      "Has anyone been president for more than two terms?",
      "Only one person has served more than two terms as president: Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was the longest-sitting president in United States history, serving from 1933 to 1945.",
      "That third term led to controversy, according to the National Constitution Center. The nation's first president, George Washington, had established a precedent of only two terms in office per president, and some saw Roosevelt's break from tradition as a threat to democracy.",
      "In 1947, Congress approved the 22nd amendment. The amendment was ratified in February 1951.",
      "How many times can someone run for president?",
      "There's no limit to how many times someone can run for president.",
      "There have been more than a few perennial candidates for president throughout American history. Harold Stassen, a former governor of Minnesota, ran for president as a Republican candidate nine times between 1944 and 1992. Lyndon LaRouche ran for president in eight consecutive elections between 1976 and 2004 \u2014 once as the candidate for the U.S. Labor Party, which he had founded, and seven times as a candidate for the Democratic party.",
      "What Trump has said about term limits",
      "Trump has made a number of comments about term limits and his time in office, although it's unclear if he was serious. In July, he repeatedly told attendees at a conservative Christian event that they wouldn't \"have to vote anymore\" if he was elected to office in 2024. Some saw the comments as a threat to not leave office after a second term.",
      "\"Christians, get out in vote. Just this time,\" he said during a speech at the Believers' Summit, an event hosted by the conservative advocacy group Turning Point Action. \"You won't have to do it anymore. Four more years. You know what? It'll be fixed. It'll be fine. You won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.\"",
      "Trump continued: \"I love you Christians and I'm a Christian. I love you, you got to get out and vote. In four years, you don't have to vote again. We'll have it fixed so good, you're not going to have to vote.\"",
      "Trump has mentioned the idea of a third term more than once. In August 2020, he said he would win that election and then \"go another four years\" because \"they spied on my campaign,\" according to Forbes. A month later, he told crowds he would \"negotiate\" more time in office, saying that he was \"probably entitled to another four after (2020)\" based on \"the way we were treated.\"",
      "In April 2024, Trump told Time magazine that he intends \"to serve four years and do a great job\" and \"wouldn't be in favor\" of an extended term, but during a 2024 speech for the National Rifle Association, Trump asked supporters if he would be considered \"three-term or two-term.\"",

    "summary": "Victims thought to be female were male and not related to one another, showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\" said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\"",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \"the house of the golden bracelet,\" the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\"They have a better overview of what's happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \"We actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\"",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",
      "In August, archaeologists at Pompeii announced they had unearthed the remains of two more victims -- a man and a woman discovered inside what was likely the bedroom of their home, where they'd become trapped as the rest of the structure filled with debris. The woman was found on the bed with a collection of gold, silver and bronze coins, as well as a pair of gold earrings, a pair of pearl earrings and other jewelry.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers won a $700,000 prize for using artificial intelligence to read a 2,000-year-old scroll that was scorched in the Vesuvius eruption.",
      "The Herculaneum papyri consist of about\u00a0800 rolled-up Greek scrolls\u00a0that were carbonized during the 79 CE volcanic eruption that buried the ancient Roman town, according to the organizers of the\u00a0\"Vesuvius Challenge.\"",
      "The scroll's author was \"probably Epicurean philosopher Philodemus,\" writing \"about music, food, and how to enjoy life's pleasures,\" wrote contest organizer\u00a0Nat Friedman\u00a0on social media.",

      "The Dragon's Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from historic launch pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 9:29 p.m. EST Monday, lighting up the night sky for miles around as it climbed away atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust.",
      "After boosting the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the first stage, making its fifth flight, peeled away, reversed course and headed back to an on-target landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station while the second stage continued the climb to space.",
      "The landing marked SpaceX's 57th successful booster recovery at the Florida Space Force station and its 363rd overall, including California flights and droneship landings.",
      "Just under 10 minutes after liftoff, the vacuum-optimized engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage shut down and one minute later, the Dragon was released to fly on its own.",
      "Running slightly ahead of schedule, the cargo ship executed a series of rendezvous rocket firings, catching up with the space station from behind and below before looping up to docking at the lab's forward port at 9:52 a.m.",
      "\"Welcome aboard, Dragon,\" astronaut Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore radioed from inside the station. \"Nice to  have you aboard.\" Station commander Sunita Williams, referring to the  successful docking in general and the food on board in particular,  added: \"Just want to say thank you to SpaceX, the International Space  Station program, the Commercial Crew program for bringing us... honey.\"",
      "One of the first items on the agenda is a test Friday to determine the Cargo Dragon's ability to boost the space station's orbit slightly using its aft-facing thrusters. The ISS is routinely re-boosted by Russian Progress freighters and Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ships, but Friday's test will be a first for SpaceX.",
      "The California rocket builder is under contract to NASA to build a powerful space tug of sorts that can be used to safely drive the ISS back into the atmosphere when the lab complex is retired in the 2030 timeframe. The vehicle is needed to make sure the station breaks up over a stretch of ocean well away from populated areas and shipping lanes.",
      "During the test Friday, the Cargo Dragon's aft thrusters will fire for about 12 minutes.",
      "\"The data that we're going to collect from this reboost and attitude control demonstration will be very helpful, informing SpaceX analyses on how the system performs,\" said Jared Metter, SpaceX director of flight reliability. \"This data is going to lead to future capabilities, namely the US de-orbit vehicle.\"",
      "Reboost aside, the Cargo Dragon is loaded with slightly more than 6,000 pounds of equipment and supplies, including 2,022 pounds of science gear, 2,119 pounds of crew clothing, food and other supplies, 377 pounds of spacewalk equipment, 525 pounds of space station hardware and 44 pounds of computer equipment.",
      "One of the more unusual payloads: Lignosat, a small wooden satellite using a framework of magnolia panels built by researchers at Kyoto University in Japan and the Tokyo-based logging company Sumitomo.",
      "\"While some of you might think that wood in space seems a little counterintuitive, researchers hope that this investigation demonstrates that a wooden satellite can be more sustainable and less polluting for the environment than conventional satellites,\" said Meghan Everett, the ISS deputy project scientist.",
      "\"The main objective here is to determine whether wood can be used in space, and to do this, researchers will measure the temperature and strain of the wooden structure and see how it might change in the vacuum environment of space with atomic oxygen and radiation conditions as well.\"",
      "As with all station-bound Dragon cargo ships, the crew supplies include fresh food and special treats for holiday meals.",
      "Bill Spetch, ISS operations and integration manager, said the \"food kit\" includes \"citrus, apples, sweet onions, blueberries, radishes, etc,\" along with lobster, crab and quail for holiday meals. A variety of cheeses is on board as well as fresh coffee and personal items requested by each crew member.",
      "Mounted in the Dragon's unpressurized trunk section is the Coronal Diagnostic Experiment, or CODEX, an instrument that will be mounted outside the space station to learn more about how charged particles in the solar wind are heated to millions of degrees and accelerated to enormous velocities, affecting Earth's space environment and the rest of the solar system.",
      "Inside the station, the astronauts will have a variety of new experiments and instruments to operate and monitor, including one called ARTEMOSS that will examine how Antarctic moss tolerates the space radiation and microgravity environment to learn more about how plants might be used in future life support systems.",
      "The European Space Agency is sending up a space exposure experiment to learn more about how high-tech materials respond to prolonged exposure to the weightless environment and another experiment to study how organic samples degrade when exposed to unfiltered ultraviolet light from the sun.",
      "And in an experiment that could be particularly useful to future astronauts, a small device known as Nanolab Astrobeat, provided by the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology, will test cold welding technology that could prove useful for repairing leaks or other damage from inside a spacecraft.",

While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",

In September, Trump had vowed not to sell his stake after a lock-up period expired for Trump Media insiders, allowing them to sell for the first time since the stock went public in March.",
      "Trump Media, whose DJT ticker is the same as Trump's initials, has seen extreme volatility on Nasdaq, with its shares swinging wildly on news related to the president-elect. That has prompted comparisons of DJT with meme stocks, or companies that trade on social media buzz rather than financial fundamentals such as revenue and profit growth.",
      "Trump's call for an investigation into trading of the stock highlight potential conflicts of interest between his role as the nation's chief executive and his business interests, with his holdings in the company valued at $3.6 billion as of Friday afternoon. As president, Trump will not only have oversight of many federal agencies, but will also appoint the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency that regulates the securities industry.",
      "Although there's no requirement that presidents sell their financial assets when they take office, most U.S. presidents have opted to put their business holdings into a blind trust,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute. A blind trust is managed by an independent trustee, and the president or other official who created the trust isn't allowed to advise or consult with the trustee on business decisions.",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he chose not to place his company, the Trump Organization, into a blind trust, opting instead to\u00a0hand over management\u00a0of the company to his oldest two sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, along with its longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. (Weisselberg was\u00a0released from jail\u00a0in July after pleading guilty to giving false testimony about the size of Trump's triplex apartment as part of a civil fraud trial.)",
      "Trump's arrangement during his first administration was flagged by some ethics experts as problematic, with former chief White House ethics lawyer Norm Eisen\u00a0writing\u00a0in 2017 that it failed to resolve the conflicts of interest between Trump's business holdings and his role as president.",
      "Trump Media stock price chart",
      "Trump Media has attracted short sellers, or investors who seek to make a profit when a stock tumbles. That drew\u00a0accusations\u00a0from Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman, that these investors have manipulated the stock. Nunes has requested investigations by lawmakers and the Nasdaq stock market, where DJT is listed.",
      "Because of Trump's majority ownership of DJT stock, the stock would likely drop if he sold his shares \"for any reason,\" noted S3 Partners in a November 6 research note.",
      "In his post on Truth Social Friday, Trump said he believes in Trump Media, and refuted claims that he is interested in selling shares.",
      "\"THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SELLING!\" Trump wrote. \"I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements, and who may have done so in the past, be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities.\"",

      "Trump has praised those who breached the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, as \"patriots\" and referred to them as \"hostages\" of a Justice Department \"weaponized\" against him. He has said that those who were arrested as a result of their actions during the Capitol riot should be freed, and he vowed to pardon a \"large portion\" of the more than 1,000 people who have been convicted of or pleaded guilty to crimes stemming from the Jan. 6 attack.",
      "Even before his election victory, defendants were trying to delay their cases, anticipating pardons. At least one defendant invoked Trump's win in an effort to delay proceedings in his case; lawyers for 21-year-old Christopher Carnell said in a filing the day after the election that Trump has \"made multiple clemency promises\" to Jan. 6 defendants and wrote that Carnell is \"expecting to be relieved of the criminal prosecution that he is currently facing when the new administration takes office.\"",
      "They said Carnell \"is now awaiting further information from the Office of the President-elect regarding the timing and expected scope of clemency actions relevant to his case.\" His request was swiftly denied.",
      "At a recent Trump rally in North Carolina, an attendee yelled at Trump to \"pardon the January sixers.\" Trump looked at the man and replied, \"Yeah, it's true.\"",
      "Firing special counsel Jack Smith",
      "Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt recently that he'd fire special counsel Jack Smith, who has brought two federal criminal indictments against him, \"within two seconds\" of becoming president. Smith was appointed independent special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to oversee Trump's federal criminal investigations and cases.",
      "Dispensing with criminal cases against him",
      "The Justice Department and special counsel Jack Smith's office are engaged in active discussions about how to wind down the ongoing federal prosecutions against President-elect Donald Trump, according to two people familiar with the talks.",
      "At the center of the discussions is the Justice Department's longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting president and the need to enable a smooth transition to a second term in the White House for Trump, the sources said.",
      "Experts told CBS News the Justice Department is likely to drop Trump's federal criminal cases. Smith charged Trump with four counts stemming from his conduct after the 2020 election, as he and others sought to overturn his defeat in that race.",
      "That case appeared to be heading for a spring 2024 trial before Trump's lawyers appealed a decision related to presidential immunity to the Supreme Court, which in July concluded former presidents cannot be prosecuted for official acts during their time in office.",
      "In a separate federal criminal case in Florida, Trump was accused of mishandling sensitive government records. The judge dismissed the case in July, ruling Smith had been unlawfully appointed special counsel by the attorney general. Smith has appealed the decision.",
      "If he had been convicted in the federal cases, he could have tried to pardon himself because the Constitution confers broad pardon power. But Trump can't pardon himself from his New York conviction in a case stemming from a \"hush money\" payment because that's a state offense. His sentencing date is set for Nov. 26, but it remains to be seen whether that will go forward.",
      "Trump could simply move to dismiss the cases against him, said Mark Tushnet, a constitutional law scholar at Harvard Law School.",
      "\"He won't have to pardon himself \u2014 as the chief executive and chief law enforcement office of the U.S. government, he can simply order that the prosecutions be dismissed,\" Tushnet said.",
      "In Fulton County, Georgia, Trump's 2020 election interference case has been delayed amid allegations of impropriety against the district attorney. That delay is likely to now be extended.",
      "Lead Trump attorney Steve Sadow told a judge in a hearing last December that proceedings would not be pushed off indefinitely if Trump won the presidency, suggesting 2029 is the year the trial could resume.",
      "Exerting more influence on the Federal Reserve",
      "Trump has given mixed responses on the future of the Federal Reserve chair he appointed in 2018, Jerome Powell. In February, Trump said he wouldn't reappoint Powell.",
      "But after Trump won this year's presidential election, Powell said he would not leave if asked to resign by Trump. Powell's term expires in 2026.",
      "In February, Trump said he had a \"couple of choices\" for Fed chair, but didn't say who those options might be.",
      "Trump has accused Powell of being \"political.\" However, in July, he told Bloomberg Businessweek, \"I would let him serve it out,\" Trump said, and he added, \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\"",
      "Beyond the question of who would lead the Fed is a bigger issue: Trump has previously said he thinks the U.S. president should have more influence on Fed decisions \u2014 a risk to the central bank's historical independence from political meddling, according to experts.",
      "\"I feel the president should have at least a say in there. Yeah, I feel that strongly,\" Trump said in an Aug. 8 press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. \"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman.\"",
      "Trump will expect the Fed to support economic growth by continuing to ease borrowing costs for consumers and businesses while containing inflation. That amounts to a delicate balancing act, given some of the president-elect's key economic policies, like imposing stiff new tariffs, boosting federal spending and deporting undocumented immigrants, could lead to higher prices.",
      "Nominating new Supreme Court justices",
      "Supreme Court justices sometimes try to time their retirements with a presidential administration corresponding to the party of the president who appointed them. When Trump takes office, there will be three justices who were appointed by previous Republican presidents \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Trump nominated the other three members of the conservative wing during his first term \u2014 Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.",
      "Thomas is the longest-serving member of the court, having been nominated by President George H.W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate in 1991. Roberts and Alito were both tapped for the court by President George W. Bush in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Thomas, 76, and Alito, 74, are also the two oldest members of the Supreme Court.",
      "None of those three justices have publicly indicated an interest in leaving the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump's Supreme Court nominations during his first term widened the court's conservative majority from 6-3, and replacing any of the three other members would maintain that ideological split.",
      "Any nominations during Trump's second term would likely be of younger judges who could serve for decades, ensuring a conservative hold on the court for years to come. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were in their 50s when he nominated them, and Barrett was 48.",
      "Trump told CBS News in August that he'd release a list of potential Supreme Court nominees ahead of the election, but that list never arrived.",
      "Deporting undocumented migrants en masse",
      "At his final campaign stop in Pennsylvania before Election Day, Trump again promised to start mass deportations, but acknowledged \"it's terrible to do.\"",
      "\"I don't want to do that. I'm not looking to do that,\" Trump said. \"I think it's terrible to do, but we have no choice.\"",
      "Nearly 80% of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. have been in the country a decade or more, and millions of them work and have families here. A concerted effort to round up, detain and deport people by the millions would not only raise legal and human rights concerns, it would cost billions of dollars a year.",
      "But Trump told NBC News after winning the election that there is \"no price tag.\"",
      "\"It's not a question of a price tag,\" he told NBC, adding, \"We have no choice. When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries and now they're going to go back to those countries because they're not staying here. There is no price tag.\"",
      "Trump has said he may start with deporting undocumented migrants in Springfield, Ohio, and Aurora, Colorado \u2014 two communities targeted by his campaign rhetoric. He said in his debate with Harris that in Springfield, migrants were \"eating the dogs\" and cats, and said of Aurora that it was being overrun by Venezuelan gangs. Local and state officials of both parties disputed Trump's claims.",
      "Rolling back climate and clean energy policies",
      "Trump has long cast doubts on the threat of climate change and prioritized increasing U.S. oil and gas production. \"Drill, baby, drill\" became a refrain at campaign rallies. He has vowed to unlock new lands for drilling, expedite drilling permits and speed up approval of natural gas pipelines.",
      "Trump has also expressed desire to dismantle the Inflation Reduction Act and redistribute any unspent climate funds, which, among other things, support electric vehicle production, EV tax credits, and incentives for battery production and critical mineral mining.",
      "Such a move could prove unpopular with consumers, the automotive industry and even some members of his own party, who have recently supported certain programs funded by the IRA that have brought major manufacturing projects and jobs to conservative districts. Eliminating the individual tax credits for EV could be catastrophic for the automotive industry, which continues to see EV sales numbers grow, and many companies are basing production goals on these growing sales numbers. If the tax incentive is revoked, it would make EVs more expensive and harder to sell.",
      "One of Trump's most prominent backers, billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, has benefitted from EV incentives.",
      "During his first term, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, which included national goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Biden later rejoined the accords.",
      "Trump's record on climate issues has prompted warnings from scientists and climate activists about the accelerating dangers of failing to move rapidly toward clean energy and more sustainable development. \"The science on climate change is unforgiving, with every year of delay locking in more costs and more irreversible changes,\" said Rachel Cleetus, the policy director and lead economist for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS.",
      "Climate advocates say four more years of Trump policies will mean the most robust action to fight climate change will need to be pursued at the state and local level, as well as by the business sector.",
      "Putting vaccine denier Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in charge of health care",
      "Kennedy's name has been floated to oversee a variety of health-related issues in a second Trump administration, including to run the Department of Health and Human Services. It's unclear, though, whether a nomination to a Cabinet position would receive the necessary support from Senate Republicans.",
      "Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, told CNN that the Senate will \"give great deference to a president that just won a stunning, what I think is an Electoral College landslide when all is said is done and a mandate.\"",
      "\"He's being given a mandate to govern, and I think presidents who are given a mandate to govern deserve from the Senate the opportunity to surround themselves with people who are going to execute their policies,\" Rubio said.",
      "Kennedy has spent years promoting false information and fears about vaccines, baselessly linking vaccines to autism long after such claims were disproven. He also falsely claimed COVID-19 was \"ethnically targeted\" to attack certain ethnic groups while sparing Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people \u2014 a conspiracy theory that drew accusations of antisemitism and racism. Kennedy also claimed Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water, a pet project of Kennedy's.",
      "Kennedy has said recently that he doesn't want to take vaccine options away from Americans, but his skepticism of them and conspiracy-laden views on science and medicine alarm public health experts.",
      "Kennedy has also campaigned against pesticide use in agriculture and processed food additives.",
      "During a rally in Henderson, Nevada, Trump suggested Kennedy would \"work on health and women's health,\" and said on election night that Kennedy is \"going to go make America healthy again.\"",
      "In an interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson last week, Trump said Kennedy \"can do whatever he wants,\" adding that he'd like the one-time independent presidential candidate to look at pesticides and vaccines.",
      "\"I want you to take care of the women of this country, the men of this country and the children of this country,\" he said.",
      "When NBC News recently asked Trump if \"banning certain vaccines\" might be on the table, Trump didn't dismiss the idea outright, saying he would make a decision and referred to Kennedy as a talented man with \"strong views.\"",
      "Cutting taxes and business regulations",
      "Trump has said he would boost economic growth through a combination of cutting taxes and eliminating regulations on business. Specifically, he is expected to push Congress to extend the sweeping tax cuts enacted under the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), many of which are set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "Trump has also proposed lowering corporate taxes to 15% from their current level of 21%; reversing a $10,000 deduction cap on state and local property taxes; ending taxes on tipped wages and overtime pay; and eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "If Congress extends the TCJA cuts, income taxes would decline under Trump for Americans of all incomes, but the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to an analysis by the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model.",
      "Overall, Trump's tax cuts would lower federal revenue by $5.8 trillion over the next 10 years, adding to the nation's mounting debt, Penn Wharton estimates. The national debt has grown significantly under both Trump and Mr. Biden in the last eight years.",
      "On the regulatory front, Trump has pledged to remove federal restrictions on fossil fuel production, eliminate red tape in housing construction and ease rules on cryptocurrencies, among other efforts. Investors expect such moves to drive up corporate profits and, in turn, stock prices.",
      "Imposing massive tariff hikes",
      "Trump has said he wants to impose tariffs on all international imports, which economists generally believe will lead to an increase in the price of goods.",
      "Trump pledged to impose 10% across-the-board levies on all products imported to the U.S. from overseas, something he says will protect American jobs and raise more federal revenue, which suggests that he believes that high tariffs would force companies to bring production back to the U.S., creating American jobs, and therefore more taxable revenue.",
      "But most economists say that would likely backfire. Manufacturers would pass costs on to consumers, effectively creating\u00a0 a new tax on Americans. Trump also proposed a levy of 60% or more on Chinese imports \u2014 so, in total, if these tariffs were enacted, a typical middle-class household\u00a0 would face an estimated $1,700 a year in additional costs, according to the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Rolling back protections for LGBTQ+ people",
      "Trump has been inconsistent on questions surrounding LGBTQ rights, but during his first term, he rolled back protections for LGBTQ people \u2014 especially transgender individuals \u2014 and anti-trans rhetoric became a theme of his 2024 campaign. His campaign spent tens of millions on one such high-visibility ad that ran during the World Series, NFL and college football games with the memorable tagline \"\"Kamala is for they/them. Trump is for you.\"",
      "The Trump administration reversed a policy that required schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. His administration banned some transgender people from serving in the military \u2014 a policy that Mr. Biden reversed. And he also tried to repeal health protections for transgender people and sought to end protections for transgender individuals in federal prison, among other policies.",
      "During his campaign, Trump pledged to use his second term to punish doctors who provide gender affirming care for minors and impose consequences for teachers who discuss it with their minor students.",
      "Leaving abortion access to be decided by states",
      "The president-elect's stances on abortion\u00a0have been contradictory in the years since he began running for the presidency. He's touted the Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade, taking credit for appointing three of the justices who joined the majority ruling.",
      "He frequently says the issue should be left up to the states \u2014 some of which have imposed near-total abortion bans. Trump has also pledged not to sign a national abortion ban.",
      "\"My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,\" Trump said in April.",
      "At the presidential debate with Harris, Trump said, \"I'm not signing a ban,\" adding that there's \"no reason to sign a ban because we've gotten what everybody wanted.\" In October, he went further, saying he'd veto a national abortion ban.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates have called for further restrictions on abortion through a law already on the books. They believe the Comstock Act, which concerns the the shipping of materials deemed as \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile,\" could be applied to ban anything used to aid an abortion \u2014 not just the mailing of abortion pills. Trump told CBS News in August that he would not enforce the Comstock Act.",
      "On IVF, another reproductive rights issue that has come to the fore in recent months, Trump has pledged to expand access to the expensive fertility treatments. The pledge came in response to backlash following a ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court that determined that frozen embryos created during the IVF process could be considered children, raising the possibility of infanticide prosecutions if they're destroyed. This prompted clinics in the state to temporarily halt treatments. Democrats have warned that Republicans want to restrict access to the procedures, while blaming the Alabama ruling and threats to fertility treatments in other states on Trump.",
      "Trump announced last month a new plan that would require the federal government to pay for the fertility treatments or require insurance companies to cover costs associated with IVF. He has not said how the government would pay for the high cost of IVF, and the idea of an insurance mandate for IVF treatments runs counter to one of the main pursuits of his first term, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. He did succeed in killing the law's individual mandate through the enactment of his 2017 tax cuts.",
      "Changing U.S. policy on Israel's war with Hamas and Hezbollah",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was among the first foreign leaders to hail Trump's victory.",
      "\"Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America,\" Netanyahu said in a tweet even before Trump's election win was confirmed.",
      "Netanyahu spoke to Trump in a \"warm and cordial\" phone call, his spokesperson said, adding that the two men \"agreed to work together for Israel's security\" and also discussed \"the Iranian threat.\"",
      "Trump has not said how he'll address Israel's still-expanding wars against Iran-backed Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon, but he's suggested he can end the conflagration in the heart of the Middle East quickly.",
      "Netanyahu, under intense domestic and international pressure over his handling of the multi-front war, has relied heavily on Washington, Israel's closest ally, for military and diplomatic backing to continue the fight. He will be urging Trump to keep that vital support coming amid intense international pressure over the humanitarian crises in Gaza and Lebanon, and growing domestic pressure over his handling of the war.",
      "But veteran Israeli diplomat, government adviser and now journalist Alon Pinkas told CBS News ahead of the U.S. election that in his view, Trump is a \"very transactional man\" who fails to understand the complexities of the wars Israel is fighting and the motivation behind them.",
      "\"He's war averse,\" Pinkas said of Trump, adding that the president-elect's isolationist tendencies presented \"a great risk\" for Israel.",
      "Even if Trump were to decide to back away from active support for Israel and essentially let Netanyahu do as he sees fit, without criticism or threats of suspending aid, Pinkas said that wouldn't be enough to ensure Israel's security.",
      "\"If you look at the last six months, about American involvement in intercepting Iranian ballistic missiles in April, in deploying a THAAD missile system in Israel just three weeks ago, in deterring Iran to the best of their ability and providing Israel hardware and munitions that otherwise Israel may not have received,\" said Pinkas, \"it's not enough that they write, the Congress\u2026a blank check of $3.8 billion, which is the annual military aid, and say, 'leave us alone, do with it what you want.' There needs to be active American diplomacy.\"",
      "Pressuring Ukraine to cede ground to Russia to end war",
      "Trump will take over as the U.S. commander-in-chief amid the deadliest conflict on the European continent since World War II. He's said he can end the nearly three-year war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine before he even takes office.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had an \"excellent\" conversation with Trump after the election, adding that they had agreed to \"advance\" cooperation.",
      "But on the campaign trail, Trump never said how he would end the war, and Ukrainians have voiced fear for months that he could do so by curbing the U.S. military and financial support \u2014 already worth more than $50 billion \u2014 which has been a lifeline for the country's defense, and force Zelenskyy to meet Russia's demands to cede occupied territory.",
      "Any fresh attempt to end violence like this is likely to involve peace talks of some kind, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has said repeatedly that the war will not end until the areas his forces have unilaterally and illegally annexed \u2014 around a fifth of Ukraine's territory \u2014 are recognized as part of Russia.",
      "Zelenskyy insists that all of Ukraine's land must be returned, and he's warned repeatedly that allowing Putin to seize ground will embolden the Russian leader, with direct implications for America.",
      "\"This aggression, and Putin's army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they're the NATO members,\" Zelenskyy told CBS News early this year.",
      "Heaping pressure on NATO allies to cough up more cash",
      "There is clear precedent for Trump's stance on the U.S.-led NATO alliance that was born out of the military partnerships formed during World War II. During his first term and since, Trump has made it clear that he feels America's European NATO allies slipped into complacency, relying on their superpower partner for theoretical defense in what had been decades of peacetime.",
      "He demanded publicly, repeatedly that some of America's oldest and closest allies meet their NATO membership commitment to devote at least 2% of their annual GDP to their defense budgets. Trump accused some allies of freeloading - benefitting from the guarantee of NATO's collective defense principle without paying their fair share.",
      "While the European jitters over the Ukraine war are undoubtedly a factor, his reprimands seem to have worked, to some degree. The majority of NATO member states now meet at least the 2% threshold. It's little wonder, perhaps, that the only two countries that devote more than the U.S. to defense, proportionally, are Poland, which borders Ukraine, and Estonia, which borders Russia.",

    "summary": "An Iranian operative told investigators that he was tasked in September with assassinating Trump, according to court records unsealed Friday.",
    "story": [
      "An operative working for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps told federal investigators that he was tasked in September with \"surveilling, and, ultimately, assassinating\" President-elect Donald Trump, according to court records unsealed Friday.",
      "Prosecutors say Farhad Shakeri, who is believed to be residing in Iran, told investigators in a phone interview that unnamed IRGC officials pushed him to plan an attack against Trump last month. If the plan could not come together in time, the Iranian officials directed Shakeri to delay the plot until after the presidential election because the official \"assessed that [Trump] would lose the election,\" charging documents revealed.",
      "Shakeri and two individuals living in the U.S. \u2014 Carlisle Rivera of Brooklyn, New York; and Jonathon Loadholt of Staten Island \u2014 were charged as part of a broad Iran-backed scheme to allegedly surveille and ultimately assassinate individuals inside the U.S. who opposed the Iranian regime.",
      "FBI investigators wrote that Shakeri immigrated to the U.S. as a child from Iran, but was deported in 2008 after serving more than a decade in prison on robbery charges. They alleged the IRGC ultimately used Shakeri to recruit criminal contacts inside the U.S. to carry out specific operations like targeting an unnamed Iranian American journalist and activist living in New York.",
      "In February, prosecutors alleged Shakeri paid Rivera and Loadholt about $1,000 to monitor the activist \u2014 who has spoken out against Iran's regime \u2014 at an event at Fairfield University in Connecticut. The surveillance operations continued into March, according to court documents, when the pair allegedly traveled multiple times to the activist's Brooklyn home. Text messages, security camera footage and cell site location data revealed their numerous trips.",
      "\"On or about April 1, 2024, 9 SHAKERI and RIVERA exchanged voice notes discussing RIVERA and LOADHOLT' s efforts to locate and murder\" the Iranian American, court records said.",
      "\"This b**** is hard to catch, bro,\" Rivera allegedly said to Shakeri. \"There ain't gonna be no simple pull up, unless there['s] the luck of the draw.\"",
      "According to court records, Shakeri allegedly responded later, \"you just gotta have patience and don't, kicking, kick in the door is not an option because that's a fail, that's a fail maneuver. You gotta wait and have patience to catch her either going in the house or coming out, or following her out somewhere and taking care of it. Don't think about going in. In is a suicide move.\"",
      "Investigators searched online accounts belonging to Rivera and Loadholt in the course of the federal probe and uncovered numerous images of firearms and other weapons.",
      "In April, Shakeri agreed to pay Rivera and Loadholt $100,000 to \"finish the work\" and said he was tasked by the IRGC to hire individuals to assassinate the journalist. And by July, according to charging documents, the Iranians were growing impatient, instructing their U.S. assets to \"take care of it already.\"",
      "The alleged plot to kill the activist did not succeed.",
      "Rivera and Loadholt are not accused of being part of the plot to target Trump. They made their initial appearance in federal court on Thursday and were ordered detained, according to the Justice Department. Shakeri remains at large.",
      "\"We will not stand for the Iranian regime's attempts to endanger the American people and America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.",
      "The charges announced Friday are not the first brought against alleged operatives of the IRGC for plotting to kill Trump. Earlier this year, the FBI arrested Asif Merchant for planning to assassinate U.S. government officials, including potentially the president-elect. Merchant remains in custody and pleaded not guilty.",
      "On at least five occasions between September and November, Shakeri participated in \"voluntary telephonic interviews with FBI agents\" in exchange for a sentence reduction for another individual serving time in the U.S, court records said.",
      "During the interviews, he allegedly told the FBI of the IRGC's desire to kill the Iranian American activist and target Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka with a mass shooting event. Shakeri also told investigators that the IRGC tasked him with surveilling two Jewish American citizens living in New York, but he did not provide the Iranian officials with information about the unnamed targets.",
      "During the interview, Shakeri also allegedly told the FBI about the effort to target Trump.",
      "In a statement, FBI Director Christopher Wray said, \"The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \u2014 a designated foreign terrorist organization \u2014 has been conspiring with criminals and hitmen to target and gun down Americans on U.S. soil and that simply won't be tolerated.\"",
      "The charges and allegations announced Friday are part of broader posture by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement to publicly bring attention to Iran's alleged efforts to quiet dissidents on U.S. soil and target U.S. government figures after the killing of IRGC General Qasem Soleimani by American forces in 2020. Trump and former members of his administration have been forced in recent years to increase his security due to the threats.",

Chutkan quickly granted Smith's request and tossed out the remaining deadlines she had set. She ordered the government to submit to her a report \"indicating its proposed course for this case going forward\" by Smith's proposed early-December deadline.",

      "How did the monkeys escape the research facility?",
      "Greg Westergaard, CEO of Alpha Genesis, told CBS News on Thursday that a caretaker inadvertently failed to secure a door at the enclosure, allowing the monkeys to roam free.",
      "\"It's really like follow-the-leader. You see one go and the others go,\" he said. \"It was a group of 50 and 7 stayed behind and 43 bolted out the door.\"",

      "\"We've got them very close,\" Westergaard said. \"This is all like what we want to see.\"",
      "What kind of monkeys are they?",
      "The monkeys that escaped are rhesus macaque primates, which have brown fur with red faces and ears. They have close-cropped hair on their heads, which accentuates their very expressive faces.",
      "The rhesus macaques are Asian, Old World monkeys that are primarily found in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Southeast Asia and China.",

    "summary": "Beloved schoolteacher Mary Catherine Edwards was found murdered wearing police-grade Smith & Wesson handcuffs \u2014 sending ripples through the Beaumont, Texas, Police Department.",
    "story": [
      "On Jan. 14, 1995, Mary Catherine Edwards, 31, a beloved elementary school teacher, was found dead in her townhouse in Beaumont, Texas.",
      "Her parents found her. It was a terrible scene: she was in her bathtub, handcuffed, and had been sexually assaulted. There were no signs of forced entry, which made investigators think she must know her killer. The police-grade Smith & Wesson handcuffs were always a big clue, but when detectives tried tracing the serial numbers, they came up empty. Early investigators questioned various law enforcement officers and came up with nothing either.",
      "The case went cold,\u00a0 \u00a0but as Beaumont Police Det. Aaron Lewallen told \"48 Hours contributor Natalie Morales, \"Could it have been someone that we knew?... It was almost like a ghost story told around the camp fire \u2026\"\u00a0 Morales reports on the search for answers in \"Tracking the Killer of Mary Catherine Edwards,\" airing Saturday, Nov. 9 at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount +.",
      "Thanks to carefully preserved DNA from the crime scene and the advent of genetic genealogy, Det. Aaron Lewallen, his wife Tina Lewallen, also a detective \u2014 along with Brandon Bess, a Texas Ranger in the cold case division, and Shera LaPoint, a professional genealogist \u2014 spent almost three months working together in a nonstop push to finally solve the case.",
      "After all the early leads and the suspicion that someone in law enforcement had been involved, the family tree they constructed revealed someone else. Their chief suspect turned out to be not a law enforcement officer, but a man who went to the same high school as Edwards: Clayton Foreman.",
      "And then they learned that Edwards and her identical twin sister Allison had been bridesmaids in Foreman's first wedding. The sisters were good friends with his first wife, Dianna Coe, who also went to the same high school.",
      "Coe remembers them fondly, telling Morales how kind they were to her when she moved to a new town and started a new school.",
      "\"I was new to the area \u2026 so, I knew no one. And they \u2026 just started talking to me and asked me my name \u00a0\u2026 and we were friends from that point forward,\" Coe said.",
      "The sisters were the first people Coe thought of to be bridesmaids at her wedding. She and Foreman stayed married for 11 years. They were divorced by the time of the murder, but in hindsight, Coe began to see things in a different, darker, light. She remembered her ex-husband's fascination with the police officers and their tools of the trade, like handcuffs and billy clubs. As Coe told Morales, \"He had a billy club that he kept\u2026by the bed. You know, said it was for protection. And I remember that he had ordered those handcuffs ... Well, he had them hung over the rearview mirror.\"",
      "Coe also remembered a disturbing conversation with her ex-husband when she heard Edwards had been murdered and called to talk about it.",
      "\"I think I was, you know, crying and I said, 'oh, my God,' I said, 'somebody has murdered Catherine,\" Coe told \"48 Hours.\" \"And \u2014 and he goes, 'Oh, really?' Just like no emotion, which I thought that was odd.\"",
      "A DNA match quickly established that Foreman had indeed been at the crime scene. And when Det. Aaron Lewallen and Ranger Bess went to question Foreman, they had an arrest warrant. They also brought something with them \u2014 something very symbolic.",
      "Together, they had taken the time to work out an arrangement with the prosecutors so they could use the handcuffs taken as evidence at the crime scene. When they arrested Foreman for the murder of Edwards, they did so with the very handcuffs that had bound her the night she died. He wasn't one of them, but in the course of the investigation, they learned Foreman had been falsely claiming to be a police officer.",
      "The handcuffs \u2014 such a focus in the beginning \u2014 came full circle at the end. Bess will never forget how it felt. As he told Morales, \"It's a moment I'll never forget ... you feel like you got to do something for Catherine there ... You know, like physically got to do for her, is take those cuffs that bound her when she was murdered and put them back on the guy that murdered her ... It may seem small to some, but it was a really big deal to us, and it felt good.\"",
      "The jury in Foreman's murder trial deliberated for less than an hour before finding him guilty of the murder of Edwards. Foreman was sentenced to life in prison.",

      "Slickly designed websites. Unbelievable markdowns. A simple online search for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic or Wegovy, can lead consumers down a rabbit hole of seemingly reputable online pharmacies in search of weight loss drugs at a discounted price. The temptation is clear for many Americans, but some of those deals come with a potentially deadly cost.",
      "U.S. consumers pay higher prices for weight loss drugs than any other country in the world, according to a 2023 KFF study. Cheaper alternatives online, however, are not always what they seem.",

      "\"We've found things like antifreeze and incorrect amounts of active ingredients in these products,\" said Ingrassia.",
      "In September, customs agents in Cincinnati's port inspected 63 shipments containing apparently counterfeit and unapproved medications. That included several boxes containing counterfeit Ozempic, Wegovy and Trulicity injections. Other medications, including Botox and minoxidil, used for hair growth, were also seized by the authorities.",
      "The FDA is taking action",
      "The Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings to multiple online pharmacies selling suspected counterfeit products. The letters demand the sites stop selling the products that are in violation of FDA's standards or face legal action.

      "If the label smears or appears misaligned, it's likely counterfeit. Uneven glue seams, lot numbers with crooked print, and cheap looking colors are also signs the products could be counterfeit, according to Chase.",

      "A federal judge on Thursday struck down a Biden administration program that would allow unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens to get legal status and a streamlined path to U.S. citizenship, declaring the policy illegal.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge J. Campbell Barker, an appointee of President-elect Donald Trump, found the program violates U.S. immigration law, agreeing with a lawsuit filed by Texas and more than a dozen other Republican-led states.",
      "The ruling is a major defeat for the outgoing Biden administration, which argued the policy, known as Keeping Families Together, promoted family unity among mixed-status households. When it was announced earlier this year, officials said roughly half-a-million undocumented immigrants were likely eligible for the program.",
      "The Justice Department can appeal Thursday's ruling, but the Keeping Families Together program is likely to be in the crosshairs of the incoming administration of Trump, who has vowed to dismantle President Biden's immigration policies. Trump has separately promised to seal and militarize the U.S.-Mexico border and oversee the largest mass deportation in American history.",
      "Representatives for the White House and Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Keeping Families Together initiative was announced by Mr. Biden in June, just weeks after he took a different executive action to sharply limit asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The program would give work permits and deportation protections to undocumented immigrants who are married to American citizens and have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years without committing serious crimes.",
      "Most importantly, the policy would also allow these immigrants to apply for permanent residency, also known as a green card. After three years, green card holders married to U.S. citizens can apply for citizenship.",
      "Immigrants who marry U.S. citizens are already eligible for a green card on paper. American immigration law, however, requires those who entered the U.S. illegally to leave the country and re-enter legally to be eligible for a green card. But leaving the U.S. after living in the country unlawfully for some time can trigger a 3 or 10-year exile, prompting many families to refrain from pursuing that option.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 11:54:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Spain is sending a marine research vessel to scan the seafloor off Valencia's coast in hopes of finding vehicles and people missing after devastating flash floods.",
    "story": [
      "Barcelona \u2014 A Spanish research vessel that investigates marine ecosystems has been abruptly diverted from its usual task to take on a new job: Helping in the increasingly desperate search for the missing from Spain's deadly floods. As the dire work continued in the eastern province of Valencia to find the victims of the disaster and clean up the mess left behind, more torrential rain unleashed flash floods farther north along the coast, near Girona.",
      "The 24 crew members aboard the Ram\u00f3n Margalef were preparing Friday to use its sensors and submergible robot to map an offshore area of about 14 square miles \u2014 the equivalent of more than 5,000 soccer fields \u2014 to see if they can locate vehicles that last week's catastrophic floods swept into the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "The hope is that a map of sunken vehicles could lead to the recovery of bodies. Nearly 100 people have been officially declared missing, and authorities admit that is likely more people are unaccounted for, in addition to more than 200 declared dead.",
      "But the severe weather was still causing problems further north in the Catalonia province, where heavy rain triggered severe flash floods Friday in the town of Cadaques, sweeping dozens of cars that had been parked in a  normally dry riverbed through the town and piling them up against a bridge, creating a blockage that worsened the flooding in the town.",
      "There were no reports immediate reports of casualties or major structural damage, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Pablo Carrera, the marine biologist leading the Ram\u00f3n Margalef mission off Valencia's coast estimated that in 10 days his team would be able to hand over useful information to police and emergency services. Without a map, he said, it would be practically impossible for police to carry out an effective and systematic recovery operation to reach vehicles that ended up on the seabed.",
      "\"It would be like finding a needle in a haystack,\" Carrera told The Associated Press by phone.",
      "Many cars became death traps when the tsunami-like flooding hit on Oct. 29.",
      "The boat will join a wider effort by police and soldiers who have expanded their searches for bodies and the missing beyond the devastated towns and streets. Searchers have used poles to probe into layers of mud while sniffer dogs tried to find scent traces of bodies buried in canal banks and fields. They are also looking at beaches that line the coast.",
      "The first area the Ram\u00f3n Margalef is searching is the stretch of sea off the Albufera wetlands, where at least some of the water ended up after ripping through villages and the southern outskirts of Valencia city.",
      "Spanish state broadcaster said Friday that the body of one woman had been found on the beach after she went missing when the rushing water swept through her town of Pedralba, roughly an hour's drive from the coast.",
      "Carrera, 60, is head of the fleet of the research vessels run by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography, a government-funded science center under the umbrella of the Spanish National Research Council.",
      "He boarded the Ram\u00f3n Margalef in Alicante, located on Spain's south coast, from where it will set sail to reach Valencia's waters before dawn Saturday. The plan is to go straight to work with the 10 scientists and technicians and 14 sailors working non-stop in shifts. The boat also helped research the impact from the lava flow that reached the sea from the 2021 La Palma volcano eruption in Spain's Canary Islands.",
      "Finding a body at sea, Carrera said, is highly unlikely. So the focus is on large objects that shouldn't be there.",
      "The boat's submergible robot loaded with cameras can dive to a depth of 60 meters to attempt to identify cars. Ideally, they will try to locate license plates, although visibility could be extremely limited and the cars could be smashed to bits or engulfed in the muck, Carrera said.",
      "In the longer term, he said his team will also evaluate the impact of the flood runoff on the marine ecosystem.",
      "Those findings will contribute to initiatives by other Spanish research centers to study Spain's deadliest floods of the century.",
      "Spain is used to the occasional deadly flood produced by autumn storms. But the drought that has hit the country for the past two years and record hot temperatures helped magnify these floods, scientists say.",
      "Spain's meteorological agency said that the 30.4 inches of rain that fell in one hour in the Valencian town of Turis is an all-time national record.",
      "\"We have never seen an autumn storm of this intensity,\" Carrera said. \"We cannot stop climate change, so we have to prepare for its effects.\"",

    "summary": "Five newly elected councilors in Dawson City, Canada, have refused to swear a mandatory oath of allegiance to Britain's King Charles III.",
    "story": [
      "Toronto \u2014\u00a0A small Canadian town's five recently elected councilors refused to swear an oath of allegiance to Britain's King Charles III during their investiture ceremony on Tuesday, despite it being a legal requirement in the northwestern Yukon territory where Dawson City is located.",
      "Under a regulation in the Yukon's Municipal Act, elected councilors are required to swear an oath of allegiance to the British monarch, who remains the official head of state of Canada despite the colonial-era link no longer giving the king any real power in the country.",
      "The oath of allegiance to the monarch is typically taken by Yukon councilors when they're sworn into office, right after they give the separate oath of office, within 40 days of their election.",
      "If the politicians fail to do so, their election can be declared null and void, resulting in the office being left vacant and potentially leading to a special election, known as a by-election.",
      "Dawson City Mayor Stephen Johnson told CBS News partner network CBC News the decision was made collectively by all the newly elected councilors before the swearing-in ceremony on Tuesday, in support of one new councilor who broached the idea.",
      "\"Early in the morning we all got an email and it was from Darwyn,\" Johnson told CBC News, referring to council member Darwyn Lynn. \"And he said I'm hesitant to sign on to this basically because of background history with [the] Crown and First Nations in Canada.\"",
      "Four of the new councilors present at the meeting on Tuesday did take their oaths of office, with the fifth new member expected to do so after returning from vacation, according to the regional Yukon News outlet. But all five agreed not to take the other oath, pledging allegiance to the British crown.",
      "Yukon Director of Community Affairs Samantha Crosby told the CBC that it's uncommon for a whole group of new councilors to refuse to take the oath of allegiance collectively. She said she'd been in touch with the councilors to find a solution to avoid having to call a by-election for Dawson City that would result in the councilors and the mayor losing their seats.",
      "\"The requirement to swear or affirm the oaths is in the [municipal] act itself, but the prescribed forms are under a regulation within the municipal act,\" Crosby told CBC News. \"So the language that is within the forms is a regulation and not within the actual legislation. To make changes to legislation is a very long process, but to make changes to a regulation is something that can be done in a much quicker fashion.\"",
      "King Charles is the official head of state for a number of former British colonies, including Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Jamaica and many other so-called Commonwealth nations. He and his family have faced mounting criticism from Indigenous communities across the globe, however, highlighting the complex relationship between the former colonial power and communities that were exploited and marginalized to build the British empire of the 19th century.",

      "In October, King Charles was heckled by an Australian lawmaker during a visit to the country and accused of complicity in a genocide of the nation's Indigenous people.",
      "Sen. Lidia Thorpe, a vocal advocate for Indigenous rights who had railed against the British royal family previously, approached the king in Australia's Parliament House after he delivered a speech and shouted at him: \"This is not your country!\"",
      "\"You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us \u2014 our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people,\" Thorpe yelled at Charles and Queen Camilla as they sat on a stage next to Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.",
      "A source close to the king and queen told CBS News after the incident that while Charles \"understands there is always a debate to be had around the role of the monarch, he firmly believes it is a matter for the Australian people to decide.\"",
      "Following the September 2022 death of Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, a poll conducted by the Angus Reid Institute suggested that a majority of people in Canada (52%) opposed recognizing Charles as the country's head of state and favored cutting Canada's formal ties with the monarchy.",

      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada's national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada's security and intelligence community and other government partners.",

      "TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",

    "story": [
      "With former President Donald Trump set to reprise his role as the commander in chief of the world's most powerful military and largest economy as he claims victory in the\u00a0U.S. presidential election, leaders around the world started reacting Wednesday to the reality of a second term in the White House for the businessman-turned-politician.",
      "From enthusiasm voiced by Israel's leader as he wages an expanding, multi-front war to anxiety from some of America's closest, generations-old European allies, the reaction to Trump's election performance started rolling in long before the final votes were counted across the U.S.",
      "Below is a look at how some foreign leaders and governments around the world have taken the news of the American electorate's apparent rebuke of Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party at the polls.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered his congratulations to Trump on Wednesday, calling his election performance \"history's greatest comeback!\"",
      "\"Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America,\" Netanyahu said. \"This is a huge victory!\"",
      "Later Wednesday Netanyahu's spokesperson said the Israeli prime minister had been among the first foreign leaders to call Trump and offer his congratulations personally.",
      "\"The conversation was warm and cordial,\" Netanyahu's office said, adding that the two men had \"agreed to work together for Israel's security\" and also discussed \"the Iranian threat.\"",
      "Despite Trump's criticism of the Israeli leader's handling of the ongoing war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Netanyahu was widely believed to favor the former U.S. leader in the U.S. election. Tension between Washington and Tel Aviv has risen sharply over the last year, with President Biden and others criticising Israel's tactics in its multi-front war with Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East.",
      "The war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that saw the militants kill some 1,200 people and kidnap about 250 others, has now killed more than 43,000 people in the Palestinian territory, according to its Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also significantly ramped-up its assault on Hezbollah, Hamas' fellow-Iranian backed allies in Lebanon. The Israeli offensive there has killed more than 3,000 people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.",
      "The Biden administration has continued pushing for cease-fires on both fronts, to no avail, and demanding that Israel do more to mitigate the devastating impact of the wars on civilians.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",
      "Ukraine's war-time President Volodymyr Zelenskyy congratulated Trump Wednesday for what he called an \"impressive election victory,\" and said he looked forward to \"an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump's decisive leadership.\"",
      "\"I recall our great meeting with President Trump back in September, when we discussed in detail the Ukraine-U.S. strategic partnership, the Victory Plan, and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post, adding that his country was interested \"in developing mutually beneficial political and economic cooperation that will benefit both of our nations.\"",
      "\"I appreciate President Trump's commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs,\" said the Ukrainian leader. \"This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together.\"",
      "Zelenskyy offered no comment on Trump's repeated vows to \"quickly\" end the nearly three-year war that began with Russia's full-scale invasion in early 2022. His government and his commanders on the battlefield have voiced growing concern that Trump could dramatically reduce or even halt the huge American support for Ukraine's military effort to repel Russia's invasion.",
      "Zelenskyy has warned that if the resolve of Ukraine's Western backers crumbles and Russia is allowed to seize Ukrainian territory, the war his country is fighting could spread, with direct implications for Americans.",
      "\"This aggression, and Putin's army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they're the NATO members,\" he told CBS News early this year.",
      "Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n",
      "One of the first foreign leaders to offer congratulations to Trump on Wednesday was one of the very few who openly backed him long before the final votes were cast in the U.S. Hungary's far-right leader Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who's been accused during his decades-long leadership of the eastern European nation of eroding its democratic institutions by giving himself more power and limiting that of the country's courts and civil society institutions, called Trump's apparent success \"a much needed victory for the World!\"",
      "In a message posted on social media, Orb\u00e1n said Trump had pulled off \"the biggest comeback in US political history,\" and he congratulated him on his \"enormous win.\"",
      "Orban has made himself an outsider among European Union leaders by endorsing anti-immigrant policies and maintaining close ties with President Vladimir Putin amid Russia's ongoing invasion of neighboring Ukraine \u2014 all while touting his close ties to Trump.",
      "In a speech over the summer, Orb\u00e1n suggested he had even helped to craft Trump's future statecraft, claiming to have \"entered the policy-writing system of President Donald Trump's team,\" with \"deep involvement there.\"",
      "Russia's President Vladimir Putin",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Trump on Thursday for his presidential win, roughly 36 hours after the results were announced.",
      "Following a speech at an international forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin praised the president-elect for his bravery during the July assassination attempt. \"His behavior at the moment of an attempt on his life left an impression on me. He turned out to be a brave man,\" the Associated Press reported Putin said. He also said Trump's desire to restore relations with Russia and to help end the Ukrainian crisis, \"in my opinion, deserves attention at least.\"",
      "Putin never spoke publicly in favor of either candidate during the U.S. election campaign process.\u00a0Trump has previously lauded\u00a0Putin's leadership.",
      "Leonid Slutsky, who heads the Committee on International Affairs in Russia's State Duma, or parliament, was quoted Wednesday by the country's state-run RIA Novosti news agency as saying a Trump victory offered \"a chance for a more constructive approach to the Ukrainian conflict.\"",
      "\"Can we expect changes in approaches to the role of the U.S. in the Ukrainian conflict, which has been fueled by the Democratic administration since 2014? Judging by the election rhetoric (if it can still be believed), the Republican team is not going to send more and more American taxpayers' money into the furnace of a proxy war against Russia,\" Slutsky was quoted as saying. \"Perhaps there is a chance for a more constructive approach here.\"",
      "Slutsky did not comment on Trump's repeated vows to end the war in Ukraine quickly if reelected \u2014 something European and Ukrainian leaders fear he could do by halting America's vast military support for Kyiv and forcing Ukraine to accept Russia's takeover of significant Ukrainian territory.",
      "Slutsky did predict, however, that if the next American administration does cut off that support, the U.S.-backed Ukrainian government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will fall \"in a matter of months, if not days.\"",
      "In remarks later to journalists in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was unaware of any plans for Putin to congratulate Trump directly, saying the former U.S. leader had made \"quite harsh statements\" about Russia during the campaign and calling the U.S. an \"unfriendly country that is directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state.\"",
      "In a statement issued later, Russia's Foreign Ministry echoed that stance, saying: \"We have no illusions about the elected American President, who is well known in Russia, and the new composition of Congress, where the Republicans, according to preliminary data, are gaining the upper hand. The ruling political elite in the United States, regardless of party affiliation, adheres to anti-Russian attitudes and a line on 'containing Moscow.' This line is not subject to fluctuations in the domestic political barometer in the United States.\"",
      "The ministry said Russia would \"work with the new Administration when it 'settles' in the White House, firmly defending Russian national interests and focusing on achieving all the goals of the special military operation.\"",
      "In his remarks, however, Peskov left room for any change in the U.S. stance during Trump's second term, saying: \"After victory, preparing to enter the Oval Office, sometimes statements take on a different tone.\"",
      "\"We will draw conclusions based on concrete steps and concrete words,\" he said, adding that it would be \"practically impossible\" for Trump to damage U.S. relations with Moscow, as they're \"at their lowest point in history.\"",
      "China's President Xi Jinping and the Foreign Ministry",
      "\"We will continue to view and handle China-U.S. relations in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and cooperation for win-win,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Wednesday. \"We respect the choice of the American people and congratulate Mr. Trump on his election as president.\"",
      "President Xi Jinping spoke Thursday, congratulating Trump on his victory and calling for both nations to find the \"right way to get along\" and reiterating previous statements about the international community expecting the two major powers to \"respect each other (and) co-exist peacefully.\"",
      "The Chinese leader called for ongoing and increasing bilateral dialogue to manage the two countries differences.",
      "Trump has often described China as a primary U.S. adversary, and he's has pledged to continue a tit-for-tat tariff feud with the vast Asian nation.",
      "Under President Biden, the U.S. tightened export controls to try to\u00a0keep some sensitive U.S. technology out of China, and tension between Washington and Beijing had increased for years over China's stance on Taiwan, the democratically ruled island off its east coast that Xi has vowed to bring back under the control of the Chinese government for the first time in about 70 years.",
      "The U.S. is bound by American law to defend Taiwan from any military aggression, but Trump has never committed to doing so in the case of a Chinese invasion.",
      "The bilateral tension has decreased slightly since last year, with lines of communication between Washington and Beijing reopening, but it's unclear how hard Trump will actually push Beijing during his second term \u2014 after recent vows to \"tariff the hell out of that country\" \u2014 and how much that economic war could impact security matters.",
      "Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te",
      "Taiwan President Lai Ching-te offered his \"sincere congratulations\" to Trump on Wednesday, saying he was \"confident that the longstanding\u00a0#Taiwan-#US\u00a0partnership, built on shared values & interests, will continue to serve as a cornerstone for regional stability & lead to greater prosperity for us all.\"",
      "The United States is bound by domestic law to back Taiwan, an island off China's eastern coast that's claimed by Beijing as Chinese territory but which has had its own democratic government for decades, if it faces military aggression.",
      "China's President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under the rule of his Communist Party, by force if necessary, creating one of the most risky global military standoffs on the planet. Chinese and Taiwanese military vessels and aircraft have regularly entered each others' territory in recent months, increasing the tension as U.S. vessels continue \"freedom of navigation\" operations in the region.",
      "During and before the campaign, Trump dodged questions about whether the U.S. would come to the aid of Taiwan if China launched an invasion with him in the White House. In a July interview with The Associated Press,\u00a0he said\u00a0Taiwan should pay the U.S. more for helping ensure its defense.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that Trump's reelection was \"no cause for concern\" for Mexico, despite the president-elect's recent threat to impose a massive 25% tariff on Mexican imports unless her government halts what he called an \"onslaught of criminals and drugs\" coming across the southern U.S. border.",
      "\"We are a free, independent, sovereign country and there will be good relations with the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, adding that she felt it was \"prudent to wait\" to extend congratulations to the U.S. election winner until the official results were announced.",
      "\"For all Mexicans, there is no cause for concern, for our countrymen and women [in the U.S.], for their relatives who are here, for Mexican businesswomen and businessmen, there is no cause for concern,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer did his best Wednesday, despite a clear delineation between his own policies and those expected of another Trump administration, to maintain the decorum of the storied \"special friendship\" between the two nations.",
      "In a social media post, Starmer offered his congratulations to Trump \"on your historic election victory,\" adding that he looks forward to \"working with you in the years ahead.\"",
      "\"As the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defense of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise,\" said Starmer, who came to power only months ago as Britain's left-leaning Labour Party won national elections in a landslide after a decade and a half of Conservative Party rule.",
      "\"I know that the US-UK special relationship will continue to prosper on both sides of the Atlantic for years to come,\" added Starmer.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron",
      "\"Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump,\" France's President Emmanuel Macron said in a brief statement posted on social media Wednesday. He declared his administration \"ready to work together\" again as it did during Trump's first term in office, \"with your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.\"",
      "But an hour later, the French president issued another statement that hinted at the concerns he and many of his European colleagues are likely to share about Trump's commitment to the transatlantic NATO alliance, America's future backing of Ukraine in the war with Russia, and his stance on foreign import tariffs.",
      "In his second tweet, Macron said he had just spoken with German Chancellor Olaf Sholz, and that the leaders of the EU's two biggest economies had agreed to \"work towards a more united, stronger, more sovereign Europe in this new context. By cooperating with the United States of America and defending our interests and our values.\"",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte",
      "\"I just congratulated @realDonaldTrump on his election as President of the United States,\" said NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on Wednesday, adding in his social media post that Trump's \"leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through #NATO.\"",
      "Trump has criticized many of the NATO alliance's European members for failing to commit at least 2% of their national GDPs to their defense budgets.",
      "Trump shocked many of America's closest allies during and after his first term by openly criticizing\u00a0their funding commitments, and during the 2024 presidential campaign he said calling on allies to increase their defense spending would be a policy he aggressively pursued if reelected.",
      "In May, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said \"Trump got our allies to increase their NATO spending by demanding they pay up,\" and that if reelected, \"he will restore peace and rebuild American strength and deterrence on the world stage.\"",
      "Iran's government and people",
      "Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran's ruling Islamic regime, appeared on the country's state-run TV network IRIB Wednesday and was quoted as dismissing the potential impact of Trump's election victory amid her country's standoff with the West over its support for armed proxy groups across the Middle East and its nuclear program.",
      "\"The election of the U.S. President is not relevant to us,\" she said according to a translation of her remarks on state media. She said the policies of both the U.S. and Iran were \"fixed and do not change with the change of individuals,\" and said there would be be no \"impact on people's livelihoods\" in Iran regardless of who occupies the White House.",
      "Iran's economy has been decimated by a huge regime of U.S. and international sanctions imposed initially over its alleged nuclear weapons development \u2014 which the country denies \u2014 and extended over its support for U.S.-designated terror groups such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "During Donald Trump's first term in office, he unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of an international nuclear pact negotiated by his predecessor that was intended to keep Iran's atomic work in check in exchange for an easing of sanctions. He adopted a hard line instead, re-imposing sanctions to the consternation of America's European allies who helped broker and co-signed the deal.",
      "Iran has since ramped up its nuclear work, and there has been mounting concern this year that its backing for the so-called proxy groups across the Mideast could lead to a full-scale war with Israel, with the potential to draw in the U.S. as Israel's closest ally.",
      "Despite the government's claim that there would be no impact on Iranians, the value of the country's currency, the rial, slipped on Wednesday to its lowest ever value.",
      "Traders in Tehran told The Associated Press that the rial was trading at 703,000 to the dollar, though there could be further fluctuations over the course of the day.",
      "One resident of Iran's capital told the AP he had no doubt that Trump \"will intensify the sanctions.\"",
      "\"Things that are not in our favor will be worse,\" 22-year-old student Amir Aghaeian told the AP. \"Our economy and social situation will surely get worse... I feel the country is going to blow up.\"",
      "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, and Gaza residents",
      "Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian Authority that administers the Israeli-occupied West Bank, congratulated Trump on his reelection and wished him success.",
      "In his message, posted Wednesday on the website of the Authority's\u00a0news agency WAFA, Abbas expressed hope to work with Trump for peace and security in the region, stressing the Palestinian people's commitment to the pursuit of \"freedom, self-determination and statehood, in accordance with international law.\"",
      "\"We will remain steadfast in our commitment to peace, and we are confident that the United States will support, under your leadership, the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people,\" he said, addressing Trump.",
      "While nearly two-thirds of Israelis polled by the Israel Democracy Institute before election day in the U.S. said they believed Trump would be a better American leader for Israel's interests, the sentiment in Gaza, where Abbas' Fatah movement hasn't held any power in many years, was less focused on who would win, and more on surviving the war.",
      "A woman living amid the rubble in Gaza told CBS News this week that they just want the bombs to stop falling, and many were doubtful that a change in U.S. leadership could precipitate that.",
      "\"For me, Republicans or Democrats are the same thing,\" Gaza resident Firas Abu Firas said before election day. \"They are two faces on the same coin.\"",
      "Hamas reacts",
      "Basem Naim, a long-time senior figure in the Hamas regime that ruled over the Palestinian Gaza Strip for almost two decades before the group sparked the ongoing war with Israel with its unprecedented terrorist attack more than a year ago, called Trump's reelection, \"a private matter for the Americans,\" but said in a statement Wednesday that \"Palestinians look forward to an immediate cessation of the aggression against our people, especially in Gaza, and look for assistance in achieving their legitimate rights of freedom, independence, and the establishment of their independent self sovereign state with Jerusalem as its capital.\"",
      "International diplomatic efforts toward a so-called \"two-state solution,\" which would see an independent state of Palestine created alongside Israel, have all but vanished amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "U.S. administrations from both sides of the political aisle have pushed for such a solution to the nearly seven-decade crisis in the heart of the Middle East, but with the current Israeli administration firmly opposed to the notion of Palestinian statehood, most Palestinians saw little reason for hope regardless of who won the U.S. election.",
      "European Union's Ursula von der Leyen",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Union bloc's governing body, the European Commission, congratulated Trump on Wednesday and iterated her hope in a brief\u00a0social media post\u00a0that the U.S. and EU could \"work together on a strong transatlantic agenda that keeps delivering\" for citizens on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "\"I warmly congratulate Donald J. Trump. The EU and the US are more than just allies,\" Von der Leyen said. \"We are bound by a true partnership between our people, uniting 800 million citizens. So let's work together on a strong transatlantic agenda that keeps delivering for them.\"",
      "Italian premier Giorgia Meloni",
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni congratulated Trump Wednesday, lauding what she called \"unshakeable\" ties between the U.S. and Italy.",
      "\"Italy and the United States are 'sister' nations, linked by an unshakeable alliance, common values and a historic friendship. It is a strategic bond which I am sure we will now strengthen even more,\" Italy's far-right leader wrote in a statement posted to social media.",

      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan congratulated \"my friend Donald Trump\" Wednesday with a message posted on social media.",
      "The leader of the sometimes contentious NATO ally, who's taken a strong stance against Israel's handling of the ongoing wars with Hamas and Hezbollah, voiced his hope that \"Turkey-US relations will strengthen, that regional and global crises and wars, especially the Palestinian issue and the Russia-Ukraine war, will come to an end.\"",
      "\"I believe that more efforts will be made for a more just world,\" said Erdogan. \"I hope that the elections will be beneficial for our friendly and allied people in the United States and for all of humanity.\"",

      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro",
      "Colombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro congratulated Trump on Wednesday and lauded the U.S. democratic process, which he said would be respected, but took the opportunity also to challenge the president-elect's vows to close the U.S. border to undocumented migrants as unrealistic.",
      "\"The only way to seal the boarders is through the prosperity of the communities of the south and the end of blockades,\" he said.",
      "Petro also alluded to concerns that Trump will lead the world's biggest economy further away from goals to address man-made climate change, saying the dialogue between the global north and south continues, \"and the reality of the climate collapse will force us to rally around a solution.\"",
      "Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva",

      "In a statement, the Taliban's foreign ministry voiced hope that \"the incoming U.S. administration will adopt a pragmatic approach to ensure tangible advancement in bilateral relations, allowing both nations to open a new chapter of relations grounded in mutual engagement.\"",
      "The Taliban, whose rule over Afghanistan has not been formally recognized by the U.S. or most other nations, noted Trump's role in getting the 2020 Doha Agreement peace deal and said \"it is expected that Mr. Trump will assume a constructive role in ending the current conflicts in the region & globally, particularly the ongoing brutality & aggression in Gaza & Lebanon.\"",

      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",
      "Most social media companies have policies that bar children under the age of 13 from setting up accounts, but a 2022 study conducted by the U.K.'s media regulator Ofcom found that nearly 80% of children in the country had social media accounts by the age of 12.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 13:50:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Victims thought to be female were male and not related to one another, showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\" said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\"",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \"the house of the golden bracelet,\" the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\"They have a better overview of what's happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \"We actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\"",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",
      "In August, archaeologists at Pompeii announced they had unearthed the remains of two more victims -- a man and a woman discovered inside what was likely the bedroom of their home, where they'd become trapped as the rest of the structure filled with debris. The woman was found on the bed with a collection of gold, silver and bronze coins, as well as a pair of gold earrings, a pair of pearl earrings and other jewelry.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers won a $700,000 prize for using artificial intelligence to read a 2,000-year-old scroll that was scorched in the Vesuvius eruption.",
      "The Herculaneum papyri consist of about\u00a0800 rolled-up Greek scrolls\u00a0that were carbonized during the 79 CE volcanic eruption that buried the ancient Roman town, according to the organizers of the\u00a0\"Vesuvius Challenge.\"",
      "The scroll's author was \"probably Epicurean philosopher Philodemus,\" writing \"about music, food, and how to enjoy life's pleasures,\" wrote contest organizer\u00a0Nat Friedman\u00a0on social media.",
      "The scrolls were found in a villa thought to be previously owned by Julius Caesar's patrician father-in-law, whose mostly unexcavated property held a library that could contain thousands more manuscripts.",

      "After President-elect Donald Trump's victory against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election was driven in part by young male voters, some are calling for the use of South Korea's \"4B Movement\" in the United States.",
      "The presidential election was seen by many as a referendum on women's rights. Trump has been found liable for sexual abuse\u00a0and defamation, and his vice president, former Ohio senator JD Vance, has previously referred to some women as \"childless cat ladies.\" The Harris campaign also ran on a platform of supporting a woman's right to abortion, something that has been jeopardized in many states after the fall of Supreme Court decision\u00a0Roe v. Wade, which Trump has taken credit for.",
      "Now, some women are swearing to abide by the code of the \"4B movement,\" a South Korean feminist approach that swears off men. Here's what to know about the 4B movement.",
      "What is the 4B movement?",
      "In short, the 4B movement is a vow to swear off men. It is called the 4B movement because in Korean, the four tenets each begin with bi, which means no, according to a paper published by two South Korean researchers at Yonsei University's Institute of Humanities.",
      "The movement specifically calls for the refusal of dating men (biyeonae), sexual relationships with men (bisekseu), heterosexual marriage (bihon), and childbirth (bichulsan) in response to what South Korean women see as a patriarchal and misogynistic culture. The movement is also known as the \"4 Nos.\"",
      "The 4B movement began in 2017 and gained more attention in 2019, amid a\u00a0#MeToo-style reckoning in South Korea. Much of the movement has been built online, where participants call themselves \"anonymous women\" and share few personal details. It has no official leadership structure.",
      "Women in the nation have fought against what Human Rights Watch calls \"shockingly widespread\" gender-based violence and called for harsher penalties for what's called \"spy cam porn.\" They have also criticized the country's extreme gender wage gap, which saw women paid 31.2% less than men in 2022, according to the KoreaTimes, and called out hiring discrimination and harassment in the workplace.",
      "What impact has the 4B movement had in South Korea?",
      "The 4B movement has been controversial in South Korea. The country's president Yoon Suk-yeol said in 2021 that feminist movements were \"blocking healthy relationships\" between men and women in the nation.",
      "The nation has been battling a declining birth rate for several years, which some credit to the 4B movement, according to The New York Times.",
      "The 4B movement in the United States",
      "After Trump's election victory on Tuesday, women on social media have expressed interest in following the \"4 Nos\" of the movement. Trump made strong inroads with young men under 30, according to exit polls from CBS News.",
      "Since the election, multiple far-right figures have made alarming statements about women's rights on social media. White nationalist Nick Fuentes, who dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, wrote \"Your body, my choice. Forever.\" in a widely-criticized post on X. Similar posts have percolated across social media.",
      "In response, women have called for an American version of the 4B movement. Use of the phrase on social media and in searches has skyrocketed. Some have also referenced \"Lysistrata,\" a Greek comedy where women take part in a sex strike to convince the men in their lives to end a war.",

    "story": [
      "Berlin\u00a0\u2014   German authorities have detained a U.S. citizen on suspicion of attempting to pass sensitive information about American military operations in Germany to Chinese intelligence agencies. The suspect has been identified only as Martin D., under German privacy laws. He is a 37-year-old former civilian contractor employed by the U.S. military who was arrested by the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) Thursday morning in Frankfurt, according to the Federal Prosecutor's Office.",
      "The case is being investigated by the federal prosecutor's office, which ordered the arrest on a warrant issued on Oct. 30 by a federal judge.",
      "\"Due to a pressing suspicion, the accused stands charged with offering himself as an agent to a foreign intelligence service,\" the prosecutor's office said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Martin D. is accused of contacting Chinese government authorities earlier this year, offering to share confidential information he acquired during his work with the U.S. military in Germany. His former employment involved working as a civilian contractor for a private firm that provided services to American forces based in the central state of Hessen, where Frankfurt is located.",
      "Investigators believe Martin D. initiated contact with Chinese intelligence operatives, proposing to hand over classified information about the U.S. military presence and operations within Germany. The prosecutor's statement said he was \"urgently suspected of having expressed a willingness to conduct intelligence activities for a foreign intelligence service.\"",
      "In response to a potential national security threat, German counter-intelligence launched an investigation, with the BKA leading the operation. Martin D.'s residence was searched as part of the operation but authorities have not said what, if any, materials were seized.",
      "The investigation was launched based on initial information gathered by Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), which has been increasing vigilance against foreign intelligence activities within the country.",
      "The arrest comes amid growing concern in Western capitals about espionage and sabotage activities by foreign powers, particularly China and Russia. Just days ago, a source familiar with the matter  that American and European law enforcement agencies were jointly investigating whether incendiary devices that detonated in July at DHL logistics hubs in Germany and the U.K. were part of a larger operation directed by Russia's military intelligence agency.",
      "Martin D. was scheduled to be brought before a judge at the German Federal Court of Justice Thursday. The judge was to formally present the arrest warrant and decide whether the accused can be held in pre-trial detention.",
      "Several people have been arrested in Germany this year and accused of spying for China. In April, federal prosecutors detained three Germans in D\u00fcsseldorf and Bad Homburg who have been accused of passing military technology information. Another high-profile case involved the arrest of a former assistant to far-right AfD party politician Maximilian Krah, who's accused of sharing EU Parliament data and surveilling Chinese dissidents in Germany.",
      "In early October, a Chinese woman working for a logistics company at Leipzig/Halle Airport was also detained on suspicion of espionage. She is accused of providing the former Krah associate with information about flights, cargo and passengers, particularly regarding military goods and individuals linked to a German defense firm.",

      "The bodies were found late Wednesday after police received a tip about an abandoned pickup truck on the main thoroughfare of the city of Chilpancingo, the state capital, prosecutors said in a news release. The city of 300,000 has been the scene of gruesome drug gang violence as two rival cartels fight for control of the area.",

The thinking was that social programs, not shootouts, would gradually drain the pool of cartel gunmen.",
      "Now, a month into the term of new President Claudia Sheinbaum, a string of bloody confrontations suggests the government is quietly abandoning the \"no bullets\" part of that strategy and is much more willing to use the full force of the military and the militarized National Guard.",
      "But the challenge Mexico now faces is different from that during the country's 2006-2012 drug war. Cartels today are more diversified, more deeply entrenched in migrant smuggling and more willing to use foreign recruits and adolescents to fill their ranks.",
      "All of that has led to a string of violent clashes in which security forces who shoot at suspected drug cartel convoys wind up killing bystanders and migrants, and reporting lopsided death tolls in which soldiers aren't harmed but most of the suspects are wiped out.",
      "Sheinbaum has studiously avoided using the \"hugs, not bullets\" slogan popularized by her predecessor and mentor, L\u00f3pez Obrador. She has, after all, pledged to continue each and every one of L\u00f3pez Obrador's policies. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "The EPA said it looked at \"several possible causes, such as a shipping spill or wastewater outflow,\" but that due to \"the complex composition of the balls and the time they have spent in the water, testing has not been able to confirm their exact origin.\"",
      "It said the regional water company, Sydney Water, reported \"no issues with the operation or maintenance\" at two nearby treatment facilities when asked soon after the balls appeared. A review of data by the state maritime meteorological agency yielded \"nothing conclusive\" about where they might have washed up from.",
      "While the EPA said it was waiting for the final results of its tests on the mystery balls, the agency has separately been pushing for greater efforts to clean up the Sydney area, which it warned was quickly filling up with residents' trash.",
      "\"Greater Sydney is on the brink of a waste crisis, with landfill space expected to run out by 2030 unless urgent action is taken,\" the EPA said in a Nov. 1 social media post, heralding a Circular Economy Summit of government, industrial and environmental officials \"to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the NSW waste sector.\"",
      "Officials explained that the concept of a circular economy is one that \"keeps products and materials in use for as long as possible and reduces the need for new materials,\" to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills \u2014 waste that, if it overwhelms the available landfill space, could be washed into water ways and then carried into the ocean.",
      "The black balls first started showing up on the Coogee and Gordon's Bay beaches near Sydney in mid-October, the local mayor said at the time, suggesting they could be tar balls, which often form at sea after an oil spill or leak.",
      "Authorities closed those beaches, along with Sydney's famed Bondi Beach and several others in the area, while cleanup operations continued. All the beaches were reopened after several days, based on authorities saying there were few or no more balls washing up, and a determination that they were \"not highly toxic to humans.\"",

      "Climate scientists working at the European Union's\u00a0Copernicus Climate Change Service\u00a0have announced that 2024 is \"virtually certain\" to be the warmest year on record.",
      "According to its ERA5 dataset, the agency said it was \"virtually certain\" that the annual temperature for 2024 will be more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, and it will likely be more than 1.55 C above.",
      "For decades, scientists have warned that average global temperatures should not get any higher than 1.5 C above pre-industrial times in order to prevent deadly weather conditions that could impact people worldwide.",
      "The world has already warmed considerably and has seen the effects with back-to-back heat waves, droughts and\u00a0unprecedented flooding and hurricane events. The way farmers are able to grow food has already started to shift, and with\u00a01.5 to 2 degrees Celsius of warming, agricultural yields will decline and sea levels could rise up to 10 feet, researchers have found. Experts say the oceans will also be warmer, fueling more powerful hurricanes and threatening ecosystems that are fundamental for economies and help protect areas from inclement weather.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records and should serve as a catalyst to raise ambition for the upcoming Climate Change Conference, COP29,\" said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, in a statement.",
      "The Copernicus Climate Change Service said the average global temperature anomaly for the first 10 months of 2024 (January to October) is 0.71 C above the 1991-2020 average, which is the highest on record for this period and 0.16 C warmer than the same period in 2023.",
      "\"The average temperature anomaly for the rest of 2024 would have to drop to almost zero for 2024 to not be the warmest year,\" the agency said.",
      "The agency added that given that 2023 was 1.48\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level according to its ERA5 model, it was also likely that the annual temperature for 2024 will be more than 1.55\u00b0C above.",
      "European temperatures were above average over almost all of the continent, Copernicus found. Outside Europe, temperatures were most above average over northern Canada, and well-above average over the central and western United States, northern Tibet, Japan and Australia.",
      "The agency also said Arctic sea ice reached its fourth lowest monthly extent for October, at 19% below average. Sea ice extent is a measure of the surface area of the ocean which is covered by ice.",
      "Sea ice concentration anomalies were well below average in all peripheral seas of the Arctic Ocean, particularly in the Barents Sea, Canadian Archipelago, and north of Svalbard, the agency said.",
      "Antarctic sea ice extent was 8% below average in October, which was the second-lowest such average behind only October 2023, when it was 11% below average, Copernicus said. Those numbers continued \"a series of large negative anomalies observed throughout 2023 and 2024.\"",
      "The Copernicus Climate Change Service, which is funded by the EU, routinely publishes monthly climate bulletins reporting on changes observed in global surface air and sea temperatures, sea ice cover and hydrological variables. All the reported findings are based on computer-generated analyses and the ERA5 dataset, which uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.",
      "In a\u00a0report\u00a0published last month, the United Nations warned that the world is now in \"climate crunch time\" as greenhouse gases \u2014 which trap heat in the atmosphere that warms global temperatures and fuels more extreme weather events \u2014 have hit \"unprecedented levels.\"",
      "\"The numbers paint a clear picture,\" the U.N. said. \"To keep emissions below the\u00a0critical 1.5-degree target\u00a0set in Paris in 2015, countries must cut emissions by 42 percent overall by 2030 and achieve a 57 percent reduction by 2035.\"",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A military judge has ruled that plea agreements struck by alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants are valid, voiding an order by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to throw out the deals, a defense official confirmed to CBS News Thursday.",
      "The New York Times and Associated Press were first to report the news.",
      "The official spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the order by the judge, Air Force Col. Matthew McCall, has not yet been posted publicly or officially announced.",
      "The plea agreements would spare Mohammed and the others the risk of the death penalty in exchange for guilty pleas in the long-running 9/11 case. Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense attorneys under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, had approved them.",
      "Outcry over plea deal for 9/11 defendants",
      "The plea deals in the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people spurred immediate political blowback by Republican lawmakers and others when announced in late July.",
      "The agreements, and Austin's attempt to reverse them, have been one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays and legal difficulties, including years of ongoing pretrial hearings to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants given their years of torture in CIA custody.",
      "Within days of the deals becoming public this summer, Austin issued a brief order saying he was nullifying them. Plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary, Austin said at the time.",

      "Military officials have yet to post the judge's decision on the Guantanamo military commission's online site.",
      "However, a legal blog that long has covered the prosecutions from the Guantanamo courtroom said McCall's 29-page ruling concludes that Austin lacked the authority to toss out the plea deals.",

The hurricane made landfall at 4:15 p.m. with maximum sustained winds near 115 mph, the National Hurricane Center said.",
      "Millions of Cubans were without power in October, which prompted the government to implement emergency measures to slash demand, including suspending classes, shutting down some state-owned workplaces and canceling nonessential services. Cubans without power resorted to cooking with improvised wood stoves on the streets before the food went bad in refrigerators as they waited for the power to go back on.",
      "The outage was the latest in a series of problems with energy distribution in a country where electricity has been restricted and rotated to different regions at different times of the day. Various power installations in the country were damaged by Hurricane Ian leaving some homes without electricity for up to eight hours a day. The October blackout was considered to be Cuba's worst outage in two years and power authorities took days to restore power for about 2 million people.",
      "The U.S. State Department issued an advisory for Cuba on Tuesday afternoon, offering departure flights to non-essential staff and American citizens, and advising others to \"reconsider travel to Cuba due to the potential impact of Tropical Storm Rafael,\" before the storm grew into a hurricane.",

      "For the last 17 years, a worldwide army of online sleuths obsessively tried to figure out the title of what has been dubbed \"the most mysterious song on the internet.\"",
      "Now, they have the answer after a chance discovery by one intrepid researcher who triumphantly reported his breakthrough on online forum Reddit: it is called \"Subways of Your Mind\"\u00a0and was recorded by a little-known 1980s German band called FEX.",
      "The former band members are \"absolutely overwhelmed\" by the news, 68-year-old Michael Haedrich, who played keyboard and guitar and sang back-up vocals for FEX, told Der Spiegel magazine.",
      "The band had been oblivious to the online phenomenon, he admitted.",
      "How the mystery unfolded",
      "The mystery began in 2007, when a German brother and sister uploaded a track online that they had digitized after originally recording it as teenagers on a cassette from the radio. As Rolling Stone\u00a0reported in 2019, the tape mostly featured songs from popular bands like XTC and The Cure, as well as one particular song that remained a mystery \u2014 until now.",
      "The German siblings asked for help to identify it and audiophiles soon took up the challenge.",
      "The track did not show up in any music databases, but online sleuths tried to work out what instruments could be heard and analyzed the lead singer's accent.",
      "Initial attempts to identify the song, soon classified by many as being in the 1980s' \"New Wave\" genre, yielded little.",
      "It was only when the track was uploaded onto Reddit in 2019 that global interest exploded.",
      "A Reddit subforum called \"r/TheMysteriousSong\" attracted tens of thousands of members, and the hunt was reported on in German media and beyond.",
      "The big breakthrough finally came earlier this week when a user called \"marijn1412\" said he had identified the song as \"Subways of Your Mind.\"",
      "He said he came across former FEX members while researching an event for up-and-coming bands that had been organized in the 1980s by a public broadcaster in northern Germany.",
      "The Reddit user wrote that he had reached out to members of what was a four-piece outfit from the northern city of Kiel, who sent him a version of the mystery song, and revealed its long-sought-after name.",
      "Marijn1412 wrote: \"After I emailed him back that the song is actually quite a famous 'lost song,' he asked me not to go public with it until he spoke with his old band members. In the meantime, though, the song did get registered at [the German performance rights organization] GEMA and people found out about it. But I'm happy to say that the band members agreed for me to go public with it.\"",
      "Haedrich, who is still a musician, told Spiegel that it was the first time he had heard about the massive search effort.",
      "\"I thought it was amazing that someone was interested in music by a band that was only successful regionally, if at all, and that was over 40 years ago,\" he said.",
      "Haedrich, who lives in Munich, said the band members now want to reissue \"Subways of Your Mind\" and are trying to track down the original recording of the song.",
      "Their success may have been decades in the making, but he said \"for us, it has just come suddenly.\"",

The storm had weakened somewhat since making landfall Wednesday, and by Thursday it had changed directions over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and was moving away from Cuba, according to the National Hurricane Center.",
      "The exact magnitude of Rafael's\u00a0impact on Cuba remained unclear Thursday afternoon. Cuban Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz reported \"major damages\" in Havana and two provinces in the surrounding region, but he did not provide details about the damages. Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel separately said the government had not confirmed any deaths linked to Rafael.",

      "Forecasters expected Rafael to weaken more while moving over the Gulf. Cuba could continue to see rainfall linked to the storm, they warned, with additional rain of 2 to 4 inches likely for western parts of the island. If that happens, the total accumulation linked to Rafael could amount to a foot of rain in some areas.",

      "In October, the island was hit by a one-two punch. First, Cuba was roiled by island-wide blackouts stretching on for days, a product of the island's energy crisis. Shortly after, it was slapped by another powerful hurricane that killed at least six people in the eastern part of the island.",
      "It stoked discontent already simmering in Cuba amid an ongoing economic crisis, which has pushed many to migrate from Cuba.",
      "While the State Department issued a travel warning for Cuba because of the storm, the Cuban government also raised an alarm, asking citizens to hunker down.",
      "Classes and public transport were suspended on parts of the island and authorities canceled flights in and out of Havana and Varadero. Thousands of people in the west of the island were evacuated as a preventative measure, and many more, like Silvia P\u00e9rez, a 72-year-old retiree living in a coastal area of Havana, scrambled to prepare.",

It is among eight hurricanes in the last 30 years that developed during the month of November and went on to reach major hurricane strength, said Nolan. Three of those eight hurricanes eventually made landfall in the U.S., but, by then, they were no longer major hurricanes.",

      "Navy ships arrived to intercept the boat, which was carrying 102 packages filled with bricks of cocaine, authorities said in a news release.",
      "The craft, of a type known as \"go-fast boats,\" was powered by two outboard motors and appeared to be a low-profile, semi-submersible craft -- commonly known as a \"narco sub\" -- designed to make detection more difficult.",
      "Aboard the craft, the Navy detained nine crew members, six of whom were foreigners. The Navy did not specify their nationalities, but many of the boats found off Mexico have Colombian or Venezuelan crew members.",
      "Officials released an image of numbered packages containing the cocaine flanked by two naval ships.",
      "Cocaine is produced in South America and is usually shipped through the Pacific or the Caribbean to reach the U.S. market.",
      "The seizure comes just weeks after the Mexican navy announced it had seized more than 8.3 tons of drugs in the Pacific Ocean, a record for a single operation at sea. The cargo was intercepted from six different vessels, including a \"narco sub\" that held about 4,800 pounds of narcotics.",
      "The Navy said Tuesday that more than 15,000 kilograms of alleged drugs have been seized at sea under the current administration.",
      "Earlier this year, Mexico's Navy seized more than seven tons of suspected cocaine in two separate raids in the Pacific Ocean, and\u00a0dramatic video\u00a0captured the high-speed chases on the open sea.",
      "In September, the U.S. Coast Guard said that it had offloaded more than $54 million worth of\u00a0cocaine\u00a0 \u2014 including over 1,200 pounds of drugs that were seized from a \"narco sub.\"",
      "Semi-submersibles, which cannot go fully underwater, are popular among international drug traffickers as they can sometimes elude detection by law enforcement. The vessels are sometimes\u00a0seized\u00a0in Colombian waters while heading to the United States, Central America and Europe. Earlier this summer, the Colombian Navy\u00a0said\u00a0it seized two \"narco subs\" off the country's Pacific coast that together contained almost 5 tons of cocaine.",

      "Modern lifestyles, including frequent computer use, have driven an uptick in dry eye cases, as the eye is the \"highest-friction area of the human body,\" the doctor said.",
      "\"You blink 10,000 times a day,\" he went on. \"The tear film is bringing nutrients to your cornea.\"",

      "Changes in hormones and medication can worsen dryness, as well as inflammatory issues throughout the body like joint pain or stomach problems, the doctor cautioned. (iStock)",

      "Symptoms to know",
      "Dry eye can have different symptoms based on gender, ethnicity and other variables, but some \"hallmark\" signs are consistent dryness, fluctuating vision and overall awareness of your eyes throughout the day, according to Cunningham.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"You should not notice that your eyes are in your head,\" he said. \"And if you notice they're there, that's most commonly dry eye.\"",

      "Some options include anti-inflammatory eye drops, tearduct plugs, intense pulsed light therapy (IPL) and other laser treatments.",
      "While artificial tears can be a \"refreshing tool,\" prescription steroids and anti-inflammatory drops are needed to address the inflammation, Cunningham said.",
      "Eyes weren't \"built\" to stare at a computer screen for long periods of time, according to an expert. (iStock)",
      "Skin is also \"intimately involved\" in dry eye, Cunningham noted, as inflammation in the skin, or rosacea, can have a direct correlation to the condition.",

      "Her father was a legendary NFL broadcaster, and she helped him overcome addiction",
      "Wiles is the daughter of late legendary NFL broadcaster Pat Summerall. Summerall was an NFL champion kicker and the lead color commentator alongside John Madden on CBS for more than two decades.",

      "Her first job in politics was with her father's old teammate",
      "In the late 1970s, Wiles was hired as an assistant to Summerall's old teammate on the New York Giants, someone who went on to have a long and successful career in the House of Representatives and later be nominated for vice president. That was none other than the late Jack Kemp, one of the chief backers of former President Ronald Reagan's supply-side economics theories and architect of the Regan tax cuts.",

She said national Republicans had developed \"an expediency culture\" and lost sight of core principles.",

    "story": [
      "SentinelOne's chief security adviser discusses the alarming rise in cyberattacks worldwide on 'Fox News Live.'",
      "Data theft and ransomware attacks against health care and critical third-party providers are still happening at an alarmingly high rate in 2024, which is shaping up to be as severe as last year, the worst on record for health care breaches.",
      "You might remember the\u00a0Ascension ransomware attack from May, one of the most devastating incidents in the health care sector, causing major issues for patients.",

      "Woman working on a computer in a hospital (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Impact of ransomware on health care",
      "Microsoft points out that beyond the financial risk to health care organizations, ransomware attacks can have life-threatening consequences. When health care providers lose access to diagnostic equipment or patient records due to ransomware, patient care is severely disrupted. For example, stroke code activations are nearly double during hospital attacks, with confirmed strokes increasing by 113.6%, and cardiac arrest cases rise by 81% and survival rates drop from 40% to just 4.5%.",
      "Health care facilities near hospitals hit by ransomware attacks also feel the impact, facing a surge in patients needing urgent care that they may not be equipped to handle. As a result, patients often face longer wait times.",
      "What\u2019s more troubling is that these attacks aren\u2019t limited to urban areas. Rural health clinics are also prime targets for cyberattacks. These facilities are particularly vulnerable to ransomware because they often lack the resources to prevent or respond to security incidents. And since these clinics are the only health care option within miles, a successful attack can be devastating for many rural communities.",

      "HEALTH CARE RANSOMWARE ATTACK EXPOSES PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION OF OVER 100 MILLION",
      "Why health care is the prime target?",
      "Ransomware attacks on health care have shot up 300% since 2015, making it one of the top 10 most targeted industries in the second quarter of 2024. This rise is mostly because health care organizations store extremely sensitive data, and hackers know there\u2019s big money to be made. With lives on the line, hospitals can\u2019t risk poor patient outcomes if their systems go down or the exposure of patient data if they don\u2019t pay. This reputation for paying ransoms just makes health care an even bigger target.",
      "Some of the blame also falls on health care organizations. They tend to have lower cybersecurity budgets compared to other industries, making it harder to defend against these kinds of attacks. Many facilities don\u2019t have staff dedicated to cybersecurity; some don\u2019t even have a chief information security officer or a security operations center. Instead, cybersecurity often gets lumped in with regular IT duties. Plus, doctors, nurses and other health care staff might not get any cybersecurity training, so they might not even recognize a\u00a0phishing email when they see one.",

      "1. Stay informed: Keep up to date with the latest news from your health care providers and reliable sources to stay aware of any disruptions or data breaches affecting systems and services.",
      "2. Maintain personal health records: Keep copies of your health records on your own devices or printed out, including details like medications, allergies, past surgeries and other relevant health information. This can be crucial if electronic health records become temporarily unavailable.",
      "3. Prepare for medical emergencies: Have a backup plan for emergencies, including knowing nearby alternative health care facilities. Research wait times and accessibility to help avoid delays if your primary facility is impacted.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Practice cybersecurity best practices: Use strong, unique passwords for online accounts and consider a\u00a0password manager to help manage them. Enable two-factor authentication where available to add an extra layer of security.",
      "5. Be vigilant against phishing: Cyberattacks often result in a spike in phishing emails and calls as attackers exploit the situation. Protect yourself by using strong antivirus software on all your devices, which can help block malicious links and detect phishing emails. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Confirm appointments: If you have upcoming appointments or procedures, contact your health care provider to confirm or reschedule if a cyberattack disrupts their normal operations.",
      "7. Monitor patient portals: Keep an eye on patient portals like MyChart for updates on your medical records and communication with health care providers, as these can provide critical information during service disruptions.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The surge in ransomware attacks on the health care industry is troubling and a harsh reminder that criminals don\u2019t care about the lives at risk. They\u2019re just after money. Health care organizations need to take lessons from the past two years, investing heavily in cybersecurity infrastructure and hiring dedicated staff to protect patient data and systems. With stronger defenses in place, the goal is to prevent these situations from reaching the point where paying a ransom is even considered.",

      "1) Keep your iPhone up to date: Occasionally, Apple releases new iOS updates to address known vulnerabilities. When possible, it is best to\u00a0update the iOS so that your iPhone is safe from known vulnerabilities.",
      "2) Install and run strong antivirus software: An antivirus software actively running on all of your devices can help keep them all safe, including your iPhone. With iPhones, strong antivirus software will prevent you from clicking on any malicious links that may then install malware onto your devices, which can potentially extract personal information from your device. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These can be phishing attempts designed to steal your personal information.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Download apps only from the App Store: Stick to downloading apps from the official Apple App Store. Apps on the App Store are vetted by Apple for security, reducing the risk of downloading malicious software.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Adding an extra layer of security to your Apple ID can help protect your personal information. With\u00a02FA, even if someone gets your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without the second factor.",
      "5) Use strong passwords: Ensure that your passwords are strong and unique for different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep track of them.",
      "6) Monitor app permissions: Regularly check the\u00a0permissions granted to your apps and revoke any that seem unnecessary. This can help prevent apps from accessing more information than they need.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While most iPhone users rest easy knowing that the iOS keeps most common viruses and malware at bay, they are still susceptible to scammers trying to work around the closed code and scaring people into making bad choices that endanger their phones and data. Because Apple never sends out alerts about viruses or malware on your iPhone, it should be the first clue of a scam. Even if it looks official, iPhone users do not get alerts from Apple about viruses or malware. If you do install a good antivirus program, that will be the only program notifying you that there is anything amiss with your iPhone. Understanding these scams can go a long way in keeping you calm and your phone safe.",

      "Common misconceptions",
      "Opening emails can instantly infect your device: One common myth is that simply opening an email can automatically infect your device with malware. In reality, modern email systems (such as Gmail, Outlook, etc.) generally prevent this from happening. The real danger comes from interacting with the content inside the email, such as clicking on malicious links or downloading harmful attachments.",
      "Plain text emails are always safe: While emails in plain text format are generally safer than HTML-based emails, they can still pose a risk if they contain malicious links. Phishing attacks can appear in plain text emails, luring you to dangerous websites.",
      "Emails from known contacts are always safe: Even if an email appears to come from someone you know, that doesn\u2019t always mean it's safe. Attackers can spoof email addresses or hack accounts, so always be cautious about unexpected or unusual messages from known contacts, especially those containing links or attachments.",
      "Spam filters catch all malicious emails: Spam filters are highly effective but not perfect. Some sophisticated phishing and malicious emails can bypass these filters and land in your inbox. This is why it\u2019s important to stay vigilant, even with emails that seem to have passed your email service\u2019s security checks.",
      "Previewing emails is always safe: Most modern email clients use a \"preview\" pane for quick reading. While the risk of malware through previews is significantly reduced in up-to-date systems, embedded trackers or other forms of data collection can still occur, confirming your activity to the spammer. Always disable automatic image loading or other active content features in your email client\u2019s settings to minimize exposure.",

      "What to watch out for",
      "As mentioned already, generally, simply opening an email is not enough to cause harm. However, there are some important points to consider:",
      "1) Embedded trackers: Some spam or\u00a0phishing emails contain trackers that can notify the sender when the email is opened. This can confirm to the spammer that your email address is active, potentially leading to more spam.",
      "2) Malicious links and attachments: The real danger lies in clicking on links or downloading attachments within the email. These can lead to malicious websites or download malware onto your device.",
      "3) HTML emails: Emails that contain HTML content can sometimes execute scripts when opened. While modern email clients have protections against this, it\u2019s still a potential risk.",
      "4) Phishing attempts: Even if you don\u2019t click on anything,\u00a0phishing emails can be designed to look very convincing and may trick you into providing personal information if you respond.",

      "3) Enable email filtering: Turn on spam filters to reduce the number of unsolicited or potentially dangerous emails reaching your inbox. This reduces your exposure to phishing attempts. Most email platforms these days automatically filter out what they assume to be \"junk\" into their own folder. If you notice the amount of spam getting through to your inbox increasing, you may want to consider a\u00a0Spam Filter.\u00a0There are free options for different email providers. For Gmail, try\u00a0Mailwasher. For Outlook and Windows Mail, try\u00a0Spam Bully, which costs an annual fee of $29.95.",
      "4) Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your email client and operating system to stay protected from the latest security vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit.",

While preventing the misuse of your SSN is paramount, there are action steps you can take if it does fall into the wrong hands.",

      "Are you concerned that your Social Security number may have gotten into the wrong hands? Check below to see if you are experiencing any of these signs:",
      "Americans are granted free credit reports every 12 months from the three major consumer reporting companies. Regularly culling through these reports can help you spot potential fraud, which might signal that your Social Security number has been compromised. Any hard inquiries you didn\u2019t request on your credit report are a strong indicator that someone tried to open a credit card or another line of credit with your SSN.",
      "While most people know they should check their credit report and scores, you can see your Social Security statement by creating an account on the official Social Security Administration website. Because only one account can be created per SSN, it is safer if you claim it so that no one else can by piecing together your personal information (along with your SSN) to claim it fraudulently. Make sure it is connected to a secure email account that you check frequently. This account also provides up-to-date data on earnings and benefit distributions so you can see if anything is \"off.\"",

      "While it might seem natural to toss a pile of \"junk\" mailers or ignore calls from random debt collectors or advertisers, it may be an indicator that someone has gotten a hold of your Social Security number and has begun opening accounts under your number. It\u2019s important to make note of the patterns and follow up with these collectors should it become more and more apparent that your SSN might have been misused. Oftentimes, consumers start getting more credit offers when new credit cards are opened. Additionally, if you start receiving bills under someone else\u2019s name at your address, it might be time to follow up with these notices.",
      "If you start receiving notices about your Social Security number being used to file someone else\u2019s taxes or inappropriately use your health insurance, it is definitely a sign that someone may have compromised your SSN. While receiving a notice from the IRS or Medicare can feel scary, it is imperative that you reach out to the corresponding agency to notify them of the fraudulent activity so that you can stop further damage.",

      "Put your Social Security number card in a very safe place, such as a safe, bank safe or a filing cabinet that can be locked. Because it is used so frequently, those nine digits are worth memorizing. If your wallet is lost or stolen, and you keep your SSN card in there, it will be messier than losing just money or your ID. Don\u2019t carry your Social Security card in your wallet or purse.",
      "Skip jotting down your Social Security number on in-person forms. When your SSN is jotted down on paper, it is hard to control how the information gets used or disposed of. If you can submit forms online, you can skip the risk of having your SSN getting into the wrong hands. If you mail in forms that denote your SSN, you risk having that piece of mail stolen or lost.",
      "Even though your SSN is requested on some forms, it is not always necessary. If a future employer is requesting your SSN, double-check why they need it. They would most likely need it to run a background check, which you should know about anyway. Additionally, some establishments allow you to provide the last four digits of your SSN until you are finalizing a screening process, etc.",
      "Open accounts for your children's Social Security numbers because you want to claim them for them early and be able to monitor any movement related to their SSN.",
      "Some records that contain your Social Security number are important to keep on hand, such as income tax filings. If they are kept digitally, encrypt and or password-protect the document or folder, especially if it is uploaded to the cloud. Keep offline documents with SSNs in a safe or shred instead of throwing them away.",
      "Remember you (usually) only get one SSN in a lifetime, it is important to safeguard that data with your \"life.\"",
      "Removing your personal information from the internet, given the increasing privacy concerns about artificial intelligence, is essential.

    "story": [
      "Powered by artificial intelligence, the tool aims to keep personal information safe.",
      "Do you remember those TV shows where the villain gets defeated in one season but comes back even stronger in the next? Think\u00a0\"Stranger Things\" on Netflix. The malware we\u2019re talking about here is just like that. It\u2019s called FakeCalls, and every time researchers figure out how it infects devices, it evolves with new ways to hide.",
      "Earlier this year, it was reported to be impersonating large financial institutions, and now security researchers have discovered that the malware has gone through another upgrade. It can even hijack the calls you make to your bank using your Android phone.",

      "Man surfing on his Android phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "FakeCalls is a banking trojan that focuses on voice phishing, where victims are deceived through fraudulent calls impersonating banks and are asked to share sensitive information. Earlier versions did this by prompting users to call the bank from within an app that impersonated the financial institution, as reported by\u00a0Bleeping Computer. However, the latest version, analyzed by\u00a0Zimperium, sets itself as the default call handler.",
      "The default call handler app manages incoming and outgoing calls, allowing users to answer, reject or initiate calls. Giving these permissions to a malicious app, as you can imagine, carries serious risks.",
      "When a user gives the app permission to set itself as the default call handler, the malware gets the green light to intercept and mess with both outgoing and incoming calls. It even shows a fake call interface that looks just like the real Android dialer, complete with trusted contact info and names. This level of deception makes it really tough for victims to see what's happening.",
      "\"When the compromised individual attempts to contact their financial institution, the malware redirects the call to a fraudulent number controlled by the attacker,\"\u00a0explains the new Zimperium report. \"The malicious app will deceive the user, displaying a convincing fake UI that appears to be the legitimate Android's call interface showing the real bank's phone number.\"",
      "\"The victim will be unaware of the manipulation, as the malware\u2019s fake UI will mimic the actual banking experience, allowing the attacker to extract sensitive information or gain unauthorized access to the victim\u2019s financial accounts,\"\u00a0the report added.",

      "The malware can also steal your data",
      "This malware not only hijacks your calls but can also steal your data. It gets access to Android\u2019s Accessibility permissions, which basically gives it free rein to do whatever it wants. The developer of the malware has also added several new commands, including the ability to start livestreaming the device's screen, take screenshots, unlock the device if it\u2019s locked and temporarily turn off auto-lock. It can also use accessibility features to mimic pressing the home button, delete images specified by the command server, and access, compress and upload photos and thumbnails from storage, especially from the DCIM folder.",

      "6 ways to protect yourself from FakeCalls malware",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software: Android has its own built-in malware protection called Play Protect, but the FakeCalls malware proves it\u2019s not enough. Historically, Play Protect hasn\u2019t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. Also, avoid clicking on any links in messages or emails that seem suspicious. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any\u00a0phishing emails or\u00a0ransomware scams.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Download apps from reliable sources:\u00a0It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources, like the Google Play Store. The FakeCalls malware infects your phone when you download an app from an unknown link. As an Android user, you should only download apps from the Play Store, which has strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Also, never trust download links that you receive through SMS.",
      "3) Be cautious with app permissions: Always review the permissions requested by apps before installation. If an app requests access to features that seem unnecessary for its function, it could be a sign of malicious intent. Do not give any app Accessibility permissions unless you really need to. Avoid granting permissions that could compromise your personal data.",
      "4) Regularly update your device\u2019s operating system and apps: Keeping your software\u00a0up to date is crucial, as updates often include security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware like FakeCalls.",
      "5) Monitor financial activity regularly: Check your bank and credit card statements often for unauthorized transactions. Set up alerts for any account activity, which can notify you immediately if suspicious activity occurs.",
      "6) Limit sensitive transactions on mobile: Whenever possible, avoid performing high-risk transactions (like large money transfers) on your mobile device, especially if you\u2019re in\u00a0public or connected to unsecured Wi-Fi. Use a secure computer or contact your bank directly from a verified number.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Hackers are constantly upgrading their tactics and finding clever ways to hack your devices and scam you out of your hard-earned money. I really think Android phone manufacturers and Google need to step up their game on security to help keep users from getting hacked so often. I don\u2019t see the same level of malware affecting iPhones.",

      "How data brokers collect your information",
      "Data brokers collect, aggregate and sell your personal information, including your phone number, with the intent to sell it to interested parties. They can get your information in many ways, by accessing public information like government records or gathering data from loyalty card programs, surveys and social media. Mobile apps can also share your personal information with data brokers. Even your online browsing habits are valuable to data brokers. Your data profile can be sold to many different buyers, including targeted advertising and marketing companies, as well as\u00a0government agencies.",
      "How a data broker uses your information",
      "Some data brokers offer personal profiles directly to consumers, and you might be surprised by how much information they have about you. Have you ever tried searching for someone on a \"people search\" website? These sites let you enter a name and find out all sorts of information about that person. Try searching for yourself or someone you know. You might find out who used to live at your current address, how much money you make and who your relatives are.",
      "Where do people search sites get their information?",
      "People search sites get their information from public records like court documents and voter registration forms. They usually offer some basic information for free, but if you want more details, you\u2019ll have to sign up for a free trial. And when you do, they\u2019ll probably ask for even more information about you.",
      "The scary thing is that anyone with a computer can access this information, including identity thieves. With just a few key pieces of information, they can call your bank, reset your passcodes and take over your financial accounts.",
      "Even cyberstalkers and blackmailers can use people search sites to find out more about you. Sure, most sites make users promise not to use the information for illegal purposes, but there\u2019s no real way to enforce that. It\u2019s all based on the honor system.",
      "Taking control: removing your information from data brokers",
      "Don\u2019t worry though; there\u2019s something you can do about it. You can request that data brokers remove your information.\u00a0 But with hundreds of them in the U.S. alone, it can be a daunting task. That\u2019s where removal services come in.",
      "Invest in data removal services",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "The persistence of robocalls: why are they still a problem?",
      "While it\u2019s important to take steps to protect your personal information, such as removing it from data broker sites, there are still other threats to our privacy and security. For example, despite efforts to crack down on robocalls, scammers are constantly finding new ways to evade detection and continue their operations. Furthermore, as technology improves, robocallers are able to use more sophisticated methods, such as \"spoofing\" their phone numbers to make it appear as though they are calling from a different location or entity.",
      "Moreover, spam callers are becoming so sophisticated that they have started to add conversational speech to their scripts to further convince their unsuspecting victims to go along with their scams. For instance, the caller may stumble on their words, use \"umm\" a lot, and sometimes even use slang to signal to the listener that the caller is not a robot but an ordinary person, but beware! While some robocalls can range from harmless reminders, most are malicious scams, leaving many frustrated and vulnerable to fraud.

      "A robot that has spent months inside the ruins of a nuclear reactor at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant delivered a tiny sample of melted nuclear fuel on Thursday, in what plant officials said was a step toward beginning the cleanup of hundreds of tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months.",
      "DRONE AIMS TO EXAMINE JAPAN'S DAMAGED FUKUSHIMA NUCLEAR REACTOR FOR THE FIRST TIME",
      "Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed.",
      "The first sample alone is not enough and additional small-scale sampling missions will be necessary in order to obtain more data, TEPCO spokesperson Kenichi Takahara told reporters Thursday. \"It may take time, but we will steadily tackle decommissioning,\" Takahara said.",
      "Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the. plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site's highly radioactive interior remains a mystery.",
      "The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit.",
      "This photo released by Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO), shows a robot, top right, clips a tiny gravel of \u00a0what it believed to be melted fuel debris at the No. 2 reactor of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Okuma, Fukushima, northern Japan, on Oct. 30, 3024. (Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings via AP)",
      "That's led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel.",
      "The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps \u2014 the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure.",
      "On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than 3 grams (.01 ounces) from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said.",
      "Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out.",
      "On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment.",
      "The sample return marks the first time the melted fuel is retrieved out of the containment vessel.",
      "Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive melted fuel remains in them.",
      "The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target to finish the cleanup by 2051, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. Some say it would take for a century or longer.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 06:45:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Amid two wars in Ukraine and the Mideast, the Biden-Harris administration has been accused of double standards when it comes to Israel through its micromanagement of the war as compared to Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice joined The Brian Kilmeade show to discuss how Israel has responded since the October 7 attacks, the latest with Russia & Ukraine and the current status of race relations in America",
      "JERUSALEM\u2014The devastating wars launched by Russia\u2019s authoritarian leader Vladimir Putin against Ukraine and the Hamas terrorist movement against Israel are raising uncomfortable questions\u00a0for President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris about their alleged lack of resolve toward an Israeli\u00a0victory over the Islamic Republic of Iran-backed proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah.",
      "Fox News Digital turned to experts on the Mideast and Russia for their reflections on the different war strategies embraced by Biden and Harris with respect to Ukraine and Israel.",
      "\"The strategic behavior of the United States toward Ukraine and Israel differs substantially,\" David Wurmser, a former senior adviser for nonproliferation and\u00a0Middle East\u00a0strategy for former Vice President Dick Cheney, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"There has never been any indication that the United States affords Russia any legitimacy to its reasons for invasion.\u00a0While a cease-fire in place may be sought, there is no indulgence of Russia\u2019s ostensible grievances or demands,\" Wurmser said, adding, \"In contrast, regarding the Palestinians, the October 7 attack was blasted as a horror and Israel\u2019s immediate defense was accepted, but the thrust of U.S. policy almost immediately and certainly with ever greater intensity was that a legitimate grievance underlies Palestinian claims and led to these events.\"",

      "While many Mideast experts see the effort to establish a\u00a0Palestinian state as a failed project, the Biden-Harris administration has embraced Palestinian demands and sought to push Israel to accept a two-state solution before the\u00a0Oct. 7 Hamas invasion and after Hamas massacred nearly 1,200 people in Israel.",
      "The language of Biden and Harris towards Ukraine and Israel also shows a disconnect. In September, after Russian missiles killed more than 50 during an attack on a training facility and hospital, Biden said, \"Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this war.\u00a0The people of Ukraine will prevail. And on this tragic day, and every day, the United States stands with them.\"",

      "Terminology that advances victory is largely shunned by Biden and Harris when discussing Israel\u2019s ground wars against Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Biden and Harris went as far as to threaten Israel with punitive measures if the Jewish state invaded the last stronghold of Hamas in the city of Rafah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhau called their bluff and defeated Hamas in Rafah, including the\u00a0elimination of its terrorist leader Yahya Sinwar last month.",

Ukraine has not experienced the same offensive war restrictions from Biden and Harris, argue experts.",
      "Wurmser noted that\u00a0\"Ukraine is not facing an incessant attempt from the first days of the Ukraine war of self-defense to stop the war in a way that allows its enemy to consolidate its gains and pocket a victory.\u00a0Only recently has the United States begun to indicate the preference for, but did not impose material pressure on yet, Ukraine to move toward a cease-fire.

After missiles and drones were sent by Iraqi militias in November 2023 into Israeli cities and ports, the United States similarly urged Israeli passivity but failed to provide Israel security.\"",

This incompetent approach \u2014 constantly pressuring Netanyahu to do a cease-fire, not letting him finish the job \u2014 is inviting escalation from Iran. Iran is emboldened, having witnessed that Biden-Harris don\u2019t have Israel\u2019s back. Iran has gotten so out of control that they\u2019ve targeted Netanyahu\u2019s home - think about that.

      "Trump was indicted in the case in August 2023, but significant delays have kept it from going to trial. Trump has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "Trump was charged in connection with the effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat and accused of fraud and trying to disenfranchise American voters.

    "summary": "Voter frustration with their economic lives was central in propelling Donald Trump to a second term.",
    "story": [
      "Voter frustration with their economic lives was central in propelling Donald Trump to a second term. Now, it will be up to Trump to try to change that trajectory and deliver on his sweeping promises of economic revival.",
      "Trump will inherit an economy already on relatively solid footing. Inflation has slowed and wages have begun to catch up with higher prices.\u00a0While companies aren\u2019t hiring at the same breakneck pace as they were coming out of the pandemic, the job market remains strong by historic standards, with low unemployment and around one job opening for every person looking for work.",
      "But despite the signs of strength in the economy, the cost of living and overall dissatisfaction with the economy was repeatedly cited as a top concern by voters heading into the election. Housing costs have been a major pressure point on household budgets after rents increased an average of 24% over the past four years, and, with mortgage rates over 6%, buying a home has been out of reach for many households. Food has been another rising expense, with the average cost of groceries up 22% over the past four years and food banks seeing record numbers of people seeking help.",
      "Trump has floated a wide range of proposals that he says would improve America\u2019s financial picture, many of which will require action from Congress, where Republicans will control the Senate and hope to control the House. Among Trump\u2019s economic plans are deporting millions of immigrants, putting sweeping tariffs on all goods coming into the U.S., encouraging more oil production, lowering corporate taxes and eliminating taxes on social security income and tips.",
      "Here are the ways some of those proposals could play out on the economy:",
      "Tariffs",
      "While inflation has been a top issue for voters, one of Trump\u2019s central campaign promises \u2014 placing tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S. \u2014 would likely raise prices and cost workers their jobs, according to economists, business groups and even some Trump allies. Trump has rejected those assertions.",
      "\u201cTo me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is 'tariff,'\u201d Trump said during remarks at the Chicago Economic Club. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite word. It needs a public relations firm.\u201d",
      "Under Trump\u2019s proposal, the U.S would impose a tariff of at least 10% on all goods coming into the U.S. from overseas and a 60% tariff on products being imported from China. Tariffs are paid to the federal government by the company importing those goods, like a retailer or manufacturer. Those companies can either pass the costs along to consumers by raising prices or absorb the costs and take a smaller profit.",
      "If past tariffs are any indication, consumers will likely see higher prices. Not only do companies often pass along the increase, but competitors who are not subject to the tariff often also raise prices. Companies including AutoZone and Black & Decker have already warned investors that they will be raising prices if Trump carries through on his tariff proposal. Tariffs enacted by Trump in 2018 and 2019 led to higher prices for a range of goods, including washing machines, handbags and tires, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "In the shoe industry, consumers and retailers were hit with a 7.5% tariff that Trump put in place in 2019 on hundreds of millions of shoes imported from China. While some retailers absorbed the cost of those tariffs and took a hit to their bottom line, others passed the fee along to consumers by increasing the prices of their shoes, said Matt Priest, head of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America",
      "\u201cWe can attest to the fact that if you charge us more to bring a product in, it\u2019s going to cost more for the consumer to buy that product,\u201d said Priest.\u00a0\u201c It\u2019s kind of Econ 101.\u201d",
      "Trump has argued that putting tariffs on goods from China would encourage companies to move their plants to the U.S., creating jobs and boosting sales for U.S. producers.",
      "But multiple studies, including those of Trump\u2019s past tariffs and previous rounds of tariffs under different administrations, found that increasing tariffs didn\u2019t lead to a significant number of companies relocating to the U.S. nor did it create jobs for domestic producers. Rather, Trump\u2019s 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum led to a reduction in manufacturing employment because of higher costs for companies using steel and aluminum in their products, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Board.",
      "For shoemakers, Trump\u2019s 2019 tariffs didn\u2019t translate into any companies moving production to the U.S. because of the high labor costs and lack of supply chain and materials stateside, said Priest. He said he doesn\u2019t see another round of tariffs from Trump changing that calculus.",
      "\u201cIts higher labor costs, a lack of labor interest in making shoes, a lack of material and material suppliers here in the States,\u201d said Priest of moving shoe production to the U.S. \u201cYou can make the duties 200% on the imports, and it still won\u2019t happen. It\u2019s just not price competitive.\u201d",
      "Inflation",
      "Trump has promised to \u201cdefeat\u201d inflation, though the rate at which prices are increasing has already returned to its historical norm of  2% to 3% over the past several months after peaking in 2022.\u00a0 But prices for many essentials still remain well above their pre-pandemic levels.",
      "To lower housing costs, Trump has said he would allow homes to be built on federally protected land, something that could help increase the supply of homes in places like Nevada and Arizona. He\u2019s also said he would cut regulations for builders, although many regulations for housing are set at the state and local levels. He\u2019s said he would promote homeownership through tax incentives, but his campaign hasn\u2019t been specific on what those incentives would be.",
      "Trump has said he would lower costs overall by reducing energy prices by 50% during his first year in office, something industry experts have said is unlikely. To do this, Trump has said he would allow oil companies to drill in more places, like on federal land in Alaska, and remove barriers to speed production.",
      "Oil producers are already pumping record levels of oil in the U.S. and are constrained in just how much they can drill by limits on labor and infrastructure. Companies are also disincentivized from flooding the market with too much oil because it would drive down the price, causing them to potentially lose money on each barrel they pump. Oil prices are also set by a global market where other countries, like Saudi Arabia or Russia, could cut back on production to drive up prices and maintain profitability.",
      "Immigration",
      "Trump has said he will carry out \u201cthe largest deportation in the history of our country\u201d of undocumented immigrants, claiming it would help the economy by freeing up housing and opening up jobs for U.S. citizens.",
      "Business groups have warned, though, that deporting millions of immigrants could create a labor shortage that would ultimately drive up prices, especially in areas like food production and housing where immigrants make up a significant share of the workforce.",
      "In the construction industry, which is already facing a shortage of hundreds of thousands of workers, there are an estimated 1.5 million undocumented workers making up about 13% of the total workforce, according to data the Pew Research Center provided to NBC News.",
      "The National Association of Home Builders CEO Jim Tobin told NBC News last month that a massive deportation of immigrants would be \u201cdetrimental to the construction industry and our labor supply and exacerbate our housing affordability problems.\u201d",
      "The NABH and other industry groups have said a key reason for higher housing costs over the past several years has been a mismatch between supply and demand after housing construction tumbled following the Great Recession. As home builders have been ramping up the construction of single-family homes and apartment buildings in recent years, they have faced higher costs of labor and materials, further adding to the price of homes.",
      "Across the economy, an analysis by researchers at the University of New Hampshire found that a mass deportation of immigrants could reduce the U.S. economy, as measured by gross domestic product, by as much as 6.2%, or about $1.7 trillion in lost productivity.",
      "Taxes",
      "Trump has proposed a number of tax cuts, including a complete elimination of the federal income tax. But those plans have varying likelihoods of getting enacted, given that Congress would have to pass legislation to change the tax system. While some of the plans are thin on details and there are many variables for how his proposals would be enacted, economists at the University of Pennsylvania estimate Trump\u2019s tax and spending plans would increase the deficit by $4.1 trillion when accounting for the effects they would have on the wider economy.",
      "One of the most likely tax proposals to become a reality would be an extension of the tax cuts enacted during Trump\u2019s first administration, which are set to expire in 2025. Those cuts lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, reduced individual income tax rates, and increased the standard deduction.",
      "Trump has suggested he would lower the corporate tax rate even more, to 15%.",
      "One of Trump\u2019s more consistent campaign pledges has been eliminating taxes on tips, which could affect about 2.5% of workers who receive tips as part of their income. But it could cause major disruptions in how workers are paid if more industries shifted to a tipping system where workers are paid a minimum wage and expected to get the bulk of their income tax-free from tips. Even white-collar industries could adopt a system where a portion of employees' income is classified as tips.",
      "That could create havoc for workers and consumers and reduce the amount of income taxes the federal government brings in.",
      "Trump has also said that the income seniors receive from Social Security should be tax-free. About 40% of Social Security recipients pay federal income taxes, typically because they have other sources of income that raise them above a certain threshold where they are required to pay income tax, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "Eliminating a tax on social security would mean a loss of tax revenue for the federal government, which would then either add to the deficit or need to be offset by cuts."

    "title": "Former intelligence officials worry Trump will try to politicize and weaponize CIA",
    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 10:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Former intelligence officials worry that Donald Trump could try to turn the spy services into tools of political retribution in his second term.",
    "story": [
      "At the end of his first term in office, then-President Donald Trump sought to install Kash Patel, a hard-line MAGA loyalist, as deputy CIA director. But the head of the agency at the time, Gina Haspel, a career intelligence officer, threatened to resign in protest, and the appointment was scuttled.",
      "Now, four years later, Patel is considered a possible pick for CIA director or another high-level national security post in a second Trump administration. And there likely will be no one to stand in his way this time.",
      "Patel is one of several fiercely loyal political allies who President-elect Trump is considering to oversee the country\u2019s national security. In his first term in office, Trump frequently clashed with his deputies and top officials, who he came to view as insufficiently loyal to his agenda.",
      "This time, the president-elect is keen to fill his administration with people who will carry out his decisions without question, according to sources familiar with the transition process.",
      "Marc Short, who served as chief of staff to former Vice President Mike Pence, said that the people Trump picked in his first term to run the intelligence agencies, including Haspel, and former lawmakers Mike Pompeo and Dan Coats, were highly capable figures who performed well.",
      "\u201cThere was undeniable competence there,\u201d Short said. \u201cAnd I think it would be a mistake to go in a different direction from that.\u201d",
      "Short added: \u201cIt certainly seems that some of the people that are most, perhaps, noisy in his inner circle, are hungry for a different path.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers, former intelligence officers and Western officials worry that Trump and a group of loyalists could reshape the makeup and mission of the nation\u2019s intelligence apparatus.",
      "Officers could be pressured to skew their findings to suit the White House\u2019s political agenda, allies might scale back information sharing due to Trump\u2019s cavalier approach to secrecy and, in a worst-case scenario, the spy agencies could be converted into tools of retribution against domestic political opponents, the former officers and others say.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of it depends on who they put in as director, deputy and chief operating officer\u201dat the CIA, said one former senior intelligence officer. Those appointments will set the tone and determine if the spy agency is able to maintain professional, apolitical standards or whether it becomes the target of a politically-motivated overhaul, the former officer said.",
      "Patel,\u00a0an outspoken critic of the intelligence agencies and the Justice Department\u00a0who worked at the White House National Security Council during the Trump administration, declined to comment. He has endorsed Trump\u2019s baseless claim that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s aides have previously dismissed warnings about how the president-elect might politicize the intelligence community, saying it was President Joe Biden and his administration that had injected partisan politics into the intelligence agencies, not Trump.",
      "Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the transition, told NBC News in an email that Trump had won a decisive victory on \u201ca common sense mandate for change\u201d and that \u201cpeople can expect an administration that reflects a commitment to seeing that agenda is put in place starting on Day 1.\"",
      "Distrust of a 'deep state'",
      "Dating back to the outset of his first term in office in 2017, Trump has had a troubled relationship with the intelligence community. He and his supporters have portrayed officials in those agencies \u2014 along with the Justice Department \u2014 as part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d plotting against him.",
      "At a 2018 news conference with Vladimir Putin, Trump famously sided with the Russian president over his own intelligence agencies when asked if he believed Moscow meddled in the 2016 election.",
      "\u201cI have great confidence in my intelligence people,\u201d Trump said at the event in Helsinki. \u201cBut I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.\u201d",
      "Another critic of the intelligence community, former Rep. Devin Nunes of California, could also be in the mix for the CIA job under a new Trump administration, according to congressional aides and Republican activists.",
      "Other possible picks for the intelligence world include: John Ratcliffe, the former Texas congressman who served as director of national intelligence in Trump\u2019s previous term; Robert O\u2019Brien, former national security adviser to Trump; and Sen. Marco Rubio.",
      "Special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into whether Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign worked with Russia to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton deeply angered Trump and his supporters.",
      "The investigation, which wrapped up in 2019, did not find a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia and reached no conclusion regarding whether Trump obstructed justice. But Mueller\u2019s report did describe a pattern of Russian outreach to people close to Trump, and an interest by Trump\u2019s campaign to benefit politically from Russian actions.",
      "In response to the probe, former Attorney General Bill Barr appointed a special counsel to investigate the FBI and the intelligence community probe of Trump. After a four-year investigation, Special Counsel John Durham issued a scathing 300-page report that said the FBI had acted negligently when it opened the investigation based on vague and insufficient information.",
      "Yet Durham found that no senior FBI or CIA officials had committed crimes. The two criminal prosecutions he brought, both regarding lying, ended in juries acquitting the defendants.",
      "Trump and his allies, though, continue to paint the Justice Department and the intelligence community as a hostile bureaucracy with civil servants out to get the president.",
      "After Trump's election win on Tuesday, Steve Bannon. one of Trump\u2019s longtime allies, called for\u00a0\u201cjustice\u201d and punishment against officials at the FBI, the DOJ and the CIA who he alleged had persecuted him and Trump and damaged the country.",
      "\u201cNow you\u2019re going to pay the price for trying to destroy this country,\u201d Bannon said.",
      "Past domestic spying",
      "Former intelligence and security officials said their former colleagues are bracing themselves for a difficult period in which they could face dilemmas about following orders they consider unethical or damaging to national security.",
      "\u201cI very much expect members of the intelligence community to be challenged to decide whether to stand up to Trump or not, just like they were repeatedly in his first term,\u201d one congressional aide said.",
      "Former intelligence officials disagree on whether Trump would seek to use the spy agencies against domestic political opponents, and if he did, how the intelligence workforce and courts would respond.",
      "After the Watergate scandal, laws were enacted that expressly forbid using the spy agencies against Americans. The measures were in response to the Nixon administration using the CIA to gather intelligence on domestic protesters opposed to the Vietnam War.",
      "Nixon also tried unsuccessfully to enlist the help of the CIA to quash an FBI investigation into the burglary of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate Hotel, which sparked the scandal.",
      "One former senior intelligence official said for all its shortcomings, the intelligence community would not be easily converted into a domestic spying service, and that many of the career officers would refuse to follow unlawful orders.",
      "\u201cThey would be pretty resistant to turning it on the American people,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Thousands of political appointees",
      "Trump\u2019s allies have called for revisiting an effort at the end of his last term when senior officials planned to remove thousands of civil servants across the federal government and replace them with political appointees.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if Trump and those he nominates to run the intelligence community will seek to replace large numbers of civil servants at the spy agencies.",
      "Presidents face few legal constraints when it comes to their authority over the intelligence agencies, legal experts and former senior officials said.",
      "\u201cThe law allows for a hell of a lot of discretion\u201d and Trump would have \u201ca pretty free hand,\u201d according to Glenn Gerstell, who worked as general counsel for the National Security Agency from 2015 to 2020.",
      "Supporters of Trump say dire warnings about the future of the intelligence agencies under a new Trump administration are hysterical and overblown, and that his record at the White House shows that he strengthened the spy agencies.",
      "Trump\u2019s supporters said it would be reasonable for the president-elect to assert control over the intelligence community through political appointees, to ensure the agencies carry out the president\u2019s policies without bureaucratic subterfuge.",
      "\u201cNo matter what side you\u2019re on politically, you should want political control because we don\u2019t want this country to become a security state,\u201d a former official close to the Trump team said.",
      "The Heritage Foundation\u2019s proposed outline for action, titled \u201cProject 2025,\u201d calls for the president-elect to promptly choose a deputy director of the CIA, who would not need Senate confirmation and could \u201cimmediately begin to implement the President\u2019s agenda.\u201d",
      "\u201cAdditional appointees should be placed within the agency as needed to assist the Director in supervising its functioning,\u201d the report states.",
      "The document also calls for breaking \u201cthe cabal of bureaucrats in D.C.\u201d by moving some directorates in the CIA outside of northern Virginia, where the headquarters is located.",
      "Robert Litt, who served as general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence from 2009 to 2017, said inserting political appointees into the management of the spy agencies in unprecedented numbers could distort the way intelligence is analyzed and lead to illegal or ill-advised decisions.",
      "\u201cI think it would be a very, very bad thing for the intelligence community and for the nation if the intelligence community was dominated by a group of political loyalists,\u201d he said in an interview with NBC News earlier this year.",
      "\u201cOne is the risk that intelligence analysis will not be called down the middle,\u201d Litt said. \u201cAnd the other is the risk that the intelligence agencies will be directed to do things that are either unlawful or inappropriate.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans are gearing up to lock in their remake of the judiciary under President-elect Donald Trump and a new Senate majority, including potentially installing several more conservative Supreme Court justices.",
      "Having already picked three Supreme Court justices in his first term \u2014 who were critical in overturning abortion rights \u2014 Trump will have appointed a majority of the court if he lands two more.",
      "Trump made the Supreme Court and lower courts priorities in his first term. He worked with Senate Republicans to help reshape the entire judiciary by naming 234 federal judges.",
      "Republicans will hold at least 52 Senate seats, having flipped Democratic-held seats in West Virginia, Montana and Ohio. The number may grow, with several other races still too close to call. Either way, they\u2019ll have power to confirm judges and justices with simple majorities.",
      "Conservatives are prepared for Supreme Court retirements, with the most attention on Justice Samuel Alito, 74.",
      "Follow 2024 election live updates",
      "\u201cI imagine that Justice Alito will want to get the hell out of D.C. as quickly as possible,\u201d said Mike Davis, the Senate GOP\u2019s former chief counsel for nominations, who runs the conservative Article 3 Project advocacy group. \u201cThat\u2019s who I would predict.\u201d",
      "The top candidates to become the next Senate majority leader \u2014 John Thune, R-S.D., and John Cornyn, R-Texas \u2014 both plan to prioritize confirming judges under Trump.",
      "\u201cCome January, we must be ready to confirm his nominees,\u201d Cornyn said while mentioning other priorities like passing a budget, extending the Trump tax cuts and pursuing tougher border policies.",
      "A source close to Thune said that \u201cconfirming conservative judges will certainly be a priority,\u201d calling Trump\u2019s first term a \u201cgreat\u201d model to look to.",
      "When it comes to the Supreme Court, observers have their eyes on the two oldest conservatives. Justice Clarence Thomas, who has served on the court since 1991, will turn 80 by the next presidential election in 2028. He is close to being the longest-serving justice of all time, a mark he would reach that year. Alito, who wrote the 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, has served since 2006 and turns 78 ahead of the next presidential election.",
      "Both are conservative stalwarts who are in some ways more aligned with the Trump wing of the GOP than the three justices Trump appointed in his first term. They have also both been subject to hostile scrutiny in recent years over allegations of ethical lapses.",
      "\u201cI certainly expect there will be a vacancy, quite possibly two,\u201d said John Malcolm, a lawyer at the conservative, Trump-allied Heritage Foundation who was among those who helped compile a list of potential high court nominees for Trump when he first ran in 2016.",
      "A Trump-appointed Supreme Court majority",
      "If Trump gets two appointments, he would be the first president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to have appointed a majority of justices to the court, a milestone he could reach as soon as the summer of 2026 depending on the timing of retirements.",
      "Trump\u2019s previous appointees \u2014 Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2014 have been instrumental in shifting the court further to the right with a 6-3 conservative majority. All three voted to overturn abortion rights and regularly joined rulings invalidating Biden administration actions.",
      "Davis, a pugnacious Trump supporter known for throwing rhetorical flames at Trump's critics, called his three justices the \u201cmost consequential accomplishment of his first term.\u201d",
      "And there may be fresh criteria this time.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump will build on that with even more bold and fearless judicial picks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means judges who will follow the law and don\u2019t care what the liberal media says about them.\u201d",
      "If Thomas or Alito steps down, Trump is likely to look to the dozens of appeals court judges he appointed in his first term to find candidates to replace them, some experts believe.",
      "Trump\u2019s former White House counsel Don McGahn, who played a key role in judicial selections in the first term, spoke at a recent event about the importance of justices\u2019 having \u201ccourage to do the job you\u2019ve been given.\u201d He added that some of Trump\u2019s potential Supreme Court nominees are \u201ccertainly more strident\u201d than earlier generations of conservative judges were.",
      "And among Democrats, anxieties are running high about whether Justice Sonia Sotomayor, 70, a lifelong diabetic, will hang on for four more years. Some Democrats had openly wondered this year whether she should step down and assure a liberal replacement, to avoid a repeat of what happened to former Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died during Trump's first term, which enabled him to swing the court to the right by picking Barrett.",
      "\u201cSonia Sotomayor needs to retire right now,\u201d a Democratic official working in the Biden administration said within hours of NBC News\u2019 projecting that Trump had won the presidency.",
      "If she does, there\u2019s no rule prohibiting Democrats from confirming a potential Sotomayor successor in the lame-duck session. They wouldn\u2019t need any Republican votes to do it. But some on the left who are familiar with the Senate confirmation process point out there is no guarantee that a replacement for Sotomayor would be confirmed in time.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they could realistically confirm a replacement, and it would be risky,\u201d said Alex Aronson, a former Democratic Senate staffer who now runs Court Accountability, a liberal legal group.",
      "Sotomayor didn\u2019t respond to a request seeking comment on her plans, relayed via a Supreme Court spokeswoman.",
      "Chuck Grassley likely to be Judiciary chairman",
      "Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told NBC News in September he would seek to return as Judiciary Committee chairman if Republicans retake the majority. Grassley has seniority on the committee, which determines what judicial nominations the full Senate votes on.",
      "Ahead of the election, numerous Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee told NBC News they expected at least one, if not more, Supreme Court retirements should Trump prevail and their party win the Senate. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he believes the GOP would look to find more justices like Thomas or Alito, especially if they\u2019re the ones being replaced.",
      "Unlike in 2016, Trump hasn\u2019t issued a public list of potential Supreme Court nominees. But the task of identifying potential nominees is made easier for him because he now has a deep bench of lower court judges he appointed to pick from.",
      "\u201cHe has the luxury that he appointed several outstanding judges who have now been judges for a number of years, so they have a judicial track record,\u201d said Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Among them are Judge Andrew Oldham of the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, who was a law clerk for Alito. Another is Judge Amul Thapar of the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He was Trump\u2019s first appeals court nominee in 2017. Vice President-elect JD Vance\u2019s wife, Usha Vance, clerked for Thapar when he was a district court judge.",
      "Other names conservative legal insiders frequently mention as potential Supreme Court nominees include Judge James Ho of the 5th Circuit appeals court, Neomi Rao of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and Judge Patrick Bumatay of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Trump appointed all of them to their current positions.",
      "There are 47 vacancies on the lower courts \u2014 trial courts and the 13 influential courts of appeal \u2014 that President Joe Biden hasn\u2019t filled.",
      "But waiting in the wings are dozens of Republican-nominated judges who in January would be eligible to retire on full pay but were most likely delaying doing so until there was a Republican president who could appoint their successors.",
      "There are 83 such judges, according to Russell Wheeler, a scholar at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution who tracks judicial nominations.",
      "Once Trump takes office, he will probably be able to fill most of those slots.",
      "GOP won't pursue Supreme Court ethics rules",
      "Trump already transformed the federal courts in his first term, appointing 54 appeals court judges and 174 district court judges, many of whom are closely linked with the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group. Even putting aside the Supreme Court, those judges have had a major role to play in pushing the law to the right.",
      "Biden has made his own mark on the judiciary, appointing 210 district and appeals court judges in total, including 44 appeals court judges, falling just short of Trump\u2019s total. His appointees have been substantially more diverse than Trump\u2019s, and he has also picked some with experience as public defenders or civil rights lawyers.",
      "To what extent Trump will follow the road map from his first term, in which he deferred to conservative lawyers like McGahn and legal activist Leonard Leo on judicial appointments, remains to be seen. Neither McGahn nor Leo responded to requests for comment on whether they will offer their advice this time around.",
      "In recent years, the Democratic-led Senate has sought to impose new ethics rules and organize inquiries into reports about potential corruption at the Supreme Court, only to get stymied by Republicans who used the filibuster to block the bills and prevent subpoenas from being enforced.",
      "Outgoing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who shepherded Trump\u2019s three justices through the chamber, said those efforts are likely to end under a GOP-led Senate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll quit beating up the Supreme Court every time we don\u2019t like the decision they make,\u201d he said."

      "One of her lawmakers, Siegbert Droese, wished the Republican \u201call the best\u201d on this \u201chappy day\u201d with a red MAGA cap on his desk.",
      "The AfD is polling in second place ahead of elections likely next spring. If the party were to enter government, \u201cyou can assume that we will work excellently with a Trump administration,\u201d Stefan Keuter, an AfD lawmaker in the German parliament and the party\u2019s ranking member in the foreign affairs committee, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe have good personal contacts with people from the Trump team,\u201d he said, adding that the party had hosted a \u201clarge delegation\u201d of the Young Republicans earlier this year.",
      "The AfD is an anti-immigration, anti-Muslim political party that is being monitored by the country\u2019s domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism \u2014 something it denies.

    "story": [
      "Bomb threats sent to polling places and ballot-counting locations in at least five battleground states across the U.S. Tuesday targeted mostly Democratic counties, an NBC News analysis has found.",
      "The full extent of who received the bomb threats is not clear. None are believed to have been deemed credible. NBC News compiled a list of 67 locations in 19 counties, based on local news reports and state and local election officials\u2019 statements, all of which appear to have received similar threats. Of the 67 locations, 56 were in 11 counties that voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 election, including the eight most populated. Those high-population Democratic counties include voting locations for Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Detroit, Michigan; Phoenix, Arizona; Atlanta, Georgia; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.",
      "Maricopa County, Arizona, which Biden won by a slim margin, has consistently been the subject of election denialism conspiracy theories. The other five \u2014 Michigan\u2019s Wayne County, Pennsylvania\u2019s Philadelphia County and Georgia\u2019s DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties \u2014 were some of the largest Democratic strongholds in their respective states.",
      "Much is still unknown about the threats, including the identity of who sent them. They do appear to have been designed to influence either the perception of the election outcome or the outcome itself, as all the threats known to NBC News were sent to the handful of battleground states widely believed by both parties to be crucial for winning the election. It\u2019s also unclear if the threats tended to focus on urban counties because they are better known or contain more people, or because they tend to be Democratic strongholds.",
      "\u201cThis is an extraordinary and very disturbing development,\u201d said Larry Norden, the vice president of the elections and government program at NYU\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a foreign or domestic actor that was involved, there needs to be repercussions for it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn some sense, we were lucky that there was a lot of preparation for this scenario going into 2024. I don\u2019t know that anybody expected the coordinated campaign that seems like that we had, but there were a lot of meetings of law enforcement and election officials, tabletop exercises and trainings to be prepared for this, and as a result, I think the disruption was mostly minimized,\u201d Norden said.",
      "Some locations that temporarily shut down on Tuesday, like DeKalb and Philadelphia County, extended their voting hours that evening. None of the threats resulted in a voting location closing for the day and there is no indication that the evacuations had a meaningful impact on voter turnout.",
      "Some of the threats also included counties that voted heavily for Donald Trump in 2020, including the comparatively smaller Blair and Clearfield Counties in Pennsylvania.",
      "The FBI said in an emailed statement Tuesday that \u201cmany\u201d of the threats \u201cappear to originate from Russian email domains.\u201d Some additional threats appeared to have been sent from a French service, a U.S. official briefed on the matter told NBC News. Anyone with unrestricted internet access can sign up for email services in other countries, making it difficult to deduce who actually sent the threats.",
      "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has openly blamed Russia for the threats since late Tuesday morning, though it\u2019s not clear if he\u2019s referencing the ones coming through a Russian email service or has access to additional intelligence. The FBI declined to provide further comment. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which in the lead-up to the election made formal attributions of online propaganda campaigns to countries like Iran and Russia, declined to comment.",
      "A spokesperson for Russia\u2019s embassy in Washington, D.C., denied the country was responsible.",
      "\u201cWe have seen the allegations by US officials you refer to, but no proof of Russian involvement was presented either to the public, or to the Embassy,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe US Authorities didn\u2019t even bother to contact us on this matter.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "With the glaring exception of the presidential race, North Carolina Democrats had a good 2024 election.",
      "While Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump in the battleground state by more than 3 percentage points, Democrats won nearly every other statewide race that was on the ballot Tuesday.",
      "Those results largely comport with decades of political trends in North Carolina. But Democrats and Republicans alike also attributed them to Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson\u2019s disastrous campaign for governor, which was constantly plagued by his long history of incendiary remarks.",
      "\u201cWe squarely blame Mark Robinson for losses in races that Republicans would and should have otherwise won,\u201d said a North Carolina GOP operative, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.",
      "As was expected, Democrat Josh Stein overwhelmingly defeated Robinson in the race for governor, winning by nearly 15 percentage points.",
      "Democrats also eked out narrow wins in the races for lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state and superintendent of public instruction.",
      "In the contest to replace Robinson as lieutenant governor, Democrat Rachel Hunt defeated Republican Hal Weatherman by 1.6 percentage points. In the contest to replace Stein as attorney general, Democrat Jeff Jackson beat Republican Dan Bishop by 2.6 points.",
      "In the secretary of state\u2019s race, incumbent Democrat Elaine Marshall defeated Republican Chad Brown by 1.9 points to win her eighth term. And in the state superintendent\u2019s race, Democrat Maurice Green defeated Republican Michele Morrow by 2.1 points to replace Republican Catherine Truitt, whom Morrow defeated in the primary this year.",
      "Democrats also seemed poised Friday to flip a seat in the Legislature that would break up Republicans\u2019 supermajority \u2014 and the power to override vetoes that comes with it. That race remains too close to call, according to The Associated Press, but the Democrat led the Republican on Thursday evening.",
      "Meanwhile, in a state Supreme Court race, Republican Jefferson Griffin led Democratic Justice Allison Riggs by two-tenths of a percentage point (about 10,000 votes) with 96% of the vote counted. NBC News hasn\u2019t yet called the race.",
      "For decades, voters in North Carolina have shown a propensity to elect Republicans for federal office while supporting Democrats in downballot statewide races.",
      "But Democrats said linking Republicans to the scandal-plagued Robinson was another important factor in their party's narrow wins this week.",
      "Robinson\u2019s embattled candidacy \u201ccertainly helped\u201d Democrats downballot, said Sam Newton, a spokesperson for the Democratic Governors Association.",
      "While Newton also credited Stein's campaign and vision, he said the results showed that \u201cDemocrats, Republicans and independents\u201d were \u201cdisgusted with Mark Robinson\u2019s extremism.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is something that clearly benefited Democrats up and down the ballot,\u201d he said.",
      "A Democratic operative in North Carolina, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said: \u201cIf you look at the people who were running in those races, they were kind of similar \u2014 prototypes, kind of \u2014\u00a0to Robinson.\u201d The operative mentioned specific speeches by Weatherman, as well as specific social media posts by Morrow.",
      "\u201cThere were a lot of attempts to tie the downballot candidates to Robinson, and I think it was successful for the candidates that were most similar to him,\u201d the operative said.",
      "A Robinson campaign spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to questions.",
      "Democrats in the state and nationally aggressively tied Republicans up and down the ballot in North Carolina to Robinson amid a constant unearthing of controversial remarks he had made. Those efforts were further ramped up after CNN reported that Robinson made inflammatory comments on the message board of a pornography website, which he denied.",
      "National Democrats also tried to extend that strategy to the presidential race, with the Democratic National Committee launching a cascade of ads linking Robinson to Trump immediately after the CNN report. But Trump\u2019s victory suggested that approach didn\u2019t bear fruit at the presidential level.",
      "The varying results, however, largely fit with long-standing political trends in the Southern battleground, particularly the tendency of its voters to simultaneously support Republican presidential candidates and Democratic candidates for governor.",
      "North Carolina, which holds its races for governor in presidential election years, has voted for the Republican presidential candidate in every election but one since 1980. Over the same stretch, all but two of the governors elected have been Democrats.",
      "Meanwhile, North Carolina has elected only one Republican attorney general since 1901 and only one secretary of state who wasn\u2019t a Democrat since 1877. The political party of the state\u2019s elected lieutenant governors has been more mixed in recent decades.",
      "\u201cWelcome to the political legacy and history and trajectory of North Carolina politics. It\u2019s just who and what the state is,\u201d said Michael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College near Charlotte. \u201cIt\u2019s baked into our political DNA.\u201d",
      "Newton, of the Democratic Governors Association, said that in North Carolina in particular, \u201cthere\u2019s always separation between federal and state races.\u201d He said that manifested again this year, with the races for governor and other downballot offices boiling down to local issues, education and abortion rights.",
      "Bitzer also offered a blunt additional assessment of why Democrats\u2019 efforts to tie Robinson to Republican candidates worked in other races but not against Trump.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s got Teflon,\" he said. \"The rest of them don\u2019t.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 14:36:32 GMT",
    "summary": "New DNA analysis of skeletal remains from Pompeii reveals that victims of Vesuvius\u2019s eruption have been wrongly identified.",
    "story": [
      "Centuries on and it turns out that long-held assumptions about some of the people of Pompeii should not have been set in stone.",
      "New DNA analysis of skeletal remains in the doomed Roman town has revealed that some of the victims of Mount Vesuvius\u2019s eruption in A.D. 79 have been wrongly identified, highlighting how much modern day thinking has been projected onto the ancient world.",
      "\u201cWe show that the individuals\u2019 sexes and family relationships do not match traditional interpretations,\u201d wrote the authors of the research published Thursday in the journal Current Biology. \u201cModern assumptions about gendered behaviors may not be reliable lenses through which to view data from the past,\u201d they added.",
      "Pompeii's victims were later immortalized by archaeologists who used plaster to fill the voids left by their bodies and observers have long created stories based on these casts, one of which was long assumed to be a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they died.",
      "But the DNA analysis has shown the person thought to be the mother was actually a man who was unrelated to the child, according to the new research.",
      "And at least one of the people locked in the embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter \u2014 was a man.",
      "\u201cThe genetic results encourage reflection on the dangers of making up stories about gender and family relationships in past societies based on present-day expectations,\u201d one of the study\u2019s authors, professor David Reich, said in interview Thursday with the Harvard Medical School, where he lectures.",
      "Researchers from Italy's University of Florence and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in the German city of Leipzig also took part in the study, which examined 14 casts undergoing restoration in a bid determine the victims\u2019 sex, ancestry and genetic relationships using genetic material preserved for almost 2,000 years.",
      "Their findings also revealed that residents of the seaside resort favored by wealthy Romans had diverse backgrounds, primarily tracing their ancestry to eastern Mediterranean immigrants, highlighting the mobility of people and the multicultural nature of the Roman Empire.",
      "Before the eruption, which lasted for more than 24 hours and had the\u00a0power of thousands\u00a0of nuclear bombs, Mount Vesuvius\u00a0had been mostly dormant for centuries.",
      "An estimated 20,000 people lived in Pompeii at the time and many were consumed by a wave of ash, pumice and mud, freezing them in place beneath a fresh layer of volcanic sediment.",
      "Over the centuries, Pompeii and the dead were forgotten, remaining buried for almost two millennia until a farmer found part of the city beneath a vineyard in 1748.",
      "In the 19th century, archaeologists pioneered the technique of pouring plaster into voids left by decomposed bodies, creating lifelike casts.",
      "Since then, more than 100 of these casts have been produced, capturing the victims' forms along with any surviving bones preserved through the centuries, according to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii.",
      "Research at Pompeii continues to reveal new details about the ancient city and its people, with fresh discoveries made all the time.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers were awarded a $700,000 prize for employing artificial intelligence to decipher a 2,000-year-old scroll that had been charred in the eruption.",
      "And last year, excavations revealed people had died as a result of an earthquake as well as the eruption and an opulent house was unveiled two decades after restoration began."

      "Footage circulating on social media showed supporters of the Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team being chased down and assaulted on Thursday night, with one video geolocated by NBC News to near Amsterdam's central station that showed fighting on the streets between the Israelis and their attackers.",
      "\"Boys on scooters crossed the city in search of Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters,\" Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema said. \"It was a hit-and-run. Football fans were beaten and scared, after which the rioters quickly left again, fleeing the police force that was on the move en masse yesterday.\u201d",
      "A separate video geolocated by NBC News showed Israeli fans taunting pro-Palestinian protesters either before or after Thursday's match by singing \u201cDeath to the Arabs\u201d and \u201cLet the IDF win. We will f*** the Arabs,\u201d as well as tearing down a Palestinian flag.",
      "The war in Gaza triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack that killed 1,200 people has caused outrage throughout Europe, including in the Netherlands.",
      "Amsterdam, like many major cities across the world, has been convulsed by large protests condemning the ongoing Israeli invasion of Gaza, the deaths of more than 43,000 Palestinians and the destruction of much of the enclave.",
      "As images of the unfolding violence went viral in the hometown of Holocaust heroine Anne Frank, the Israelis dispatched commercial planes to bring the fans home.",
      "\u201cYesterday there was an outburst of antisemitism such as we had hoped to see no more in Amsterdam,\" Halsema said.\u00a0\"I express the strongest condemnation of the violence that has taken place. Among our Jewish Amsterdam residents there is fear, dismay, anger, disbelief.\u201d",
      "The fighting erupted after the match between the Israeli team and the Dutch club Ajax. There have been outbreaks of soccer hooliganism and fighting between fans of competing clubs around the world for many years,\u00a0but it\u2019s unclear how much of that contributed to the violence in this case.",
      "\"Rioters\" had \"actively sought out Israeli supporters to attack and assault them,\" Halsema's office said in a statement.",
      "At a news conference Friday, Halsema said the city has taken emergency measures to prevent any more violence, including a three-day ban on all demonstrations.",
      "Police said that five people required hospital care, while 20 to 30 others suffered nonserious injuries, and at least 62 people were arrested.",

      "\u201cEverybody ran through the streets,\u201d Gold said. \u201cWhatever they saw in the street, they tried to attack us with.\u201d",
      "Gold said they were chased by attackers on motorbikes and some of their pursuers were armed with knives. He said that they fled to their hotels and that he let a fellow fan stay with him because he was too afraid to venture back outside.",
      "When dawn broke, Gold said they were still too \"frightened to go into the streets.\"",
      "In a video shared by the Israeli Embassy is Washington, which NBC News has not been able to independently verify, a man could be seen being beaten as an attacker shouts: \u201cThis is for the children! Free Palestine now!\u201d",
      "Tevel Caro, 18, said he and a friend had already made it back to their hotel when they began to receive messages from other Maccabi fans about what was going on outside.",
      "On Friday, Caro said he was sheltering in a safe house with dozens of other Israelis, worried about how they would get back home.",
      "Caro, who said he will soon be doing his mandatory Israeli military service, said he was disappointed that Israel was not deploying military aircraft in addition to the El Al airliners.",
      "\"I felt so lonely,\" Caro said. \"You know, like I'm supposed to get deployed in two weeks and no one cares about me.\"",
      "The Ajax team has historically drawn fans from Amsterdam\u2019s large Jewish community. The confrontation between the Israelis and pro-Palestinians appeared to be more about Gaza than soccer.",
      "Even before the game, tensions between Israeli fans and local Palestinian supporters were simmering, Amsterdam's acting police chief, Peter Holla, said Friday at a news conference.",
      "As a precaution, hundreds of extra police officers were dispatched to Amsterdam, Hollas said.",
      "Some of the Israeli fans added to the tensions, Holla said, by attacking a taxi Wednesday as well as a Palestinian flag.",
      "There was also a confrontation before the game between Israeli fans and pro-Palestinian demonstrators, and police struggled to keep the two groups apart, Holla said.",
      "World leaders decry violence",

      "He described the violence as \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and said he had spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone \u201cto stress that the perpetrators will be identified and prosecuted.\u201d",
      "Other European leaders echoed those sentiments, with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock calling the images emerging from Amsterdam \u201chorrific & deeply shameful for us in Europe,\u201d in a post on X.",
      "Netanyahu was briefed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 situation room on Friday.",
      "In comments shared by his office, he said that Israel \u201ccannot accept this\u201d and that the violence \u201cputs us and them, the free countries and the Netherlands, in danger.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu compared the incident to Kristallnacht, or the \u201cNight of Broken Glass,\u201d when almost exactly 86 years ago, on Nov. 9, 1938, Nazi mobs in Germany launched pogroms and vandalized Jewish-owned homes, synagogues and businesses.",
      "Israeli President Isaac Herzog spoked directly with King Willem-Alexander about the \"antisemitic pogrom\" in Amsterdam, the Dutch royal family said. The king expressed his shock and said \"history has taught us how intimidation goes from bad to worse, with horrific consequences.\"",
      "\"Jewish people must feel safe in the Netherlands,\" the king said.",
      "U.S. Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt, the special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism, condemned the incident and also said it was \"terribly reminiscent of a classic pogrom.\"",
      "Lipstadt said she was also \"deeply disturbed by how long the reported attacks lasted and called on the government to conduct a thorough investigation into security force intervention and on how these despicable attacks transpired.\"",

A giant \u201cFree Palestine\u201d banner was unveiled at a Paris Saint Germain game on Wednesday, drawing criticism from France\u2019s interior minister. Israel\u2019s national team is scheduled to play France in Paris on Nov. 14."

      "Locals were urged to lock windows and doors and not to interact with the monkeys and instead call 911 immediately upon spotting any of the escaped primates. \"These animals are highly sensitive and easily startled, we recommend that the public avoid the area to prevent frightening them further,\" police said.",

      "Police also said Thursday that the monkeys were very young females weighing just 6 to 7 lbs.

      "\u201cOur Executive Slaves will come get you in a Brown Van,\u201d the message read, \u201cbe prepared to be searched down once you\u2019ve enter the plantation.\u201d",

I\u2019m going to find who you are\u201d and shared a photo of the text on social media. She learned that some of her friends had received the same text.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a scare tactic,\u201d Miller said in an interview. \u201cI saw it and was like, \u2018What in the world?\u2019 Usually, in any other instance, someone is racist to the point where it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s a bad humor sort of funny. But that day, with the climate and everything going on, I genuinely felt scared.\u201d",
      "Black social media users across the country said they have received text messages similar to Miller\u2019s. Many of the recipients are college students from a wide range of schools nationwide, including Ohio State University, Clemson University in South Carolina, the University of Southern California and Missouri State University, NBC News has confirmed.",
      "Domonique Valles, 23, who attends the University of Southern California, said he and some of his fellow Kappa Alpha Psi frat brothers who received the text messages and has since filed a complaint with the FBI.",
      "\u201cI definitely feel kind of unsafe on campus,\u201d Valles said. While he said he\u2019s unclear what the campus can do to make people feel safe, \u201cthey definitely need to at least come in support of people who are suffering from this Black community.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the university called the messages \"hateful and unacceptable,\" and added that it was referring students who received them to the campus Office for Equity, Equal Opportunity, and Title IX.",
      "The FBI said in a statement Thursday that it is aware of the texts, has been in contact with the U.S. Department of Justice and encourages people who receive them to report the messages to local law enforcement authorities.",

      "It is unclear who is behind the mass text messages, what motivated them or how they obtained phone numbers for swaths of Black people. But some of the anonymous numbers appear to be tied to TextNow, a text messaging service that allows users to obtain untraceable, \u201cburner\u201d phone numbers.",
      "A TextNow spokesperson told NBC News in a statement that it is aware of the messages. \u201cAs soon as we became aware, our Trust & Safety team acted quickly, shutting down the accounts involved within the hour,\u201d the statement said. \u201cTextNow is proud to be an inclusive service offering free mobile text and data to millions of Americans. We do not tolerate or condone the use of our service to send harassing or spam messages and will work with the authorities to prevent these individuals from doing so in the future.\u201d",
      "The Attorney General\u2019s Office in Virginia condemned the messages Wednesday and directed anyone who \u201cbelieves themselves to be under threat\u201d to contact law enforcement. Police departments and leaders in cities across the country have also addressed the situation.",
      "People as young as high school students, and some beyond college have also received these messages, which began rolling out the morning after Election Day. Some of the messages mention Donald Trump.",
      "Brian Hughes of the Trump campaign denounced the texts and said it is \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d to link the president to the messages.",
      "\u201cIf we can find the origin of these messages which promote this kind of ugliness in our name we will obviously take legal action to stop it,\u201d Hughes said in a statement to NBC News.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump built a diverse and broad coalition of support, with voters of all races and backgrounds,\u201d he added. \u201cThe result was a landslide victory for his common sense mandate for change. This will result in a second term that is beneficial to every working man and woman in our nation.\u201d",
      "Some recipients responded to the texts with anger and others with a sense of humor, but many agree that the messages seem to be a bleak foreshadowing. The NAACP condemned the messages, saying they believe the messages were a product of the president-elect\u2019s rhetoric.",
      "\u201cThe unfortunate reality of electing a President who, historically has embraced, and at times encouraged hate, is unfolding before our eyes,\u201d the statement read.",
      "Although college students seem to be the most targeted with the texts, Black people of varying ages have reported receiving the messages. Corryn Freeman, 35, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, said she along with her friends\u2019 high school-age students have received the messages.

      "The text messages seemed to have died down as of Thursday evening, but Miller said she\u2019s afraid that they may only be the start of an onslaught of racist targeting.",

In the probe, detectives met with witnesses and say they saw cellphone video depicting \u201can adult male victim being assaulted by several college-aged men.\u201d",

    "summary": "Gen. Kevin Schneider, a top US commander in the region, told NBC News that Chinese military flights have increased dramatically since Taiwan\u2019s new president took office in May.",
    "story": [
      "The\u00a0Chinese military has\u00a0increased\u00a0its provocative flights around Taiwan by 300% over the last five months, according to the commander of the U.S. Air Forces in the Indo-Pacific Command.",
      "In an exclusive interview with NBC News, Gen. Kevin Schneider warned that People\u2019s Liberation Air Force activities have increased dramatically since Taiwan\u2019s new president was inaugurated in May.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s coming into the air defense identification zone or crossing the center line within the Taiwan Strait, since the inauguration we have seen a 300% increase in those air activities,\u201d he said.",
      "From May 2023 until November 2023, China violated Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone 335 times, according to figures released by Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of National Defense compiled by NBC News. During that same timeframe this year, China violated that same airspace at least 1,085 times, more than three times as many as the previous year.",
      "During some months, the difference was even more pronounced. In July 2023, for example, 50 Chinese aircraft violated Taiwan's air defense zone. In July 2024, 210 did, more than four times as many.",
      "Schneider noted that the Chinese Air Force has maintained the increased activity level since Lai Ching-te was sworn in\u00a0on May 20.\u00a0Beijing, which views Lai a \u201cseparatist\u201d and a \u201ctroublemaker,\u201d claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, a view Lai and his government reject.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., defended the flights.",
      "\u201cThe PLA\u2019s relevant drills are a necessary and legitimate move to crack down on \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d separatist forces and their separatist activities and send a warning to external interference and provocations,\u201d said Liu Pengyu. It is fully consistent with international law and common practices.",
      "Schneider oversees more than 46,000 airmen in Japan, South Korea, Hawaii, Alaska and Guam. He said the biggest challenge he faces comes from Beijing, which is building a massive rocket force, an air force, a submarine force and a cyber force, and using these forces to intimidate other nations\u00a0in the region.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the behaviors that have gone along with that,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s the bullying, the aggressiveness.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy assessment is it\u2019s a pressurization campaign designed to win without fighting, and I think just to continue to impose costs, physical or otherwise, to present a fait accompli to the world,\u201d\u00a0he added.\u00a0\u201cNot just to Taiwan, but to the world that Beijing can accomplish their objectives, and they continue to ramp up their activities, military activities, in conjunction with diplomatic activities, informational activities, economic activities, to win without fighting.\u201d",
      "Will Trump defend Taiwan?",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has said that he intends to unify Taiwan with mainland China and has steadily ramped up military pressure on democratically governed Taiwan. U.S. intelligence officials say Xi has directed his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027.",
      "CIA Director William Burns has publicly said that does not mean Xi will invade in 2027, but \u201cit\u2019s a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and ambition.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials have pointed to 2027 as a possible inflection point for conflict between China and Taiwan, a year that now falls in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term in office.",
      "Trump has not committed to defending Taiwan during a Chinese military invasion.",
      "\u201cTaiwan should pay us for defense,\u201d he told Bloomberg Businessweek in July. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re no different than an insurance company.\u201d",
      "While Trump has repeatedly characterized the relationship as transactional, some senior advisers in his first term were among the most strident supporters of Taiwan, revising the process for arms sales to Taiwan and increasing the sales during Trump\u2019s administration, which also sent high-level officials to Taiwan. Both actions increased tensions between Washington and Beijing under President Trump.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how President-elect Trump will work with President Xi over the next four years.\u00a0But the two have spoken since Trump won the 2024 election, according to the Chinese government, which quoted Xi as telling Trump that the two nations must find a way to get along.",
      "A current U.S. official said the relationship between the two nations during President Joe Biden\u2019s term in office was also marked by tensions but made progress in some areas in recent years.",
      "\u201cChina for sure thought they\u2019d be back into a much better relationship with the Biden administration, and have been sorely disappointed,\u201d said a senior U.S. official who tracks Chinese politics.",
      "Gen. Schneider said the timing for possible action in 2027 by China is still unclear, but he warned that their behavior has grown more aggressive and that China is operating farther and farther away from mainland China, both in the air and at sea.",
      "Their\u00a0goal is to push the U.S. out of the region while building their military capabilities, which Schneider said Beijing learned from the U.S. military\u2019s military operations in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cWe had the ability to take our time, to bring our forces into the theater, to build up large bases, to build up our capability, and then at the time of our choosing, when we had the advantages of mass in place, was to be able to determine when we would go to conduct our operations,\u201d\u00a0he said.\u00a0\u201cI assess that Beijing has recognized that, and now that they are building this capability to prevent us from ever being able to do that and replicating it.\u201d",
      "Gen. Schneider said adversaries in the region could try to test a new\u00a0Trump administration in its early days. \u201cRegardless of which party wins, this is where the opportunist part comes in, that actors in the region may seek to challenge a new administration.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that we on the military side are ready for, and we continue to provide options back to our national leadership,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cEither to prevent or to deal with someone that would provide a test for a new administration early in your career.\u201d",
      "Ultimately,\u00a0Schneider added, the U.S. is still focused on preventing conflict in the region.",
      "\u201cWe continue to deter effectively. And for over 80 years, the peace, the relative peace and stability of this region, has been unwritten by the presence of the United States military and that of our partners and allies, and we will continue to do that,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cAnd if that peace, stability and security is unilaterally upended by anyone in the region, then we will react, and we will react with a network of allies and partners that is incredibly capable.\u201d"

      "Redmayne was sharing what he learned during physical training for an upcoming series, and after Mescal and Norton made jokes about using a phone to protect themselves during an altercation, Ronan reminded the actors how often women prepare for the possibility of physical violence.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what girls have to think about all the time. Am I right, ladies?\u201d Ronan asked, cutting laughter from Redmayne, Norton and others abruptly short.",
      "The moment went viral on social media, as some users emphasized not only with Ronan's point, but the reaction from her fellow actors and the audience.",
      "Ronan spoke about her comments on TODAY Nov. 7, saying that she thought it was important that the moment should be kept in context with the larger interview, in which the actors discussed the prep work needed to do certain jobs.",
      "She then went into detail on what surprised her about the viral response to her words.",
      "\"I guess what was really interesting about the response \u2014 that I totally was not expecting \u2014 is that this is the kind of conversation that I would have with my female and male friends, and we make points like this all the time,\" she said.",
      "Ronan referenced the murder of 33-year-old Sarah Everard in the U.K. in 2021. Everard was a marketing executive who disappeared while walking home from a friend's house in London. A week later, Everard's body was found about 50 miles away in a wooded area in Kent.",

      "Ronan reflected on the tragedy, saying, \"She followed all the rules, and she did everything that she was supposed to do to keep herself safe, and she still ended up dead. And I think that that really opened up this conversation for everyone back at home.\"",
      "The actor said that since Everard's murder, she's been more vocal in her personal life, with both women and men.",
      "\"So it was just sort of something that naturally came up on the show, but it's been really interesting to see what the response has been like,\" she said. \"It's just sort of gone everywhere.",
      "\"I think people have needed something like this, on a platform like that, to go, OK, we can talk about it now, and just to talk about that,\" she continued. \"And of course, it's not something that guys would have to think about, but I think it's really important for us, for all of our little young girls that are growing up, that we go like, 'This is the this is the mentality that a woman has to have, and that a young girl has to have every day ever.'\"",
      "Reps for Redmayne, Mescal and Washington did not respond to a request for comment from TODAY.com last month."

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 17:42:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Gen. Kevin Schneider, a top US commander in the region, told NBC News that Chinese military flights have increased dramatically since Taiwan\u2019s new president took office in May.",
    "story": [
      "The\u00a0Chinese military has\u00a0increased\u00a0its provocative flights around Taiwan by 300% over the last five months, according to the commander of the U.S. Air Forces in the Indo-Pacific Command.",
      "In an exclusive interview with NBC News, Gen. Kevin Schneider warned that People\u2019s Liberation Air Force activities have increased dramatically since Taiwan\u2019s new president was inaugurated in May.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s coming into the air defense identification zone or crossing the center line within the Taiwan Strait, since the inauguration we have seen a 300% increase in those air activities,\u201d he said.",
      "From May 2023 until November 2023, China violated Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone 335 times, according to figures released by Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of National Defense compiled by NBC News. During that same timeframe this year, China violated that same airspace at least 1,085 times, more than three times as many as the previous year.",
      "During some months, the difference was even more pronounced. In July 2023, for example, 50 Chinese aircraft violated Taiwan's air defense zone. In July 2024, 210 did, more than four times as many.",
      "Schneider noted that the Chinese Air Force has maintained the increased activity level since Lai Ching-te was sworn in\u00a0on May 20.\u00a0Beijing, which views Lai a \u201cseparatist\u201d and a \u201ctroublemaker,\u201d claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, a view Lai and his government reject.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., defended the flights.",
      "\u201cThe PLA\u2019s relevant drills are a necessary and legitimate move to crack down on \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d separatist forces and their separatist activities and send a warning to external interference and provocations,\u201d said Liu Pengyu. It is fully consistent with international law and common practices.",
      "Schneider oversees more than 46,000 airmen in Japan, South Korea, Hawaii, Alaska and Guam. He said the biggest challenge he faces comes from Beijing, which is building a massive rocket force, an air force, a submarine force and a cyber force, and using these forces to intimidate other nations\u00a0in the region.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the behaviors that have gone along with that,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s the bullying, the aggressiveness.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy assessment is it\u2019s a pressurization campaign designed to win without fighting, and I think just to continue to impose costs, physical or otherwise, to present a fait accompli to the world,\u201d\u00a0he added.\u00a0\u201cNot just to Taiwan, but to the world that Beijing can accomplish their objectives, and they continue to ramp up their activities, military activities, in conjunction with diplomatic activities, informational activities, economic activities, to win without fighting.\u201d",
      "Will Trump defend Taiwan?",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has said that he intends to unify Taiwan with mainland China and has steadily ramped up military pressure on democratically governed Taiwan. U.S. intelligence officials say Xi has directed his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027.",
      "CIA Director William Burns has publicly said that does not mean Xi will invade in 2027, but \u201cit\u2019s a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and ambition.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials have pointed to 2027 as a possible inflection point for conflict between China and Taiwan, a year that now falls in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term in office.",
      "Trump has not committed to defending Taiwan during a Chinese military invasion.",
      "\u201cTaiwan should pay us for defense,\u201d he told Bloomberg Businessweek in July. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re no different than an insurance company.\u201d",
      "While Trump has repeatedly characterized the relationship as transactional, some senior advisers in his first term were among the most strident supporters of Taiwan, revising the process for arms sales to Taiwan and increasing the sales during Trump\u2019s administration, which also sent high-level officials to Taiwan. Both actions increased tensions between Washington and Beijing under President Trump.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how President-elect Trump will work with President Xi over the next four years.\u00a0But the two have spoken since Trump won the 2024 election, according to the Chinese government, which quoted Xi as telling Trump that the two nations must find a way to get along.",
      "A current U.S. official said the relationship between the two nations during President Joe Biden\u2019s term in office was also marked by tensions but made progress in some areas in recent years.",
      "\u201cChina for sure thought they\u2019d be back into a much better relationship with the Biden administration, and have been sorely disappointed,\u201d said a senior U.S. official who tracks Chinese politics.",
      "Gen. Schneider said the timing for possible action in 2027 by China is still unclear, but he warned that their behavior has grown more aggressive and that China is operating farther and farther away from mainland China, both in the air and at sea.",
      "Their\u00a0goal is to push the U.S. out of the region while building their military capabilities, which Schneider said Beijing learned from the U.S. military\u2019s military operations in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cWe had the ability to take our time, to bring our forces into the theater, to build up large bases, to build up our capability, and then at the time of our choosing, when we had the advantages of mass in place, was to be able to determine when we would go to conduct our operations,\u201d\u00a0he said.\u00a0\u201cI assess that Beijing has recognized that, and now that they are building this capability to prevent us from ever being able to do that and replicating it.\u201d",
      "Gen. Schneider said adversaries in the region could try to test a new\u00a0Trump administration in its early days. \u201cRegardless of which party wins, this is where the opportunist part comes in, that actors in the region may seek to challenge a new administration.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that we on the military side are ready for, and we continue to provide options back to our national leadership,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cEither to prevent or to deal with someone that would provide a test for a new administration early in your career.\u201d",
      "Ultimately,\u00a0Schneider added, the U.S. is still focused on preventing conflict in the region.",
      "\u201cWe continue to deter effectively. And for over 80 years, the peace, the relative peace and stability of this region, has been unwritten by the presence of the United States military and that of our partners and allies, and we will continue to do that,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cAnd if that peace, stability and security is unilaterally upended by anyone in the region, then we will react, and we will react with a network of allies and partners that is incredibly capable.\u201d"

    "summary": "An Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza has killed at least 20 people, mostly women and children, Palestinian officials said Tuesday, as Israel wages a nearly monthlong air and ground operation in what was already the most isolated and heavily destroyed part of the territory.",
    "story": [
      "An Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza has killed at least 20 people, mostly women and children, Palestinian officials said Tuesday, as Israel wages a nearly monthlong air and ground operation in what was already\u00a0the most isolated and heavily destroyed\u00a0part of the territory.",
      "The strike late Monday hit a home where several displaced families were sheltering in the town of Beit Lahiya, near the border with Israel, according to Hossam Abu Safiya, the director of\u00a0the recently raided and barely functioning\u00a0Kamal Adwan Hospital, which received the casualties.",
      "The dead included eight women and six children, according to a list provided by the Gaza Health Ministry\u2019s emergency service.\u00a0Separate strikes elsewhere in Gaza\u00a0early Tuesday killed another 10 people, according to health officials.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.",
      "Israel launched the offensive in the north after saying Hamas militants had regrouped there. The army has returned to several areas of Gaza multiple times after previous operations, as Hamas continues to carry out hit-and-run attacks on troops and fire occasional rockets into Israel.",
      "The military has ordered the complete evacuation of Beit Lahiya, the nearby town of Beit Hanoun and the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, and has allowed almost no humanitarian aid into the area for over a month. That has\u00a0drawn rebukes from the Biden administration, which has warned that U.S. laws might force it to curb military aid to Israel if more aid is not allowed in.",
      "Tens of thousands of people have fled to nearby Gaza City in\u00a0the latest wave of displacement\u00a0within the besieged territory. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million have fled during the war, often multiple times.",
      "The three hospitals serving the area have been largely inaccessible because of the fighting, and ambulances have stopped operating. Israeli troops raided Kamal Adwan Hospital last month, saying Hamas militants were sheltering there, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials.",
      "The offensive has raised fears among Palestinians that Israel is implementing\u00a0a surrender-or-starve plan\u00a0for northern Gaza proposed by former generals, in which civilians would be ordered out, aid would be cut off and anyone remaining would be considered a fighter.",
      "The Israeli military has denied receiving such orders, but the government has not said whether it is adopting part or all of the plan.",
      "Palestinian officials said a separate wave of Israeli strikes early Tuesday killed 10 people, including four children and two women.",
      "One strike hit a house in the Tufah neighborhood in Gaza City, killing two children and their parents, according to the Health Ministry\u2019s emergency service. Two other children were wounded, it said.",
      "In the central town of Zuweida, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent where a displaced family was sheltering, killing four people, including a mother and her two children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah. Another strike hit a house in Deir al-Balah, killing two people, the hospital said. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue.",
      "The Israeli military says it only targets militants and accuses them of hiding among civilians. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 250 hostages. Around 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its toll but says over half of those killed were women and children."

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 14:17:30 GMT",
    "summary": "An Israeli court on Sunday partially lifted a gag order on a case investigating leaks of classified Gaza documents suspected to involve one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s media advisers.",
    "story": [
      "Arrests. Classified documents. And suspected leaks that may have harmed efforts to free hostages held by Hamas in order, critics say, to give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu public cover for failing to agree to a cease-fire deal. Netanyahu was engulfed in scandal Monday over a case involving one of his aides that has sent shock waves across the country.",
      "The firestorm \u2014 brought into public view when an Israeli court loosened a gag order Sunday night \u2014 has enraged Netanyahu's political opponents and hostages\u2019 families. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and distanced himself from the case, but critics have alleged that he put hostages' lives and national security at risk to buttress his hard-line position in stalled cease-fire talks by leaking Gaza documents to friendly media outlets.",
      "In a ruling Sunday, the Rishon Le-Zion Magistrates\u2019 Court\u00a0said an investigation had been launched after suspicions arose within the Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Security Agency, or the Shin Bet, that \"classified and sensitive intelligence\" had been illegally taken from IDF systems.",
      "The action, the court said, may not only have caused \u201cserious harm to state security and the endangerment of intelligence sources,\" but it also could have harmed \"the goal of releasing the hostages\" who were taken captive during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.",
      "The court identified the central suspect in the case as Eliezer Feldstein, reported by Israeli media to have been one of Netanyahu\u2019s media advisers.",
      "In addition to Feldstein, three other people the court described as \"detainees involved in the activities\" were questioned. The court has yet to publicly identify them.",
      "Israeli media have reported that the information suspected of being leaked formed the basis of multiple articles on Hamas' approach to the hostage situation, including an article published by the London-based Jewish Chronicle that was later withdrawn after widespread criticism. NBC News was not immediately able to independently confirm that reporting.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle article had suggested that Hamas planned to move hostages out of Gaza through Egypt, while a separate article published by the German newspaper Bild reported that Hamas was drawing out negotiations for a cease-fire deal as a form of psychological warfare on Israel.",
      "Both articles drew skepticism from Israeli observers given their timing and the apparent cover they gave Netanyahu as he was accused of deliberately sabotaging cease-fire negotiations.",
      "\u201cThere was something very fishy about them. Also about the timing of everything,\u201d Mairav Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle and Bild did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The reports emerged as Netanyahu insisted on Israeli control over the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt, a demand that became a major sticking point in cease-fire talks. They also came as Netanyahu faced mounting outrage from hostages\u2019 families and much of the country's public over his failure to agree to a cease-fire deal after six hostages were killed in Hamas' captivity.",
      "While Israeli media had reported some details of the probe and the gag order had been partially lifted last week, it was not until Sunday that crucial and explosive allegations were revealed.",
      "In a statement before the ruling, Netanyahu's office said the materials suspected of being leaked had never reached the prime minister's office from the Military Intelligence Directorate and that Netanyahu had learned about the document in question from the media.",
      "It added that the aide implicated in the suspected leaks had \"never participated in security discussions, was not exposed or received classified information, and did not take part in secret visits.\"",
      "But political opponents, hostages\u2019 families and critics expressed outrage over the potential involvement of one of Netanyahu's aides.",
      "\"It\u2019s left me yet again disappointed but not surprised by this government,\" said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui was taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7.",
      "\"I feel utterly betrayed, not just as a hostage father but as an Israeli citizen,\" he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "Dekel-Chen said that if the allegations raised in the investigation are true, it would be the latest in a \"long series\" of moments when Netanyahu's government has \"invented reasons to not move forward in the negotiation process.\"",
      "Gil Dickmann's cousin Carmel Gat was one of six hostages killed in Hamas captivity \u2014 an incident that sparked national outrage not long before the media reports were published.",
      "He noted the timing but said that if the intention was to sway public opinion, \"it didn't work,\" as he pointed to major demonstrations in the following days pressuring Netanyahu to secure a cease-fire.",
      "In a statement, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of those still in Hamas captivity, expressed \u201coutrage and deep concern\u201d at the possibility that at least one Netanyahu aide may have \u201cworked to undermine public support\u201d for a deal.",
      "Benny Gantz, who resigned from Netanyahu's now-dissolved war Cabinet in June, said on X that \"if sensitive security information was stolen and used as a tool in a political survival campaign, it\u2019s not just a criminal offense; it\u2019s a national crime.\"",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid rejected claims from Netanyahu's office that Netanyahu had been previously unaware of the materials alleged to have been leaked.",
      "\"If Netanyahu didn\u2019t know that his close aides were stealing documents, planting spies within the IDF, forging documents, exposing intelligence sources, and passing classified documents to the foreign press to stop the hostage deal\u2014what *does* he know?\" Lapid said on X.",
      "Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said that even if Netanyahu was not directly involved, the suspected leak would have emerged from a \u201cwell-oiled machine that is already accustomed to taking sensitive information and manipulating it for political purposes.\u201d",
      "But she said that would not \"come as a surprise at all.\"",
      "\"I think for the people who are already convinced that Netanyahu was playing with the public's consciousness and wasn't interested in a hostage deal, this is kind of just further proof,\" she said."

      "Centuries on and it turns out that long-held assumptions about some of the people of Pompeii should not have been set in stone.",

      "Pompeii's victims were later immortalized by archaeologists who used plaster to fill the voids left by their bodies and observers have long created stories based on these casts, one of which was long assumed to be a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they died.",
      "But the DNA analysis has shown the person thought to be the mother was actually a man who was unrelated to the child, according to the new research.",
      "And at least one of the people locked in the embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter \u2014 was a man.",

      "The twin-jet then \u201creally labored\u201d to gain altitude, he said, adding that the \u201cone engine was really pumping it out hard to get us into the air.\u201d",
      "The jet took off shortly after 12:35 p.m. local time (8:35 p.m. ET Thursday), according to data from the flight-tracking platform FlightRadar24.",
      "\u201cAfter circling for a short period of time, the aircraft landed safely at Sydney Airport,\u201d Qantas\u2019 chief pilot, Capt. Richard Tobiano said in a statement.",
      "The plane \u201cwas banking a lot\u201d as it turned to prepare for its eventual descent back into Sydney, Willacy said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel as stable as it would normally feel when you when you\u2019re doing those turns,\u201d he added.",
      "In a separate statement Sydney Airport said the \u201cdeparture of aircraft coincided with a grass fire along the eastern side of the airport\u2019s parallel runway.\u201d",
      "Firefighters brought this under control, the statement said, adding that it was \u201cnot clear at this stage if the two incidents are linked and investigations are continuing.\u201d",
      "It is unclear if this complicated the flight 520's descent, but the airport said by 5 p.m. local time (1 a.m. ET Friday) it had returned to full operation."

    "story": [
      "China\u2019s new J-35A stealth fighter jet will be displayed for the first time next week at the country\u2019s biggest civil and military airshow, a biennial event where Beijing showcases its expanding aerospace industry.",
      "The six-day China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition begins Tuesday in the southern Greater Bay city of Zhuhai. The 2022 edition of the event led to about $40 billion in \u201ccooperation agreements\u201d being signed, according to its organizers.",
      "Developing domestic aerospace design and manufacturing capabilities is a major strategic priority for Beijing as it vies for regional military dominance with the U.S. amid escalating tensions around Taiwan and the South China Sea.",
      "China also seeks to reduce its reliance on foreign imports, a concern borne out after the election as the next U.S. president this week of Donald Trump, who has been vocal about increasing trade tariffs and decoupling supply chains from the world\u2019s second-largest economy.",
      "Alongside drones, weapons systems, aircraft and electronic warfare technologies, China\u2019s emerging role as a commercial airliner manufacturer through state-owned planemaker COMAC will be on display.",
      "As the expected highlight of the show, the People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) will reveal to the public the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation\u2019s J-35A, which the air force described last week as a \u201cmedium-sized stealth multi-purpose fighter.\u201d",
      "Russia has also flown its most advanced fighter jet, the SU-57, to Zhuhai for its first airshow abroad, in an apparent message to the West about China-Russia cooperation.",
      "The J-35A, which uses airstrips to take off and land, is a variant of the J-35, a stealthy aircraft China is developing for use on aircraft carriers. Little is known about its performance or capabilities, although it superficially resembles the Lockheed Martin F-35.",
      "The J-35 program is a follow-on from China\u2019s J-31 fighter, which made its public debut at the Zhuhai show in 2014 but was never used by the People\u2019s Liberation Army or sold to foreign customers.",
      "Diplomats and security analysts have closely watched the evolution of J-35 variants given the importance of the plane to China\u2019s aircraft carrier program, which seeks to expand jets\u2019 range and payload to project power beyond China\u2019s home waters.",
      "Monday marks the 75th anniversary of the PLAAF, which will have its largest presence at the airshow, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "This year\u2019s Zhuhai airshow is its first post-pandemic edition since Beijing lifted its zero-Covid policy and travel restrictions in 2023.",
      "Airbus and the world\u2019s third-largest planemaker, Embraer, will have a presence at the show, but Boeing will not be officially represented after new CEO Kelly Ortberg halted travel to industry events as the troubled U.S. manufacturer recovers from a damaging seven-week workers\u2019 strike that ended this week.",
      "Beijing has invested heavily in developing homegrown commercial planes, and engines that one day may replace the foreign versions that currently power COMAC\u2019s jets.",
      "COMAC-watchers will, in particular, be paying attention to a possible rebranding of the company\u2019s ARJ21 regional jet, after one was spotted by aviation enthusiasts in mid-October at a Chinese airport with C909 painted on its blue tail, instead of ARJ21.",
      "Although largely symbolic, the change \u2014 which would align with the manufacturer\u2019s naming convention for its other models \u2014 signals Beijing\u2019s growing intention to present itself as a full-scale alternative to Airbus and Boeing, which are both struggling to keep up with demand.",
      "Industry sources say COMAC is a long way off from making inroads internationally without benchmark certifications from the E.U. \u2014 which COMAC is pursuing for its C919 airliner \u2014 or the U.S.",
      "In particular, competing with Western engines poses one of the most daunting challenges for China\u2019s rising aerospace industry, even after a spate of industrial problems in the West.",
      "Even so, Chinese manufacturers will benefit from the sheer scale of their domestic market, analysts say. China is the world\u2019s second-largest domestic aviation market after the U.S.",
      "Boeing has said China will more than double its commercial airplane fleet and need 8,830 new planes by 2043."

    "summary": "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol denied wrongdoing on Thursday in a burgeoning influence-peddling scandal involving him and the first lady.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol denied wrongdoing on Thursday in a burgeoning influence-peddling scandal involving him and his wife that is severely hurting his approval ratings and providing political munition to his rivals.",
      "The political firestorm coincides with South Korea facing a slew of critical foreign policy issues, such as Donald Trump\u2019s election win to become the next president of the United States and North Korea\u2019s reported entry into the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "The scandal centers around allegations that Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee exerted inappropriate influence on the conservative governing People Power Party to pick a certain candidate to run for a parliamentary by-election in 2022 at the request of Myung Tae-kyun, an election broker and founder of a polling agency who conducted free opinion surveys for Yoon before he became president.",
      "For weeks, the scandal has been making headlines in South Korea as Myung\u2019s leaked phone conversations show he boasted of his influence over the presidential couple and other top governing party officials.",
      "Asked about his ties with Myung during a news conference Thursday, Yoon said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything inappropriate and have nothing to hide regarding Myung Tae-kyun.\u201d",
      "Yoon said he has never meddled in any candidate nomination process at the PPP, and had never asked Myung to carry out surveys for him, though he acknowledged that Myung gave him some sort of help during his presidential primary campaign in 2021.",
      "The main liberal opposition Democratic Party said Yoon\u2019s response only showed his \u201carrogance\u201d and \u201cself-righteousness.\u201d The party earlier demanded that Yoon apologize, reshuffle top officials and accept an independent investigation into his wife.",
      "The Democratic Party recently shared what it said was an audio file of phone calls between Yoon and Myung on May 9, 2022 \u2014 a day before Yoon took office for a single five-year term. The opposition party alleges that the conversation proves Yoon provided Myung with political favors in return for free surveys.",
      "In the audio file, Yoon can be heard telling Myung that he asked a PPP committee to pick senior party member Kim Young-sun to run for one of the parliamentary by-elections the following month. Kim Young-sun eventually obtained the party\u2019s nomination and won the election.",
      "In the file, Myung is heard saying, \u201cI really won\u2019t forget this favor for my entire life. Thank you!\u201d",
      "South Korea\u2019s election law bars public servants, including the president, from interfering in elections, but applies no such restrictions to a president-elect, so it\u2019s unclear whether Yoon violated the law.",
      "Recent surveys showed Yoon\u2019s approval rating has fallen below 20% for the first time since his inauguration. Kim Keon Hee has been grappling with other scandals, such as spy camera footage purportedly showing her accepting a luxury bag as a gift from a pastor.",
      "Yoon apologized for causing public concerns about him and his wife, but stressed that many of the allegations raised were not consistent with the facts.",
      "Some governing party lawmakers have accused the Democratic Party of deliberately ramping up political attacks on Yoon and his wife in an effort to rescue its embattled leader, Lee Jae-myung, from legal troubles.",
      "Lee, a firebrand lawmaker who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, is undergoing four separate trials over corruption and various other allegations. The first two district court rulings on Lee over his election law violation and perjury charges are set for Nov. 15 and Nov. 25.",
      "Either a prison sentence or a fine of more than 1 million won ($750) in the election law case would unseat Lee as a lawmaker and disqualify him from running in elections for five years, although he is likely to appeal any guilty verdict.",
      "Surveys show Lee is the early favorite for the 2027 presidential race to succeed Yoon.",
      "On foreign policy, Yoon \u2014 who has worked closely with Washington and Tokyo to solidify security cooperation in the face of North Korean threats \u2014 expressed optimism that the three-way partnership will continue to expand under Trump\u2019s government. He said he wants to meet Trump and new Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba soon to coordinate policies.",
      "During his previous presidency, Trump engaged in highly orchestrated nuclear summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Yoon noted that North Korea\u2019s arsenal has significantly advanced since Trump\u2019s diplomacy with Kim collapsed in 2019.",
      "Yoon said Trump \u201cwill be receiving comprehensive reports very soon about how North Korea\u2019s nuclear technologies and capabilities have changed since then.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter he receives these reports, I think we can have more meaningful and in-depth discussions when we have the opportunity to meet,\u201d Yoon said.",
      "When asked about concerns that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach would damage South Korean interests in trade through increased tariffs and other measures, Yoon said Seoul was making \u201cmultifaceted efforts to minimize the losses to our people\u2019s economy.\u201d",
      "\u201cThings can\u2019t be exactly the same as they were during the Biden administration,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we have been preparing to hedge these risks for a long time.\u201d",
      "Earlier Thursday, Yoon had a telephone call with Trump, congratulating him on his election win and discussing strengthening bilateral cooperation. The two agreed to arrange an in-person meeting soon, according to Yoon\u2019s office."

      "According to a Nov. 5 court order, India\u2019s government told the Delhi High Court that the import ban order \u201cwas untraceable and, therefore could not be produced.\u201d",
      "As a result, the court said it had \u201cno other option except to presume that no such notification exists.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe ban has been lifted as of Nov. 5 because there is no notification,\u201d said Uddyam Mukherjee, lawyer for petitioner Sandipan Khan.",

      "Khan\u2019s plea said he approached the court after being told at bookstores that the novel could not be sold or imported in India and then when he searched, he could not find the official import ban order on government websites.",
      "Even in court the government has been unable to produce the order, he said.",
      "\u201cNone of the respondents could produce the said notification ... in fact the purported author of the said notification has also shown his helplessness in producing a copy,\u201d the Nov. 5 order noted, referring to the customs department official who drafted the order.",
      "Rushdie\u2019s fourth fictional novel ran into a global controversy shortly after its publication in September 1988, as some Muslims saw passages about Prophet Muhammad as blasphemous.",
      "It set off violent demonstrations and book burnings across the Muslim world, including in India, which has the world\u2019s third-largest Muslim population.",
      "In 1989, Iran\u2019s then-supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a fatwa, or religious edict, calling on Muslims to assassinate Rushdie, sending the Booker Prize-winning author into hiding for six years.",
      "In August 2022, about 33 years after the fatwa, Rushdie was stabbed on stage during a lecture in New York, which left him blind in one eye and affected the use of one of his hands."
