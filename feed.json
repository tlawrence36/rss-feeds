      "One hundred years after Charlie Chaplin made dinner rolls dance and ate his shoe like it was a fine meal, \u201cThe Gold Rush\u201d has been vividly brought back to life in a new restoration that premiered Tuesday at the Cannes Film Festival",
      "CANNES, France -- One hundred years after Charlie Chaplin made dinner rolls dance and ate his shoe like it was a fine meal, \u201cThe Gold Rush\u201d has been vividly brought back to life in a new restoration that premiered Tuesday at the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "On the opening day of its 78th edition, Cannes debuted a 4K restoration of \u201cThe Gold Rush,\u201d one of Chaplin\u2019s most beloved silent masterpieces. The screening, held just before the festival\u2019s official opening ceremony, was part of a new day-one tradition for restored films, festival director Thierry Fremaux said before the screening at Cannes\u2019 Debussy Theatre.",
      "Years in the making, this \u201cGold Rush\u201d pristinely restores Chaplin\u2019s Tramp to all his downtrodden glory. The 1925 Alaskan frontier comedy may be marking its centenary, but it looks bracingly fresh in the restoration carried out by La Cineteca di Bologna.",
      "The restoration was more complicated than most because it included an extensive search for any missing footage. In 1942, Chaplin edited the film and re-released it with sound effects, music and narration. That version landed two Oscar nominations, but the restoration sought to get as close to the 1925 original as possible.",
      "In \u201cThe Gold Rush\u201d Chaplin's lone prospector ambles through the snowy Alaskan wilds in pursuit less of gold than some food and perhaps companionship. His antic, cliff-dangling struggles make up much of the film's deft slapstick, but the Little Tramp's humble, sweet hopes for romance greatly exceed his strike-it-rich ambitions.",
      "The film's premiere drew two grandchildren of Chaplin: Kiera Chaplin and Spencer Chaplin.",
      "\u201cWhat to say about \u2018The Gold Rush?' said Spencer Chaplin. \u201cIt was his biggest production to date. He built the set \u2014 it was almost like a tourist attraction in L.A. at the time. He built the mountains.\u201d",
      "The screening in Cannes drew a packed house in one of Cannes' largest theaters, a crowd that the Chaplin descendants warmly surveyed.",
      "\u201cOur grandfather would be really proud to see this, a hundred years later, to see all you here and interested in seeing the film,\u201d said Kiera Chaplin.",
      "\u201cThe Gold Rush\u201d will roll out in theaters worldwide on June 26 in a release organized by mk2 Films.",

      "A former model testifying in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s retrial on sexual assault charges is being questioned about a private journal she wrote a decade ago",
      "NEW YORK -- A former teen fashion model testifying in Harvey Weinstein \u2019s retrial on sexual assault charges was confronted on the stand Tuesday with a private journal where defense attorneys say she wrote about people who sexually abused her.",
      "As one of Weinstein\u2019s lawyers began to question her about the handwritten journal, Kaja Sokola protested that it shouldn\u2019t be discussed in open court as she\u2019d written it as part of a substance abuse treatment program years ago.",
      "\u201cThis is very inappropriate,\u201d she pleaded as the attorney began to cite portions of the text, which they say was originally written in Polish in 2015. \u201cPlease don\u2019t read that. This is my personal things. I\u2019m not on trial here.\u201d",
      "Judge Curtis Farber dismissed the jury for a lunch break as Sokola began to get emotional.",
      "He assured her later that he would allow the jury to hear limited questioning around the document. The judge also said he had concerns about the journal\u2019s completeness and authenticity, wondering how defense lawyers had obtained what appears to be private medical records.",
      "\u201cThis might backfire tremendously\u201d for the defense, Farber said at one point, as prosecutors also strongly opposed inclusion of the journal as evidence in the trial. \u201cThat\u2019s the risk they\u2019re willing to take.\u201d",
      "Sokola, who is now a 39-year-old psychotherapist, continued to push back. Her testimony was expected to resume Tuesday afternoon after a lunch break.",
      "\u201cThis is unethical,\u201d she insisted to the judge. \u201cI would never do this to my patient, and I would never do this to myself.\u201d",
      "Michael Cibella, one of Weinstein\u2019s lawyers, told Farber that the defense team intends to question Sokola on a part of the journal where she describes at least five sexual assaults she\u2019s suffered over her life.",
      "Weinstein, they say, is not among those she named, though he does appear elsewhere in the journal. They say she references her frustration and disappointment after a \u201cHarvey W\u201d had led her along, \u201cpromising me help\u201d but \u201cnothing came out of it.\u201d",
      "Sokola testified last week that Weinstein exploited her dreams of an acting career to subject her to unwanted sexual advances, starting days after they met in 2002, while she was a 16-year-old on a modeling trip to New York.",
      "Some of those allegations are beyond the legal time limit for criminal charges, but Weinstein faces a criminal sex act charge over Sokola\u2019s claim that he forced oral sex on her in 2006.",
      "Prosecutors added the charge to the landmark #MeToo case last year, after an appeals court overturned Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction. The guilty verdict pertained to allegations from two other women, who also have testified or are expected to testify at the retrial.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies ever sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "His lawyers, in their cross-examination of Sokola that began Friday, have sought to raise doubts about her allegations, portraying her as a wannabe actor who tried to leverage her consensual relations with the former studio boss.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted, but Sokola has given her permission to be identified.",

      "A \u201cSpace Man\u201d has been at Eurovision before, but never a Time Lord",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 \u201cDoctor Who\u201d and Eurovision unite for an evening of music and intergalactic adventure on Saturday \u2014 all thanks to Russell T Davies.",
      "Before fans tune in for the annual song contest, they can enjoy Ncuti Gatwa\u2019s Doctor and Varada Sethu's Belinda Chandra attending the Interstellar Song Contest in an episode of the sci-fi series.",
      "In real life, the Eurovision Song Contest is an annual musical competition and TV event that sees 37 countries compete for a crystal microphone trophy over a four-hour live broadcast. In the interstellar version, aliens from 40 different worlds vie to win, also by singing.",
      "Davies says it took three years to pull it off the doubleheader because they had to work with the BBC to set the schedule and storylines in stone to ensure a perfect alignment.",
      "Britain\u2019s Sam Ryder took a \u201cSpace Man\u201d to Eurovision before, in 2022. Now, Gatwa will read out the U.K.\u2019s jury scores during the song contest's grand final, held this year in Basel, Switzerland.",
      "Talking to The Associated Press, Davies says that both Eurovision and \u201cDoctor Who\u201d share the DNA of old-fashioned Saturday night television, making the combination \u201cirresistible.\u201d",
      "This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "DAVIES: I almost think every episode of \u201cDoctor Who\u201d is a great big celebration, sort of noise and color and spectacle, and that sums up Eurovision as well. In pitching this to Disney+ as well it\u2019s like, \u201cLook we\u2019re going out in 60 of your territories\u201d and Eurovision itself has a viewing figure that some years is bigger than the Super Bowl. There\u2019s not many shows that can say that on planet Earth.",
      "DAVIES: It\u2019s enormous fun. It could be said if you\u2019ve never seen a single Eurovision Song Contest in your life, you can still come along and watch this. It\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019d have made up for a \u201cDoctor Who\u201d story anyway.",
      "One day I\u2019ll do that \u201cABBA Voyage\u201d story where the holograms come to life and start killing people. That\u2019s the best idea ever. We\u2019ve got to do that one then. Can you imagine? That would be just amazing. I think there might be some copyright problems with that but we\u2019d overcome them.",
      "The actual pitch for the story to Juno (Dawson), who wrote it, was Eurovision meets \u201cDie Hard.\u201d So as you will see, the moment it starts, there\u2019s trouble, someone\u2019s out to sabotage it. There are villains behind the scenes trying to disrupt the program. All chaos is let loose and the rest of the episode is spent saving people\u2019s lives after that.",
      "DAVIES: I think there\u2019s four songs in total (by Murray Gold). Obviously we don\u2019t get to all 40 planets with their songs, but it was a very big production. We had to hive this off into its own production unit. There are scenes in the television gallery, where 40 different monitors have output of 40 different screens. And that\u2019s all been fed in live. That\u2019s not done with green screen afterwards, that\u2019s all stuff they\u2019d already shot. Crowds, acts, rehearsals, backstage, presenters, all of that stuff, playing onto that set, so it\u2019s terribly complicated.",
      "DAVIES: Frankly, they\u2019re all expensive. It was a lot, yes. It had to be planned very far in advance, more than any. Once you plan something carefully, then it costs less just because you\u2019re not busking. We allocate each story more or less the same amount of money. So I think it ends up costing as much as the others, but it just looks so good because they had so much time to plan it.",
      "DAVIES: We never say that. I don\u2019t know why, but we just don\u2019t ever do it. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d tell me. I\u2019d faint.",
      "DAVIES: Yes, I will be. This will be a great night. I always sit and watch \u201cDoctor Who\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m old-fashioned \u2014 on its old-fashioned BBC One transmission at 7 o\u2019clock at night.",
      "I know people who have Eurovision parties, which I\u2019ve never gone to actually. Look at my life, it\u2019s devoted to television. I can\u2019t bear other people talking over it. That would just be a nightmare. So I will be sitting in. I\u2019ll get some nice dinner. I\u2019ll be a very happy man.",
      "DAVIES: I would like to go on a date with the man from Cyprus (Theo Evan). He\u2019s beautiful. I do like the U.K. entry this year (\u201cWhat the Hell Just Happened?\u201d by Remember Monday). I have a theory it\u2019s being underestimated in Great Britain. Just because we\u2019re so used to losing. We\u2019ve won five times, everyone. But this country gets a bit cynical about Eurovision sometimes. But I love our song. I think it\u2019s got a very memorable chorus.",

      "CANNES, France -- The 78th Cannes Film Festival got underway Tuesday, kicking off two weeks of French Riviera frenzy. Here are five things to look for at this year\u2019s Cannes:",
      "It might still be springtime, but, make no mistake, multiple Oscar campaigns will be launched in Cannes.",
      "Recent Cannes editions have produced several best-picture winners, including Bong Joon Ho\u2019s \u201cParasite\u201d and this year\u2019s winner, \u201cAnora\u201d by Sean Baker. The sway Cannes has on the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has only grown in recent years as the academy has expanded its overseas membership \u2014 many of them European voters who closely follow the buzz in Cannes.",
      "At the Oscars in March, three Cannes entries \u2014 \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cEmilia Perez\u201d and \u201cThe Substance\u201d \u2014 were among the 10 best-picture nominees. Less heralded movies can also emerge. The Latvian animated charmer \u201cFlow\u201d premiered last year in Cannes before its upset win at the Oscars.",
      "Before we get to the Academy Awards, though, Cannes will hand out its own prize, the Palme d\u2019Or.",
      "Deliberations by the jury (headed this year by Juliette Binoche ) are held entirely in private, so predicting the Palme is no easier than it was guessing the next pope. That doesn\u2019t stop bookies from handicapping the race and plenty of guesswork up and down the Croisette.",
      "This year\u2019s competition lineup features two previous Palme winners in Julia Ducournau (who returns with \u201cAlpha,\u201d her follow-up to \u201cTitane\u201d) and Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (two-time winners, back this year with \u201cThe Young Mother\u2019s Home\u201d).",
      "Some of the movies that could be in the mix include Lynne Ramsay\u2019s \u201cDie, My Love,\u201d Jafar Panahi\u2019s \u201cA Simple Accident\u201d and Mascha Schilinksi\u2019s \u201cSound of Falling.\u201d Or it could be Chie Hayakawa\u2019s \u201cRenoir,\u201d Joachim Trier\u2019s \u201cSentimental Value\u201d or Ari Aster\u2019s \u201cEddington.\u201d Or it could be \u2026 well, you get the idea.",
      "Cannes has a power to burnish even the most established stars, and its red carpet will, for the next 10 days, host a nonstop parade of them. (And they will be clothed, as per Cannes\u2019 latest etiquette protocol.)",
      "Among those on tap are Tom Cruise with \u201cMission Impossible: Final Reckoning\u201d on Wednesday; Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d with Denzel Washington; Wes Anderson\u2019s \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d with a cast featuring Benicio Del Toro and Michael Cera; Ari Aster\u2019s \u201cEddington,\u201d with Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal and Emma Stone; and Oliver Hermanus\u2019 \u201cThe History of Sound,\u201d with Paul Mescal and Josh O\u2019Connor.",
      "O\u2019Connor also stars in Kelly Reichardt\u2019s \u201cThe Mastermind,\u201d scheduled as one of the festival\u2019s last premieres.",
      "Three stars are coming to Cannes with their first features behind the camera: Scarlett Johansson (\u201cEleanor the Great\u201d), Kristen Stewart (\u201cThe Chronology of Water\u201d) and Harris Dickinson (\u201cUrchin\u201d). All are premiering in the Cannes sidebar Un Certain Regard, which means they won\u2019t have quite the pressure of the competition lineup. But there\u2019s no calm or easygoing section of Cannes, and each could emerge from the festival either minted as a filmmaker or humbled by critics.",
      "While Cannes movie screens light up with films, deal making transpires along the Croisette. Cannes draws studios, producers and sales agents all on the hunt for acquisitions. But when U.S. President Donald Trump last week announced that he wants to enact tariffs on films made outside the U.S., it threw a giant wrench in the border-crossing dealmaking that Cannes specializes in. Yet with little detail on any possible tariffs and widespread doubt over its feasibility, the buying and selling of movies might not be slowed.",

      "\u201cI was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,\u201d Kardashian told a French court, recalling how one robber pulled her toward him while she was wearing only a bathrobe. \u201cI absolutely did think I was going to die,\u201d she added.",
      "It marked the first time Kardashian has confronted the men accused of tying her up at gunpoint in her hotel suite during Fashion Week and stealing more than $6 million in jewelry.",
      "Her appearance is the emotional peak of a trial that has gripped France and reignited global debates over celebrity, privacy, and digital-age exposure.",
      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
      "Kim Kardashian has arrived at a Paris courthouse to testify against the men accused of robbing her at gunpoint in 2016, an event that reshaped her life and redefined celebrity security in the age of social media.",
      "This will be the first time she has faced the alleged assailants since that night, when she begged for her life as masked men bound her with zip ties and stole over $6 million in jewelry.",
      "Kardashian\u2019s appearance is expected to be the emotional centerpiece of a trial that has captivated France, where the suspects \u2014 mostly in their 60s and 70s \u2014 are nicknamed \u201cthe grandpa robbers.\u201d",
      "Authorities say the group tracked her via her Instagram posts. Two defendants have admitted being at the scene.",
      "Her lawyers say she is ready to confront those who attacked her, with dignity.",
      "Earlier, Kardashian 's childhood friend and then stylist told the court that she heard the celebrity beg for her life during the robbery that transformed the way the world viewed fame in the digital age.",
      "Simone Harouche, who was sharing their two-floor hotel suite during Fashion Week, said she heard a terrified Kardashian yelling: \u201c\u2018I have babies and I need to live.\u2019 That is what she kept on saying, \u2018Take everything. I need to live.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cI was scared that she was raped or violated. I thought the worst,\u201d Harouche said. Kardashian was \u201cscreaming with terror in her voice.\u201d",
      "One of the most recognizable figures on the planet, Kardashian is set to face 10 men accused of orchestrating the heist \u2014 a crime that shook the fashion world and redefined the risks of being visible, female and famous in the Instagram era.",
      "Harouche told the court the trauma \u201cforever\u201d changed her friend, whom she\u2019s known since age 12, robbing her of a basic human right: freedom.",
      "\u201cShe now has a completely different lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cIn terms of security, she can\u2019t go alone, she doesn\u2019t go alone to places anymore. To lose your sense of freedom ... it\u2019s horrible.\u201d",
      "Kardashian\u2019s testimony is expected to recount how the attackers demanded her ring and left her fearing she would never see her children again.",
      "David De Pas, the lead judge, asked Harouche whether Kardashian had made herself a target by posting images of herself with \u201cjewels of great value.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Harouche replied. \u201cJust because a woman wears jewelry, that doesn\u2019t make her a target. That\u2019s like saying that because a woman wears a short skirt that she deserves to be raped.\u201d",
      "Twelve suspects were originally charged. One has died. Another was excused due to illness. Most are in their 60s and 70s \u2014 nicknamed les papys braqueurs, or \u201cthe grandpa robbers\u201d \u2014 and authorities describe them as a seasoned and coordinated criminal gang.",
      "Two defendants have admitted being at the scene. The others deny involvement, and one claims he didn\u2019t know who Kardashian was. But police say the group tracked her via social media, where she had posted images of her jewelry, her hotel, and her schedule \u2014 exposing her vulnerability.",
      "The heist turned Kardashian into a cautionary tale of hyper-visibility. At the time, she was at the height of her influence \u2014 a style icon, social media pioneer and one of the most photographed women in the world.",
      "Fashion legend Karl Lagerfeld criticized her after the robbery, telling The Associated Press she was \u201ctoo public\u201d with her wealth. Yet, as details emerged in the days after the heist, public sentiment shifted. The image of Kardashian \u2014 alone, bound, and pleading for her life \u2014 reframed her in the public eye.",
      "In the aftermath, Kardashian pulled back from the spotlight. She developed severe anxiety and later described symptoms of agoraphobia.",
      "\u201cI hated to go out,\u201d she said in a 2021 interview. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anybody to know where I was \u2026 I just had such anxiety.\u201d",
      "Later, she acknowledged that constant sharing had made her vulnerable: \u201cPeople were watching,\u201d she said. \u201cThey knew what I had. They knew where I was.\u201d",
      "Harouche, who hid in a downstairs bathroom during the robbery, said she also suffered trauma. She sought counseling for post-traumatic stress and left the celebrity styling world to become an interior designer.",
      "\u201cThat experience was very stressful for me. It made me fearful of being around celebrities,\" she said.",
      "Harouche said she went to bed before the robbery. Kardashian entertained friends upstairs. Screams jolted Harouche from her sleep.",
      "From inside the locked bathroom, she texted Kardashian\u2019s sister Kourtney and Kardashian\u2019s bodyguard that \u201csomething is very wrong,\u201d Harouche testified.",
      "Later, after the robbers had gone, she said she heard Kardashian hopping down the stairs with her ankles still bound to find her.",
      "\u201cShe was beside herself,\u201d Harouche said. \u201cShe just was screaming.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A Paris court has found actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in 2021",
      "PARIS -- French movie star G\u00e9rard Depardieu on Tuesday was found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on the set of a movie in which he starred and was given an 18-month suspended prison sentence by a Paris court.",
      "He was also fined a total of 29,040 euros (around $32,350), and the court requested that he be registered in the national sex offender database.",
      "The 76-year-old actor was convicted of having groped a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant during the filming of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\u201cThe Green Shutters\u201d) in 2021. The case was widely seen as a key post-#MeToo test of how French society and its film industry address allegations of sexual misconduct involving prominent figures.",
      "Depardieu, who has denied the accusations, didn't attend the hearing in Paris. Depardieu\u2019s lawyer said that his client would appeal the decision.",
      "\u201cIt is the victory of two women, but it is the victory of all the women beyond this trial,\u201d said Carine Durrieu Diebolt, the set dresser's lawyer. \u201cToday we hope to see the end of impunity for an artist in the world of cinema. I think that with this decision we can no longer say that he is not a sexual abuser. And today, as the Cannes Film Festival opens, I\u2019d like the film world to spare a thought for G\u00e9rard Depardieu\u2019s victims.\"",
      "Depardieu\u2019s long and storied career \u2014 he told the court that he\u2019s made more than 250 films \u2014 has turned him into a French movie giant. He was Oscar-nominated in 1991 for his performance as the swordsman and poet Cyrano de Bergerac.",
      "In recent years, the actor has been accused publicly or in formal complaints of misconduct by more than 20 women, but so far only the sexual assault case has proceeded to court. Some other cases were dropped because of a lack of evidence or the statute of limitations.",
      "During the four-day trial in March, Depardieu rejected the accusations, saying he\u2019s \u201cnot like that.\u201d He acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language on the film set and that he grabbed the set dresser's hips during an argument, but denied that his behavior was sexual.",
      "The court, composed of a panel of three judges, concluded that Depardieu\u2019s explanations in court were \u201cunpersuasive\u201d and \u201cnot credible\" and stressed both accusers' \u201cconstant, reiterated and substantiated declarations.\u201d",
      "The court also said that both plaintiffs have been faced with an \u201caggressive\u201d defense strategy \u201cbased on comments meant to offend them.\u201d The judges therefore considered that Depardieu\u2019s lawyer comments in court aggravated the harm to the accusers and justified higher fines.",
      "Depardieu\u2019s lawyer, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, regretted that the court \u201cconsidered that questioning the accusations is an additional assault ... which means that now the defense, even in this type of trial, is no longer accepted.\"",
      "The set dresser described the alleged assault, saying the actor pincered her between his legs as she squeezed past him in a narrow corridor.",
      "She said he grabbed her hips then started \u201cpalpating\u201d her behind and \u201cin front, around.\u201d She ran her hands near her buttocks, hips and pubic area to show what she allegedly experienced. She said he then grabbed her chest.",
      "The woman also testified that Depardieu used an obscene expression to ask her to touch his penis and suggested he wanted to rape her. She told the court that the actor\u2019s calm and cooperative attitude during the trial bore no resemblance to his behavior at work.",
      "The other plaintiff, an assistant, said that Depardieu groped her buttocks and her breasts during three separate incidents on the film set.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify by name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to be named. Neither woman has done so in this case, although one has agreed to be pictured.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very moved,\" one of the plaintiffs, the set dresser, told reporters after the verdict. \u201cI\u2019m very, very much satisfied with the decision, that\u2019s a victory for me, really, and a big progress, a step forward. I feel justice was made.\u201d",
      "Some figures in the French cinema world have expressed their support for Depardieu. Actors Vincent Perez and Fanny Ardant were among those who took seats on his side of the courtroom.",
      "French media reported last week that Depardieu was shooting a film directed by Ardant in the Azores archipelago, in Portugal.",
      "The actor may have to face other legal proceedings soon.",
      "In 2018, actor Charlotte Arnould accused him of raping her at his home. That case is still active, and in August 2024 prosecutors requested that it go to trial.",
      "For more than a half-century, Depardieu stood as a towering figure in French cinema, a titan known for his commanding physical presence, instinct, sensibility and remarkable versatility.",
      "A bon vivant who overcame a speech impediment and a turbulent youth, Depardieu rose to prominence in the 1970s and became one of France\u2019s most prolific and acclaimed actors, portraying a vast array of characters, from volatile outsiders to deeply introspective figures.",
      "In recent years, his behavior toward women has come under renewed scrutiny, including after a documentary showed him repeatedly making obscene remarks and gestures during a 2018 trip to North Korea.",

      "\u201cIndeed last year was a beautiful year,\u201d Fr\u00e9maux said Monday. \u201cBut at the very time when I was with (journalists) as the festival started, we didn\u2019t know if it was going to be a good year or not.\u201d",

In one of France\u2019s most prominent #MeToo cases, Depardieu was given an 18-month suspended prison sentence. The 76-year-old has long been a regular presence at Cannes.",
      "This year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival, the premier international cinematic gathering, is also unspooling following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s call for tariffs on movies made overseas.

      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival red carpet is perhaps the most rigidly controlled red carpet in the world. Now, the festival has added a new stipulation: no nudity.",
      "While nudity was never previously endorsed at the festival, Cannes updated its dress policy on the eve of its 78th edition to read that \u201cnudity is prohibited on the red carpet, as well as in any other area of the festival.\u201d",
      "While a no-shirt-no-service policy is standard in places far less glamorous than Cannes, the policy tweak sparked widespread attention Monday because of the recent trend of sheer and \u201cnude dresses, \u201d such as Bianca Censori's Grammys appearance.",
      "Asked for clarity on the policy, Cannes press officers said the festival \u201cmade explicit in its charter certain rules that have long been in effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe aim is not to regulate attire per se, but to prohibit full nudity on the red carpet, in accordance with the institutional framework of the event and French law,\u201d it said.",

      "Behind so many award-winning careers, high-profile productions, beloved institutions and in-depth research projects there is often a quieter story of early support from the government",
      "NEW YORK -- Poet Marie Howe, one of this year's winners of the Pulitzer Prize, says being a writer is often less a career than a vocation. You rely on teaching and other outside work and seek support from foundations or from a government agency, like the National Endowment for the Arts.",
      "\u201cEverybody applies for an NEA grant, year after after year, and if you get it, it's like wow \u2014 it's huge,\" says Howe, a Pulitzer winner for \u201cNew and Selected Poems\u201d and a former NEA creative writing fellow. \u201cIt's not just the money. It's also deep encouragement. I just felt so grateful. It made a big, big difference. It gives you courage. It says to you, \u2018Go on, keep doing it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Behind so many award-winning careers, high-profile productions, beloved institutions and in-depth research projects there is often a quieter story of early support from the government \u2014 the grants from the NEA or National Endowment for the Humanities that enable a writer to complete a book, a community theater to stage a play, a scholar to access archival documents or a museum to organize an exhibit.",
      "For decades, there has been a nationwide artistic and cultural infrastructure receiving bipartisan support, including through the first administration of Donald Trump.",
      "Now that is changing \u2014 and drastically.",
      "Since returning to office in January, the president has alleged that federal agencies and institutions such as the NEA, NEH, PBS, the Kennedy Center and the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) were advancing a \u201cwoke agenda\u201d that undermined traditional values.",
      "Trump has ousted leaders, cut or eliminated programs and dramatically shifted priorities: At the same time the NEH and NEA were forcing out staff members and canceling grants, they announced a multimillion-dollar initiative to support statues for Trump's proposed \"National Garden of American Heroes,\u201d from George Washington to Shirley Temple.",
      "\u201cAll future awards will, among other things, be merit-based, awarded to projects that do not promote extreme ideologies based upon race or gender, and that help to instill an understanding of the founding principles and ideals that make America an exceptional country,\" reads a statement on the NEH website.",
      "Individuals and organizations across the country, and across virtually every art form, now find themselves without money they had budgeted for or even spent, anticipating they would be reimbursed.",
      "Electric Literature, McSweeney's and n+1 are among dozens of literary publications that received notices their grants have been rescinded. Philadelphia's Rosenbach Museum & Library had to halt a project to create an online catalog after losing a near-$250,000 grant from the IMLS. The Stuttering Association for the Young, which manages a summer music camp, has a $35,000 gap.",
      "\u201cOur fundraising allows kids to attend our summer camp at a greatly reduced cost so the lost funds make it harder to fulfill that commitment,\" says the association's director, Russell Krumnow, who added that \u201cwe planned our programming and made decisions with those funds in mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cGovernment money ought to be consistent. It ought to be reliable,\u201d says Talia Corren, co-executive director of the New York-based Alliance of Resident Theatres, which assists hundreds of nonprofit theater companies. \u201cYou need to make decisions based on that money.\u201d",
      "The NEA, NEH and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting were among the institutions established 60 years ago, during the height of President Lyndon Johnson's \u201cGreat Society\u201d domestic programs. At various times, they have faced criticism for supporting provocative artists, such as photographer Robert Mapplethorpe in the 1980s. But they have endured, in part, because of their perceived economic benefits, distributed through as many congressional districts as possible.",
      "Arts advocates contend that, like other forms of federal aid, the importance of an NEA or NEH grant isn\u2019t just the initial money, but the \u201cripple\u201d or \u201cmutliplier\u201d effect. Government backing often carries the kind of prestige that makes a given organization more desirable to private donors.",
      "The millions of dollars channeled through state arts and humanities councils in turn support local projects. Funding for a theater production helps generate jobs for the cast and crew, brings in business for neighboring restaurants and bars and parking garages and spending money for the babysitter hired by parents having a night out.",
      "Actor Jane Alexander was just beginning her stage career when the endowment helped fund the 1967 Arena Stage production of Howard Sackler's drama about boxer Jack Johnson, \u201cThe Great White Hope,\" which starred Alexander and James Earl Jones and eventually won the Pulitzer Prize. Alexander, who headed the NEA in the 1990s, remembered how Arena co-founder Zelda Fichandler worried that the endowment might hurt business by supporting other theaters in Washington.",
      "\u201cAnd I remember my late husband (Robert Alexander) who was artistic director of the Living Stage Theatre Company at the time, saying to her, 'No, it doesn\u2019t work that way. A rising tide floats all boats,\" she says.",
      "In the short term, organizations are seeking donations from the general public and philanthropists are attempting to fill in fiscal holes. The Mellon Foundation recently announced an \u201cemergency\u201d $15 million fund for state humanities councils. At the Portland Playhouse in Oregon, artistic director Brian Weaver says that donors stepped in after the theater lost a $25,000 NEA grant just a day before they were to open a production of \u201cJoe Turner's Come and Gone,\u201d",
      "But Weaver and others say private fundraising alone isn't a long-term solution, if only because individuals incur \u201cdonor fatigue\u201d and philanthropists change their minds. Jane Alexander remembers when the Arena theater in Washington founded a repertory company, supported in part by the Rockefeller Foundation.",
      "\u201cIt was like the National Theatre in Britain,\" she says. '\"We felt so proud that we can have a repertory company of 30 players rotating players through the season. It was very, very exciting. And we had, you know, voice lessons, we had fencing lessons. We were going to become the great company. And guess what happened? Rockefeller\u2019s priorities changed.\u201d",

      "\u201cAndor\u201d ends with the release of a three-episode series finale on Tuesday",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The complex effects of personal trauma have not traditionally been the stuff of sci-fi and fantasy. They tend to get in the way of the quest.",
      "\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d made a meal of it. \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d tried to consider the effect on survivors of losing a planet of people. But it hasn't fit in the swashbuckling world of \u201cStar Wars.\u201d How could the mission to destroy the Death Star have quickly concluded if Princess Leia needed to mourn the loss of nearly all her loved ones on Alderaan?",
      "\u201cAndor\u201d changed all that. Coping with inner pain has been a theme throughout its two-season run, which comes to a close Tuesday when Disney+ releases a series-finale trilogy of episodes. It starts with its title character, who is left rootless by the deaths and destruction around him.",
      "\u201cEverything has been taken away from him since day one,\u201d Diego Luna, who plays Cassian Andor, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd he has to understand that home is inside. That he can be home. That home can be there. And therefore there\u2019s a reason to fight.\"",
      "The three final episodes take Andor and the rest of the characters up to the events of \u201cRogue One,\u201d the 2016 film that spawned the streaming prequel series. Tony Gilroy, who wrote \u201cRogue One\u201d and is the show runner for \u201cAndor,\u201d has loved playing in the Star Wars galaxy, but he\u2019s made it clear his real mission is to tell universal stories of the effects of war, revolution and colonization on human (and occasionally non-human) souls.",
      "Nearly every character he\u2019s created is ravaged in one way or another, and even the lighthearted moments of the series are fraught with emotional pain. (Spoilers ahead for episodes 1-9 of Season 2.)",
      "When Andor goes undercover as a moussed-and-mulleted fashion designer named Varian Skye and makes small talk with a hotel staffer, he learns the man's family was killed in a notorious massacre by Grand Moff Tarkin, the imperial leader who would later order the destruction of Leia's world.",
      "And in a widely-memed moment of drunken techno dancing by senator and secret rebel Mon Mothma at her daughter's wedding, she is, as Genevieve O'Reilly who played her said, \"dancing to stop herself from screaming\" after tacitly agreeing to have an old friend murdered for the cause.",
      "No one on \u201cAndor\u201d undergoes more trauma than Bix Caleen, played by Adria Arjona. While still dealing with the fallout of being tortured by an imperial doctor in the first season, she is nearly raped early in the second and has been surrounded by death. Arjona said seeing the script was daunting.",
      "\u201cShe has to go from PTSD to sort of being addicted to droppers, which help her sleep and get over the nightmares, to then her last final decision,\u201d Arjona told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot. And reading it was incredibly scary.\u201d",
      "An utterly new for \u201cStar Wars\u201d set of scenes between Cassian and Bix explore both the explicit and subtle difficulties of intimate relationships amid trauma. Cassian must comfort Bix, but she doesn't want her pain to define her.",
      "The two try to take a trip to the neighborhood bodega, but even that is subsumed by his fear for her.",
      "Cassian and Bix also must deal with the difficulty of the lives they take for the cause.",
      "Han Solo never mourned the stormtroopers he blasted, but the \u201cAndor\u201d duo killed a young imperial soldier during a mission and it haunts the home life they\u2019re trying to build.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t stop seeing his face,\u201d Bix says.",
      "\u201cIt fades,\u201d Cassian replies. \u201cI want to tell you it goes away forever, but I\u2019d be lying.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a war,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI wonder if he knew,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cHe knows now,\u201d Cassian says.",
      "Bix is among the major characters who won\u2019t go on to \u201cRogue One\u201d or other existing \u201cStar Wars\u201d stories. \u201cAndor\u201d lets her complete her emotional arc with a tear-jerking but well-earned set of scenes.",
      "\u201cThe last speech, I still haven\u2019t been able to watch it,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cI was a mess! It took me takes and takes of me absolutely just bawling through that scene until finally it gets to what I believe they used.\u201d",
      "The show's revolutionary leaders, just as those in history have done, try to take their followers' trauma, and their own, and use it to drive the movement.",
      "Saw Gerrera, the radical rebel played by Forest Whittaker who has a key role (and one less leg) in \u201cRogue One,\u201d gave a call-to-arms in a recent episode that is already being celebrated among fans as the \u201crevolution is not for the sane\u201d speech. The theme: pain as power.",
      "He tells a young prospective follower about his youthful enslavement in a brutal imperial work camp, and the toxic leak there of a fuel called rhydo.",
      "\u201cThey worked us naked. Two, three hundred men. Boys really. Back and forth until the only thing you could remember was back and forth. Then one day, everyone started to itch. Everyone, all at once. Even the guards. You could feel your skin coming alive,\" Saw says, his raspy voice rising. \u201cIt was the rhydo. They had a leak.\u201d",
      "He tells the young man, \"We\u2019re the rhydo, kid. We\u2019re the fuel. We\u2019re the thing that explodes when there\u2019s too much friction in the air. Let it in, boy! That\u2019s freedom calling! Let it in! Let it run! Let it run wild!\u201d",

      "Sharing online was second nature for Kim Kardashian, an extension of her fame",
      "PARIS -- The ring gleamed in Instagram posts. So did the diamond necklace and the luxury Paris address. For Kim Kardashian, sharing online was second nature, an extension of her fame. But in the early hours of Oct. 3, 2016, that openness was turned against her.",
      "Five masked men posing as police officers stormed the residence where she was staying during Fashion Week. They bound her with duct tape and plastic cable ties, locked her in the bathroom and fled with an estimated $6 million in stolen jewelry.",
      "The robbery sent shock waves far beyond Paris. It was the latest moment when celebrity exposure \u2014 fueled by social media updates and glamour on display \u2014 collided with real-world risk.",
      "The late fashion icon Karl Lagerfeld offered a characteristically blunt assessment in the days that followed. Speaking to The Associated Press, he criticized Kardashian\u2019s hyper-visibility in an era when fame can come with serious vulnerabilities.",
      "\u201c(She is) too public, too public \u2014 we have to see in what time we live,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot display your wealth then be surprised that some people want to share it,\u201d he added, questioning why she was in a hotel with no security.",
      "On Tuesday, Kardashian takes the stand in a trial that began last month, nearly a decade after the robbery. She will finally face the men accused of carrying out one of the most audacious celebrity heists in modern French history.",
      "What made the robbery extraordinary was not just its high-profile victim but how investigators believe she was targeted. Kardashian had posted real-time updates from her hotel suite. She showed off a 20-carat diamond ring, gifted by her then-husband Kanye West, hours before it was stripped from her hand.",
      "The attackers used no digital trackers or hacking tools. Instead, investigators believe they followed Kardashian\u2019s digital breadcrumbs \u2014 images, timestamps, geotags \u2014 and exploited them with old-school criminal methods.",
      "It was, some suggested at the time, a blueprint built from her own broadcast.",
      "The men dressed as police, spoke only French and overpowered the concierge, who was forced to act as a translator during the break-in.",
      "\u201cI thought it was terrorists,\u201d Kardashian later told a French magistrate in 2017. \u201cThat they were going to kill me.\u201d",
      "The robbery forced Kardashian to consider how she lived, posted and protected herself. Her brand had been built on access, her life broadcast to millions. But that strategy had collapsed.",
      "\u201cI learned to be more private,\u201d she later said. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth the risk.\u201d",
      "Kardashian enhanced her security detail by hiring people with backgrounds in elite protective services, reportedly including former members of the U.S. Secret Service and CIA. She stopped posting her location in real time. Lavish gifts and jewelry all but vanished from her feed.",
      "\u201cI was definitely materialistic before \u2026 but I\u2019m so happy that my kids get this me,\" she reflected on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2017.",
      "Later, Kardashian acknowledged that constant sharing had made her a target.",
      "\u201cPeople were watching,\u201d she said. \u201cThey knew what I had. They knew where I was.\u201d",
      "Her retreat set off a ripple effect across Hollywood and the fashion world.",
      "Model Gigi Hadid increased her private security detail in the months after the heist. She was spotted at Paris fashion shows flanked by multiple guards. Kendall Jenner, Kardashian\u2019s sister, reportedly took similar steps ahead of the 2016 Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show in Paris, following new protocols on personal protection and digital discretion. Publicists and managers began advising clients to delay posts, remove location tags and think twice before flashing luxury online.",
      "Visibility remained currency, but for some the rules had changed.",
      "Surveillance footage helped French police reconstruct the timeline of the robbery, but the breakthrough came from a trace of DNA left on the plastic ties used to bind Kardashian.",
      "It matched Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, a veteran criminal whose DNA was in the national database. Phone taps and surveillance led police to others, including Yunice Abbas and Didier Dubreucq, known as \u201cYeux bleus.\u201d Most of the accused have long criminal records.",
      "Abbas later claimed he was unaware of Kardashian\u2019s identity during the heist.",
      "But investigators say the men acted with detailed planning and discipline. Prepaid phones were activated the day before the heist and abandoned immediately afterward. But in the end, it wasn\u2019t enough.",
      "Kardashian, once mocked by some of the French press as a reality TV sideshow, is now at the center of a case with deep cultural resonance.",

      "NEW YORK -- After more than 11 months and hundreds of singalongs, \u201cMy Girl\u201d finally has some company atop the charts at Citi Field.",
      "New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor, whose pivot to The Temptations\u2019 \u201cMy Girl\u201d as his walk-up song last May coincided with a turnaround in fortunes for Lindor and his teammates, added \u201cAin\u2019t No Mountain High Enough\u201d \u2014 the 1967 duet by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell \u2014 to his rotation prior to his second at-bat in Friday's 7-2 win over the Chicago Cubs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the vibes \u2014 the vibes I\u2019m in right now,\u201d Lindor said with a grin Friday night. \u201cI think it\u2019s a fantastic song. Hopefully the fans can vibe to it, too.\u201d",
      "Lindor\u2019s success with \u201cMy Girl\u201d and the accompanying pop culture sensation made his pivot a surprise to the 41,243 fans in attendance Friday, if not his teammates.",
      "Lindor was batting .210 and the Mets were 22-30 when he debuted \u201cMy Girl\u201d last May 28, but Lindor hit .306 the rest of the way and finished second in NL MVP balloting as New York made it to the National League Championship Series. The Temptations performed the song, along with the national anthem, prior to Game 5 of the NLCS against the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "Lindor hit a leadoff homer for the first-place Mets on Friday \u2014 his 34th round-tripper in 137 games since introducing \u201cMy Girl.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere were some fans that yelled at me,\u201d Lindor said. \u201cBut there were some other ones that were singing.\u201d",
      "Mets first baseman Pete Alonso, who is walking up to Eric Clapton\u2019s \u201cLayla\u201d this year after using Rush\u2019s \u201cWorking Man\u201d and Don McLean\u2019s \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d in previous seasons, said Lindor hinted at the change during the just-concluded road trip to St. Louis and Arizona.",
      "\u201cHe said he was going to do it and no one believed him,\u201d Alonso said Saturday. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good one \u2014 that\u2019s a great walk-up song.\u201d",
      "Lindor acknowledged some teammates wanted him to stick with \u201cMy Girl\u201d and said he\u2019d alternate the songs in hopes his new selection grows in popularity.",
      "\u201cMan, the movie \u2018Remember The Titans\u2019 \u2014 who doesn\u2019t know that?\u201d Lindor said, referring to the song\u2019s usage in the 2000 film. \u201cIt\u2019s a great song. So we\u2019ll see if it catches on. If it doesn\u2019t catch on \u2014 since I got pushback from some people \u2014 they\u2019re still going to get \u2018My Girl.\u2019\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein 's lawyers sought Friday to raise doubts about a former model's allegations that he repeatedly sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager.",
      "As defense lawyer Mike Cibella began what's likely to be lengthy questioning of Kaja Sokola, he pointed to differences in some details of her testimony this week and what she told a grand jury last year.",
      "Cibella also noted that although documents have indicated that Weinstein and Sokola knew each other by 2006, no witnesses or documents corroborate her account of meeting the then-influential movie producer four years earlier at a Manhattan nightclub. She was 16 at the time and alleges he first sexually assaulted her days after they met.",
      "Sokola is the second of three accusers to testify at Weinstein's rape and sexual assault retrial, and she's the only one who wasn\u2019t part of the onetime Hollywood honcho\u2019s first trial in 2020.",
      "Weinstein is being retried because an appeals court overturned his landmark #MeToo 2020 conviction, saying the judge at the time allowed prejudicial testimony. After the reversal, prosecutors added Sokola\u2019s allegation to the case.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies ever sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "The Polish-born Sokola, 39, is a psychotherapist who had a jet-setting modeling career as a teen. She testified earlier this week that Weinstein exploited her youthful interest in an acting career to subject her to unwanted sexual advances, starting days after they met in 2002, while she was on a modeling trip to New York.",
      "Another alleged incident, in 2006, is the basis for a criminal sex act charge against Weinstein. Sokola, who was 19 at the time, says he lured her to a hotel room by saying he had a script for her to see, then pinned her down on a bed and performed oral sex on her as she implored him not to.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted, but Haley, Mann and Sokola have given their permission to be identified.",

      "NEW YORK -- Historian Ron Chernow's latest work may surprise readers who know him best for the book which inspired the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d and for his biographies of George Washington and Ulysses Grant.",
      "The 1,200-page \u201cMark Twain\u201d will be published next week. It's Chernow's first release since his Grant biography came out in 2017, and the first time he has taken on a literary writer after a career defined by celebrated books about business leaders (John D. Rockefeller, the Morgan dynasty), presidents (Grant and Washington) and, most of all, Alexander Hamilton. His many honors include the Pulitzer Prize for \u201cWashington: A Life,\u201d the National Book Award for \u201cThe House of Morgan\u201d and the National Book Critics Circle prize for \u201cTitan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.\u201d",
      "But a book on Twain had been in his thoughts for decades, dating back to when he saw Hal Holbrook play him on stage in Philadelphia in the mid-1970s.",
      "\u201cAnd there he was, with the white suit and cigar and mustache and he was tossing out one hilarious line after another,\u201d the 76-year-old Chernow says, remembering such Twain quips as \u201cThere's no distinctly Native American criminal class, except Congress.\u201d Chernow became fascinated by Twain as a prototype of the modern celebrity and found himself drawn less to \u201cMark Twain the novelist than the pundit, the personality and the platform artist.\u201d",
      "Chernow admittedly is more comfortable with the researchable world of facts than with the more intangible qualities of the imagination. But he found much to identify with Twain, relating to him as a fellow widower (Twain outlived his wife, Olivia, by six years; Chernow's wife, Valerie Stearn, died in 2006), as a public speaker and as an author fortunate enough to write full time.",
      "Chernow also looks closely into subjects familiar to him \u2014 politics and finance, notably the various failed business ventures that left Twain short of money despite his author royalties and the inherited wealth of his wife. Toward the end of the book, the historian addresses the friendships an elderly Twain cultivated with teen and preteen girls, whom Twain called his \u201cangelfish.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the time Twain\u2019s behavior was regarded as the charming eccentricity of a beloved humorist with a soft spot for children. We look at that same behavior today and find it odd and disturbing. It's important to get both perspectives,\u201d Chernow says. \u201cTwain\u2019s behavior was chaste and none of the angelfish or their parents ever accused him of improper or predatory behavior. At the same time, there was such an obsessive quality about Twain\u2019s attention to these teenage girls \u2014 he devoted more time to them than to his own daughters.\u201d",
      "During a recent interview at his Upper West Side Manhattan apartment, where his glass of Diet Coke stood on a coaster illustrated with a sketch of Twain receiving an honorary college degree, Chernow also reflected on Twain's family, his politics and the sadness in his soul. Chernow's comments have been condensed for clarity and brevity.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t know what he would say about Donald Trump. I could, yes, but I don\u2019t want to guess. But we do know what he said about political figures of his own day. And he hated Teddy Roosevelt. He saw that Teddy Roosevelt had a very large ego, very self-absorbed and a Mr. Bombastic personality. But he (Twain) has a wonderful quote where he says that Teddy Roosevelt is the Tom Sawyer of the political world of the early 20th century. He said that he was always hunting for attention. And then he has this great line. He said that in his (Roosevelt's) frenzied imagination, the great republic is one vast Barnum\u2019s circus, and he is the clown, and the whole world is his audience.\u201d",
      "To actually read about the children of famous personalities is almost invariably sad, as it often is with Mark Twain. The one who suffered from this most acutely, I think was the middle daughter, Clara, who was kind of insanely competitive with her father and felt overshadowed by him, wanted to kind of trade on his reputation, but then didn\u2019t want him to get the attention. She said that she would be in a room with her father, and she felt she was only Mark Twain\u2019s daughter, that she was reduced to the level of a footstool. And she also had a very interesting line, one that has a very contemporary ring: He would come into the room and he would flood the room with talk.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere's that time when he goes to the Sandwich Islands and he meets the American diplomat Anson Burlingame, who advises him to \u201ccultivate your betters,\u201d which Twain really takes to heart. I think that with Twain, if someone asks me, you know, did he marry Olivia for her money? I would say definitely not. It was a true love match. And as Twain said late in life, there was not a single day of his marriage that she didn\u2019t say, \u2018I worship you,\u2019 \u2018I idolize you.\u2019 This was just kind of pouring out of her and her letters. On the other hand, the more you know about Mark Twain, the more you know that he could never have married a poor woman.",
      "\u201cAnd the irony of Twain\u2019s life is that he spends his entire life attacking the plutocrats on the one hand, and on the other, he\u2019s doing everything in his power to become one. This man embodies in his person every tendency of the time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of self-loathing in him. I have a quote later in the book \u2014 he says that (poet Lord) Byron detested life because he detested himself. Twain said, \u2018I\u2019m the same way.\u2019 You know, that's a really harsh, harsh thing to say. But I think that he saw all these impulses within himself that he was really powerless to stop. And then he realized he hurt other people. I think that Mark Twain did fit the stereotype of the funny man who\u2019s sad and depressed under the surface and is kind of releasing that through the humor.\u201d",

      "In 1976, De Niro starred in two films \u2014 Martin Scorsese's \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and Bernardo Bertolucci's \u201c1900\" \u2014 that premiered in competition at Cannes. \u201cTaxi Driver\" was an immediate sensation, and went home with the festival's top prize, the Palme d'Or.",
      "Since then, De Niro has been a regular on the Croisette, returning with \u201cThe King of Comedy\u201d in 1983, Sergio Leone's \u201cOnce Upon a Time in America\u201d in 1984 and Roland Joff\u00e9's \u201cThe Mission\u201d in 1986. Joff\u00e9's film also won the Palme, making De Niro the rare actor to star in two Palme d'Or winners.",
      "Though De Niro helps run his own film festival back in New York, the Tribeca Festival, he has remained a mainstay in Cannes. He presided over the jury in 2011 that selected Terrence Malick's \u201cThe Tree of Life\u201d for the Palme. Most recently, he and Scorsese returned to premiere \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d in 2023.",
      "\u201cI have such close feelings for Festival de Cannes,\" De Niro said when his honorary Palme d'Or was announced last month. \u201cEspecially now when there\u2019s so much in the world pulling us apart, Cannes brings us together \u2014 storytellers, filmmakers, fans, and friends. It\u2019s like coming home.\u201d",

      "The final stage of jury selection for the racketeering and sex trafficking trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has been postponed until early next week",
      "NEW YORK -- The final stage of jury selection for the racketeering and sex trafficking trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was postponed until early next week, right before opening arguments begin, a federal judge decided on Friday.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Combs, 55, used his fame and power at the top of the hip-hop world to sexually abuse women from 2004 to 2024. He pleaded not guilty after his September arrest and has remained held without bail at a federal lockup in Brooklyn.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian granted the defense lawyers' request to delay the last step in jury selection until Monday, when both sides will narrow down the pool of 45 people to 12 jurors and six alternates. Generally, lawyers do not have to explain why they are ejecting individuals from the panel.",
      "The defense said striking prospective jurors could take as little as 10 to 15 minutes, so why not do it on Monday when they will be present. The jurors weren\u2019t required to be in the Manhattan courtroom on Friday, but Combs was there.",
      "Prosecutors objected, saying the whole process could get gummed up if several jurors panic after being chosen and decide they don\u2019t want to take part in a high-profile trial that's expected to last two months.",
      "Would-be jurors were asked questions earlier this week to help the judge and lawyers determine if they could be fair and impartial. And they were also questioned to ensure they could decide the case on the facts \u2014 even after seeing explicit videos of sexual activity that some might find disturbing.",
      "On Monday, prosecutors will be permitted to strike six prospective jurors from the jury while defense lawyers were allowed 10 strikes before the jury is finalized. The process is expected to take up to an hour.",
      "If Combs is convicted on all charges, which include racketeering, kidnapping, arson, bribery and sex trafficking, he would face a mandatory 15 years in prison and could remain behind bars for life.",
      "Prosecutors allege the Bad Boy Records founder used his fame and power at the top of the hip-hop world to sexually abuse women from 2004 to 2024.",
      "An indictment includes descriptions of \u201cFreak Offs,\u201d drugged-up orgies in which women were forced to have sex with male sex workers while Combs filmed them.",
      "The charges against him also portray Combs as abusive to his victims, sometimes choking, hitting, kicking and dragging them, often by the hair. Once, the indictment alleges, he even dangled someone from a balcony.",
      "His lawyers say prosecutors are trying to criminalize sexual activity between consenting adults. They concede that Combs had abused various substances but say he has undergone treatment.",
      "A centerpiece of the evidence against him are recordings of Combs beating a longtime girlfriend in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016.",
      "After a video of the encounter aired on CNN last year, Combs apologized, saying, \u201cI take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I\u2019m disgusted now.\u201d",
      "Numerous prospective jurors told the judge they'd seen the video and some were deemed too affected by it to be impartial.",

      "A judge has ordered a man who authorities say crashed his car through the front gate of Jennifer Aniston\u2019s home to face a competency review",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A judge on Thursday ordered that a man who authorities say crashed his car through the front gate of Jennifer Aniston's home must go through mental-health court to determine whether he is competent to face felony stalking and vandalism charges.",
      "Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, 48, appeared shirtless and wrapped in a blanket when he appeared behind glass in a custody area of a Los Angeles courtroom. Carwyle did not speak during the proceedings; his attorney entered a not guilty plea on his behalf.",
      "Prosecutors say the Mississippi man had been harassing Aniston with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving into her gate on Monday.",
      "Judge Keith L. Schwartz doubted whether Carwyle would understand him when a prosecutor requested that the defendant, who will remain in jail, be ordered not to get near Aniston.",
      "Carwyle's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Toral Malik, said \u201cI don\u2019t believe him staying away from Ms. Aniston will be an issue at this time.\"",
      "But at a prosecutors' insistence, Schwartz issued the order anyway.",
      "\u201cYou are not to have any contact with Jennifer Aniston under any conditions,\u201d the judge said.",
      "Authorities say Aniston was home when Carwyle crashed his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood, causing major damage, prosecutors said. A security guard stopped him in her driveway before police arrived and arrested him.",
      "There were no reports of anyone being injured.",
      "An Aniston attorney who attended Thursday's hearing declined comment, and other representatives of the \u201cFriends\u201d star have not responded to comment requests.",
      "Carwyle also faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm. If convicted he could get up to three years in prison.",
      "Malik not speak to reporters outside court.",
      "Aniston bought the midcentury mansion on a 3.4-acre lot for about $21 million in 2012, according to reporting by Architectural Digest.",
      "She became one of the biggest stars in television in her 10 years on NBC's \u201cFriends.\u201d Aniston won an Emmy Award for best lead actress in a comedy for the role, and she has been nominated for nine more. She currently stars in \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Apple TV+.",

      "Michigan\u2019s 24-hour waiting period before an abortion has been struck down",
      "DETROIT -- A judge on Tuesday struck down Michigan's 24-hour waiting period before an abortion, saying it conflicts with a voter-approved amendment that locked abortion rights in the state constitution in 2022.",
      "\u201cMichiganders have the fundamental right to reproductive freedom, including the right to abortion care, and the state cannot deny, burden or infringe upon this freedom barring a compelling state interest to protect the health of the individual seeking care,\u201d Judge Sima Patel said.",

      "The judge said a mandatory 24-hour delay \u201cexacerbates the burdens that patients experience seeking abortion care.\"",
      "Patel also overturned a regulation that required abortion providers to provide a fetal development chart and information about alternatives, declaring them \u201ccoercive and stigmatizing.\u201d The judge stopped a requirement that only a physician, not other health professionals, can perform an abortion.",
      "The lawsuit was filed by Northland Family Planning Centers and a group called Medical Students for Choice.",
      "Michigan's attorney general and health director agreed that the challenged regulations were unconstitutional, though state attorneys were assigned to defend them in court.",
      "Abortion rights were added to the state constitution by nearly 57% of voters in 2022, months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.",
      "Patel's ruling \u201creaffirms that Michigan is a state where you can make your own decisions about your own body with a trusted health care provider, without political interference,\u201d Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, said.",

      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has signed a bill into law to make Maryland the first state to use money collected from a surcharge on insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act to pay for an abortion grant program",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland will become the first state to use money collected from a surcharge on insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act to fund a program to pay for abortions, regardless of a patient's insurance coverage, under a measure signed into law Tuesday by Democratic Gov. Wes Moore.",
      "The law will make about $25 million available when it takes effect July 1, because a $1 surcharge has been unused and growing over the last 15 years since the ACA took effect in 2010. It's estimated to make about $3 million available annually in future years.",
      "\u201cThe lieutenant governor and I were very clear from Day 1 \u2014 that Maryland will always be a safe haven for abortion access,\u201d Moore said, highlighting the measure among SOME 170 bills signed at a ceremony.",
      "The program will be paid for through the transfer of certain insurance premium funds collected by carriers that can only be used for abortion coverage in accordance with the ACA. Supporters say other states have access to a similar surplus of funds through their state exchange insurance systems.",
      "\u201cIf programs like ours are duplicated across the country, we could help millions of Americans access essential abortion care \u2014 without relying on taxpayer dollars,\u201d said Del. Lesley Lopez, a Democrat from Maryland's Montgomery County, in the suburbs of the nation's capital.",
      "Officials in New York and Illinois already have reached out to Maryland officials to learn more about the program, said Lopez, who sponsored the bill.",
      "A dozen states require abortion coverage in ACA marketplace plans, according to KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues. They are California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.",
      "\u201cThis money exists in every state that has abortion as a required type of care under their state\u2019s benefit exchanges,\" Lopez said. \"It\u2019s basically all the blue states that mandated abortion be covered when the Affordable Care Act was starting to be implemented.\u201d",
      "The law creates a grant program fund in the state's health department to improve access to abortion clinical services. It requires the department to award grants to nonprofit organizations to support equitable access.",
      "Lynn McCann-Yeh, co-executive director of the Baltimore Abortion Fund, which helps pay costs associated with abortion for people who live in Maryland or who travel there, said it\u2019s hard to keep up with an annual budget of about $2 million.",
      "\u201cWe would need many, many more times over that to fully be able to meet the full logistic and medical support for each caller,\u201d she said.",
      "She said the $3 million that would be made available annually under the new law could make a major difference. The fund could apply to administer a share of that money.",
      "\u201cThe $3 million is a great start, but it will take more than that and it will take sustained funding,\u201d she said.",
      "Maryland's legislature is controlled by Democrats, who hold a 2-1 advantage over Republicans in voter registration statewide. Last year, Maryland voters approved a constitutional amendment with 76% support to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution, in response to the 2022 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. The court's decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization gave control over abortion to the states.",
      "\u201cI think before the Dobbs decision, there just wasn\u2019t quite the same type of urgency as there is now,\" Lopez said. \"We\u2019ve seen abortion bans in some form or another in double digits in states across the country, so we\u2019ve got to make sure that we shore up all the support we can in a state like Maryland that has it as a constitutionally protected right.\u201d",
      "Twelve states currently enforce abortion bans with limited exceptions at all stages of pregnancy. Four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The Dobb decision and an influx of people from other states seeking abortions in Maryland has made the financial need more urgent, supporters of the law say.",
      "Maryland has been seeing an increase in patients from other states where abortion has been banned. Last year, 15% of abortions in Maryland were obtained by patients from other states, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. That's a decrease from 20% in 2023.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. health officials say they plan to phase out fluoride-containing supplements used to strengthen children\u2019s teeth, citing possible health risks",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health regulators announced plans Tuesday to phase out fluoride-containing supplements sometimes used to strengthen children\u2019s teeth, opening a new front in Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s effort against a mainstay of dental care.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said it will conduct a scientific review of the products by late October with the aim of removing them from the market. It was not immediately clear whether the agency planned to formally ban the supplements or simply request that companies withdraw them.",
      "The products targeted by the FDA are sometimes recommended for children and teens who are at increased risk of tooth decay or cavities because of low fluoride in their local drinking water. They usually require a prescription from a pediatrician or dentist. Fluoride-based tablets and lozenges are designed to be chewed or swallowed. Companies also sell drops for babies and infants.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the products pose a risk when swallowed by children because they may interfere with healthy gut bacteria that are critical to digestion, immunity and other key bodily functions. He also referenced studies showing possible associations between excess fluoride intake and other problems, including decreased IQ.",
      "Previous reviews by public health experts and dental professionals have not shown any serious health risks with the products.",
      "As state and local governments begin removing fluoride from their water, the need for supplemental fluoride is expected to grow.",
      "Officials in Utah \u2014 the first U.S. state to ban fluoride from drinking water \u2014 recently made fluoride supplements available without a prescription.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1962, the agency set guidelines for how much should be added to water.",
      "Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a \u201cdangerous neurotoxin\u201d tied to a range of health dangers. Last month, he announced a task force to scrutinize fluoride's use, while at the same time saying he would order the CDC to stop recommending it.",
      "A report last year by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program concluded that drinking water with more than twice the CDC\u2019s recommended level was associated with lower IQs in kids. The study was based on research conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico.",
      "\u201cEnding the use of ingestible fluoride is long overdue,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Tuesday. \"This decision brings us one step closer to delivering on President Trump\u2019s promise to Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "An influential government health panel recommends fluoride supplements for children between the ages of six months and 5 years if they live in areas with low fluoridation levels. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Forces judged the recommendation to have \u201chigh certainty\u201d of benefit, based on the available evidence.",
      "A 2010 paper from the American Dental Association recommended supplemental fluoride for children up to 16 years old who are at high risk of cavities. The recommendation was based on a review of studies across different age groups. The most common side effect associated with the products is spotting or discoloration of the teeth, caused by extra fluoride.",
      "The FDA regulates most dental products, including fluoride-containing toothpastes, supplements, mouthwashes and rinses.",
      "In recent weeks those products have increasingly been targeted with lawsuits and legal actions.",
      "Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced an investigation into the marketing of fluoride toothpastes by Colgate-Palmolive and Proctor and Gamble. A press release from his office described the companies' promotions as \u201cmisleading, deceptive and dangerous.\u201d",

It had previously been an issue primarily for mayors and other local officials, but Newsom pumped money into converting old motels into housing and launched other initiatives to tackle the issue.",

      "Newsom\u2019s model ordinance includes prohibitions on \u201cpersistent camping\u201d in one location and encampments blocking sidewalks and other public spaces. It asks cities and counties to provide notice and make every reasonable effort to identify and offer shelter before clearing an encampment.",
      "Organizations representing California's cities and counties balked at the suggestion that they are to blame for street conditions. They say they need dedicated, sustained funding over multiple years for permanent projects instead of sporadic, one-time funding.",
      "Carolyn Coleman, executive director and CEO of the League of California Cities, said that eight in 10 cities have policies to address encampments but they need money to address the root causes of homelessness, such as more housing.",
      "The California State Association of Counties said the state has not provided as much money to address homelessness as it says it has and that half of the money has gone to housing developers.",
      "Studies have shown that encampment bans and other punitive measures make it even harder for people to find stable housing and work, said Alex Visotzky with the National Alliance to End Homelessness.",
      "People may lose critical documents or lose contact with a trusted case manager, forcing them to start all over again.",
      "In Los Angeles, Jay Joshua watches over a small encampment in which he also lives. He says encampments can be a safe space for those living there.",
      "Major cities with Democratic mayors have already started cracking down on encampments, saying they present a public health and safety hazard.",
      "In San Francisco, new mayor Daniel Lurie vowed to clean up city sidewalks. In San Jose, Mayor Matt Mahan has proposed arrests if a person refuses shelter three times.",
      "Newsom can't make cities and counties adopt an encampment ban.",
      "But the proposed encampment legislation was paired with an announcement of $3.3 billion in grant money for facilities to treat mental health and substance abuse disorders, suggesting that he could condition state funding on compliance.",
      "In 2022, he paused $1 billion in state money for local government, saying that their plans to reduce homelessness fell short of the acceptable.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's plan to change the pricing model for some medications is already facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he's even signed the executive order set for Monday that, if implemented, could lower the cost of some drugs.",
      "Trump has promised that his plan \u2014 which is likely to tie the price of medications covered by Medicare and administered in a doctor\u2019s office to the lowest price paid by other countries \u2014 will significantly lower drug costs.",
      "\u201cI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION\u2019S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,\u201d the Republican president posted on social media on Sunday, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.",
      "But the nation's leading pharmaceutical lobby on Sunday pushed back, calling it a \u201cbad deal\u201d for American patients. Drugmakers have long argued that any threats to their profits could impact the research they do to develop new drugs.",
      "\u201cImporting foreign prices will cut billions of dollars from Medicare with no guarantee that it helps patients or improves their access to medicines,\u201d Stephen J.

      "Trump's so-called \u201cmost favored nation\u201d approach to Medicare drug pricing has been controversial since he first tried to implement it during his first term. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry has argued that Trump\u2019s 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \u201cupper hand\u201d in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.",
      "It's likely that Trump's executive order Monday will only impact drugs covered by Medicare Part B, the insurance for doctor\u2019s office visits. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor\u2019s visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay.",
      "A report by the first Trump administration found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",
      "Trump has played up the announcement, saying it will save taxpayers big money.",
      "\u201cOur Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,\u201d Trump added.",
      "But many Americans won't see the savings.",
      "Trump's proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office \u2014 think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring billions of dollars in savings to the government \u2014 not necessarily the \u201cTRILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u201d Trump boasted about in his post.",
      "Medicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both major political parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress.",
      "More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.",
      "Trump\u2019s post formally previewing the action came after he teased a \u201cvery big announcement\u201d last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn\u2019t related to trade or the tariffs he has announced for much of the world.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very big announcement to make \u2014 like as big as it gets,\u201d Trump said last week.",

      "Referring to drug companies\u2019 powerful lobbying efforts, he said that campaign contributions \u201ccan do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Vaccination teams are part of an effort by health authorities across Mexico to contain the country\u2019s biggest measles outbreak in decades",
      "CUAUHTEMOC, Mexico -- In a rickety white Nissan, nurse Sandra Aguirre and her vaccination team drive past apple orchards and cornfields stretching to the desert horizon. Aguirre goes door to door with a cooler of measles vaccines. In one of Latin America's biggest Mennonite communities, she knows many will decline to be vaccinated or even open their doors. But some will ask questions, and a handful might even agree to get shots on the spot.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out here every single day,\u201d said Aguirre, pausing to call out to an empty farm, checking for residents. \u201cTo gain trust of the Mennonites \u2013 because they\u2019re reserved and closed-off people \u2013 you have to meet them where they\u2019re at, show a friendly face.\u201d",
      "Aguirre's work is part of an effort by health authorities across the country to contain Mexico's biggest measles outbreak in decades, as cases climb not only here but in the U.S. and Canada. In Mexico, cases have been concentrated in the Mennonite community \u2014 long skeptical of vaccines and distrustful of authorities \u2014 in the northern border state of Chihuahua.",
      "Officials say results of their campaign alongside Mennonite leaders have been mixed \u2014 they cite tens of thousands of new vaccinations in Chihuahua, but infections have ballooned and spread past the community to Indigenous and other populations.",
      "Federal officials have documented 922 cases and one death in Chihuahua. Officials, health workers and local leaders say the numbers are likely underestimated, and misinformation about vaccines and endemic distrust of authorities are their biggest obstacles.",
      "Pressed against the fringes of the small northern city of Cuauhtemoc, the Mennonite settlement here spans about 40 kilometers (25 miles). With 23,000 residents, it's one of Cuauhtemoc's primary economic engines, but it's an isolated place where families keep to themselves. Some have turned to social media and anti-vaccine websites for research. Others use little technology but visit family in the United States, where they also hear misinformation \u2014 which then spreads through word of mouth.",
      "Chihuahua is a particularly worrisome place, officials say \u2014 as a border state, the risk that the preventable disease will continue spreading internationally and affect the most vulnerable is high.",
      "\u201cWe have a massive flow of people,\u201d said Alexis Hern\u00e1ndez, a Cuauhtemoc health official. \u201cThat makes things a lot more complicated.\u201d",
      "Mexico considered measles eliminated in 1998. But its vaccination rate against the virus was around 76% as of 2023, according to the World Health Organization \u2014 a dip from previous years and well below the 95% rate experts say is needed to prevent outbreaks.",
      "Mexico\u2019s current outbreak began in March. Officials traced it to an 8-year-old unvaccinated Mennonite boy who visited relatives in Seminole, Texas \u2014 at the center of the U.S. outbreak.",
      "Cases rapidly spread through Chihuahua's 46,000-strong Mennonite community via schools and churches, according to religious and health leaders. From there, they said, it spread to workers in orchards and cheese plants.",
      "Gloria Elizabeth Vega, an Indigenous Raramuri woman and single mother, fell sick in March. Because she's vaccinated, measles didn't occur to her until she broke out in hives. Her supervisor at the cheese factory \u2014 who also caught measles \u2014 told her she had to take 10 days of leave and docked her pay 40% for the week, Vega said.",
      "It's rare for vaccinated people to get measles, but officials say that may account for up to 10% of cases here, though they're milder.",
      "Vega tucked herself away in the back of her two-room home, hoping her daughter and mother \u2014 also vaccinated \u2014 wouldn\u2019t get sick. She wishes people would think of others when considering vaccination.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018Well, I have enough to be fine,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t think about that other person next to them, or wonder if that person has enough to live off of.\u201d",
      "Vaccination isn't required in Mexico. Schools can request vaccination records, federal health department spokesman Carlos Mateos said, but they cannot deny anyone access to education.",
      "In Chihuahua, some schools started reaching out to parents for copies of vaccination cards and encouraging shots, said Rodolfo Cort\u00e9s, state health ministry spokesman.",
      "It's unknown how many in the Mennonite community have gotten the vaccine \u2014 which is safe, with risks lower than those of measles complications.",
      "Gabriella Villegas, head of vaccination at a clinic treating Mennonites with measles, estimated 70% of community members are not vaccinated. Other health authorities estimated the vaccination rate around 50%.",
      "Mennonites who spoke to The Associated Press \u2014 most on condition of anonymity, fearing backlash \u2014 repeatedly cited vaccine misinformation. One man said U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long record of promoting anti-vaccine views and has called vaccination a personal choice, is a hero.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t accept vaccines; it\u2019s that easy. Because that\u2019s where freedom of expression comes in,\u201d said the man, Jacob Goertzen. \"If we can\u2019t make out own decisions, we don\u2019t live in a democracy.\u201d",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, Cuauhtemoc\u2019s health director, said outside influences affect community vaccine views.",
      "\u201cThe Mennonite population has a lot of access to social media and family members in the U.S. and Canada, where there are a lot of myths that have taken hold and many more \u2018anti-vaccine\u2019 groups than we have in Mexico,\u201d he said.",
      "During nurse Aguirre's vaccination drive, one man simply said people here \u201cprefer to cure themselves in their own way.\" A mother described getting sick with measles as a \"privilege\" and spoke of putting her unvaccinated 5- and 7-year-olds in a party so everyone could get sick and recover \u2014 a risky tactic doctors have long denounced.",
      "Mexico's lone death from measles was a 31-year-old Mennonite man in the settlement who had diabetes and high blood pressure, underlying conditions that often complicate sicknesses.",
      "Most people in Indigenous and other communities quickly agreed to vaccinate, officials told AP, but in Mennonite areas crews have to do more vigorous outreach \u2014 the door-to-door visits, follow-up calls and conversations, and involvement of local leaders.",
      "In Cuauhtemoc's settlement, that's leaders like Jacob Dyck Penner. As colony president, he and other leaders closed school for two weeks to slow infections, have made a push to show residents they\u2019re working with health authorities, and are encouraging vaccination.",
      "Leaders translate health information into Low German, the native language of most of the community. Penner and others are assisting vaccination teams, making sure families know how to access health services.",
      "\u201cWe had to find this way, together with doctors, to not pressure people or inspire distrust, so they can take their time and make their own decision to accept (being vaccinated),\u201d Penner said.",
      "Medics report more people visiting clinics, seeking vaccines for measles and other diseases. Still, Penner said, there a swath of people will always reject vaccinations.",
      "Health officials like Hern\u00e1ndez say they're concerned in particular for vulnerable populations including Indigenous groups, many of whom have fewer resources to cope.",
      "Vega, the single mother who got measles, said her job at the cheese factory was once a blessing, providing health insurance and steady pay.",
      "But the forced leave and docked pay left her reeling. She said she's living paycheck to paycheck and wonders how she'll pay the bills \u2014 her daughter's school supplies, lunches, tennis shoes.",
      "\u201cI have a daughter to keep afloat,\" she said. \"It\u2019s not like I have the option to wait and pay for things, for food.\u201d",

      "LUSAKA, Zambia -- The United States will cut $50 million worth of aid a year to the southern African country of Zambia because of the \u201csystematic\" theft of medicines and medical supplies the money paid for, the U.S. ambassador said Thursday.",
      "The U.S. had discovered in 2021 that medicines and supplies that were meant to be provided free to Zambians had been taken and were being sold by pharmacies across the country, U.S. Ambassador to Zambia Michael Gonzales said at a press briefing.",
      "He said that an investigation of around 2,000 pharmacies in Zambia between 2021 and 2023 found that nearly half of them were selling medicines and products paid for by U.S. aid funds.",
      "The Zambian government had failed to do enough to address the corruption after the U.S. informed it of the theft scandal in April 2024, Gonzales said.",
      "There was no immediate government comment Thursday.",
      "The $50 million is part of $128 million the U.S. gives to Zambia a year for medicines, medical supplies and other support for its health sector. Gonzales said the cuts would affect medications for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, three critical diseases affecting Zambians.",
      "\u201cThe United States is taking necessary steps to safeguard, and ensure the accountability of, American taxpayer funds,\u201d Gonzales said.",
      "The action was separate to President Donald Trump's decision to cut U.S. foreign aid across the world, Gonzales said.",
      "He said that the U.S. investigation into the theft also found that medications and supplies for Zambia paid for by the Global Fund and other international donors were also being sold in pharmacies.",
      "Gonzales said he had recommended to officials in Washington that the U.S. start cutting the aid from January next year to give Zambia time to plan new procurements of the life-saving drugs.",

      "A new U.S. government study provides the most complete picture yet of early-onset cancers, defined as cancer diagnosed before age 50",
      "Cancer before age 50 is rare, but increasing, in the United States and researchers want to know why.",
      "A new government study provides the most complete picture yet of early-onset cancers, finding that the largest increases are in breast, colorectal, kidney and uterine cancers. Scientists from the National Cancer Institute looked at data that included more than 2 million cancers diagnosed in people 15 to 49 years old between 2010 and 2019.",
      "Of 33 cancer types, 14 cancers had increasing rates in at least one younger age group. About 63% of the early-onset cancers were among women.",
      "\u201cThese kinds of patterns generally reflect something profound going on,\u201d said Tim Rebbeck of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who studies cancer risk and was not involved in the research. \u201cWe need to fund research that will help us understand.\"",
      "The findings were published Thursday in Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.",
      "The researchers compared cancer rates in 2019 to what would be expected based on 2010 rates.",
      "Breast cancer made up the largest share of the excess cancers, with about 4,800 additional cases. There were 2,000 more colorectal cancers compared with what would be expected based on the 2010 rates. There were 1,800 more kidney cancers and 1,200 additional uterine cancers.",
      "Reassuringly, death rates were not rising for most cancers in the young adult age groups, although increasing death rates were seen for colorectal, uterine and testicular cancers.",
      "Explanations will take more research. The big databases used for the study don't include information on risk factors or access to care. Theories abound and a big meeting is planned later this year to bring together experts in the area.",
      "\u201cSeveral of these cancer types are known to be associated with excess body weight and so one of the leading hypotheses is increasing rates of obesity,\u201d said lead author Meredith Shiels of the National Cancer Institute.",
      "Advances in cancer detection and changes in screening guidelines could be behind some early diagnoses.",
      "For breast cancer, the trend toward women having a first child at older ages is a possible explanation. Pregnancy and breastfeeding are known to reduce risk.",
      "This isn't happening across the board. Cancer rates in people under 50 are going down for more than a dozen types of cancer, with the largest declines in lung and prostate cancers.",
      "Cigarette smoking has been declining for decades, which likely accounts for the drop in lung cancer among younger adults.",
      "The drop in prostate cancer is likely tied to updated guidelines discouraging routine PSA testing in younger men because of concerns about overtreatment.",

      "Burkina Faso\u2019s junta leader Capt. Ibrahim Traore has sparked a social media debate, with some in Africa praising him and others criticizing him",
      "ABUJA, Nigeria -- As news emerged this week about hundreds of Burkina Faso citizens killed separately by both jihadi groups and government forces, images of Burkina Faso\u2019s junta leader Capt. Ibrahim Traore were plastered over Russian state media speaking about pan-Africanism and liberating the minds of the continent\u2019s youths.",
      "Traore, who was in Moscow for the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, is Africa\u2019s youngest leader at 37, a strong appeal for the continent's young population that is used to much older leaders.",
      "Since coming to power in September 2022 after the country\u2019s second coup that year, he has dwelt on a rhetoric of self-reliance and independence from the West, particularly former colonial ruler France \u2014 a message that often resonates with young Africans and the diaspora.",
      "The latest Traore frenzy reached a new peak late April with a solidarity march in the country\u2019s capital, Ouagadougou, following an alleged coup attempt and comments by Gen. Michael Langley, the head of U.S. military in Africa, accusing the Burkina Faso leader of misusing the country's gold reserves.",
      "Following the 2022 coup that brought him to power, Traore promised to end the country\u2019s decadeslong deadly security crisis and leverage its rich mineral resources for the benefit of its 24 million citizens.",
      "Alongside the coup-hit nations of Niger and Mali, Burkina Faso has since severed ties with the regional bloc of ECOWAS \u2014 criticized by many young Africans as representing the interest of leaders and not the citizens \u2014 as well as longstanding Western allies such as France, whose military provided security support to the government for many years to help its security crisis.",
      "Analysts and locals suggest that these factors, combined with his youth, have contributed to Traore\u2019s appeal among young Africans.",
      "\u201cThere is a growing consciousness among African youth at home and abroad that they need to do something about the continent\u2019s lack of progress,\u201d said Richard Alandu, a Ghanaian living near the border with Burkina Faso. \u201cIt appears Traore has become the face of that consciousness.\u201d",
      "The security crisis that Traore vowed to resolve has worsened instead, slowing the country\u2019s overall economic development and preventing most citizens from benefiting from its mineral wealth, according to analysts and researchers\u2019 data.",
      "\u201cThere has been no real progress on the ground\u201d in Burkina Faso, said Gbara Awanen, a professor of international relations and security studies at Nigeria\u2019s Baze University, who specializes in West Africa. \u201cA lot of it is just sleek propaganda.\"",
      "Data from the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED, shows that while 2,894 people were killed by both government and armed groups during the year before the 2022 coup, the number has more than doubled to at least 7,200 in the last year.",
      "Analysts say the attacks have worsened to the point that Ouagadougou is now increasingly threatened, with more than 60% of the country outside of government control. At least 2.1 million people have lost their homes as a result of the violence, and almost 6.5 million need humanitarian aid to survive, conservative estimates show.",
      "Babacar Ndiaye, a senior fellow at the Senegal-based Timbuktu Institute for Peace Studies, attributes the current frenzy surrounding Traore primarily to his popularity \u2014 and Russia-driven propaganda",
      "Despite Burkina Faso\u2019s worsening security crisis, Traore still has \u201cso much resonance and interest simply because of propaganda,\u201d Ndiaye said. \u201cIn Africa, there is deep frustration with the traditional leadership, so there is polarized anger towards a scapegoat that is the west.\u201d",
      "West Africa, meanwhile, has a history of young men seizing power as exemplified by John Jerry Rawlings in Ghana, Samuel Doe in Liberia and Thomas Sankara in Burkina Faso, all in the 1980s. That history, placed against the perceived failure of Western-style democracy in Africa, has helped to create conditions for idolizing the likes of Traore.",
      "Still, allegations of propaganda do not adequately explain the excitement that has built up around Africa\u2019s youngest ruler, according to Chidi Odinkalu, an Africa analyst and professor at Tufts University.",
      "\u201cTraore articulates a revolutionary message that is appealing to a young population frustrated by the thievery of what passes for \u2018democracy\u2019 in their own countries,\u201d said Odinkalu.",

      "Leading journalists were among dozens of people who marched through the Dominican Republic\u2019s capital to decry a bill that critics warn could lead to government censorship",
      "SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic -- Dozens of people, including prominent journalists, marched Tuesday through the Dominican Republic \u2019s capital to decry a bill that critics warn could lead to government censorship.",
      "The bill, which is expected to be approved, calls for the creation of an independent regulator that would oversee content published on social media and digital news sites, focusing especially on anything that would violate the privacy of children or someone\u2019s dignity. But critics say such a regulator could overreach.",
      "However, some journalists have publicly supported the bill, noting that it protects freedom of expression without prior censorship and calls for the respect of public criticism.",
      "Opponents of the bill say it is the latest measure under the administration of President Luis Abinader that appears aimed at stifling the media in the Caribbean country of more than 11 million people.",
      "Under Abinader, a newsroom located inside the National Palace in Santo Domingo was closed and journalists are now required to request access to press conferences and other events up to a week in advance. Under previous presidents, access was automatically granted to the palace with a verified press identification.",
      "Journalists also complain that government security has become more aggressive during press conferences.",
      "\u201cWe have seen how politicians repeatedly want to curtail the freedoms we have,\u201d Jaime Rinc\u00f3n, a reporter with El Nuevo Diario newspaper, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe are marching today for that reason, but also for the repeated abuse we have seen against our colleagues.\u201d",
      "During the march, journalists held signs and chanted, \u201cNo to censorship! Freedom of press!\u201d",
      "Rinc\u00f3n said the bill not only affects journalists\u2019 freedom of speech: \u201cIt is a freedom that all Dominicans have, because with the internet, you can express yourself through any social network.\u201d",
      "Rosalba Escalante, a reporter with ACD Media, who was recently pushed and stepped on by the security detail of Vice President Raquel Pe\u00f1a, who publicly apologized for the incident, also participated in Tuesday\u2019s march.",
      "\u201cStealthily, access to the presidential press is becoming increasingly limited,\u201d she told the AP.",
      "Abinader has not responded to the journalists\u2019 allegations, although when asked about the bill during a press conference on Monday he said he was not involved in its creation. \u201cI didn\u2019t even add a comma,\u201d he said.",
      "The protest march ended at the National Palace where a manifesto was presented calling for proper access to public records and elected officials, as well as an end to \u201charassment, censorship or reprisals\u201d against journalists, among other things.",

      "Judicial authorities in Iraq say that more than 19,000 prisoners have been released so far this year under a broad new amnesty law that eases prison crowding and frees some people convicted of terrorism-related crimes",
      "BAGHDAD -- More than 19,000 prisoners have been released in Iraq so far this year under a broad new amnesty law that eases prison crowding and frees some people convicted of terrorism-related crimes, judicial authorities said Tuesday.",
      "The amnesty covers some people convicted of the terror-related offense of membership in the Islamic State group, which had been seen by Sunni Muslims as disproportionately targeting their community. However, anyone convicted of a killing in connection with terrorism-related charges is not eligible for the amnesty. Other crimes covered under the amnesty include corruption, theft and drug use.",
      "The number of releases were announced following a meeting Tuesday in Baghdad among top judicial officials led by the head of the Supreme Judicial Council Faeq Zeidan to discuss the implementation of the new law, passed earlier this year.",
      "A statement released after the meeting said that 19,381 inmates were released from prisons during the first four months of the year. It added that the overall number of beneficiaries of the law, including those sentenced in absentia, those released on bail and those with outstanding arrest warrants, reached 93,597.",
      "Iraq's prisons face a crisis of overcrowding, with the justice minister saying earlier this month that the country's 31 prisons hold about 65,000 inmates despite being built to hold only about half that number.",
      "Thousands more detainees remain in the custody of security agencies but have not yet been transferred to the Justice Ministry due to a lack of prison capacity.",
      "Among provisions of the new law adopted in January is that some people convicted of terrorism charges can ask for a retrial if they assert that their confessions were taken under duress while in detention.",
      "The general amnesty law had strong support from Sunni lawmakers who argue that their community has been targeted by terrorism charges, with confessions sometimes extracted under torture.",
      "Thousands of detainees held in the country are linked to the Islamic State group, which was defeated in Iraq in 2017. Some former members of the extremist group were executed for their acts while they controlled large parts of the country.",
      "All executions have been halted under the general amnesty law.",
      "Iraq has faced criticism from human rights groups over its application of the death penalty and particularly over mass executions carried out without prior notice to lawyers or family members of the prisoners.",

      "One of the women, Bigeni Maina Mwangi, told The Associated Press how she was promised a beautician job in Saudi Arabia, she instead found herself thrust into a life of domestic servitude under exploitative conditions.",
      "\u201cThe contract I signed in Nairobi was changed the moment I landed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe agent said I had no choice but to work.\u201d",
      "Mwangi worked in Saudi Arabia for 17 months without pay. When she was finally sent home, her promised wages never came. Due to rising unemployment in Kenya, she found a better job in Dubai, but a return to Oman in 2020 led to even grimmer conditions.",
      "\u201cI worked in three houses non-stop, often without food,\u201d she said.",
      "The Amnesty report urges the Kenyan and Saudi governments to extend labor protections to domestic workers, prosecute abusive employers, and ban recruitment agencies complicit in exploitation.",
      "Another woman, Mejuma Shaban Ali, recounted signing her contract at Kenya\u2019s main airport before flying out in 2014. Her journey led her to what she described as \u201ca prison.\u201d",

      "Villagers in central Myanmar have held funerals for almost two dozen students and teachers killed in what they said was a airstrike on a school by one of the ruling military\u2019s jet fighters",
      "BANGKOK -- Funerals have been held in Myanmar for almost two dozen students and teachers alleged to have been killed in an airstrike on a local school by a ruling military jet fighter.",
      "Local resistance groups and independent media said Tuesday that 20 pupils and 2 teachers died in the attack on Ohe Htein Twin village, in Sagaing region\u2019s township of Tabayin, also known as Depayin. Their reports said that as many as 100 people were wounded.",
      "The dead students were from grades 2 to 11, with the youngest seven years old, according to the shadow National Unity Government, which serves as an umbrella organization for opponents of military rule",
      "A member of a local resistance group fighting against army rule told The Associated Press that another student, who was severely injured in Monday's bombing, died Tuesday afternoon while undergoing medical treatment.",
      "The resistance fighter, who requested that neither he nor his group be named for fear of arrest by the military, said the incident occurred while more than 100 students were studying in a school in the village, which has about 500 houses. He denied that any resistance fighters were stationed in the village that was attacked.",
      "Sagaing has been a stronghold of armed resistance to army rule in Myanmar, and the military in recent years has stepped up airstrikes in their fight against resistance forces, which include the armed People\u2019s Defense Forces. The resistance has no effective defense against air attacks, which many reports say hit non-military targets.",
      "Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army\u2019s 2021 takeover ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, which led to nationwide peaceful protests that escalated into a durable armed resistance denying the army control of much of the country.",
      "A report Tuesday in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper denied the army had carried out the airstrike, saying malicious media outlets were intentionally spreading fake information. The military's tight control over the media and the relative remoteness of many such incidents makes independent confirmation of what occurred difficult.",
      "The bodies of 18 of the victims, most of them under the age of 10 were buried Monday in two village cemeteries after hastily arranged funerals just a few hours after the bombing incident, the unidentified resistance fighter said.",
      "About 100 wounded people, both students and teachers, were being treated in regional hospitals as the village\u2019s clinic lacked adequate facilities. At least two victims have had to have limbs amputated, he added.",
      "A member of another resistance group, the White Depeyin People\u2019s Defence Force, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told the AP that the funerals concluded on Tuesday.",
      "A report on Tuesday by the Human Rights Ministry of the National Unity Government said the jet fighter took off from an airbase in Meiktila township in the central region of Mandalay on Monday morning and deliberately attacked the school with two cluster bombs while students were preparing to sit for their exams.",
      "\u201cAll individuals implicated in the commanding, execution, or collusion of deliberate air strikes against innocent children, students, and educators shall be subject to stringent judicial repercussions,\u201d the group said in a separate statement. \u201cNo avenue for impunity shall be permitted. Every responsible party will be pursued without respite, unequivocally identified, held accountable and subjected to stringent punitive measures under the full force of the law.\u201d",
      "The military has increasingly used airstrikes to counter the widespread armed struggle against its rule. More than 6,600 civilians are estimated to have been killed by security forces since the army's 2021 takeover, according to figures compiled by nongovernmental organizations.",
      "Airstrikes in Myanmar garnered increased attention recently when numerous reports deemed credible by the United Nations and human rights groups said that they continued to be carried out in the wake of Myanmar\u2019s devastating March 28 earthquake, after which the military and resistance groups declared ceasefires to facilitate relief efforts.",
      "\u201cWe are horrified by reports of a Myanmar regime airstrike on a school in an earthquake-affected area at a time when a ceasefire has been announced. Schools are meant to be a place of safety and opportunity, not collateral in a conflict,\" Britain's Minister for Indo-Pacific Catherine West said in a statement.",

      "LONDON -- A man who spent nearly four decades in a British prison in the killing of a barmaid said he was not angry or bitter Tuesday as his murder conviction was overturned and he was released after being exonerated by DNA evidence.",
      "Peter Sullivan put his hand over his mouth and wept as the Court of Appeal in London quashed his conviction and ordered his freedom after he had spent years fighting to prove his innocence.",
      "Sullivan, who watched the hearing by video from Wakefield prison in northern England, said through his lawyer that he was not resentful and was anxious to see his loved ones.",
      "\u201cAs god is my witness, it is said the truth shall take you free,\" attorney Sarah Myatt read from a statement outside court. \u201cIt is unfortunate that it does not give a timescale as we advance towards resolving the wrongs done to me. I am not angry, I am not bitter.\"",
      "He was the longest-serving victim of a wrongful conviction in the U.K., Myatt said.",
      "Sullivan, 68, was convicted in 1987 of killing Diane Sindall in Bebington, near Liverpool in northwest England. He was behind bars for 38 years.",
      "Sindall, 21, a florist who was engaged to be married, was returning home from a part-time job at a pub on a Friday night in August 1986 when her van ran out of fuel, police said. She was last seen walking along the road after midnight.",
      "Her body was found about 12 hours later in an alley. She had been sexually assaulted and badly beaten.",
      "Sexual fluid found on Sindall\u2019s body could not be scientifically analyzed until recently. A test in 2024 revealed it wasn\u2019t Sullivan, defense attorney Jason Pitter said.",
      "\u201cThe prosecution case is that it was one person. It was one person who carried out a sexual assault on the victim,\u201d Pitter said. \u201cThe evidence here is now that one person was not the defendant.\u201d",
      "Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson did not challenge the appeal and said that if the DNA evidence had been available at the time of the investigation it was inconceivable that Sullivan would have been prosecuted.",
      "Merseyside Police said it reopened the investigation as the appeal was underway and was \u201ccommitted to doing everything\u201d to find the killer.",
      "The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which examines possible wrongful convictions, declined to refer Sullivan\u2019s case to the appeals court in 2008 because it said testing at the time was unlikely to produce a DNA profile.",
      "A commission spokesperson said that while it made the correct decision based on the evidence at the time, it regretted not identifying the potential miscarriage of justice in its first review.",
      "Sullivan appealed in 2019 without the CCRC's help and the court turned down his bid in 2021.",
      "But the commission took up the case later that year and was able to use scientific techniques that hadn't been available during the earlier review to find the DNA that set Sullivan free.",
      "\u201cIn the light of that evidence, it is impossible to regard the appellant\u2019s conviction as safe,\u201d Justice Timothy Holroyde said.",
      "Police said the DNA found in the subsequent investigation does not match anyone in a national database. They've ruled out as suspects Sindall's fianc\u00e9, members of her family and more than 260 men who have been screened since they reopened the investigation.",
      "Sullivan's sister, Kim Smith, reflected outside the court on the toll the case had taken on two families.",
      "\u201cWe lost Peter for 39 years and at the end of the day it\u2019s not just us,\" Smith said. \u201cPeter hasn\u2019t won and neither has the Sindall family. They\u2019ve lost their daughter, they are not going to get her back. We\u2019ve got Peter back and now we\u2019ve got to try and build a life around him again.\u201d",

Three other small parties will take the rest.",

      "The Central Election Commission, the electoral executive, has said that by law the final results come out 48 hours after the vote ends. The results may be delayed following a request of the opposition not to consider ballots mailed from the diaspora in neighboring Greece, some 53,000, claiming they are manipulated.",

      "ROME -- Pope Leo XIV met with members of his Augustinian religious order on Tuesday, visiting the congregation\u2019s headquarters outside St. Peter\u2019s Square.",
      "Leo was seen arriving in a black vehicle at around lunchtime at the Agostinianum, the pontifical institute that also serves as the Rome-based residence and headquarters of the Order of St. Augustine. Leo left shortly before 3 p.m.",
      "The ethos of the order, which includes a contemplative spirituality, communal living and service to others, is traced to the fifth-century St. Augustine of Hippo, one of the theological and devotional giants of early Christianity.",
      "The former Rev. Robert Prevost, history's first American pope, was twice elected superior of the order, which was formed in the 13th century as a community of mendicant friars \u2014 dedicated to poverty, service and evangelization.",
      "Ever since his May 8 election, Leo has repeatedly emphasized that he's a \u201cson of St. Augustine\u201d and quoted from the saint.",
      "He visited an Augustinian-run Marian sanctuary south of Rome on Saturday in his first outing as pope, and during his first greeting to the world, Leo wore a pectoral cross given to him by his order that contained relics of the saint.",
      "Leo, the first Augustinian pope, has also kept as his papal coat of arms and motto \"In Illo uno unum.\u201d The words were pronounced by St. Augustine in a sermon to explain that \u201calthough we Christians are many, in the one Christ we are one.\u201d The emblem on the coast of arms is that of the Augustinian order: a pierced flaming heart and a book, representing the Scriptures.",

      "A top official says Turkey is closely monitoring any attempts to undermine its peace initiative with the PKK following the militant Kurdish group\u2019s announcement that it is ending its decades-long armed conflict with the Turkish state",
      "ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey is closely monitoring any attempts to undermine its peace initiative with the PKK, a senior official said Tuesday, following the militant Kurdish group\u2019s announcement that it is dissolving and ending its decades-long armed conflict with the Turkish state.",
      "The PKK, designated as a terrorist organization by several, announced the historic decision on Monday months after its imprisoned leader called for the group to formally disband and disarm \u2014 a move that could bring an end to one of the Middle East\u2019s longest-running insurgencies.",
      "In making the call, the PKK leader stressed the need for securing Kurdish rights through negotiation rather than armed struggle.",
      "Previous peace efforts with the group have failed, most recently in 2015. Given the past failures, a close aide to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed determination to uphold the current initiative and prevent any disruptions.",
      "\u201cWe are closely following attempts to sabotage the process and we will not allow anyone to test our state\u2019s determination in this regard,\u201d Fahrettin Altun, the head of the Turkish presidential communications office said.",
      "The PKK initially launched its struggle with the goal of establishing an independent Kurdish state. Over time, it moderated its objectives toward autonomy and greater Kurdish rights within Turkey. The conflict, which has spilled into neighboring Iraq and Syria, has claimed tens of thousands of lives since it began in the 1980s.",
      "The latest peace effort, which the government has labeled \u201cTerror-Free Turkey\u201d was launched in October, after a key ally of President Recep Tayyip suggested parole for PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan if the PKK renounces violence and disbands.",
      "Officials have not disclose details about the process that will follow the PKK\u2019s decision.",
      "Media close to the government have reported that the PKK\u2019s disarmament process is expected to take three to four months, with weapons being collected at designated locations in northern Iraq under official supervision.",
      "According to Hurriyet newspaper, the disarmament could be overseen jointly by Turkey and the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq or through a commission involving Turkey, the United States, European Union nations and Iraq.",
      "The newspaper also suggested that high-ranking PKK members may be relocated to third countries, while lower-ranking militants without arrest warrants could return to Turkey once a legal framework is established to facilitate their reintegration.",
      "Turkish officials have not responded to requests for comment on the report.",
      "Analysts expect Ocalan to see improved prison conditions following the PKK's disbandment.",
      "Erdogan said Monday the PKK\u2019s declaration should apply to all PKK-affiliated groups, including Kurdish groups in Syria.",
      "The Kurdish fighters in Syria have ties to the PKK and have been involved in intense fighting with Turkish-backed forces there. The leader of the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces previously said Ocalan\u2019s call for a dissolution does not apply to his group in Syria.",
      "The group then reached an agreement with the central government in Damascus for a nationwide ceasefire and its merger into the Syrian army. Despite the deal, Kurdish officials in Syria later declared their desire for a federal state, sparking tensions with the Syrian government.",
      "Some believe the main aim of the reconciliation effort is for Erdogan\u2019s government to garner Kurdish support for a new constitution that would allow him to remain in power beyond 2028, when his term ends.",

      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa will not attend an Arab League summit in Iraq this week and the country\u2019s delegation will be headed by the foreign minister, the president\u2019s office said Tuesday.",
      "A short statement released by the office of President Ahmad al-Sharaa did not give a reason why he will not attend the summit but an invitation by the Iraqi government last month trigged sharp political divisions in Iraq. The summit is scheduled to be held in Baghdad on Saturday.",
      "Al-Sharaa and his interim government in Syria have been scrambling to establish ties with countries across the Middle East in a bid to ease skepticism about his former ties to al-Qaida and to convince Washington to lift crippling economic sanctions on the battered country.",
      "Attending the Arab Summit would have been a major symbolic diplomatic victory for Damascus as well, as Al-Sharaa struggles to deal with opponents in the countries, largely from non-Sunni Muslim minority groups, as he tries to exert state authority across Syria.",
      "Al-Sharaa took power after leading a lightning rebel offensive that unseated his predecessor, Bashar Assad, in December. Since then, he has positioned himself as a statesman aiming to unite and rebuild his country after nearly 14 years of civil war, but his past as a Sunni Islamist militant has left many \u2014 including Shiite groups in Iraq \u2014 wary.",
      "Formerly known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, al-Sharaa joined the ranks of al-Qaida insurgents battling U.S. forces in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and still faces a warrant for his arrest on terrorism charges in Iraq.",
      "During Syria\u2019s conflict that began in March 2011, several Iraqi Shiite militias fought alongside Assad\u2019s forces, making al-Sharaa a particularly sensitive figure for them.",

      "The hourslong clashes, which involved heavy weapons, took place Monday evening into the early hours of Tuesday and centered in Tripoli\u2019s southern neighborhood of Abu Salim, the officials said.",
      "The fighting stemmed from the killing of Abdel-Ghani al-Kikli, commander of the Stabilization Support Authority, SSA, on Monday by a rival militia, a senior government and health official said.",
      "The SSA is an umbrella group of militias that rose to become one of the most powerful groups in western Libya, which has a history of atrocities and rights abuses during the country\u2019s long-running conflict. Al-Kikli, who was known as \u201cGheniwa,\u201d has been accused by Amnesty International of war crimes and other serious rights violations over the past decade.",
      "Al-Kikli was killed in a facility run by the 444 Brigade, a militia commanded by Mahmoud Hamza, a warlord close to Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, one of the officials said.",
      "Hamza\u2019s militia and their allies then attacked the offices of SSA across the capital, seizing their assets and detaining dozens of SSA fighters, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity for their safety.",
      "The Health Ministry\u2019s Ambulance and Emergency Services said in a statement that at least six people were killed in the vicinity of Abu Salim, the SSA stronghold. It said it helped evacuate many families trapped in the clashes.",
      "Residents reported heavy clashes and explosions in multiple areas in the capital, with dozens of vehicles carrying fighters affiliated with different militias in the streets.",
      "\u201cIt was a nightmare,\u201d said Ahmed Ammer, who lives in the city center, adding that the clashes were reminiscent of the civil war that engulfed the North African country following the 2011 overthrow and killing of longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi.",
      "He said the clashes subsided early Tuesday morning, but the situation has been tense with many fighters in the streets.",
      "Classes in the capital\u2019s schools were suspended on Tuesday, according to the Tripoli-based Education Ministry. The University of Tripoli also said it suspended studies, exams and administrative work until further notice.",
      "Dbeibah\u2019s government posted on its social media platforms early Tuesday that its forces carried out a military operation in Abu Salim and took full control of the area. It didn\u2019t provide further details.",
      "In a statement, the U.N. mission in Libya expressed alarm about the \u201cintense fighting with heavy weaponry in densely populated civilian areas\u201d and warned that \u201cattacks on civilians and civilian objects may amount to war crimes.\u201d",
      "The clashes were the latest bout of violence in the largely lawless Mediterranean country, which has been plunged into chaos and division since 2011. Amid the chaos, militias grew in wealth and power, particularly in Tripoli and the western part of the country.",
      "Libya has been divided for years between rival administrations in the east and west, each backed by armed groups and foreign governments. Currently, it is governed by Dbeibah\u2019s government in the west and by the administration of Prime Minister Ossama Hammad in the east.",

      "Russia has said it will send a delegation to Istanbul without preconditions.",
      "The U.S. has been applying stiff pressure on both sides to come to the table since President Donald Trump came to power in January with a promise to end the war.",
      "Military analysts say both sides are preparing a spring-summer campaign on the battlefield, where a war of attrition has killed tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said Monday that Russia is \u201cquickly replenishing front-line units with new recruits to maintain the battlefield initiative.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy will not be meeting with any Russian officials in Istanbul other than Putin, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said Tuesday on a YouTube show run by prominent Russian journalists in exile.",

      "A report from a London-based environmental group says illegal overfishing and destructive practices by foreign vessels are responsible for increased irregular migration to Spain from Senegal in West Africa",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Overfishing by foreign vessels is decimating fish stocks in the West African country of Senegal, which is in turn fueling migration to Spain, according to a report released Tuesday.",
      "The Environmental Justice Foundation, a London-based group specializing in environmental and human rights issues, said illegal overfishing and destructive practices by foreign vessels are responsible for increased irregular migration to Spain. It based its conclusions on interviews with fishermen in Spain and Senegal and its prior research on foreign overfishing.",
      "The group found that 57% of fish stocks in Senegal are in a \u201cstate of collapse,\u201d with foreign vessels playing a significant role in declining numbers. Its analysis showed 43.7% of licensed vessels in Senegal are foreign-controlled, predominantly of Spanish and Chinese origin.",
      "As fish populations dwindle, local fishermen are facing income loss, and many have turned to migration as a last resort. Fishing is an important economic sector in Senegal that employs 3% of the workforce.",
      "Irregular migration to the Canary Islands almost doubled in 2024, according to the Spanish Interior Ministry, reaching 46,843. While exact figures aren\u2019t known due to a lack of information on departures from West Africa, Senegal is one of the top three nationalities of arrivals to the Spanish islands.",
      "The Atlantic route from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. The Spanish migrant rights group Walking Borders estimates the victims were in the thousands last year.",
      "Migrants and former fishermen in the Canary Islands told the Environmental Justice Foundation that the treacherous journey to Spain was a last resort, a way to provide for families when fishing in Senegal could no longer put food on the table.",
      "\u201cIf I was able to gain enough money in fishing, I would never have come to Europe,\u201d said Memedou Racine Seck.",
      "Local activists in Senegal have voiced their frustration with foreign overfishing and its contribution to the migration crisis. Karim Sall, President of AGIRE, a Senegalese organization operating in the Joal-Fadiouth marine protected area, condemned foreign nations for their role in the crisis.",
      "\u201cI get so angry when (foreign nations) complain about immigration because they are the real pirates and what they did is worse than clandestine immigration. It\u2019s theft, plundering our resources to feed their own inhabitants while we suffer,\u201d said Sall.",
      "Industrial foreign fleets, many of which use bottom trawling techniques, are exacerbating the crisis. These vessels drag heavy nets across the seafloor, indiscriminately catching young fish and destroying marine ecosystems like seagrass and coral reefs, which are vital for fish reproduction. As a result, fish stocks are unable to recover, deepening the hardships of local fishing communities and eaters. Fish plays an important role in food security in Senegal, especially for protein consumption. Due to declining fish stocks, consumption per capita in Senegal has fallen from 29 kilograms per year to 17.8 kilograms per person.",
      "The report also pointed to a lack of transparency in fishing licenses and inadequate government management of fisheries as contributing factors. Despite efforts by the Senegalese government to address the crisis, experts warn that without stricter regulations on industrial foreign fleets, the situation will worsen.",
      "Migrant and former fisherman Souleymane Sady, who arrived in the Canary Islands in 2020, summed up the situation fishermen in Senegal face: \u201cSince the government cannot regulate the boats and we cannot work normally, we choose to run away from the country to come for stability,\u201d he said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Federal safety regulators have asked Elon Musk's car company to explain how its driverless taxis will avoid causing accidents when they hit the road in Texas next month before a national \u201crobotaxi\u201d launch that is key to keeping its stock price aloft.",
      "Tesla has been told to provide information on how its taxis will operate safely in Austin, Texas, when there is fog, sun glare, rain and other low-visibility conditions that have been tied to accidents involving the company's driver-assistance software. Those accidents, including one that killed a pedestrian, triggered the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to launch an investigation in October of 2.4 million of Musk's vehicles.",
      "The billionaire reassured investors on an earnings call last month that the robotaxi service would launch in Austin as planned and would quickly lead to millions of robotaxis and other autonomous self-driving Teslas operating around the country by the end of the year.",
      "\u201cWe expect a green light after Tesla\u2019s response but the big focus is on more widespread launches in the U.S. after the Austin pilot kicks off,\" said Wedbush Securities stock analyst Dan Ives. \u201cIt's a pivotal time for Musk.\u201d",
      "On that same call, Musk said he was stepping back from his work as President Donald Trump\u2019s government cost-cutting czar. Tesla\u2019s shares have risen 45% since but they're still down about 17% year to date.",
      "Regulators routinely request safety information from automakers and NHTSA's order itself is not alarming, though it could lead to delays of the Austin launch if Tesla's answers to the nine-page letter made public by the agency on Monday are not satisfactory. The agency gave Tesla until June 19 to provide a response.",
      "Federal regulators have limited powers over new Tesla taxis that operate without a steering wheel or brake pedals because there are no national regulations on self-driving technology. One fall back is that the vehicles themselves still must past longstanding safety checks.",
      "\u201cNHTSA can force a recall, either \u2018voluntarily,\u2019 by Tesla, or by ordering a recall,\u201d said Ann Carlson, the former acting NHTSA chief. \u201cThe agency cannot, however, require some sort of pre-approval before Tesla can launch.\u201d",
      "In the letter, regulators posed several questions to Tesla in addition to those about low-visibility conditions. They asked for the number and models of the taxis, when and where the taxis will be deployed in the next several months, how they will be monitored remotely by Tesla in real time, the cameras and other sensors being used to guide the vehicles, the specific measures used to judge whether they are navigating the streets in a safe way, and the names of people at Tesla making those evaluations.",
      "In his investor conference call last month, Musk spoke of an effortless driving future coming within months.",
      "\u201cCan you go to sleep in our cars and wake up at your destination?\" the billionaire asked, then answered, \"I\u2019m confident that will be available in many cities in the U.S. by the end of this year.\u201d",
      "If such a future doesn't come soon, the company could struggle to justify the stock's still-high price.",
      "Tesla reported a 71% drop in profits in the first quarter as it faced angry protests over Musk's embrace of extreme right-wing politicians in Europe and his role in cutting government jobs that has divided the country.",

      "The Iowa Senate has advanced a bill that would further complicate a massive carbon-capture pipeline project routed across several Midwestern states",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- The Iowa Senate advanced a bill that could further complicate a massive carbon-capture pipeline project routed across several Midwestern states after a long-winded and testy debate that exposed a clear rift among Republicans over property rights and the future of the state's agricultural dominance.",
      "The legislation that narrowly passed late Monday would prohibit the renewal of permits for a carbon dioxide pipeline, limit the use of such a pipeline to 25 years and significantly increase the insurance coverage requirements for the pipeline company. Those provisions would likely make it less financially feasible for a company to build the pipeline.",
      "Already passed by the House, the measure now goes to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds' desk. A spokesperson for the governor said Tuesday that the governor's office is reviewing the bill.",
      "The legislation could force adjustments to Summit Carbon Solutions\u2019 plans for the estimated $8.9 billion, 2,500-mile (4,023-kilometer) project, which are already strained after South Dakota\u2019s governor signed a ban on the use of eminent domain \u2014 the government seizure of private property with compensation \u2014 to acquire land for carbon dioxide pipelines.",
      "The project received permit approvals in Iowa, Minnesota and North Dakota, but it does face various court challenges, and its application was rejected in South Dakota.",
      "The Iowa Senate, already operating in overtime as legislative session drags on, came to a halt after a dozen Republican state senators insisted that their leaders bring a pipeline bill to the floor.",
      "In response, Summit spokesperson Sabrina Zenor this month outlined the company's investment to date, saying that the company remained committed to building the project and to Iowa.",
      "\u201cSummit Carbon Solutions has invested four years and nearly $175 million on voluntary agreements in Iowa, signing agreements with more than 1,300 landowners and securing 75% of the Phase One route,\u201d Zenor said in a May 1 statement.",
      "Zenor declined to comment Tuesday.",
      "Dozens of Summit employees and leaders and members of the Iowa Corn Growers Association, the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association and labor unions made a big showing as debate in the state Senate seemed inevitable. They told lawmakers that the project is essential for the future of Iowa\u2019s ethanol industry, for farmers and for construction jobs.",
      "The pipeline would carry carbon emissions from ethanol plants in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota to be stored underground permanently in North Dakota. By lowering carbon emissions from the plants, the pipeline would lower their carbon intensity scores and make them more competitive in the renewable fuels market.",
      "The project would also allow ethanol producers and Summit to tap into federal tax credits.",
      "A majority of the Iowa Senate \u201cturned their back on Iowa agriculture tonight,\u201d Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said in a statement.",
      "\u201cFor 25 years, Iowa has benefited greatly from being the most profitable place in the world to convert corn kernels into ethanol,\u201d said Shaw, who predicts that there will be severe economic consequences if the legislation is signed into law. \u201cIowa is poised to be left behind.\u201d",
      "The pipeline's critics accuse Summit of stepping on their property rights and downplaying the safety risks of building the pipeline alongside family homes, near schools and across ranches.",
      "Lee Enterprises and The Associated Press reviewed hundreds of cases that reveal the great legal lengths the company went to to get the project built. In South Dakota, in particular, a slew of eminent domain legal actions to obtain land sparked a groundswell of opposition that was closely watched by lawmakers in Iowa as well.",
      "Tensions flared among the Iowa Senate's Republican supermajority, with senators openly criticizing one another and exposing the closed-door discussions that got them there. Thirteen Republican senators joined with 14 Democrats in voting in favor of the bill. Twenty-one Republicans and one Democrat voted against it.",
      "The Republicans who opposed it stressed that they, too, respect private property rights. But they said the bill has holes that will threaten any infrastructure development in Iowa, not just carbon-capture pipelines.",
      "They criticized the bill for drawing out the permitting process by muddying up the standards of public use, allowing anyone, anywhere to intervene, and creating unnecessary insurance disputes between the company and landowners that may be miles away.",
      "The bill's backers said those criticisms are overblown interpretations of the legislation and distractions from the issue at hand.",
      "Republican state Sen. Jeff Taylor, who supports the bill, said it would fundamentally ensure that companies respect the constitutional requirement for eminent domain.",
      "\u201cBoth the Iowa Constitution and the federal Constitution specify what the requirement is for eminent domain: It\u2019s public use,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s not anything else. It\u2019s not a positive business climate, it\u2019s not helping the agribusiness in the state, it\u2019s not the price of corn or helping the ethanol plants. It\u2019s public use.\u201d",

      "A leading economist has been telling EU finance ministers that Russia\u2019s economy is under growing strain as its invasion of Ukraine drags on",
      "BRUSSELS -- Russia\u2019s economy is under growing strain as its invasion of Ukraine drags on and Western sanctions are undermining President Vladimir Putin\u2019s ability to sustain his war, a leading European economist said after briefing finance ministers on Tuesday.",
      "The economist, Torbj\u00f6rn Becker, Director of the Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics, warned that should Russia prevail, European Union governments would have to spend 2-3 times more than they currently do on defense for several years.",
      "Russia\u2019s \u201cfinancial system, their macroeconomic performance, is under pressure. It\u2019s not in balance. Risks are mounting. But it doesn\u2019t mean that we can sit back and relax,\u201d Becker told reporters at EU headquarters in Brussels.",
      "He spoke after briefing the bloc\u2019s finance ministers to help provide a picture of \u201cthe actual condition of Russia\u2019s economy, which significantly contrasts with the narrative promoted by Russian propaganda,\u201d the EU\u2019s Polish presidency said.",
      "It said that discussion would help \u201cus to better shape punitive, financial and economic sanctions against Russia.\u201d",
      "Becker said Russia\u2019s economy only accounts for about 12% of the economies of the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc. He underlined that it is highly dependent on oil and natural gas revenue, and on imports of high-tech equipment to sustain the war effort.",
      "Still, Russia\u2019s economy has outperformed predictions. High defense spending has propelled growth and kept unemployment low despite fueling inflation. At the same time, wages have gone up to keep pace with inflation, leaving many workers better off.",
      "Large recruiting bonuses for military enlistees and death benefits for those killed in Ukraine have also put more income into the country\u2019s poorer regions.",
      "Over the long term, inflation and a lack of foreign investments remain threats to the economy. The question is how long Russia\u2019s militarized economy can keep going before those issues bite and whether it can hold out for longer than Ukraine and its Western backers.",
      "To hit its economy harder, EU envoys have drafted a new set of sanctions that would target more ships in the shadow fleet of tankers that Russia has deployed to evade a price cap of $60 per barrel imposed on Russian oil by the Group of 7 democracies.",
      "They could also freeze the assets of the Nord Stream II gas pipeline consortium. The pipeline is not in use, but the EU believes the move could help to discourage investment. The sanctions could enter force as soon as Thursday.",
      "\u201cIf we can lower oil prices and gas revenues and put tighter sanctions on what they can import, that\u2019s great,\u201d Becker said. He said U.S. President Donald Trump should press \u201cChina and India about what they are paying for and what they\u2019re exporting to Russia.\u201d",
      "Russia found new markets for its oil in India and China after the EU imposed a near-total ban and continues to earn a substantial part of government revenues from exports of oil and gas.",
      "Becker also urged Trump to hit Russia\u2019s financial system by restricting international transactions. \u201cIf something ruins an economy pretty quickly, it\u2019s a banking crisis,\u201d he said.",
      "In a recent report, his institute said that Russia\u2019s oil revenues decreased dramatically in early 2025, notably due to EU and G7 sanctions on the ghost fleet. This has forced Russia to withdraw from its sovereign wealth fund.",
      "The institute estimates that the liquid part of the fund is now equivalent to less than 3% of GDP. \u201cIf oil prices stay as they are, they will certainly run out of these funds in a year,\u201d Becker said.",

But he said that he decided to come, and that he wanted to \u201cclarify\u201d President Aleksandar Vucic's visit to Moscow last week.",
      "Vucic, Costa said, \u201cexplained to me it was a moment to celebrate an event from the past.\"",
      "\u201cWe cannot rewrite the history, and (we) fully understand that Serbia celebrates (its) liberation\u201d by Soviet troops, Costa said, before referring to the Russia-Ukraine war. \u201cBut we cannot celebrate the liberation 80 years ago and don\u2019t condemn an invasion of another country today.\u201d",

      "A group of Serbian university students \u2014 who have been a key force behind the protests \u2014 were in Brussels this week after running a relay-style marathon there to draw EU attention to their struggle for justice and the rule of law that they say has been dismantled under Vucic's tight rule in the country.",
      "From Belgrade, Costa will travel later on Tuesday to Bosnia-Herzegovina where separatist policies of a Serb-run entity's president have revived ethnic tensions long after a 1992-95 war, and stalled pro-EU reforms.",

The EU's willingness to accept new members has grown since the all-out war in Ukraine started on Feb. 24, 2022, fearing the conflict could fuel instability in the volatile Balkans.",

      "TOKYO -- Honda\u2019s profit for the fiscal year through March slipped 24.5% from the previous year, as its vehicle sales in China dropped, and the Japanese automaker warned Tuesday that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs will worsen its earnings.",
      "Tokyo-based Honda Motor Co., which dropped talks to integrate its business with Japanese rival Nissan Motor Corp. earlier this year, said its annual profit totaled 835.8 billion yen ($5.6 billion), down from 1.1 trillion yen in the previous fiscal year.",

      "Executive Vice President Noriya Kaihara acknowledged that Trump\u2019s tariffs were likely to hurt, erasing 650 billion yen ($4.4 billion) from its operating profit for the fiscal year through March 2026. That's mainly because of U.S. tariffs on vehicles from Canada and Mexico. Honda\u2019s vehicle shipments from Japan to the U.S. are negligible.",
      "Officials stressed major uncertainties remain, but said they felt it was important to give a realistic projection, no matter how pessimistic it might be.",
      "Chief Executive Toshihiro Mibe said Honda will do its best to minimize the impact from tariffs. In the long term, Honda will transfer auto production to U.S. plants and rethink its investment plans. All decisions will be made \u201cvery carefully,\u201d Mibe told reporters.",
      "He also said Honda was sticking to its plans to produce more electric vehicles.",

      "Honda and Nissan announced in December they were going to hold talks to set up a joint holding company. Mitsubishi Motors Corp., another Japanese automaker, had said it was considering joining that group. But the plans quickly unraveled, with Nissan saying it wanted out because it would be at a disadvantage.",

      "The Netherlands and Australian governments brought the case against Moscow before the Montreal-based global aviation agency in 2022, and on Tuesday welcomed the verdict.",

      "It's the first time that the council, which represents 193 member states, has decided a dispute between governments.",

      "\u201cThe latter is important in order to ensure that the negotiations are conducted in good faith and according to specific timelines, and that they will yield actual results,\u201d he added.",
      "Dutch father Thomas Schansman, who lost his son in the disaster, said the ICAO decision makes it clear Russia was responsible for the tragedy and could lead to compensation, but that he and other relatives mostly want the country to acknowledge its culpability.",

      "\u201cRussia did not take part in the investigation of this incident and therefore we will not accept these biased conclusions,\u201d said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.",
      "Australian National University international law expert Don Rothwell said that the council had yet to publish the reasons for its decisions.",
      "\u201cOne of the consequences for this process will be that the council will probably make some recommendations that Russia pay what are called reparations, which is an international term for damages, as a result of its violation of international law,\u201d Rothwell said.",

      "A U.S. budget airline has begun making deportation flights out of an Arizona airport, an unusual and controversial move for a company that depends heavily on its consumer brand",
      "PHOENIX -- A budget airline that serves mostly small U.S. cities began federal deportation flights Monday out of Arizona, a move that's inspired an online boycott petition and sharp criticism from the union representing the carrier\u2019s flight attendants.",
      "Avelo Airlines announced in April it had signed an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security to make charter deportation flights from Mesa Gateway Airport outside Phoenix. It said it will use three Boeing 737-800 planes for the flights.",
      "The Houston-based airline is among a host of companies seeking to cash in on President Donald Trump's campaign for mass deportations.",
      "Congressional deliberations began last month on a tax bill with a goal of funding, in part, the removal of 1 million immigrants annually and housing 100,000 people in U.S. detention centers. The GOP plan calls for hiring 10,000 more U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and investigators.",
      "Avelo was launched in 2021 as COVID-19 still raged and billions of taxpayer dollars were propping up big airlines. It saves money mainly by flying older Boeing 737 jets that can be bought at relatively low prices. And it operates out of less-crowded and less-costly secondary airports, flying routes that are ignored by the big airlines. It said it had its first profitable quarter in late 2023.",
      "Andrew Levy, Avelo's founder and chief executive, said in announcing the agreement last month that the airline's work for ICE would help the company expand and protect jobs.",
      "\u201cWe realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,\" said Levy, an airline industry veteran with previous stints as a senior executive at United and Allegiant airlines.",
      "Avelo did not grant an interview request from The Associated Press.",
      "Financial and other details of the Avelo agreement \u2014 including destinations of the deportation flights \u2014 haven\u2019t publicly surfaced. The AP asked Avelo and ICE for a copy of the agreement, but neither provided the document. The airline said it wasn\u2019t authorized to release the contract.",
      "Several consumer brands have shunned being associated with deportations, a highly volatile issue that could drive away customers. During Trump's first term, authorities housed migrant children in hotels, prompting some hotel chains to say that they wouldn't participate.",
      "Many companies in the deportation business, such as detention center providers The Geo Group and Core Civic, rely little on consumer branding. Not Avelo, whose move inspired the boycott petition on change.org and drew criticism from the carrier's flight attendants union, which cited the difficulty of evacuating deportees from an aircraft in an emergency within the federal standard of 90 seconds or less.",
      "\u201cHaving an entire flight of people handcuffed and shackled would hinder any evacuation and risk injury or death,\u201d the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA said in a statement. \u201cIt also impedes our ability to respond to a medical emergency, fire on board, decompression, etc. We cannot do our jobs in these conditions.\u201d",
      "In New Haven, Connecticut, where Avelo flies out of Tweed New Haven Airport, Democratic Mayor Justin Elicker urged Avelo\u2019s CEO to reconsider. \u201cFor a company that champions themselves as \u2018New Haven\u2019s hometown airline,\u2019 this business decision is antithetical to New Haven\u2019s values,\u201d Elicker said in a statement.",
      "Protests were held outside airports in Arizona and Connecticut on Monday.",
      "In Mesa, over 30 protesters gathered on a road leading up to the airport, holding signs that denounced Trump\u2019s deportation efforts. In Connecticut, about 150 people assembled outside Tweed New Haven Airport, calling on travelers to boycott Avelo.",
      "John Jairo Lugo, co-founder and community organizing director of Unidad Latina en Acci\u00f3n in New Haven, said protesters hope to create a financial incentive for Avelo to back out of its work for the federal government.",
      "\u201cWe need to cause some economical damage to the company to really convince them that they should be on the side with the people and not with the government,\u201d Lugo said.",
      "Mesa, a Phoenix suburb with about 500,000 people, is one of five hubs for ICE Air, the immigration agency's air transport operation for deportations. ICE Air operated nearly 8,000 flights in a 12-month period through April, according to the advocacy group Witness at the Border.",
      "ICE contracts with an air broker, CSI Aviation, that hires two charter carriers -- GlobalX and Eastern Air Express -- to do most of the flights, said Tom Cartwright, who tracks flight data for Witness at the Border.",
      "Cartwright said it was unusual in recent years for commercial passenger carriers to carry out deportation flights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been with an air broker who then hires the carriers, and the carriers have not been regular commercial carriers, or what I call retail carriers, who are selling their own tickets,\u201d Cartwright said. \u201cAt least since I have been involved (in tracking ICE flights), they\u2019ve all been charter companies.\u201d",
      "Avelo will be a sub-carrier under a contract held by New Mexico-based CSI Aviation, which didn\u2019t respond to questions about how much money Avelo would make under the agreement.",
      "Avelo provides passenger service to more than 50 cities in the U.S., as well as locations in Jamaica, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Avelo does not operate regular commercial passenger service out of Mesa Gateway Airport, said airport spokesman Ryan Smith.",
      "In February 2024, Avelo said it had its first profitable quarter, though it didn't provide details. In an interview two months later with the AP, Levy declined to provide numbers, saying the airline was a private company and had no need to provide that information publicly. ___ Associated Press writer Susan Haigh in Hartford, Connecticut, contributed to this report.",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says a new software update prevented a third radar outage over the last two weeks at New Jersey's busy Newark airport when a telecommunications line failed again over the weekend",
      "A new software update prevented a third radar outage in the last two weeks at New Jersey's busy Newark airport when a telecommunications line failed again over the weekend, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday.",
      "At a news conference, Duffy also said the recent problems that have led to hundreds of cancellations and delays in Newark could have been avoided had action been taken by President Joe Biden's administration to better equip the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia \u2014 particularly after issues with the hardware in October and November that should have set off alarms.",
      "Duffy said the update the Federal Aviation Administration installed Friday night helped ensure the backup system worked on Sunday when there was another problem with the primary line coming into the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia. When a similar issue happened Friday and on April 28, the radar and communications systems went offline briefly, leaving controllers unable to see or talk to the planes.",
      "The FAA restricted traffic into Newark Liberty International Airport after the first incident, partly because several air traffic controllers went out on trauma leave afterward, worsening the already short staffing. Those limits, designed to keep flights safe, combined with an ongoing runway construction project in Newark, led to all the cancellations and delays. Later this week, the FAA will meet with all the airlines to discuss making those limits last into the summer.",
      "Even though the radar system stayed online Sunday, controllers were worried because of the two previous outages, so Duffy said they stopped all traffic at Newark airport for about 45 minutes as a precaution.",
      "Duffy said he will request an investigation into last year's move of Newark air traffic controllers from New York to Philadelphia to determine why more wasn't done to ensure there wouldn't be problems. Philadelphia is about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southwest of Newark.",
      "\u201cThe Biden-Buttigieg FAA bungled this move without properly hardening the telecom lines feeding the data, which was already well-known to be error-prone,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cWithout addressing the underlying infrastructure, they added more risk to the system.\u201d",
      "Duffy also said the FAA should have set up a new radar system for Newark in Philadelphia instead of piping the signal in from New York for controllers.",
      "Duffy and President Donald Trump have said that the problems in Newark are a prime example of why they developed a multibillion-dollar plan to overhaul that nation's air traffic control system, unveiled last week. Duffy blames the Biden administration for failing to do that, but those problems go back decades, even before the first Trump administration.",
      "An advisor to former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Duffy should spend more time trying to deal with the nation's problems, and he defended the Biden administration's efforts to bolster air traffic controller hiring and make a down payment on dealing with some of the infrastructure problems.",
      "\u201cSecretary Duffy has a tough job. But he needs to spend more time doing what the American people are paying him to do \u2014 fix problems \u2014 and less time blaming others,\" said Chris Meagher.",
      "Duffy laid out an extensive plan to replace the nation's outdated air traffic control system last week, including installing 4,600 new high-speed data connections and replacing 618 radars, but didn't put a price tag on the plan other than to say it will cost billions.",
      "The FAA has installed new fiber optic lines at Newark airport and New York's Kennedy International and LaGuardia airports to replace old copper wires since the first outage, but plans to spend the next two weeks testing those new lines out before switching over to them.",

      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to lower its 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods by 115 percentage points, while China agreed to lower its retaliatory 125% rate on U.S. goods by the same amount. The two sides plan to continue negotiations on a longer-term trade deal.",
      "National Retail Federation President and CEO Matthew Shay said the move was a \u201ccritical first step to provide some short-term relief for retailers and other businesses that are in the midst of ordering merchandise for the winter holiday season.\u201d",

      "Jeremy Rice, the co-owner of a Lexington, Kentucky, home-d\u00e9cor shop that specializes in artificial flower arrangements, said the limited pause makes him unsure how to approach pricing.

      "\u201cOur vendors are still kind of running around juggling, not knowing what they\u2019re gonna do,\u201d Rice said. \u201cWe ordered in what we could pre-tariff and so there\u2019s stock here, but we\u2019re getting to the point now where there\u2019s things that are gone and we\u2019re going to have to figure out how we\u2019re gonna approach it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no relief,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of like you\u2019re just waiting for the next shoe to drop.\u201d",
      "Before Trump started the latest U.S. tariff battle with China, Miami-based game company All Things Equal was preparing to launch its first electronic board game.

      "When the president in February added a 20% tariff on products made in China, Poses started removing unessential features such as embossed packaging. When the rate went up to 145%, he faced two options: leave the goods in China or send them to bonded warehouses, a storage method which allow importers to defer duty payments for up to five years.",
      "Poses contacted his factories in China on Monday to arrange the deferred shipments, but with his games still subject to a 30% tariff, he said he would have to cut back on marketing to keep the electronic game priced at $29.99. With other businesses also in a rush to get their products, he said he is worried he won't be able to his into shipping containers and that if he does, the cost will be much more expensive.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to plan because if you want to go back to production in a couple of months, then you\u2019re worried about what will the tariff rate be when it hits the U.S. ports after that 90-day period,\u201d Poses said.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to change the pricing model for some medications is facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he\u2019s even signed an executive order he says will lower the costs of drugs",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's plan to change the pricing model for some medications is already facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he's even signed the executive order set for Monday that, if implemented, could lower the cost of some drugs.",
      "Trump has promised that his plan \u2014 which is likely to tie the price of medications covered by Medicare and administered in a doctor\u2019s office to the lowest price paid by other countries \u2014 will significantly lower drug costs.",
      "\u201cI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION\u2019S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,\u201d the Republican president posted on social media on Sunday, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.",
      "But the nation's leading pharmaceutical lobby on Sunday pushed back, calling it a \u201cbad deal\u201d for American patients. Drugmakers have long argued that any threats to their profits could impact the research they do to develop new drugs.",
      "\u201cImporting foreign prices will cut billions of dollars from Medicare with no guarantee that it helps patients or improves their access to medicines,\u201d Stephen J. Ubl, the president and CEO of PhRMA, said in a statement. \u201cIt jeopardizes the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America, making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines.\u201d",
      "Trump's so-called \u201cmost favored nation\u201d approach to Medicare drug pricing has been controversial since he first tried to implement it during his first term. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry has argued that Trump\u2019s 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \u201cupper hand\u201d in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.",
      "It's likely that Trump's executive order Monday will only impact drugs covered by Medicare Part B, the insurance for doctor\u2019s office visits. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor\u2019s visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay.",
      "A report by the first Trump administration found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",
      "Trump has played up the announcement, saying it will save taxpayers big money.",
      "\u201cOur Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,\u201d Trump added.",
      "But many Americans won't see the savings.",
      "Trump's proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office \u2014 think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring billions of dollars in savings to the government \u2014 not necessarily the \u201cTRILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u201d Trump boasted about in his post.",
      "Medicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both major political parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress.",
      "More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.",
      "Trump\u2019s post formally previewing the action came after he teased a \u201cvery big announcement\u201d last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn\u2019t related to trade or the tariffs he has announced for much of the world.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very big announcement to make \u2014 like as big as it gets,\u201d Trump said last week.",
      "He came into his first term accusing pharmaceutical companies of \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d and complaining that other countries whose governments set drug prices were taking advantage of Americans.",
      "On Sunday, Trump took aim at the industry again, writing that the \u201cPharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say, for years, that it was Research and Development Costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the \u2018suckers\u2019 of America, ALONE.\u201d",
      "Referring to drug companies\u2019 powerful lobbying efforts, he said that campaign contributions \u201ccan do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party.\u201d",

      "House Republicans have unveiled the cost-saving centerpiece of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans unveiled the cost-saving centerpiece of President Donald Trump's \u201c big, beautiful bill \u201d late Sunday, at least $880 billion in cuts largely to Medicaid to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks.",
      "Tallying hundreds of pages, the legislation is touching off the biggest political fight over health care since Republicans tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, during Trump's first term in 2017 \u2014 which ended in failure.",
      "While Republicans insist they are simply rooting out \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse\u201d to generate savings with new work and eligibility requirements, Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage. A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.",
      "\u201cSavings like these allow us to use this bill to renew the Trump tax cuts and keep Republicans\u2019 promise to hardworking middle-class families,\u201d said Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, the GOP chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which handles health care spending.",
      "But Democrats said the cuts are \u201cshameful\u201d and essentially amount to another attempt to repeal Obamacare.",
      "\u201cIn no uncertain terms, millions of Americans will lose their health care coverage,\" said Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the panel. He said \"hospitals will close, seniors will not be able to access the care they need, and premiums will rise for millions of people if this bill passes.\"",
      "As Republicans race toward House Speaker Mike Johnson's Memorial Day deadline to pass Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, they are preparing to flood the zone with round-the-clock public hearings this week on various sections before they are stitched together in what will become a massive package.",
      "The politics ahead are uncertain. More than a dozen House Republicans have told Johnson and GOP leaders they will not support cuts to the health care safety net programs that residents back home depend on. Trump himself has shied away from a repeat of his first term, vowing there will be no cuts to Medicaid.",
      "All told, 11 committees in the House have been compiling their sections of the package as Republicans seek at least $1.5 trillion in savings to help cover the cost of preserving the 2017 tax breaks, which were approved during Trump\u2019s first term and are expiring at the end of the year.",
      "But the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee has been among the most watched. The committee was instructed to come up with $880 billion in savings and reached that goal, primarily with the health care cuts, but also by rolling back Biden-era green energy programs. The preliminary CBO analysis said the committee's proposals would reduce the deficit by $912 billion over the decade \u2014 with at least $715 billion coming from the health provisions.",
      "Central to the savings are changes to Medicaid, which provides almost free health care to more than 70 million Americans, and the Affordable Care Act, which has expanded in the 15 years since it was first approved to cover millions more.",
      "To be eligible for Medicaid, there would be new \u201ccommunity engagement requirements\u201d of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents. People would also have to verify their eligibility to be in the program twice a year, rather than just once.",
      "This is likely to lead to more churn in the program and present hurdles for people to stay covered, especially if they have to drive far to a local benefits office to verify their income in person. But Republicans say it\u2019ll ensure that the program is administered to those who qualify for it.",
      "Many states have expanded their Medicaid rosters thanks to federal incentives, but the legislation would cut a 5% boost that was put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Federal funding to the states for immigrants who have not shown proof of citizenship would be prohibited.",
      "There would be a freeze on the so-called provider tax that some states use to help pay for large portions of their Medicaid programs. The extra tax often leads to higher payments from the federal government, which critics say is a loophole that creates abuse in the system.",
      "The energy portions of the legislation run far fewer pages, but include rollbacks of climate-change strategies President Joe Biden signed into law in the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "It proposes rescinding funds for a range of energy loans and investment programs while providing expedited permitting for natural gas development and oil pipelines.",

      "President Donald Trump says he\u2019ll sign an executive order that, if implemented, could bring down the costs of some medications",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he'll sign an executive order on Monday that, if implemented, could bring down the costs of some medications \u2014 reviving a failed effort from his first term on an issue he's talked up since even before becoming president.",
      "The order Trump is promising will direct the Department of Health and Human Services to tie what Medicare pays for medications administered in a doctor's office to the lowest price paid by other countries.",
      "\u201cI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION\u2019S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,\u201d the president posted Sunday on his social media site, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.",
      "\u201cOur Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,\u201d Trump added.",
      "His proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office \u2014 think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring significant savings to the government, although the \u201cTRILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u201d Trump boasted about in his post may be an exaggeration.",
      "Medicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress.",
      "Under the planned order, the federal government would tie what it pays pharmaceutical companies for those drugs to the price paid by a group of other, economically advanced countries \u2014 the so-called \u201cmost favored nation\" approach.",
      "The proposal will face fierce opposition from the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "It was a rule that Trump tried to adopt during his first term, but could never get through. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under the Biden administration.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry argued that Trump\u2019s 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \u201cupper hand\u201d in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.. The industry has long argued that forcing lower prices will hurt profits, and ultimately affect innovation and its efforts to develop new medicines.",
      "Only drugs on Medicare Part B \u2014 the insurance for doctor's office visits \u2014 are likely to be covered under the plan. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor's visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay.",
      "A report by the Trump administration during its first term found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",
      "More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.",
      "Trump's post formally previewing the action came after he teased a \u201cvery big announcement\u201d last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn't related to trade or the tariffs he has announced imposing on much of the world.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very big announcement to make \u2014 like as big as it gets,\u201d Trump said last week.",
      "He came into his first term accusing pharmaceutical companies of \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d and complaining that other countries whose governments set drug prices were taking advantage of Americans.",
      "On Sunday, Trump took aim at the industry again, writing that the \u201cPharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say, for years, that it was Research and Development Costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the \u2018suckers\u2019 of America, ALONE.\u201d",
      "Referring to drug companies' powerful lobbying efforts, he said that campaign contributions \u201ccan do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A new study shows that people Zepbound lost about 50% more weight than those using Wegovy",
      "People taking Eli Lilly's obesity drug, Zepbound, lost nearly 50% more weight than those using rival Novo Nordisk's Wegovy in the first head-to-head study of the blockbuster medications.",
      "Clinical trial participants who took tirzepatide, the drug sold as Zepbound, lost an average of 50 pounds (22.8 kilograms) over 72 weeks, while those who took semaglutide, or Wegovy, lost about 33 pounds (15 kilograms). That's according to the study funded by Lilly, which was published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Both drugs are part of a new class of medications that work by mimicking hormones in the gut and brain that regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. But tirzepatide targets two such hormones, known as GLP-1 and GIP, while semaglutide targets GLP-1 alone, said Dr. Louis Aronne, director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine.",
      "\u201cTwo drugs together can produce better weight loss,\u201d said Aronne, who led the study and presented the findings Sunday at the European Congress on Obesity in Spain.",
      "While tirzepatide won out in what Aronne said many view as \u201ca drag race of efficacy,\u201d both are important tools for treating obesity, which affects about 40% of American adults.",
      "\u201cThe point of these medications is to improve health,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of people won't need the most effective medication.\u201d",
      "The trial included 751 people from across the U.S. who were overweight or had obesity and at least one other weight-related health problem, but not diabetes. Participants received weekly injections of the highest tolerated doses of Zepbound, either 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams, or Wegovy, 1.7 milligrams or 2.4 milligrams.",
      "By the end of the trial, those who took Zepbound lost about 20% of their body weight on average, compared with a nearly 14% loss for those who took Wegovy. The tirzepatide group trimmed about 7 inches (17.8 centimeters) from their waist circumference, compared to about 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) with semaglutide. In addition, nearly 32% of people taking Zepbound lost at least a quarter of their body weight, compared to about 16% of those taking Wegovy, the study found.",
      "Weight loss was about 6% lower in men than in women in both groups, the authors noted. As participants in both groups lost more weight, they saw improvements in health markers such as blood pressure, blood fat and blood sugar levels.",
      "More than three-quarters of patients taking both drugs reported at least one side effect, mostly mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues such as nausea, constipation, diarrhea and vomiting. About 6% of participants taking Zepbound left the trial because of adverse events, compared with 8% of those taking semaglutide.",
      "The GLP-1 drugs have become increasingly popular, with at least 1 in 8 U.S. adults reporting their use, according to a 2024 survey by KFF, a independent health policy research organization. Zepbound generated $4.9 billion in global sales last year. Wegovy brought in nearly $8.8 billion (58.2 billlion Danish kroner).",
      "Access and affordability have limited wider use of the drugs. Tirzepatide and semaglutide were removed recently from a list of drug shortages by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Both manufacturers recently released programs that cut costs to about $500 per month or less, depending on the dose.",
      "Other factors can affect access. This week, CVS Health said Wegovy will become the preferred option on its standard formulary, or list of covered drugs, as of July 1. Zepbound will be excluded.",
      "It's important to have a range of drugs to treat a disease as widespread as obesity in the U.S., said Dr. Angela Fitch, chief medical officer of knownwell, an obesity care company. Wegovy has been found to cut the risk of serious heart problems by 20%, she noted. A drug may work well for one patient, but not for others.",
      "\u201cWe're going to need to use them all just because we have so many patients who need treatment,\u201d she added.",

      "She then went out and put together one of the best performances in league history.",
      "The problem is her teammates didn't all come along, and the two-time defending champion Aces never quite found their game and eventually were eliminated by eventual winner New York in the semifinals. As satisfying as last season was individually for Wilson, failing to meet Las Vegas' high standards as a team sticks with her.",
      "And that same drive that fueled her last season remains.",
      "\u201cI want to be the best,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cNormally, you're classified the best when you win games and you win championships, so that was my whole mentality coming into this offseason. It was a long offseason. It was a long, dull offseason because we lost. Sometimes you need that \u2018L\u2019 to wake you up.\"",
      "The offseason, however, wasn't a complete disappointment.",

      "That includes what to come with the Aces this season.",
      "Wilson and the Aces return with most of the core intact but with some notable changes. Las Vegas helped orchestrate a three-team trade in January that sent Kelsey Plum to Los Angeles and landed Jewell Loyd from Seattle. The Aces also have what is essentially a new player in Liz Kitley, a post player who was drafted 24th a year ago but didn't play because of a torn ACL.",
      "Plus, returning All-Star guards Chelsea Gray and Jackie Young should be healthy after playing through injuries last season.",
      "\u201cMe being healthy is a game changer, just getting everybody organized and being a leader and knowing the flows and ins and outs of the game,\u201d Gray said. \u201cA'ja, I think it only helps her as well. We can get into some actions and stuff. It's hard when you look at it defensively. You have A'ja and you want to come double, who do you come off of? Who do you rotate to?\u201d",
      "That was part of why the Aces had their dominant two-year stretch. They could make opponents pay for placing too much attention on Wilson in the frontcourt, and she could take advantage when defenses backed off her to try to take away Las Vegas' perimeter shooting.",
      "It almost didn't matter what kind of defense Wilson faced last season. She was on a mission from the beginning and averaged 26.9 points and 11.8 rebounds, joining the Houston Comets' Cynthia Cooper in 1997 as the league's only unanimous choices for MVP.",
      "\u201cShe put together the single most greatest individual season in WNBA history,\u201d Aces coach Becky Hammon said. \"Not only was it historical numbers-wise in the W, it would be the same in the NBA. It was just unprecedented.",
      "\u201cHowever, she was very upset with not winning a championship. So, to her, that was like, \u2018How do I get more out of my teammates?\u2019 We talked about it. We've got to get greatness out of everybody else. One person being great isn't enough, and she recognizes that.\u201d",

      "Defending champion New York and Breanna Stewart figure to be in the conversation again, Caitlin Clark-led Indiana upgraded in the offseason and became one of the favorites, and Minnesota and Napheesa Collier came oh-so-close after losing in overtime to the Liberty in Game 5 of the finals.",
      "But Wilson senses a different vibe in the Aces' locker room compared with last year at this time, one that more closely resembles the team that won it all in 2022 and 2023.",
      "\u201cIt kind of sucks when the mindset (with other players) wasn't where it is,\u201d Wilson said. \"But it's also human nature. When you come in after winning back to back, you have this feeling of, \u2018What else do we have to do?\u2019 We've already executed and done more than people may have expected us to do.",

But we don\u2019t need Superman. I play the long game. If he can, we know he will, but there\u2019s no pressure. We\u2019ve got to figure out how to win, whether he plays or not.\u201d",

      "The first day of practice for the 109th Indianapolis 500 has been delayed by rain, causing a disruption to Tuesday\u2019s schedule at Indianapolis Motor Speedway",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- The first day of practice for the 109th Indianapolis 500 has been delayed by rain, causing a disruption to Tuesday's schedule at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.",
      "The day was supposed to begin with a two-hour window for Arrow McLaren team principal Tony Kanaan to run a veteran refresher course in case he's needed to substitute for NASCAR star Kyle Larson, who is attempting to run both the Indy 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on May 25. It will be Larson's second attempt at completing 1,100 miles on the same day; last year rain in both Indianapolis and Charlotte, North Carolina, prevented him from turning a lap at the 600.",
      "The rain Tuesday in Indianapolis delayed all on-track activity, so IndyCar is expected to go to full field practice if weather permits. Kanaan will have to complete the refresher course at a later time.",
      "But it's needed because NASCAR is adamant that Larson make the Coca-Cola 600 a priority. The Indy 500 was delayed by rain last year and Hendrick Motorsports made the decision to leave him at the speedway for the 500 and arrive late in North Carolina. But by the time he got to Charlotte Motor Speedway, the race was in a rain stoppage and never resumed.",
      "It took NASCAR several weeks to decide whether or not it would grant Larson the waiver he needed to remain eligible for the playoffs, and this year NASCAR has made it clear he must be at the 600 or it will cost him dearly in his pursuit of a second Cup Series championship.",
      "Larson was not discouraged by Tuesday's rain, even though the long-range forecast shows pockets of rain all the way into next week.",
      "In fact, despite his non-stop racing schedule and run of NASCAR success \u2014 he's tied for the Cup Series points lead and tied with Christopher Bell with three wins so far this season \u2014 he said he's relaxed for the 500 and called it the \u201cbiggest event of the year.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery day is something really cool and just being part of it is special,\u201d Larson said. \u201cHopefully we can make the couple of weeks special and perform well on the track, get to the All-Star race, and then the 600 next week. I know we're going to have good cars for (the NASCAR races) so good times to be Kyle Larson.\u201d",
      "He did say of all the different disciplines of racing he does, IndyCar is the most difficult because it requires the most work from him inside the cockpit.",
      "\u201cEverything besides the Indy car is really easy because I do it often,\u201d Larson said. \u201cIndyCar is difficult to drive because there's so much more going on in the car. Sprint cars, I rarely touch, nothing matters. But the Indy car has so many adjustments. I feel like I am studying the wheel, staring at the wheel, and then they tell me to make an adjustment and I need to find it quickly, or hope it comes from memory. That part is what gets me.\u201d",
      "Kanaan, meanwhile, is the 2013 Indy 500 winner but last raced the event in 2023 for McLaren. He then moved into a management role with the team and has since been promoted to team principal.",
      "He said his wife noticed immediately it was a scheduled on-track day for Kanaan when she said \u201cGood morning\u201d and he grumbled a reply.",
      "\u201cShe said \u2018I guess the race car driver is back,\u2019\u201d Kanaan said of his wife, Lauren.",

      "Justin Thomas has positioned himself to turn back the clock at the PGA Championship",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Justin Thomas has positioned himself to turn back the clock at the PGA Championship.",
      "The resurgent Thomas returns to Quail Hollow this week looking to recapture some of the magic from his first major victory at the 2017 PGA Championship when he posted a two-shot victory over Francesco Molinari, Louis Oosthuizen and Patrick Reed.",
      "The 32-year-old Thomas finally appears to have his game back on track following a years-long slump.",
      "He\u2019s finished tied for second or better in three of his last four tournaments with a combined score of 41-under par, including a playoff win last month over Andrew Novak at the RBC Heritage that snapped a three-year winless drought on the PGA Tour.",
      "The only tournament he hasn't been competitive in over the last month was the Masters. He finished tied for 36th.",
      "Still, it is one of Thomas' best stretches of golf since 2016-17 when he became the fourth player behind Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods and Jordan Spieth to win five times in the same season, including a major, before his 25th birthday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just more patient, I\u2019d say,\u201d Thomas said of his recent improved play. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m forcing the issue as much. Just trying to trust my game and myself quite a bit more. I feel like some of the events maybe earlier this year or last year where I had a chance to win, I just felt like maybe I pressed a little too much.\"",
      "While the memory of celebrating his first major on the 18th green at Quail Hollow eight years ago with his father Mike, then a PGA Tour professional at Harmony Landing in Louisville, Kentucky, and a former member of the PGA\u2019s board of directors, will forever be etched in his memory, Thomas admitted there's probably not much carryover from that to help him this week.",
      "That tournament was played during the summer on what he called a \u201ccompletely different golf course\u201d with Bermuda grass versus overseed.",
      "This one comes in the spring, with a course that will have absorbed several inches of rain by the time golfers tee off on Thursday, likely meaning that an already long course will play even longer.",
      "\u201cAs much as I\u2019d like to say (it matters), I think that\u2019s a bit of a stretch,\u201d Thomas said.",
      "However, Thomas said his knowledge of the course and the confidence of knowing he can handle Quail Hollow's difficult three closing holes known as the \u201cGreen Mile\u201d could pay dividends if he's near the top of the leaderboard on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m coming down the stretch and trying to win the tournament, I can tell myself I\u2019ve literally done this before here,\u201d Thomas said. \"I\u2019ve hit the shots. I\u2019ve made the putts. I\u2019ve handled all of that mentally on this exact golf course in this exact tournament.\"",
      "It's helpful, too, that the weight of a losing streak has been lifted from his shoulders.",
      "The win at Harbour Town last month \u2014 his first since the 2022 PGA Championship at Southern Hills \u2014 was something he called \u201cthe last thing I needed to do for my own well-being\" and helped jettison him back into the top 10 in the world, while proving he's capable of making big shots to close out a win.",
      "He nearly pulled off another last week at the Truist Championship, but wound up tied for second after a late run at the leaders.",
      "He's in the right \u201chead space,\u201d and he appears set on reaching bigger goals ahead.",
      "Thomas said watching Rory McIlroy clinch the career Grand Slam last month with a win at the Masters has ignited some competitive jealousy within him. Although he's never won a major other than the PGA Championship, Thomas feels like it's something he's capable of accomplishing in his career.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of faith and a lot of ability \u2014 or trust in my ability,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI have confidence in, I feel like, what I can do. Obviously I knew I always wanted to win the Grand Slam, wanted to win all the majors. For some reason watching somebody do it firsthand, it reminded me almost of, damn, I forgot, I really do want to do that.\u201d",

      "Morgan was among the first players signed by the Wave after the club joined the NWSL in 2021. She went on to play 63 matches with the Wave and scored 28 goals, including the team's first.",
      "Morgan played in 150 NWSL matches over her career, which included stints with the Portland Thorns and the Orlando Pride.",
      "In addition to World Cup titles in 2015 and 2019, Morgan also won an Olympic gold medal in 2012 for the United States. She played in 224 matches for the U.S., with 123 goals (fifth on the career list) and 53 assists. She was named the U.S. Soccer Player of the Year in 2012 and 2018.",
      "Off the field, Morgan advanced women\u2019s soccer through her fight for equal pay. The U.S. women filed a lawsuit in 2019 that led to a historic agreement in 2022 that provided the women with pay equitable to what U.S. men's players received.",
      "She also paved the way for reforms in the NWSL, calling for the adoption of an anti-harassment policy after a coach misconduct scandal rocked the league in 2021.",
      "\u201cAlex has always fought to positively impact this game beyond the pitch,\u201d said Lauren Leichtman, controlling owner of the Wave. \u201cShe used her platform to lead, to advocate, and to build something meaningful in San Diego. Her decision to invest is not only a continuation of her leadership but also a reflection of her belief in what we are building.\u201d",

      "Now that Rory McIlroy completed the career Grand Slam with his Masters victory, the question becomes who might be next",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Tiger Woods became the youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam at age 24 when he crossed the Swilcan Bridge at St. Andrews and marched right into history. No one bothered asking who was next because no one was particularly close.",
      "It's different now.",
      "That was some grand occasion for Rory McIlroy when he won the Masters. There was sheer joy from 17 years of trying to win the green jacket, the last 11 years fully aware that he could join the most exclusive group in golf. \u201cWelcome to the club, kid,\u201d is the text Woods sent him.",
      "That raised the question: Who's next?",
      "The attention immediately falls to Jordan Spieth, who has been trying to complete the Grand Slam at the PGA Championship since 2017, the last time it was at Quail Hollow. He has never finished closer than six shots in those previous eight attempts.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a number of years I\u2019ve come to the PGA, and no one\u2019s really asked me about it,\u201d Spieth said Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s been some years where it was a storyline, I guess. It's funny, I think if didn\u2019t, then it wouldn\u2019t have been a storyline for me here necessarily.\u201d",
      "Perhaps he's been lost behind McIlroy and Phil Mickelson, who has been trying to get the career slam since the 2014 U.S. Open. This year's might be Lefty's last chance. His five-year exemption to the U.S. Open from winning the 2021 PGA Championship at age 50 runs out.",
      "\"I would put money on Jordan being the next guy,\u201d Xander Schauffele said.",
      "But this is no easy money, even when it's only one more major to win.",
      "That surely was the feeling some 60 years ago when golf celebrated a career Grand Slam in consecutive years \u2014 Gary Player at the 1965 U.S. Open, Jack Nicklaus at the 1966 U.S. Open. Next in line was Arnold Palmer. All he needed was the PGA Championship.",
      "\u201cCertainly the incentive is there,\" Palmer said when he arrived at Firestone for the 1966 PGA Championship. \u201cI feel so good there can't be any excuses.\u201d",
      "But there was no Grand Slam, not that year or the next 28 years that followed until Palmer played his last PGA Championship in 1994 at age 64. Lee Trevino, Tom Watson and Raymond Floyd all reached the cusp of golf's greatest feat and never crossed the line.",
      "After Nicklaus, it took 34 years before Woods got his Grand Slam, and then 25 years until McIlroy did it.",
      "\u201cDo I think it will take another 25 years? It\u2019s a good question,\u201d Scottie Scheffler said. \u201cJordan can win the Grand Slam by winning four majors. Rory did it in five. ... The odds would say he\u2019s good enough to do it, for sure.\"",
      "Scheffler has been the dominant player for the last three years, winning the Masters in 2022 and 2024 and spending more consecutive weeks at No. 1 than anyone except Woods.",
      "\u201cI've only one won, technically. That's the other side of the coin,\u201d Scheffler said of his chances at the Grand Slam. \u201cI've been playing some pretty good golf and I'm not even close.\u201d",
      "The PGA Championship, which starts Thursday, and the next two majors at Oakmont (U.S. Open) and Royal Portrush (British Open) could go a long way in shaping the conversation for the next several years.",
      "Jon Rahm winning the PGA Championship or British Open. Schauffele or Collin Morikawa winning at the U.S. Open. Dustin Johnson at the PGA Championship or British Open. Brooks Koepka at the British.",
      "That\u2019s all it would take to add to the list of players on the verge of a feat realized by only Woods and McIlroy over the last 59 years.",
      "But as hard as it is to win two majors, getting the third leg is no small task. That much is evident by the number of players who have two legs of the slam and got no closer.",
      "Nick Price won the PGA Championship in 1992 and the British Open in 1994.",
      "\u201cFrom the time I won the first PGA, I wanted to win that Grand Slam so badly,\u201d Price said. \u201cIt's every golfer's dream. I always struggled at Augusta as a low ball-striker. And then the U.S. Open, I had two or three good chances. It was definitely one of those things on my mind.\u201d",
      "Before him was Sandy Lyle and Nick Faldo, Fuzzy Zoeller and Larry Nelson, Hubert Green and the late Seve Ballesteros. The Spaniard had two legs of the Grand Slam at age 23.",
      "Faldo won six majors \u2014 three apiece at the British Open and Masters \u2014 giving him the most majors of any players in the last century who got only two legs of the Grand Slam.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to get on the cusp, but it\u2019s a lot easier to get on the cusp than to actually pull it off,\u201d Scheffler said. He paused before adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s really hard to get on the cusp.\u201d",
      "And it doesn't get any easier as time goes on. The modern version of the Grand Slam didn't start until Palmer mentioned it in 1960. Gene Sarazen (1935) and Ben Hogan (1953) won the career slam retrospectively. It still counts.",
      "Player (29), Nicklaus (26) and Woods were all in their 20s when they captured the last leg. McIlroy was 35 when he finally got the Masters, perhaps another reason he was so emotional that day at Augusta National, and still looks to be floating on air.",
      "Johnson turned 40 last year and his game in the majors has dropped substantially since joining LIV Golf. Koepka turned 35 last month and has gone seven straight majors without a top 10 since winning the 2023 PGA Championship, the longest such streak of his career.",
      "Spieth is 31, winless in three years but still in his prime. If he isn't next, perhaps the focus shifts to who joins the line.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Carlos Alcaraz was made to work for a 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 victory over Karen Khachanov that earned him a spot in the Italian Open quarterfinals on Tuesday.",
      "Alcaraz saved two break points early in the third set then dropped his serve later on to waste an early break before improving to 5-0 in his career against the 24th-ranked Khachanov.",
      "\u201cPhysically I was struggling a little bit,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cNot any pain in any part of the body. I was just tired. I had to run a lot. I was really proud the way I fought (for) every ball.\u201d",
      "The third-ranked Alcaraz wore a long black brace that covered the upper portion of his right leg and stretched down to just below his knee.",
      "Alcaraz withdrew from the Madrid Open last month due to an upper right leg ailment that bothered him during the Barcelona Open final. He also had a left leg injury.",
      "Alcaraz, who won the Monte Carlo Masters in April, improved to 12-1 on clay this season. The four-time Grand Slam champion will next face No. 5 Jack Draper, who rallied past Corentin Moutet 1-6, 6-4, 6-3 on the red clay courts of the Foro Italico.",
      "While Alcaraz holds a 3-2 career edge over Draper, the British player won their most recent meeting in the semifinals at Indian Wells, California, in March.",
      "Alcaraz is playing the Italian Open for the second time. During the Spaniard\u2019s debut last year, he lost to then-135th-ranked Hungarian qualifier Fabian Marozsan in the third round as he dealt with a bothersome right forearm issue.",
      "But Alcaraz then went on to win back-to-back Grand Slam titles at the French Open and Wimbledon.",
      "Later in the other half of the draw, top-ranked Jannik Sinner was to play No. 18 Francisco Cerundolo in the biggest test so far after his return from a three-month doping ban.",
      "Rome is the last big warmup tournament before the French Open starts May 25.",
      "In the women\u2019s quarterfinals later, home favorite Jasmine Paolini was playing Diana Shnaider and two-time Rome champion Elina Svitolina was playing Peyton Stearns.",

      "MADRID -- Carlo Ancelotti wants to remain fully focused on his job with Real Madrid before taking over Brazil's national team in two weeks.",
      "Brazil announced Ancelotti as its new coach on Monday, but the 65-year-old Italian had not commented on the move until he was asked about it at a news conference Tuesday ahead of Real Madrid\u2019s next Spanish league match against Mallorca on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI have great respect for this club and these fans and I'm totally focused on finishing the last part of this spectacular adventure,\u201d Ancelotti said. \u201cBeginning on May 26 I will start coaching Brazil, which will be a great challenge personally, but until then I will continue training Real Madrid and I want to finish the best possible way.\u201d",
      "Former Madrid player Xabi Alonso is widely expected to take over the coaching job after confirming he is leaving Bayer Leverkusen, but the Spanish club has yet to announce Ancelotti's successor.",
      "\u201cI like Alonso a lot,\u201d Ancelotti said when asked about the former midfielder. \u201cI don\u2019t have any advice for him because he already has all the tools needed to become a great coach in the future.\u201d",
      "Ancelotti, wearing Madrid's apparel as usual, looked relaxed as he led the team's practice session at the club's training center. He then spoke to the media for the first time since Brazil's announcement.",
      "Madrid hadn\u2019t released any reaction or statement about its coach since Brazil's announcement, and there were no farewell or congratulatory messages for Ancelotti either.",
      "\u201cThe club will make its announcement when it wants to make its announcement,\u201d Ancelotti said. \u201cI don't see any problem.\u201d",
      "Madrid lost its fourth straight match to Barcelona on Sunday, a 4-3 defeat after holding a two-goal lead, to see its title chances in the league virtually vanish. Madrid dropped seven points behind the Catalan club with three matches remaining. A loss or a draw against Mallorca on Wednesday would hand Barcelona the title. Barcelona visits city rival Espanyol on Thursday.",
      "Madrid\u2019s last two league matches will be at Sevilla on Sunday and against Real Sociedad on May 25.",
      "The 65-year-old Ancelotti is leaving after four mostly successful years in his second stint with Madrid, which won both the Champions League and the Spanish league last season.",
      "Ancelotti also coached the club from 2013-2015. In total, he was in charge of Madrid in 350 matches and helped it win three Champions Leagues, three Club World Cups, two Spanish leagues, two Copa del Reys, three UEFA Super Cups and two Spanish Super Cups.",
      "For the match against Mallorca, the coach will be without several regular starters because of injuries. Rodrygo left the training session before it was over, having missed Sunday\u2019s match in Barcelona because of an illness.",
      "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, fighting for the league\u2019s scoring title in his first season with the Spanish powerhouse, is expected to play. He scored a hat trick on Sunday to reach 27 goals, two more than Barcelona\u2019s Robert Lewandowski.",
      "Madrid began the season by winning the UEFA Super Cup title but has mostly struggled since then. Many Madrid fans blamed Ancelotti for its relatively poor season, saying he lost control over the squad and wasn\u2019t able to get the team ready for the clasicos against Barcelona.",

      "Djokovic and Murray joined forces ahead of the Australian Open in what initially was seen as an unlikely pairing. After Murray retired last year, Djokovic reached out with the coaching proposition.",
      "Djokovic said in February that Murray had agreed to stay on for an \u201cindefinite\u201d period, including \u201csome clay-court tournaments\u201d this season. Djokovic has yet to win a tournament this season, losing in the finals in Miami and Madrid to leave him one shy of 100th career title.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Major social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and X have failed to protect LGBTQ+ users from hate and harassment, in part, because they intentionally rolled back previous safety practices, the advocacy group GLAAD said Tuesday in its annual Social Media Safety Index.",
      "The report said that recent \u201cunprecedented hate speech policy rollbacks\u201d from Instagram and Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google's YouTube are \u201cactively undermining the safety of LGBTQ people\u201d both online and offline. Meta\u2019s rollback now allows users to call LGBTQ people \u201cmentally ill,\u201d among other policy changes.",
      "The scorecard assigns numeric ratings to each platform with regard to LGBTQ safety, privacy, and expression. Elon Musk's X received the lowest score at 30 out of 100, while TikTok came in highest at 56. Meta's Facebook, Instagram, Threads and Google's YouTube were in the 40s. The group's methodology has changed since last year, so the scores are not directly comparable to previous reports.",
      "\u201cAt a time when real-world violence and harassment against LGBTQ people is on the rise, social media companies are profiting from the flames of anti-LGBTQ hate instead of ensuring the basic safety of LGBTQ users,\" said Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD's president and CEO.",
      "While X has received the lowest scores since Musk's takeover of the platform in 2022 \u2014 when it was called Twitter \u2014 Meta's backslide can largely be attributed to its recent policy shift. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January that Meta is removing restrictions on topics like immigration and gender \u201cthat are out of touch with mainstream discourse,\u201d citing \u201crecent elections\u201d as a catalyst. GLAAD calls the rollback \u201dparticularly extreme.\"",
      "Representatives for Meta, TikTok and X did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Monday afternoon.",
      "GLAAD said Google recently removed \u201cgender identity and expression\u201d from YouTube's list of protected characteristic groups, which suggests that the platform is \"no longer protecting transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming people from hate and discrimination.\"",
      "Google says this is not the case.",
      "\u201cWe confirmed earlier this year our hate speech policy hasn\u2019t changed. We have strict policies against content that promotes hatred or violence against members of the LGBTQ+ community and we continue to be vigilant in our efforts to quickly detect and remove this content,\u201d Google said in a statement.",
      "Although GLAAD acknowledges Google's statement, the organization stresses that gender identity has not been restored as a protected characteristic on YouTube's hate speech policy page.",
      "\u201cYouTube should reverse this dangerous policy change and update its \u2018Hate Speech\u2019 policy to expressly include gender identity and expression as a protected characteristic,\u201d the report says.",
      "GLAAD's report makes policy recommendations for protecting LGBTQ users, though it's unclear if the platforms will take these up, given that many have rolled back such protections. For instance, GLAAD says platforms should protect LGBTQ people from hate, harassment and violence, prohibit targeted misgendering and \u201cdeadnaming\u201d of transgender users and explain steps it takes to stop wrongfully removing or demonetizing legitimate accounts and content related to LGBTQ topics.",

      "The office said in a statement Sunday that Perlmutter received an email from the White House a day earlier with the notification that \u201cyour position as the Register of Copyrights and Director at the U.S. Copyright Office is terminated effective immediately.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, President Donald Trump fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, the first woman and the first African American to be librarian of Congress, as part of the administration's ongoing purge of government officials perceived to oppose the president and his agenda.",
      "Hayden named Perlmutter to lead the Copyright Office in October 2020.",
      "Perlmutter\u2019s office recently released a report examining whether artificial intelligence companies can use copyrighted materials to \u201ctrain\u201d their AI systems and then compete in the same market as the human-made works they were trained on.",
      "The report, the third part of a lengthy AI study, follows a review that Perlmutter began in 2023 with opinions from thousands of people including AI developers, actors and country singers.",
      "In January, the office clarified its approach as one based on the \u201ccentrality of human creativity\u201d in authoring a work that warrants copyright protections. The office receives about half a million copyright applications per year covering millions of creative works.",
      "\u201cWhere that creativity is expressed through the use of AI systems, it continues to enjoy protection,\u201d Perlmutter said in January. \u201cExtending protection to material whose expressive elements are determined by a machine ... would undermine rather than further the constitutional goals of copyright.\u201d",
      "The White House didn\u2019t return a message seeking comment Sunday.",
      "Democrats were quick to blast Perlmutter's firing.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s termination of Register of Copyrights, Shira Perlmutter, is a brazen, unprecedented power grab with no legal basis,\u201d said Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee.",
      "Perlmutter, who holds a law degree, was previously a policy director at the Patent and Trademark Office and worked on copyright and other areas of intellectual property. She also previously worked at the Copyright Office in the late 1990s. She did not return messages left Sunday.",

      "Players swiping their way through more than 18,700 levels of Candy Crush Saga might be surprised to learn they\u2019re solving puzzles enhanced by unsuspected ally: artificial intelligence",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Players swiping their way through more than 18,700 levels of Candy Crush Saga might be surprised to learn they\u2019re solving puzzles designed with an assist from artificial intelligence.",
      "The app that helped make gamers out of anyone with a smartphone uses AI to help developers create levels to serve a captive audience constantly looking for more sweets to squash. King, the Swedish video game developer behind Candy Crush, also uses AI to update older levels to help ensure players don't feel bored, stuck or frustrated as they spend time with the game.",
      "Todd Green, general manager of the Candy Crush franchise, said using AI in that way helps free up developers' time to create new puzzle boards. It would be \"extremely difficult,\" he said, for designers to update and reconfigure more than 18,000 levels without AI taking a first pass.",
      "Within the video game industry, discussions around the use of AI in game development run the gamut. Some game makers see AI as a tool that can assist with menial tasks, allowing designers and artists to focus on bigger projects. AI, they say, can help build richer worlds by creating more interactive non-player characters, for example. But there are also those who strongly oppose the use of AI, or who see the tech as a threat to their livelihoods \u2014 be it as video game actors and performers, or as workers who help make games. Concerns over AI led game performers with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists to go on strike in late July.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not putting chatbots into the game. We\u2019re not putting AI-powered design experiences into the game for players directly to play with,\u201d Green said, adding that the tech is not being used to replace game workers. \u201cInstead, we\u2019re trying to deploy AI on existing problems that we have in order to make the work of the teams faster or more accurate, and more accurate more quickly.\u201d",
      "In the United States, consumer spending on video game content increased to $51.3 billion in 2024, up from $49.8 billion in 2023, with mobile games accounting for about half of all video game content spending, according to data from the Entertainment Software Association trade group. Mobile is now the leading game platform among players aged 8 and older, the ESA says.",
      "Candy Crush \u2014 first launched on Facebook in 2012 \u2014 is constantly updating. King recently released its 300th client version of the game. Gaming giant Activision Blizzard acquired King in 2016 for $5.9 billion.",
      "The free-to-play game is in a unique position, said Joost Van Dreunen, author of \u201cOne Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.\u201d Candy Crush is more than a decade old, boasts millions of users and caters to a \u201cravenous set of players,\" he said. Demand is so high for new content that it makes sense to use AI to offset the work it takes to create so many levels, Van Dreunen added.",
      "\u201cTo supply that at scale, you absolutely can rely on a sort of artificial intelligence or generative AI to create the next set of forms,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing about Candy Crush is that every level is technically a single board that you have to solve or clear before you can advance. With AI and the existing library of human-made boards, it makes total sense to then accelerate and expand the efforts to just create more inventory. People play more levels.\u201d",
      "King uses AI to target two separate areas: developing new levels and going back to older levels, in some cases, puzzles that are several years old, and reworking them to ensure they're still worth playing. On new levels designed for people who have played the game for a long time, the company wants to ensure the puzzles are fun \u201con first contact.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s hard for us to do, because we don\u2019t get the benefit of having many players test or play through the levels and give us feedback. We have to sort of try and pitch it right at first,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a really important group for us in between people who maybe played before and perhaps took a break for a while, and then coming back because they saw or heard of or were curious about what might be new.\u201d",
      "Green said King uses AI as a behind-the-scenes assistant in the design \u201cloop\u201d of the game, rather than as a tool that immediately puts something new in front of players.",
      "\u201cDoing that for 1,000 levels all at once is very difficult by hand,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the most important thing to understand here is that we are using AI as like a custom design.\u201d",
      "For most players, Green said, the fun in solving the puzzles lies in the \u201cup and down.\u201d Levels aren't designed in order of difficulty. An easy level can follow a few difficult levels \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 to give the game a sense of variety. Leveraging AI means that instead of the team working on several hundred levels each week, they could potentially improve thousands of levels per week because they're able to automate the drafting of the improved levels, he added.",
      "\u201cWe talk to players all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also get the quantitative feedback. We can see how players respond to the levels... How easy are the levels? Do they get sort of stuck, or are they progressing in the way that we hope?\u201d",
      "To determine whether gamers and playing through the way the designers intended, King looks at several factors, including pass rate \u2014 how many times a player passes a level out of every 100 attempts \u2014 and how often a board is \u201creshuffled,\u201d or refreshed with all candies rearranged. Some metrics are also intangible, like whether a level is simply fun.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also, to some extent, obviously subjective,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s different for different people.\u201d",

      "Many autism experts say the Trump administration's plan to find autism's causes is unrealistic",
      "WASHINGTON -- For many experts, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2019s promise for \u201cpulling back the curtain\u201d to find autism's causes in a few months is jarring \u2014 and unrealistic.",
      "That\u2019s because it appears to ignore decades of science linking about 200 genes that play a role \u2014 and the quest to understand differences inside the brain that can be present at birth.",
      "\u201cVirtually all the evidence in the field suggests whatever the causes of autism \u2014 and there\u2019s going to be multiple causes, it\u2019s not going to be a single cause \u2014 they all affect how the fetal brain develops,\u201d said longtime autism researcher David Amaral of the UC Davis MIND Institute.",
      "\u201cEven though we may not see the behaviors associated with autism until a child is 2 or 3 years old, the biological changes have already taken place,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy on Wednesday announced the National Institutes of Health would create a new database \u201cto uncover the root causes of autism and other chronic diseases\u201d by merging Medicaid and Medicare insurance claims with electronic medical records and other data. He has cited rising autism rates as evidence of an epidemic of a \u201cpreventable disease\u201d caused by some sort of environmental exposure and has promised \u201csome of the answers by September.\u201d",
      "Autism isn\u2019t considered a disease. It's a complex brain disorder better known as autism spectrum disorder, to reflect that it affects different people in different ways.",
      "Symptoms vary widely. For some people, profound autism means being nonverbal and having significant intellectual disabilities. Others have far milder effects, such as difficulty with social and emotional skills.",
      "Autism rates are rising \u2014 not among profound cases but milder ones, said autism expert Helen Tager-Flusberg of Boston University.",
      "That's because doctors gradually learned that milder symptoms were part of autism\u2019s spectrum, leading to changes in the late 1990s and early 2000s in diagnosis guidelines and qualifications for educational services, she said.",
      "The link between genes and autism dates back to studies of twins decades ago. Some are rare genetic variants passed from parent to child, even if the parent shows no signs of autism.",
      "But that's not the only kind. As the brain develops, rapidly dividing cells make mistakes that can lead to mutations in only one type of cell or one part of the brain, Amaral explained.",
      "Noninvasive testing can spot differences in brain activity patterns in babies who won't be diagnosed with autism until far later, when symptoms become apparent, he said.",
      "Those kinds of changes stem from alterations in brain structure or its neural circuitry \u2014 and understanding them requires studying brain tissue that\u2019s available only after death, said Amaral, who\u2019s the scientific director of a brain banking collaborative called Autism BrainNet. The bank, funded by the nonprofit Simons Foundation, has collected more than 400 donated brains, about half from people with autism and the rest for comparison.",
      "Researchers have identified other factors that can interact with genetic vulnerability to increase the risk of autism. They include the age of a child\u2019s father, whether the mother had certain health problems during pregnancy including diabetes, use of certain medications during pregnancy, and preterm birth.",
      "Any concern that measles vaccinations could be linked to autism has been long debunked, stressed Tager-Flusberg, who leads a new Coalition of Autism Scientists pushing back on administration misstatements about the condition.",
      "The U.S., with its fragmented health care system, will never have the kind of detailed medical tracking available in countries like Denmark and Norway \u2014 places with national health systems where research shows similar rises in autism diagnoses and no environmental smoking gun.",
      "Experts say Kennedy's planned database isn't appropriate to uncover autism's causes in part because there's no information about genetics.",
      "But researchers have long used insurance claims and similar data to study other important questions, such as access to autism services. And the NIH described the upcoming database as useful for studies focusing on access to care, treatment effectiveness and other trends.",

      "\u201cIn Texas, Big Tech is not above the law.\" Paxton said in a statement. \u201cFor years, Google secretly tracked people\u2019s movements, private searches, and even their voiceprints and facial geometry through their products and services. I fought back and won.\u201d",
      "The agreement settles several claims Texas made against the search giant in 2022 related to geolocation, incognito searches and biometric data. The state argued Google was \u201cunlawfully tracking and collecting users\u2019 private data.\u201d",
      "Paxton claimed, for example, that Google collected millions of biometric identifiers, including voiceprints and records of face geometry, through such products and services as Google Photos and Google Assistant.",

      "The judge said he loved and appreciated the video, then sentenced the shooter to 10.5 years in prison \u2014 the maximum sentence and more than what prosecutors sought. Within hours of the hearing on May 1, the defendant's lawyer filed a notice of appeal.",
      "Defense attorney Jason Lamm won't be handling the appeal, but said a higher court will likely be asked to weigh in on whether the judge improperly relied on the AI-generated video when sentencing his client.",

Does this video exaggerate the suspect's height, weight, or skin color?",
      "\u201cIt's definitely a disturbing trend,\" she said, \u201cbecause it could veer even more into fake evidence that maybe people don't figure out is false.\u201d",

      "Previous research has shown that chimps have their own signature drumming style. A new analysis of 371 bouts of chimpanzee drumming demonstrates that the chimps \u201cclearly play their instruments -- the tree trunks -- with regular rhythms,\u201d said University of Amsterdam music cognition researcher Henkjan Honing, who was not involved in the study.",
      "When bounding through the jungle, chimps will often grab hold of the tall buttress roots of rainforest trees. Sometimes they pound them several times to create low-frequency sounds that can be heard for a kilometer or more through the forest.",
      "Scientists believe that the drumming is a form of long-distance communication, perhaps to alert other chimps where one chimp is waiting or the direction it is traveling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a way of socially checking in,\u201d said Hobaiter, adding that each chimp has its own \u201cindividual signature \u2014 a pattern of beats that allows you to recognize who\u2019s producing that drumming.\u201d",
      "The new work showed that chimps from different regions of Africa drum with distinctly different rhythms, with western chimps preferring a more even beat while eastern chimps used varied short and long intervals between beats.

While space debris trackers around the world converged in their forecasts, it was still too soon to know exactly when and where the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 would come down.

      "TOKYO -- Panasonic will slash its global workforce by 10,000 people, half in Japan and half overseas, to become a more efficient, \u201clean\u201d company, the Japanese manufacturer said Friday.",
      "The job cuts, amounting to about 4% of its 230,000 workers, will include early retirement offers in Japan and closures and consolidation of various operations, according to the Osaka-based maker of home appliances, such as washing machines and refrigerators.",
      "Panasonic also makes solar panels, delivery robots, facial recognition technology, fuel cells for homes and EV batteries for Tesla cars.",
      "Also Friday, Panasonic reported a 17.5% drop in profit for the fiscal year through March at 366 billion yen ($2.5 billion), down from 443 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. It sales totaled 8.46 trillion yen ($58 billion), down 0.5% year-on-year.",
      "The company said the slowing global economy and weaker demand for electric vehicles were a factor behind its weak results. But sales of air-conditioners and consumer electronics products held up in Japan, it said.",
      "The company's chief executive, Yuki Kusumi, told reporters his heart felt heavy in announcing the job cuts. Panasonic did not mention U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies as a factor behind its drop in profit.",
      "Panasonic forecast that its profit will improve by at least 150 billion yen ($1 billion) by the fiscal year through March 2027, and by 300 billion yen ($2.1 billion) by the fiscal year through March 2029.",
      "That will be achieved through management reform, closure of unprofitable businesses and building a system that\u2019s more responsive to changes in the business environment, officials told reporters.",
      "But the turnaround will take time and profit will slip further in this fiscal year. For the fiscal year through March 2026, Panasonic is projecting a 310 billion yen ($2.1 billion) profit on 7.8 trillion yen ($54 billion) sales.",
      "Panasonic said it remains bullish about EV batteries and plans to supply Japanese automakers Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp. in new strategic partnerships.",

      "WASHINGTON -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and executives from Microsoft and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices testified on Capitol Hill about the biggest opportunities, risks and needs facing an industry which lawmakers and technologists agree could fundamentally transform global business, culture and geopolitics.",
      "The hearing comes as the race to control the future of artificial intelligence is heating up between companies and countries. Altman's OpenAI is in a furious race to develop the best artificial intelligence model against tech rivals like Alphabet and Meta, as well as against those developed by Chinese competitors.",
      "\u201cI believe this will be at least as big as the internet, maybe bigger,\u201d Altman said in his opening remarks about AI\u2019s potential to transform society. \u201cFor that to happen, investment in infrastructure is critical.\u201d Altman urged senators to help usher in the \u201cdual revolutions\u201d of artificial intelligence and energy production that \u201cwill change the world we live in, I think, in incredibly positive ways.\u201d",
      "The witnesses included Altman; Lisa Su, chief executive of semiconductor maker AMD; Michael Intrator, co-founder of AI cloud computing startup CoreWeave; and Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft. They four executives unanimously urged lawmakers to help streamline policy for AI-related projects and fundraising.",
      "The hearing spanned topics ranging from industry debates over chip performance, jobs, human relationships and power generation to grander questions about the global competition with China and the European Union.",
      "\u201cChina aims to lead the world in AI by 2030,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. \u201cIn this race, the United States is facing a fork in the road. Do we go down the path that embraces our history of entrepreneurial freedom and technological innovation? Or do we adopt the command and control policies of Europe?\u201d",
      "Senators were broadly sober in their questioning and united in their concern that the U.S. maintain its dominance in artificial intelligence. Lawmakers from both parties also raised concerns over cybersecurity, data privacy and AI's ability to create content that could confuse or mislead people.",
      "Some partisan fighting did arise. Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican, pressed Su and Smith on whether the Biden administration\u2019s sustainable energy policies hindered the goal of producing more power for AI-related infrastructure.",
      "And Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, criticized cuts by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk to federal funding for research and to agencies like the Energy Department\u2019s national laboratories and National Science Foundation, painting them as \u201ca self sabotaging attack.\u201d",
      "\u201cDoes anyone truly have confidence that had DOGE been around decades ago, they would not have cut the project that created the internet as an example of wasteful, publicly funded research and development?\u201d asked Duckworth.",
      "But despite some barbs, the hearing maintained a low-key tenor and some bipartisan joking as lawmakers and executives discussed the potential of a technology all present agreed would determine humanity's future.",
      "\u201cLook, there is a race, but we need to understand what we\u2019re racing for,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, told the witnesses. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a sort of commercial race, so we can edge out our nearest competitor in the public sector or the private sector. We\u2019re trying to win a race so that American values prevail.\u201d",
      "Several of the executives warned against U.S. export controls that could end up pushing other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology.",
      "\u201cWe totally understand as an industry the importance of national security,\u201d Su said. But she added, if not able to \u201chave our technology adopted in the rest of the world, there will be other technologies that will come to play.\u201d Those technologies are less advanced today but will mature over time, she said.",
      "Altman drew a direct connection between the United State's ability to attract global talent and ability to sell its products globally to national security and its international influence.",
      "\u201cThe leverage and the power the U.S. gets from having iPhones be the mobile device people most want, and Google being the search engine that people most want around the world is huge,\u201d Altman said. \u201cWe talk maybe less about how much people want to use chips and other infrastructure developed here, but I think it\u2019s no less important, and we should aim to have the entire U.S. stack be adopted by as much of the world as possible.\u201d",
      "Trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the AI industry, including California-based chipmakers Nvidia and AMD.",
      "The Trump administration announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips and AMD\u2019s MI308 chips to China.",
      "Nvidia has said the tighter export controls will cost the company an extra $5.5 billion. AMD said after reporting its quarterly earnings this week that it will cost the firm $1.5 billion in lost revenue over the coming months.",
      "Still uncertain are the effects on additional AI chip controls set by former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that are set to take effect next week targeting more than 100 countries. The policy drew strong opposition from Nvidia and other tech companies, while it was supported by others, including AI company Anthropic, as a way to prevent China\u2019s \u201csophisticated smuggling operations\u201d to obtain chips from shell companies in third countries.",
      "The Commerce Department said in an email Thursday that Trump plans to replace Biden\u2019s \u201coverly complex, overly bureaucratic\u201d rule with a simpler one but didn\u2019t say when.",
      "The day before the hearing, Altman visited the Abilene, Texas, site of the massive Stargate data center project being built for OpenAI in collaboration with Oracle and other partners. The site was chosen for its potential access to a variety of energy resources, including wind and solar power.",
      "Altman, during the hearing, said that Texas had been \u201cunbelievable\" in incentivizing major AI projects. \u201cI think that would be a good thing for other states to study,\u201d Altman said. He predicted that the Abilene site would be the \u201clargest AI training facility in the world.\u201d",
      "But Altman also later cautioned against a patchwork regulatory framework for AI.",
      "\u201cIt is very difficult to imagine us figuring out how to comply with 50 different sets of regulations,\u201d said Altman. \u201cOne federal framework that is light touch, that we can understand, and it lets us move with the speed that this moment calls for, seems important and fine.\u201d",
      "While the tech industry has long relied on data centers to run online services, from email and social media to financial transactions, new AI technology behind popular chatbots and generative AI tools requires even more powerful computation to build and operate.",
      "A report released by the Department of Energy late last year estimated that the electricity needed for data centers in the U.S. tripled over the past decade and is projected to double or triple again by 2028 when it could consume up to 12% of the nation\u2019s electricity.",

      "New experiments show eggs are less likely to crack when they fall on their side",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Eggs are less likely to crack when they fall on their side, according to experiments with over 200 eggs.",
      "What does this mean for the best way to crack an egg for breakfast? Not much, since a break around the middle is the best way to get the golden yolk and runny whites to ooze out.",
      "But scientists said it could help with hard-boiling eggs in a pot: Dropping eggs in horizontally may be less likely to cause a stray crack that can unleash the egg's insides in a puffy, cloudy mess.",
      "It's commonly thought that eggs are strongest at their ends \u2014 after all, it's how they're packaged in the carton. The thinking is that the arc-shaped bottom of an egg redirects the force and softens the blow of impact.",
      "But when scientists squeezed eggs in both directions during a compression test, they cracked under the same amount of force.",
      "\u201cThe fun started when we thought we would get one result and then we saw another,\u201d said Hudson Borja da Rocha with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who helped run the experiments.",
      "The researchers also ran simulations and dropped eggs horizontally and vertically from three short heights up to 0.4 inches (10 millimeters).",
      "The egg result? The ones dropped horizontally cracked less .",
      "\u201cThe common sense is that the egg in the vertical direction is stronger than if you lay the egg down. But they proved that's not the case,\u201d said materials scientist Marc Meyers with the University of California, San Diego who was not involved with the new study.",
      "Scientists found that the egg's equator was more flexible and absorbed more of the energy of the fall before cracking. The findings were published Thursday in the journal Communications Physics.",
      "Eggs are also usually nestled top-down into homemade contraptions for egg drop challenges as part of school STEM projects, which partially inspired the new study. It's not yet clear whether the new results will help protect these vulnerable eggs, which are dropped at much loftier heights.",
      "It's a bit counterintuitive that the oblong side of an egg could hold up better against a tumble, said study co-author Tal Cohen with Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "Countless broken eggs show \"the courage to go and challenge these very common, accepted notions,\u201d Cohen said.",

    "story": [
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez addressed the judge directly in court on Tuesday.",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez were resentenced on Tuesday to 50 years to life in prison, which makes them eligible for parole -- the latest step in a years-long battle for the brothers trying to get released after 35 years behind bars.",
      "The parole process will be long and could take years.",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez were initially sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the 1989 murders of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez. They have the support of over 20 family members in their efforts to be freed.",
      "After the resentencing, Erik Menendez released a statement on Tuesday night, saying, \"I am touched and humbled by the outpouring of support.\"",
      "\"This has to be the first step in giving people who have no hope in prison some hope,\" he said. \"My goal is to ensure there are no more people spending 35 years in prison without hope. That possibility of having hope that rehabilitation works is more important than anything that happened to me today.\"",
      "The brothers watched Tuesday's much-anticipated resentencing hearing via video from prison and gave their own statements to Judge Michael Jesic.",
      "\"I killed my mom and dad,\" Lyle Menendez told the judge. \"I give no excuses.\"",
      "He also admitted to committing perjury by lying in court in the 90s. He apologized to his family for years of lies and the shock and grief of the crimes.",
      "\"I committed an atrocious act,\" Erik Menendez told the judge. \"My actions were criminal, selfish and cowardly. ... No excuse. No justification for what I did.\"",
      "He admitted to lying for years and apologized.",
      "\"I have come a long way on this path\" of redemption, Erik Menendez said, adding, \"I will not stop trying to make a difference.\"",
      "\"This was absolutely a horrific crime,\" the judge said. He noted that he was moved by letters from prison guards and is amazed by what the brothers have accomplished.",
      "The brothers' attorney Mark Geragos said after court, \"I'm hopeful and glad that we're one huge step closer to bringing the boys home.\"",
      "\"This encourages people who are incarcerated to make the right decisions, to take the right path,\" Geragos said, adding, \"It's just a win-win on so many levels.\"",
      "Menendez cousin Anamaria Baralt commended her cousins' rehabilitation, telling reporters, \"Ultimately, we are here today with this result because of Erik and Lyle. Because they chose to live their lives with clarity and a purpose of service that the judge was impressed by.\"",
      "Geragos called several Menendez relatives to the stand at Tuesday's hearing, including Baralt.",
      "Through tears, Baralt pleaded with Jesic to release her cousins, noting time is running out for them to be reunited with aging family members.",
      "\"They are very different men\" than when they committed the murders, Baralt said, adding that \"their transformation is remarkable.\"",
      "During cross-examination, Baralt told prosecutors that the brothers have taken full responsibility for the crimes and Lyle Menendez has admitted to asking a witness to lie at trial. But Baralt conceded they haven't acknowledged some aspects of the case to her, as prosecutors argue the brothers haven't admitted to the full extent of their crimes and cover-ups.",
      "A retired judge who worked with therapy dogs said on the stand that the brothers are looked at as leaders and that they changed his views on inmate rehabilitation. He said he used to want to punish defendants, but because of the brothers and their work to help the elderly and other inmates, he now believes in rehabilitation.",
      "The prosecution did not call any witnesses.",

      "Jesic's resentencing decision follows the recommendation made in October by then-Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n recommended the brothers' sentences of life without parole be removed, and said they should instead be sentenced for murder, which is a sentence of 50 years to life. Because both brothers were under 26 at the time of the crimes, they're eligible for parole immediately under California law.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n's office said its resentencing recommendations take into account many factors, including rehabilitation in prison and abuse or trauma that contributed to the crime. Gasc\u00f3n praised the brothers' conduct in prison, saying they rehabilitated themselves and started programs to help other inmates.",
      "In November, Gasc\u00f3n lost his reelection bid to Nathan Hochman, who in March filed a motion to withdraw the resentencing petition, calling the brothers' claims of self-defense part of a litany of \"lies.\" The judge denied Hochman's request.",
      "Tuesday's resentencing hearing was a face-off between Geragos and Hochman, who wants to keep the brothers behind bars.",
      "Geragos told reporters outside court on Tuesday, \"There are no two better candidates in the state of California right now for resentencing than Erik and Lyle Menendez.\"",
      "\"It's a unicorn-style situation where you have horrific crimes -- that nobody is walking away from -- but also remarkable, remarkable, almost unparalleled rehabilitation and redemption,\" he said.",
      "At the time, Hochman told reporters, \"The Menendez brothers have failed to come clean with the full extent of their criminal conduct, their cover-up, their lies and their deceit.\"",
      "Following the sentencing Tuesday, he released a new statement saying, \"The decision to resentence Erik and Lyle Menendez was a monumental one that has significant implications for the families involved, the community, and the principles of justice.\"",
      "\"Our office\u2019s motions to withdraw the resentencing motion filed by the previous administration ensured that the Court was presented with all the facts before making such a consequential decision,\" the statement continued, with Hochman calling the case \"a window for the public to better understand the judicial system.\"",
      "\"This case, like all cases \u2014 especially those that captivate the public \u2014 must be viewed with a critical eye,\" he continued. \"Our opposition and analysis ensured that the Court received a complete and accurate record of the facts.\"",
      "A hearing was held May 9 to determine whether the resentencing case should include information from the California Board of Parole's newly completed risk assessment, which was conducted as a part of a separate clemency path. The risk assessment came at the request of Gov. Gavin Newsom as a part of the brothers' clemency bid; the brothers are pursuing multiple avenues to freedom, and the clemency path is separate from the resentencing path. Newsom can grant clemency at any time.",
      "The risk assessment said Erik and Lyle Menendez pose a moderate risk to the community if they're released.",
      "The assessment revealed the brothers possessed illegal cellphones in prison, among numerous other violations, though many are not recent. However, Erik Menendez had a phone as recently as January of this year, which Hochman stressed was during the resentencing effort when he should have been on his best behavior.",
      "The defense noted Erik Menendez had one write-up for violence 25 years ago and Lyle Menendez has had none.",
      "Their next court appearance for the clemency case is June 13.",

He later faced two additional superseding indictments. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.",

      "Ventura was soft-spoken on the witness stand as she recounted her alleged sexual experiences with Combs: the men allegedly involved, the \u201cdisgusting\u201d acts in which she said she took part, the drugs that she said were part of all of it.",

      "The candles were used for lighting along with studio-type lights that gave the room a reddish hue, she testified. The jury saw a photo of Combs on a bed with a wad of cash in a room that was glowing with red light.",
      "Ventura said she remembered the smell in the room being \u201csuper pungent\u201d from candles, body odor and urine.",
      "Ventura said Combs liked participants\u2019 bodies \u201cto be glistening\u201d with baby oil. They would go through ten large-sized bottles at a time, she testified.",
      "Ventura told the jury that the freak offs fulfilled Combs\u2019s alleged desire for voyeurism. She described in graphic detail what she said were \u201cdisgusting\u201d acts.",

    "story": [
      "The announcement came just hours before a judge ordered the workers reinstated.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday reversed the firings of more than 100 federal employees with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the federal institute that helps protect coal miners from black lung, according to Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito.",
      "Roughly 200 employees of the NIOSH office in Morgantown, West Virginia, were put on administrative leave in April and informed they would be formally fired in June. Some were temporarily brought back roughly two weeks ago, but until Tuesday they were told they would still be terminated next month.",
      "In a letter sent Tuesday, a copy of which was obtained by ABC News, HHS said, \"You previously received a notice regarding the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) upcoming reduction in force (RIF). That notice is hereby revoked. You will not be affected by the upcoming RIF.\"",
      "The move comes after public pressure from Capito, and follows a series of ABC News reports detailing the impact the firings would have on black lung health care programs for coal miners.",
      "Capito, announcing the reversals on X, said, \"The heath and safety of our WV workers, including our miners, is of the utmost important and I will always advocate for their wellbeing.\"",
      "Critics said the initial firings, part of President Donald Trump's efforts to slash the size of the federal government, belied his vow to reinvigorate America's coal industry.",
      "NIOSH has offices in several other states covering a range of issues from vehicle safety to firefighter health care. It's unclear if any employees in those offices were also rehired.",
      "ABC News reached out to HHS for comment.",
      "The announcement came just hours before a federal judge ordered HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to temporarily halt its dismissal of NIOSH officials who oversee the black lung surveillance program.",
      "\"Losing the services of these experienced and dedicated employees is an aspect of the irreparable harm to the miners and the public that cannot and should not be ignored,\" U.S. District Judge Irene Berger wrote in her order Tuesday.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether the ruling had anything to do with the Trump administration's decision to reinstate the workers earlier Tuesday.",
      "Judge Berger's ruling came after a veteran coal miner named Henry Wiley, in April, challenged the Trump administration's removal of the NIOSH employees, arguing that terminations endangered him and other miners.",
      "The judge wrote Tuesday that Wiley and a handful of NIOSH officials who testified in a hearing last week persuaded her of the importance of NIOSH's health screening program and a waiver called Part 90, which allows miners with early-stage black lung disease to transfer to roles out of the mines.",
      "If the NIOSH dismissals were allowed to go forward, Berger wrote, \"thousands of miners will go without screening for black lung, and those with black lung will be deprived of access to the Part 90 transfer option.\"",
      "Berger referenced Kennedy directly, writing, \"Does the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services genuinely believe that a miner diagnosed with black lung is not being injured when the program designed to confirm his condition and provide him with workplace protections to prevent its progression is rendered inaccessible? This court does not share such a belief.\"",
      "Berger ordered the Trump administration to grant \"full restoration of the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division, rescission of the [reduction in force letters], and compelling continued health surveillance\" through the health surveillance program and Part 90.",
      "She gave Kennedy three weeks to report in writing when the court's orders have been satisfied.",
      "In a statement to ABC News, plaintiffs attorney Sam Petsonk said, \"This opinion gives life to our foundational principles of judicial review, empowering ordinary citizens like these coal miners to defend their rights.\"",
      "\"We're glad to see the Administration already taking some initial steps in the direction of complying with the order. America's coal miners deserve nothing less, and in fact they deserve a heck of a lot more,\" Petsonk said.",
      "An HHS spokesperson told ABC News that Kennedy has been working hard to maintain NIOSH's critical functions as HHS streamlines its operations, and that the Trump administration is committed to supporting coal miners and firefighters.",

      "Martin's appointment to several powerful positions at the Justice Department -- following his rejected confirmation by the U.S. Senate -- appears to have emboldened him to more aggressively pursue political targets of President Donald Trump, according to a series of recent interviews with right-wing media outlets and his Tuesday press conference.",

      "The Trump administration's move to prioritize the resettlement of white South African refugees in the United States even as it has turned away refugees from countries including Afghanistan and Haiti has sparked allegations of hypocrisy and a double standard, as well as questions about who is footing the bill for the new arrivals.",
      "On Monday, the State Department said it had welcomed 59 Afrikaners whose applications to come to the U.S. were fast-tracked under President Donald Trump's executive order issued in February titled, \"Addressing Egregious Actions of the Republic of South Africa.\" The order called on the administration to \"prioritize humanitarian relief, including admission and resettlement\" for Afrikaners, a South African minority group descended primarily from Dutch settlers, \"who are victims of unjust racial discrimination.\"",
      "State Department Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, the second-highest-ranking U.S. diplomat, was on hand to greet the new arrivals' charter flight, and department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce signaled in a statement that additional Afrikaners will soon follow in their footsteps.",
      "\"In the coming months, we will continue to welcome more Afrikaner refugees and help them rebuild their lives in our great country,\" she said.",
      "However, the State Department has dodged questions about how that travel is being funded.",
      "Typically, when a refugee who is resettled in the U.S. cannot afford the cost of travel, the State Department provides the refugee with an interest-free, repayable loan to fund the travel, which is administered through the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations agency. Refugees also sign a promissory note guaranteeing they will repay the loan before they depart their country of origin.",
      "But the International Organization for Migration told ABC News it was not involved in administering loans for any of the 59 people who arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport this week, and the Trump administration has repeatedly declined to say whether they paid their own way.",
      "\"State Department's Migration and Refugee Assistance account funds a variety of programs and activities aimed at providing humanitarian assistance to refugees, displaced persons and other vulnerable populations,\" a State Department official told ABC News when pressed about the costs.",
      "\"This includes activities related to resettling refugees in the United States, such as processing and their initial placement,\" the official added.",
      "For decades, the State Department has defended its longstanding policy of making refugees fund their own way to the U.S., arguing it ensures each person assumes responsibility for his or her own success in a new country and that it helps establish credit history.",
      "Critics of the Trump administration's policy say it is not the only way white South African refugees have received preferential treatment.",
      "On the same day the 59 Afrikaners landed in the Washington, D.C., area, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would terminate temporary protected status, or TPS, for Afghans already in the U.S. -- revoking deportation protections issued by the Biden administration in 2021 after the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan.",
      "\"We've reviewed the conditions in Afghanistan with our interagency partners, and they do not meet the requirements for a TPS designation,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said. \"Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent them from returning to their home country.\"",

      "Following South Africa's apartheid era, white and Black landowners have been the target of violent farm attacks. The South African government said the primary motive for the attacks is robbery, but white nationalist groups and others have claimed they are racially motivated.",
      "Trump has been a critic of the South African government's handling of the situation for years, and in 2018, he posted that he asked that then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \"closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers.\"",

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is requesting that the Department of Defense's Office of Inspector General launch an inquiry on the department's role in \"facilitating and serving as a pass-through\" for the Trump administration to accept a luxury jet donated by the Qatari government to use as Air Force One, ABC News has exclusively learned.",
      "President Donald Trump confirmed on social media this week an ABC News report that his administration was preparing to accept the aircraft, calling it a \"very public and transparent transaction\" with the Defense Department.",
      "In a letter sent on Tuesday, also signed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Senate Armed Services Committee ranking member Jack Reed, D-R.I., along with six other Senate Democrats, Schiff raised to acting Inspector General Steven Stebbins a number of constitutional, legal and national security concerns related to the possible gift from Qatar.",
      "\"Public reports raise the troubling prospect that the Administration involved DOD to (1) launder this impermissible gift, so that the Department could provide cover to give the transfer of the plane the appearance of an official gift; (2) place the onus on DOD to retrofit the plane at considerable cost to U.S. taxpayers; and (3) ultimately transfer it to President Trump's library prior to the end of his term for his continued use in a personal capacity,\" the senators wrote in the letter.",
      "The Democrats asked Stebbins to launch an inquiry into the DOD's involvement with facilitating the potential foreign gift transfer and requested a \"comprehensive audit and investigation\" into any \"fraud, waste, and abuse\" when a potential transfer is completed, given that a mandatory retrofit of the plane would need to occur if it were to be used as Air Force One. They also asserted that the Trump administration is sidestepping constitutionally provided congressional guardrails by accepting the foreign gift.",
      "\"DOD risks becoming embroiled in a brazen attempt to evade constitutional limitations on the acceptance of personal gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval,\" they continued in his letter.",
      "The letter also requested, \"in classified form if needed,\" the cost estimate and probable timeline for retrofitting and installing communications and other equipment necessary to meet security and counterintelligence requirements for the Air Force One fleet and any timeline the White House has dictated for this plane to be ready for use by Trump.",
      "They also asked whether necessary modifications can be made within such a time frame to meet Air Force One standards and what possible risks could be associated with that timeline. Additionally, they asked for answers on whether the existing contract for other Air Force One aircraft will continue or be terminated and what the cost of any termination would be.",

Schumer also said he believes the jet poses a \"grave security risk\" and cited reporting that Bondi personally signed off on the transaction. In light of what Schumer called Bondi's \"central role in approving the proposal,\" he asked Bondi to respond to a number of questions related to the proposed gifted plane.",

      "For several months, Trump has promised not to touch the program, though on Monday he urged Republicans to \"UNIFY\" around the \"one, big beautiful bill,\" which plans to slash Medicaid spending by imposing work requirements for recipients, make more frequent eligibility checks, and penalize states like New York and California that offer Medicaid to illegal immigrants.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office wrote in a letter to Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie that the proposal met its lofty target for $880 billion of savings over the next decade. The health portions would save about $715 billion, according to CBO. However, at least 8.6 million more Americans will go uninsured.",
      "In his first-ever campaign speech for president in 2015, Trump said he would \"Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts,\" then tried to dismantle it once in office.",
      "During his last campaign, Trump primarily promised to save Social Security and Medicare, with Medicaid not specifically mentioned in his platform, though he pledged to protect it once it came up as a target for cuts.",
      "While promising not to touch Medicaid, Trump has countered that the administration is looking for \"fraud\" and \"abuse\" in the benefits program.",
      "On \"Meet the Press\" on May 4, Trump said he would veto the bill if it includes cuts to Medicaid while adding, \"but they're not cutting it.\"",
      "\"They're looking at fraud, waste and abuse. And nobody minds that,\" he said. \"If illegal immigrants are in the mix, if people that aren't supposed to be there, people that are non-citizens are in the mix, nobody minds that. Waste, fraud and abuse. But we're not cutting Medicaid, we're not cutting Medicare, and we're not cutting Social Security.\"",
      "When asked if he could guarantee that Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security will not be touched while before a Cabinet meeting on Feb. 26, Trump said, \"I have said it so many times, you shouldn't be asking me that question.\"",
      "\"We're not going to touch it. Now, we are going to look for fraud,\" he continued.",
      "Those other times included during a Feb. 18 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, when, while referring to Medicaid and Medicare, Trump said, \"None of that stuff is going to be touched.\"",
      "\"We're going to love and cherish Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,\" Trump also said in the Oval Office on Jan. 31. \"We're not going to do anything with that, other than if we can find some abuse or waste, we'll do something, but the people won't be affected. It will only be more effective and better.\"",

      "According to Jeffrey Schwab \u2013 a lawyer from the conservative Liberty Justice Center representing the plaintiffs \u2013 the question isn't even close. Schwab argued that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act \u2013 a 1977 law that gives the president the right to regulate commerce during national emergencies \u2013 does not give Trump the right to unilaterally to impose tariffs.",
      "He added that Trump's purported emergency of trade deficits has been a problem for years and fail to meet the legal standard for an emergency of being brief, rare and not ongoing.",
      "\"This case is so far outside of what an emergency is and what an unusual and extraordinary threat is that this Court could easily say that it is not an emergency,\" Schwab argued.",
      "When the three judge panel hearing the case \u2013 including judges appointed by Presidents Obama, Trump and Reagan \u2013 pushed for a legal standard on which to issue their future ruling, Schwab said the unlawfulness of the tariffs is so obvious that the judges shouldn't overthink it.",

Is it at the knees or slightly below the knees?\" Schwab said. \"I'm saying it's a wild pitch and it's on the other side of the batter and hit the backstop, so we don't need to debate that.\"",
      "The lawsuit was filed last month by a group of small businesses, including a New York liquor distributor, Utah pipe company, Virginia electronics store, Pennsylvania-based tackle shop, and Vermont cycling company.

      "\"Plaintiffs' proposed injunction would be an enormous intrusion on the President's conduct of foreign affairs and efforts to protect national security under IEEPA and the Constitution,\" they argued.",
      "At least six separate lawsuits have targeted Trump's use of tariffs, including a case filed by the state of California and a coalition of twelve state attorneys general. While some of the cases were filed in district courts, the cases have gradually been transferred to the Court of International Trade, making Tuesday's argument the first time a panel of judges hears a challenge to Trump's tariffs.",

      "Online shoppers in the U.S. will see a price break on their purchases valued at less than $800 and shipped from China after the Trump administration reached a truce with Beijing over sky-high tariffs",
      "WASHINGTON -- Online shoppers in the U.S. will see a price break on their purchases valued at less than $800 and shipped from China after the Trump administration reached a truce with Beijing over sky-high tariffs.",
      "An executive order Monday from President Donald Trump said the tariffs on low-value parcels originating from China and coming through the U.S. Postal Service will be lowered to 54%, down from 120%.",
      "It also says a per-package flat rate \u2014 as an alternative to the value-based tariff \u2014 will be kept at $100, rather than being raised to $200 on June 1 as previously decreed. Packages shipped by commercial carriers are subject to the general tariff, which also has been cut.",
      "The new rules go into effect Wednesday.",
      "They are part of a broader agreement by the Trump administration to drastically lower import taxes on all Chinese goods from 145% to 30% following weekend talks in Switzerland with Chinese officials. China issued a public notice on Tuesday lowering its own tariffs on U.S. goods to 10%, down from 125%.",
      "However, the reductions are temporary, allowing the two sides to negotiate a longer-term deal in the next 90 days.",
      "Izzy Rosenzweig, founder and CEO of the logistic company Portless, said U.S. brands are \u201cvery excited\u201d about the broader tariff cut. The import tax is still high, but not as prohibitive as when it was 145%, which amounted to a trade embargo.",
      "On the low-value shipments, online purchases had been coming into the U.S. duty-free for several years under the de minimis rule, which exempted them from the import tax.",
      "Popular shopping sites such as Shein and Temu that offer ultra-low prices took advantage of the duty-free rule by shipping directly from China to U.S. buyers, bypassing more cumbersome customs paperwork.",
      "President Donald Trump terminated the exemption on such parcels originating from China and Hong Kong on May 2, following criticism that it not only resulted in lost tariff revenue but also allowed illicit drugs and unsafe products to flow into the U.S. without adequate scrutiny.",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection said as many as 4 million low-value parcels were coming into the U.S. every day \u2014 many of which originated from China.",
      "Shortly before the exemption ended on May 2, prices on many items sold by Shein rose. Temu apparently halted shipments from China and tapped its existing inventory in the U.S.",
      "John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at the supply chain platform e2open, said he expected the volume of low-value packages would now rise but not back to previous levels. The $100 flat rate, he said, means that higher-value packages could get less of a hit, because the effective duty rate could be as low as 13%.",
      "Neither Shein nor Temu immediately responded to requests for comment Tuesday about the lower tariffs.",

    "story": [
      "Two South Carolina legislators are seeking an investigation into the state\u2019s firing squad execution last month",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Two South Carolina legislators have requested an investigation into the state's firing squad execution last month after lawyers for the inmate said his autopsy showed the shots nearly missed his heart and left him in extreme pain for up to a minute.",
      "The Democratic and Republican representatives asked the governor, the prison system and leaders in the state House and Senate for an independent and comprehensive review of the April 11 execution of Mikal Mahdi.",
      "They also want the firing squad removed from the methods of execution that an inmate can choose until an investigation is complete. Condemned prisoners in South Carolina can also choose lethal injection or the electric chair.",
      "Reps. Justin Bamberg and Neal Collins wrote in their letter that the request doesn't diminish the crimes Mahdi was convicted of, nor was it rooted in sympathy for the 42-year-old inmate. Mahdi was put to death for the 2004 shooting of an off-duty police officer during a robbery.",
      "\u201cThis independent investigation is to preserve the integrity of South Carolina's justice system and public confidence in our state's administration of executions under the rule of law,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Bamberg, a Democrat, and Coillins, a Republican, are deskmates in the South Carolina House.",
      "Prison officials said they thought the execution was properly conducted. House and Senate leaders did not respond. Republican Gov. Henry McMaster said he sees no need to investigate.",
      "\u201cThe governor has high confidence in the leadership of the Department of Corrections. He believes the sentence of death for Mr. Mahdi was properly and lawfully carried out,\" wrote spokesman Brandon Charochak in an email.",
      "Even without an investigation, what happened at Mahdi's execution may get hashed out in court soon. A possible execution date for Stephen Stanko, who has two death sentences for murders in Horry County and Georgetown County, could be set as soon as Friday. He would have to decide two weeks later how he wants to die.",
      "Mahdi had admitted he killed Orangeburg Public Safety officer James Myers in 2004, shooting him at least eight times before burning his body. Myers\u2019 wife found him in the couple\u2019s Calhoun County shed, which had been the backdrop to their wedding 15 months earlier.",
      "The autopsy conducted after Mahdi's execution raised several questions that the lawmakers repeated in their letter.",
      "The only photo of Mahdi's body taken at his autopsy showed just two distinct wounds in his torso. A pathologist who reviewed the results for Mahdi's lawyers said that showed one of the three shots from the three prison employee volunteers on the firing squad missed.",
      "The pathologist who conducted the autopsy concluded that two bullets entered the body in the same place after consulting with an unnamed prison official who said that had happened before in training. Prison officials said all three guns fired and no bullets or fragments were found in the death chamber.",
      "\u201cBoth bullets traveling on the exact same trajectory both before and after hitting a target through the same exact entrance point is contrary to the law of physics,\u201d Bamberg and Collins wrote.",
      "In the state's first firing squad execution of Brad Sigmon on March 7, three distinct wounds were found on his chest and his heart was heavily damaged, according to his autopsy report.",
      "The shots barely hit one of the four chambers of Mahdi's heart and extensively damaged his liver and lungs. Where it likely takes someone 15 seconds to lose consciousness when the heart is directly hit, Mahdi likely was aware and in extreme pain for 30 seconds to a minute, said Dr. Jonathan Arden, the pathologist who reviewed the autopsy for the inmate's lawyers.",
      "Witnesses said Mahdi cried out as the shots were fired at his execution, groaned again some 45 seconds later and let out one last low moan just before he appeared to draw his final breath at 75 seconds.",
      "Bamberg and Collins said Mahdi's autopsy itself was problematic.",
      "The official autopsy did not include X-rays to allow the results to be independently verified; only one photo was taken of Mahdi\u2019s body, and no close-ups of the wounds; and his clothing was not examined to determine where the target was placed and how it aligned with the damage the bullets caused to his shirt and his body.",
      "\u201cI think it is really stretching the truth to say that Mikal Mahdi had an autopsy. I think most pathologists would say that he had \u2018an external examination of the body,\u2019\u201d said Jonathan Groner, an expert in lethal injection and other capital punishments and a surgeon who teaches at Ohio State University.",
      "Sigmon's autopsy included X-rays, several photos and a cursory examination of his clothes",
      "Prison officials have used the same company, Professional Pathology Services, for all its execution autopsies, Corrections Department spokeswoman Chrysti Shain said.",
      "They provide no instructions or restrictions to the firm for any autopsy, she said.",
      "The pathologist who conducted the autopsy refused to answer questions from The Associated Press.",
      "Bamberg and Collins also want the state to allow at least one legislator to attend executions as witnesses.",
      "State law is specific about who can be in the small witness room: prison staff, two representatives for the inmate, three relatives of the victim, a law enforcement officer, the prosecutor where the crime took place, and three members of the media.",

      "The Iditarod race organization called Dan Seavey a \u201ctrue pioneer and cherished figure\u201d in the race\u2019s 53-year history and said he was instrumental in the establishment of the Iditarod Trail as a National Historic Trail in 1978. He also wrote a book, \u201cThe First Great Race,\u201d which his son said drew on notes Seavey recorded during the first edition of the Iditarod.",
      "Dan Seavey ran the Iditarod five times, including the first two races in 1973 and 1974. His last, in 2012, was aimed at celebrating and drawing attention to the history of the trail.",
      "That year featured three generations of Seaveys, with Mitch\u2019s son Dallas winning the first of his record-breaking six titles. Mitch, a three-time Iditarod champ, that year finished seventh.",
      "Dan Seavey moved with his family to Alaska in 1963 to teach in Seward, a community about 125 miles (201 kilometers) south of Anchorage. In an interview for Project Jukebox, a University of Alaska Fairbanks oral history project, he recalled being inspired as a kid by a radio program centered on a character who was with a Canadian mounted police force and his trusty sled dog, Yukon King, who took on bad guys during the Gold Rush era.",
      "Seavey said finding time to train to race was difficult.",
      "\u201cHaving to make a living, it kind of interfered with my dog mushing,\u201d Seavey, a longtime history teacher, said. He trained on nights and weekends, and around the first two years of the Iditarod he petitioned the school board for time off, he said.",
      "Seavey didn't have competitive aspirations past those first two Iditarod races, his son said, but he continued to mush recreationally. Seavey at one point thought about letting Mitch have his dogs but couldn\u2019t bear the thought of not having dogs around, Mitch Seavey said.",

      "The legislation, which has the backing of Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, would authorize the state to issue bonds valued at up to half the cost of the stadium projects and allow tax credits of up to $50 million. But the plan doesn't list a total cost or a location for the stadiums, leaving those details to be negotiated later.",
      "Missouri lawmakers are scrambling to try to counter an offer from neighboring Kansas, which authorized its own package of incentives last year after voters in Jackson County, Missouri, turned down a sales tax extension that would have helped finance a $2 billion ballpark district for the Royals in downtown Kansas City and an $800 million renovation of the Chiefs' Arrowhead Stadium.",
      "The clock is ticking for Missouri lawmakers. The state Senate would still need to approve the plan before a Friday deadline to wrap up work in the annual legislative session. But the legislation encountered immediate resistance when it was brought up later Tuesday in Senate. Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman denounced it as \u201cspecial interests for billionaires\u201d and foreshadowed a lengthy debate.",
      "The Chiefs and Royals have played for more than 50 years in side-by-side football and baseball stadiums built in eastern Kansas City, drawing fans from both states in the split metropolitan area.

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s plans to slash the number of senior military leaders across the services would cut more than 120 high-ranking officer jobs in the active duty and National Guard, including as many as nine top general slots",
      "WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's plans to slash the number of senior military leaders across the services would cut more than 120 high-ranking officer jobs in the active duty and National Guard, including as many as nine top general slots.",
      "Based on the percentages outlined by Hegseth and his senior staff, 20% of the 44 authorized top active duty general and admiral jobs would be eliminated, along with 10% of the more than 800 one-, two- and three-star positions, according to numbers compiled by The Associated Press.",
      "The cuts \u2014 about nine positions among four-star generals and 80 jobs across the other leadership levels \u2014 would affect dozens of active duty officers scattered across the five services as well as those who are in joint command jobs, such as those overseeing Africa, the Middle East and Europe. The changes would eliminate 33 senior National Guard positions.",
      "The cuts are part of a broader government-wide campaign to slash spending and personnel across federal agencies that is being pushed by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and ally Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "According to Hegseth and others, the intent of the military job reductions isn't to reduce the overall size of the force but to thin out the higher ranks and offset those cuts with additional troops at lower levels. While the overall number of service members may not drop, the salary costs will be lower.",
      "Some Democratic members of Congress have criticized Hegseth's plans as an attempt to politicize the military and oust leaders that don't agree with the Trump administration. The changes also come as the world is roiled by conflicts, including the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and as the U.S. has troops deployed in Syria and elsewhere.",
      "Military officials expect that as various jobs are downgraded \u2014 for example from a lieutenant general in charge to a major general or brigadier general \u2014 more leadership responsibilities will fall on colonels or Navy captains and other subordinates.",
      "And while many of the job cuts will come through attrition, as senior officers retire or move on, the services say they will have the flexibility to move people into higher priority positions and get rid of less critical posts.",
      "\u201cMore generals and admirals does not equal more success,\u201d Hegseth said in a video describing his plan. \u201cThis is not a slash and burn exercise meant to punish high-ranking officers. Nothing could be further from the truth. This has been a deliberative process.\u201d",
      "Calling it the \u201cLess Generals, More GIs\u201d plan, he said the department will make \u201cprudent reductions.\u201d",
      "The Army, which is the largest service, is allowed to have a maximum of 219 high-ranking general officers and is expected to absorb a higher number of the cuts, while the Marine Corps will probably see little impact at the very top. There are only two Marine four-star generals, and the tiny Space Force also only has two.",
      "\u201cThe Marine Corps, with our general officers, like our civilians and senior executives, is by far the leanest service,\" said Lt. Col. Josh Benson, a Marine spokesman. \"Due to the already lean nature of the general officers in the Marine Corps, any cuts to Marine general officers will have an outsized impact to the Corps relative to other services.\u201d",
      "He said nearly one-third \u2014 or 21 \u2014 of Marine generals hold two or three jobs each, and as many as 10 positions are already empty.",
      "Army leaders, meanwhile, have already developed plans to merge or close headquarters units and staff. As many as 40 general officer slots could be cut as a result, officials have said.",
      "The joint jobs would include leaders at regional commands, such as those in Europe, the Indo-Pacific and the Middle East, as well as administrative or functional commands, such as Cyber Command and Special Operations Command.",
      "Under the law, there currently can be no more than 232 of those joint officers, and they're spread across all the services.",
      "It's unclear how many of the cuts those jobs would absorb, versus the slots in each of the services. But officials have talked about merging some commands as the Pentagon reviews its overall leadership structure.",
      "In addition to the joint command jobs, Congress stipulates the maximum number of high-ranking general officers in the services: 219 in the Army, 171 in the Air Force, 21 in the Space Force, 64 in the Marine Corps and 150 flag officers in the Navy.",
      "All combined, the services can't have more than 27 four-star officers, 153 three stars, 239 two stars and 210 one stars.",
      "The decrease in the National Guard stems from a review done by Guard leaders last year that identified more than 30 positions that could be cut among the 133 general officer jobs spread out across the government.

      "Guard officials described their plan to Hegseth and Pentagon leaders, and it was approved. According to officials, it would result in six jobs cut from Guard Bureau staff and the rest from other military and government posts.",
      "The adjutants general who run the Guard in each state are chosen by and work for the governors and so are not part of any cuts. They are largely one- and two- star officers.",

      "The law known as the Speedy Trial Act allows the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court to appoint a sitting or retired judge to preside over a specific case or cases involving a violent offense. Under the act, the attorney general or a district attorney must request the appointments.",
      "On the same day the bill was signed, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall asked Chief Justice Sarah Stewart to appoint a visiting judge to handle the case of the man accused of the 2019 kidnapping and killing of college student Aniah Blanchard, 19. Her disappearance from an Auburn gas station drew national attention.",

Her remains were discovered about a month later in a wooded area of Macon County. A trial date has not been set for Ibraheem Yazeed, the man accused of killing Blanchard. He has pleaded not guilty to capital murder charges.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A technological glitch caused an emergency alert to be mistakenly sent to millions of Los Angeles County residents in January rather than only those in the proximity of a wildfire, according to a congressional report.",
      "The mistaken alert on Jan. 9 came as residents were on edge two days after fierce winds and deadly wildfires ripped across Los Angeles County hillsides and burned through communities. The alert message was only supposed to go to residents in the San Fernando Valley facing an evacuation warning due to the Kenneth Fire.",
      "The report issued Monday by Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of Long Beach found that Los Angeles County officials properly coded the alert to reach the wireless devices of a more limited group of people. But the alert was sent to residents across the county of 10 million people, and without specific geographic information, prompting concern and confusion after two days of devastating wildfires.",
      "That's because the coding for the precise location didn't get saved into the IPAWS federal channel for local emergency alerts, which software provider Genasys believed might be due to a network disruption, the report said. \u201cThe initial false alert is believed to be caused by technology issues with third-party technology vendor Genasys,\u201d the report said.",
      "The report did not address how emergency alerts were handled in the Eaton and Palisades fires.",
      "In the Eaton Fire in Altadena, evacuation orders went out long after houses were reported burning. LA County officials have launched their own independent review, led by a third party, of evacuation policies and the emergency alert system. An initial report released last month said nearly three dozen people who responded to the fires had been interviewed and more interviews were planned. The next report on the review is expected by July 27.",
      "In the Palisades fire, residents said they received notification about the blaze on their phones well after they could see it coming and decided on their own to leave, reporting by The Associated Press found.",
      "Garcia's report suggested that Los Angeles County officials could use more location-specific language in the text of warnings so residents know where they are intended for, and the need for enhanced training and standardized software to prevent issues like the faulty alert issued in connection with the Kenneth Fire.",
      "\u201cThe lessons from the Kenneth Fire should not only inform reforms, but serve as a catalyst to modernize the nation\u2019s alerting infrastructure before the next disaster strikes,\u201d the report said.",

      "WAKEFIELD, R.I. -- Jurors began deliberating Tuesday in the child molestation trial of a former Rhode Island high school basketball coach who asked hundreds of male student-athletes to take off their underwear so he could check their body fat.",
      "Defense attorneys contend Aaron Thomas conducted the tests because he was focused on developing a successful athletics program, downplaying the credibility of students who say they were humiliated and embarrassed.",
      "The trial for the once popular coach and teacher at North Kingstown High School lasted six weeks. Thomas, 57, is charged with second-degree child molestation and second-degree sexual assault.",
      "For nearly 30 years, Thomas designed and administered a fitness test that involved measuring their upper inner thighs and pressing his fingers into their groin areas with no other adults present.",
      "Defense attorneys acknowledged it was wrong and not backed by body composition expert but insisted it didn\u2019t break the law. They said that\u2019s because Thomas didn\u2019t touch the boy athletes for sexual gratification or arousal, a key requirement under the charges he faces.",
      "\u201cI suggest to you that justice was served years ago,\u201d John Calcagni, Thomas\u2019 attorney, said during closing arguments on Monday. \u201cHe lost his job. He\u2019ll never coach and teach ever again. And in his own words, his reputation has been destroyed.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors, meanwhile, presented a starker picture in their closing argument on Tuesday, focusing on Thomas creating a program that allowed him to have unfettered access to young naked boys for decades.",
      "Quoting from the student-athletes who testified throughout the trial, the prosecution argued that Thomas preyed on prepubescent boys who were smaller in size and likely intimidated by Thomas' authority.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s someone who used somewhat legitimate testing as a cover and a guise to administer his own perverted tests, under the guise of legitimacy for his own pleasure,\u201d said Special Assistant Attorney General Meegan Thomson.",
      "A key detail surrounding the case is the question Thomas would present to the male athletes, asking if they were \u201cshy or not shy?\u201d Those who said no were asked to strip naked, allowing Thomas to pinch various areas of their bodies, including near their groins and buttocks. The tests were conducted behind closed doors, first in a small closet-like room and then eventually in Thomas' office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be coercive. That question is not poised until you\u2019re alone being towered over this man at 6\u20194 and you\u2019re already in a state of undress and he\u2019s saying 'shy or not shy'.'\" Thomson said.",
      "During his testimony, Thomas told his attorney he likely saw more than 600 student-athletes throughout his career, with \u201croughly 80%\u201d of them taking their underwear off during the test. He acknowledged that removing the underwear was not necessary.",
      "During his third day of testifying, Thomas acknowledged he lied to law enforcement when he was initially asked if students were naked for the tests.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m truly sorry that it occurred the way it occurred,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt was never my intent to ever hurt or cause any kind of pain, or embarrass, or make uncomfortable, even, any of the student-athletes. It was just for competitive advantage.\u201d",
      "Although Thomas is alleged to have performed the tests on multiple students over many years, the charges relate to just two. One was 14 at the time of the alleged crime between September 2000 and February 2002.",
      "On Monday, the defense team attacked the credibility of the two student-athletes whose allegations led to the charges, pointing out the mental health struggles of one of the witnesses and inconsistent statements in their testimony.",
      "Calcagni also stressed that some of the student-athletes are pursuing a civil lawsuit against North Kingstown, saying \u201cwhen money is on the line, that becomes a motivating factor for people, sometimes to stretching the truth, and sometimes not to tell the truth at all.\u201d",
      "Thomson pushed back against those attacks, saying that one of the witnesses involved in the charges has passed the statute of limitations to file a civil lawsuit and countered that the mental health struggles directly stemmed from the years of abuse caused by Thomas.",
      "More than a dozen student-athletes testified throughout the six-week trial, as well as law enforcement officers, body composition experts and former school officials.",
      "Judge Melanie Wilk Thunberg told jurors that if they don't find Thomas guilty of sexual assault, they can consider whether he's guilty of misdemeanor battery, a lesser charge.",

      "Farm country voted heavily for Donald Trump last November",
      "WAVERLY, Minn. -- Minnesota farmer Dan Glessing isn\u2019t ready to get too upset over President Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars.",
      "Farm country voted heavily for Trump last November. Now Glessing and many other farmers are taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the Republican president's disputes with China and other international markets.",
      "China normally would buy about one row out of every four of the Minnesota soybean crop and took in nearly $13 billion worth of soybeans from the U.S. as a whole last year. More than half of U.S. soybeans are exported internationally, with roughly half of those going to China, so it's a critical market.",
      "Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on products from China to 145%, and China retaliated with 125%. But Monday's announcement of a 90-day truce between the two countries backed up the reluctance of many farmers to hit the panic button.",
      "More good news came in an updated forecast from the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Monday that projected higher corn exports and only slightly lower corn prices. The report also predicted somewhat lower soybean exports but higher domestic consumption, resulting in higher prices. Soybean futures surged.",
      "After he finished planting his soybean crop on Monday, Glessing said he was excited by the news and hopes to see more progress. But he said he wasn't really surprised.",
      "On a bright, sunny day last week, as he began planting soybeans, Glessing said tariffs were only one of the things he's worried about \u2014 and not necessarily the biggest. Farming, after all, is an enterprise built on loose soil, the whims of weather and other uncontrollable factors.",
      "\u201cAm I concerned about tariffs? Yeah. I mean, there\u2019s uncertainty that comes with that,\" Glessing said. \"Is that the number one driving factor in these poor commodity prices the last two years? No.\u201d",
      "As he steered his 25-year-old Case IH tractor over a gently rolling field near the town of Waverly, he towed a planter that inserted his seeds through the stubble of last year\u2019s corn crop. As he laid down the long rows, he rumbled past a pond where wild swans paddled about.",
      "Riding shotgun was Georgie the Corgi, who alternated between roaming around his cab and half-dozing at his feet.",
      "Perhaps more skeptical than Glessing is Matt Griggs, one of many soybean farmers in Tennessee paying close attention to the trade war. On Monday, he said the ripple effects on farmers might still be coming.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re only on a 90-day pause,\u201d Griggs said. \u201cWho knows what is going to come after that?\u201d",
      "Joe Janzen, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois, said the commodity markets have largely shaken off the initial shock of the trade war, including Trumps\u2019 declaration of April 2 as \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d when he announced stiff worldwide tariffs.",
      "\u201cOur markets have largely rebounded and are back where we were around April Second,\u201d Janzen said. \u201cTariffs have not had a major impact on prices yet.\u201d",
      "Even something that might seem like good news \u2014 ideal planting conditions across much of the Midwest \u2014 has its downside. The potential for bigger crops sent prices downward, Glessing noted. High interest rates, seed and fertilizer costs pose additional challenges.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many other factors besides just tariffs and my market price,\u201d Glessing said.",
      "But Glessing said he was encouraged by that morning\u2019s news of a trade deal with the United Kingdom, and said he hopes the current uncertainty in talks with China and other countries ultimately leads to better trade deals going forward.",
      "Glessing had finished planting his corn the day before on the other half of a field that he rents from his father\u2019s cousin, split between 45 acres of corn and 45 acres of beans. It's at the farm where his grandfather grew up, and it's part of the approximately 700 acres he plants on average. He locked in those planting decisions months earlier as he made deals for seeds, fertilizer and other supplies.",
      "Back on his \u201chome farm\u201d closer to Waverly \u2014 where his late grandfather\u2019s house, made of local brick, still stands and a cacophony of house sparrow songs filled the air \u2014 Glessing was pleased to spot the first signs of corn he had planted there about 10 days earlier poking above the soil.",
      "Waverly is about an hour west of Minneapolis. Its most famous resident was Democratic former Vice President Hubert Humphrey. It\u2019s in the congressional district represented by Republican House Majority Whip Tom Emmer.",
      "Glessing\u2019s post as president of the Minnesota Farm Bureau puts him in close touch with other influential politicians, too. He and his wife, Seena, were Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar\u2019s guests at the Capitol for Trump\u2019s inauguration in January. Glessing declined to say who he voted for.",
      "The Glessings have three kids, milk about 75 dairy cows, and grow corn, soybeans and alfalfa on a combination of parcels they own or rent. He uses the alfalfa and corn primarily to feed his cows. He sells his soybeans to a processing plant in Mankato, where some of them become soybean meal he adds to his animal feed. The milk from his cows goes to a co-op cheese plant in Litchfield that sells internationally.",
      "Because Glessing has local buyers locked in and doesn\u2019t directly export his crops, he's partially cushioned from the volatility of world markets. But he\u2019s quick to point out that everything in the agricultural economy is interconnected.",
      "On his farm near Humboldt, Tennessee, roughly midway between Memphis and Nashville, Griggs weathered the 2018 trade war during Trump\u2019s first term and said he feels more prepared this time around.",
      "\u201cBack in 2018, prices were about the same as what they are now, and due to the trade war with China, prices dropped around 15%,\u201d he said. \u201cThey dropped significantly lower, and they dropped in a hurry, and due to that, we lost a lot of demand from China.\u201d",
      "Griggs said exports to China never fully rebounded. But he doesn't think the impact of the current dispute will be nearly as drastic.",
      "Griggs \u2014 who raises approximately 1,600 acres of cotton, corn, soybeans and wheat \u2014 said tariffs were just one consideration as he planned out this year\u2019s crops. Growing a variety of crops helps him minimize the risk that comes with weather, volatile prices, and now the prospect of a trade war.",
      "Griggs said he\u2019s going to be watching for opportunities to sell when market volatility causes upticks in prices.",
      "\u201cThe main thing I learned in 2018 was that if you do have a price period where prices have risen some, go ahead and take advantage of it instead of waiting for it to go higher,\u201d said Griggs. \u201cBecause when it comes to the tariffs and everything, the markets can be very unpredictable. So my lesson learned was, \u2018Don\u2019t hold out for a home run, be satisfied with a double.\u2019\u201d",
      "He said a temporary subsidy called the Market Facilitation Program helped soybean farmers withstand some of the losses last time could help if something similar is revived this year. But he said no farmer wants to make a living off government subsidies.",
      "\u201cWe just want fair access to markets,\u201d Griggs said. \u201cAnd a fair price for the products we produce.\u201d",

      "NEWARK, N.J. -- Newark Mayor Ras Baraka briefly returned Tuesday to the gates of the federal immigration detention center where he was arrested last week on trespassing charges.",
      "Baraka, a Democrat running for governor in the June 10 primary, was turned away from Delaney Hall, the facility where he was arrested Friday. He departed and stayed about a half hour away from the building, according to NJ.com.",
      "Witnesses said the arrest last week came after Baraka attempted to join three members of New Jersey\u2019s congressional delegation, Reps. Robert Menendez, LaMonica McIver, and Bonnie Watson Coleman, in attempting to enter the facility.",
      "Baraka, an outspoken opponent of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown and vocal opponent of the facility's opening, faces a court hearing on the trespassing charge on Thursday. He has denied the trespassing charge",
      "It wasn't immediately clear how Baraka's appearance at the gates Tuesday differed from Friday when he was arrested. He denied being on the detention facility's property, which is run by private prison operator Geo Group. Alina Habba, interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey, said on the social platform X that Baraka trespassed there again.",
      "In video of the Friday altercation shared with The Associated Press, a federal official in a jacket with the logo of the Homeland Security Investigations can be heard telling Baraka he could not enter the facility because \u201cyou are not a Congress member.\u201d",
      "Baraka then left the secure area, rejoining protesters on the public side of the gate. Video showed him speaking through the gate to a man in a suit, who said: \u201cThey\u2019re talking about coming back to arrest you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not on their property. They can\u2019t come out on the street and arrest me,\u201d Baraka replied.",
      "Minutes later several ICE agents, some wearing face coverings, surrounded him and others on the public side. As protesters cried out, \u201cShame,\u201d Baraka was dragged back through the gate in handcuffs.",
      "Delaney Hall is a two-story building next to a county prison and formerly operated as a halfway house. In February, ICE awarded a 15-year contract to The Geo Group Inc. to run the detention center. Geo valued the contract at $1 billion, in an unusually long and large agreement for ICE.",

      "North Carolina Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs has been sworn in to a new term after her Republican rival challenged the results over six months",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs was sworn in to a new term on Tuesday after the Democrat won a monthslong fight against her Republican rival\u2019s challenges to thousands of ballots.",
      "The State Board of Elections on Tuesday issued an election certificate to Riggs based on a 734-vote victory over GOP rival Jefferson Griffin from over 5.5 million ballots cast. The board was complying with a federal judge's order last week against Griffin, who conceded rather than appeal.",
      "Associate Justice Anita Earls, the other Democrat on the seven-member court, delivered the oath to Riggs at the old Capitol building. While The Associated Press declared over 4,800 winners in the 2024 general election, the Supreme Court election was the last nationally that was undecided.",
      "\"Thank you for your trust and unwavering support,\" Riggs told family and supporters after she was sworn in to an eight-year term. \"You chose a path forward where power stays in the hands of the people, not politicians.\"",
      "The victory builds Democratic hopes that they can take over the highest court in the ninth-largest state later this decade. Earls is seeking reelection in 2026. The conservative majority in place since early 2023 has issued opinions favoring Republicans on redistricting, photo voter identification and even this race.",
      "After two recounts, the result remained in the air for months, as Griffin protested the eligibility of over 65,000 ballots. Court decisions whittled the potential ballots at issue down to roughly 7,000.",
      "Riggs' Democratic allies said Griffin and the state Republican Party were trying to overturn a fair and legal election by removing legally-cast ballots. Some of Griffin's challenges only applied to a handful of Democratic-leaning counties.",
      "The State Board of Elections dismissed Griffin's protests in December.",
      "But by April state appeals courts \u2014 including the high court \u2014 ruled against counting votes from people who never lived in North Carolina but whose parents had. And they declared ballots ineligible if they were cast by military and overseas voters who didn\u2019t provide copies of photo identification or an ID exception form.",
      "A Republican majority of justices said that those people who cast ballots without an ID or form \u2014 perhaps several thousand \u2014 should have 30 days to provide additional information so their choices could still count.",
      "Riggs, who recused herself from her court's deliberations, went to federal court to block these decisions. U.S. District Judge Richard Myers, an appointee of President Donald Trump, sided with Riggs on May 5, agreeing the \u201dretroactive invalidation\u201d of ballots cast by military and overseas voters would violate the due process rights of voters. And Myers wrote the lack of a process for people mistakenly declared nonresidents also was unconstitutional.",
      "Griffin's challenges in part had been about \u201cmaking sure that every legal vote in an election is counted,\u201d he said last Wednesday as he announced he wouldn\u2019t appeal.",
      "Republican officials contend the six-month challenge brought to light errors by the State Board of Elections that threatened election integrity. But many voters whose ballots were challenged saw Griffin's efforts as a disturbing attempt to steal an election.",
      "Myers\u2019 order, however, did not invalidate for future North Carolina elections the state courts' decisions on military and overseas voters who don't provide ID information as well as those who have never been residents in the state. They can vote in North Carolina elections for federal offices only, the State Board of Elections said this week.",
      "Riggs' term lasts through late 2032. Griffin remains a state Court of Appeals judge.",

The group's methodology has changed since last year, so the scores are not directly comparable to previous reports.",
      "\u201cAt a time when real-world violence and harassment against LGBTQ people is on the rise, social media companies are profiting from the flames of anti-LGBTQ hate instead of ensuring the basic safety of LGBTQ users,\" said Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD's president and CEO.",
      "While X has received the lowest scores since Musk's takeover of the platform in 2022 \u2014 when it was called Twitter \u2014 Meta's backslide can largely be attributed to its recent policy shift. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January that Meta is removing restrictions on topics like immigration and gender \u201cthat are out of touch with mainstream discourse,\u201d citing \u201crecent elections\u201d as a catalyst. GLAAD calls the rollback \u201dparticularly extreme.\"",
      "Representatives for Meta, TikTok and X did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Monday afternoon.",
      "GLAAD said Google recently removed \u201cgender identity and expression\u201d from YouTube's list of protected characteristic groups, which suggests that the platform is \"no longer protecting transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming people from hate and discrimination.\"",
      "Google says this is not the case.",
      "\u201cWe confirmed earlier this year our hate speech policy hasn\u2019t changed. We have strict policies against content that promotes hatred or violence against members of the LGBTQ+ community and we continue to be vigilant in our efforts to quickly detect and remove this content,\u201d Google said in a statement.",
      "Although GLAAD acknowledges Google's statement, the organization stresses that gender identity has not been restored as a protected characteristic on YouTube's hate speech policy page.",
      "\u201cYouTube should reverse this dangerous policy change and update its \u2018Hate Speech\u2019 policy to expressly include gender identity and expression as a protected characteristic,\u201d the report says.",
      "GLAAD's report makes policy recommendations for protecting LGBTQ users, though it's unclear if the platforms will take these up, given that many have rolled back such protections. For instance, GLAAD says platforms should protect LGBTQ people from hate, harassment and violence, prohibit targeted misgendering and \u201cdeadnaming\u201d of transgender users and explain steps it takes to stop wrongfully removing or demonetizing legitimate accounts and content related to LGBTQ topics.",

      "Gerhardt Konig previously pleaded not guilty. His wife wrote in a petition for a temporary restraining order against him that they were hiking in Honolulu in March when he grabbed her, pushed her toward the edge of a cliff, attempted to inject her with a syringe and then bashed her head with a rock. She has since filed for divorce.",
      "The Associated Press does not name people who are victims of domestic violence unless they consent to be identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.",

He called his adult son, told him he \u201ctried to kill your stepmom\u201d and told him he would turn off his phone so that police could not locate him, prosecutors said in a court filing. He also hid in the bushes until nightfall, even though the attack happened before lunch, and led police on a search, prosecutors said.",
      "When he was apprehended, he said, \u201cWait, she's not dead?\" according to prosecutors.",
      "Konig's wife suffered major cuts to her head that required surgery, prosecutors said.",
      "The couple were visiting Oahu to celebrate her birthday while their two young sons stayed home on Maui with a nanny and family, according to the wife\u2019s petition filed in family court. A judge signed an order saying Konig must stay away from her and their children.",
      "The petition for a restraining order said that in December, Konig accused his wife of having an affair.",
      "On March 24 during their recent trip, Konig suggested they go on a hike, the petition said.",
      "What is known as \u201cPali Puka\u201d trail is closed because the route is unsafe, the state Department of Land and Natural Resources said. Hikers often enter through a small clearing near a popular lookout point that offers stunning views despite a warning: \u201cArea Closed! Do not go beyond this sign.\u201d",
      "\u201cDuring the hike, I became uneasy and informed Gerhardt that I did not want to continue,\u201d the woman said in her petition. \u201cGerhardt hiked a little further and then came back to get me.\u201d",

      "They began wrestling and she screamed and pleaded for him to stop, fearing for her life, the petition said.",
      "During the struggle, she said he took a syringe from his bag and tried to inject her with something.",
      "She said that she bit his arm in an attempt to defend herself.",
      "He appeared to calm down, but then grabbed a nearby rock and \u201cbegan bashing me repeatedly on the head with it,\u201d she said.",

      "Thames Water would struggle and fail to hit performance targets on pollution while it tried to turn the company around, he added.",
      "The troubled company is currently in talks with Ofwat in an effort to persuade it to give some leeway on fines, but the regulator has told the BBC there is a \"high bar\" for flexibility within its regulations.",
      "Thames has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "Since the dire state of the company's finances first emerged about 18 months ago, the government has been on standby to put Thames into special administration.",
      "The firm is in discussions with Ofwat to put in place a \"turnaround regime\" designed to let it escape a loop where fines lead to further fines because it has not got the money to improve.",

      "Like other business owners, he feels a surge of relief, after the US and China announced on Monday that they would be undoing most of the tariffs announced in recent weeks, pulling back from a clash that had sent trade between the two countries plunging and raised fears of significant economic damage.",
      "The US said it would cut back the new duties from a punishing 145% to 30%.",
      "China likewise agreed to lower its retaliatory tariffs on US products to 10%, and committed to unspecified changes to other trade barriers.",

    "summary": "The planned layoffs mean the Japanese carmaker has now cut about 15% of its workforce in the past year.",
    "story": [
      "Japanese carmaker Nissan has said it will cut another 11,000 jobs globally and shut seven factories as it shakes up the business in the face of weak sales.",
      "Falling sales in China and heavy discounting in the US, its two biggest markets, have taken a heavy toll on earnings, while a proposed merger with Honda and Mitsubishi collapsed in February.",
      "The latest cutbacks bring the total number of layoffs announced by the company in the past year to about 20,000, or 15% of its workforce.",
      "It was not immediately clear where the job cuts will be made, or whether Nissan's plant in Sunderland will be affected.",
      "The government said the plant was of \"vital importance\" to the north east of England, and that it would \"engage closely\" with Nissan over its restructuring plans.",
      "Nissan employs about 133,500 people globally, with about 6,000 workers in Sunderland.",
      "Two-thirds of the latest job cuts will come from manufacturing, with the rest from sales, administration jobs, research and contract staff, said the company's chief executive, Ivan Espinosa.",
      "The latest layoffs come on top of 9,000 job cuts Nissan announced in November as part of a cost saving effort that it said would reduce its global production by a fifth.",
      "In February, talks between Nissan and its larger rival Honda collapsed after the firms failed to agree on a multi-billion-dollar tie-up.",
      "The plan had been to combine their businesses to fight back against competition from rival firms, especially in China.",
      "The merger would have created a $60bn (\u00a346bn) motor industry giant, the fourth largest in the world by vehicle sales after Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai.",
      "After the failure of the negotiations, then-chief executive Makoto Uchida was replaced by Mr Espinosa, who was the company's chief planning officer and head of its motorsports division.",
      "Nissan also reported an annual loss of 670 billion yen ($4.5bn; \u00a33.4bn), with US President Donald Trump's tariffs putting further pressure on the struggling firm.",
      "Mr Espinosa said that the previous financial year had been \"challenging\", with rising costs and an \"uncertain environment\", adding that the results were a \"wake-up call\".",
      "The car giant did not give a forecast for income in the coming year due to the \"uncertain nature of US tariff measures\".",
      "It said it expected flat profit this year even without accounting for the impact of tariffs.",
      "Last week, Nissan announced it had scrapped plans to build a battery and electric vehicle factory in Japan as it cuts back on investment.",
      "The firm has been in trouble in key markets, including China where growing competition has led to falling prices.",
      "In China, many foreign carmakers have struggled to compete with homegrown firms such as BYD.",
      "China has become the world's biggest producer of electric vehicles, with some established car-making nations having failed to anticipate demand for the new technology.",
      "In the US, another major market for Nissan, inflation and higher interest rates have hit new vehicle sales, although Nissan retail sales rose slightly last year.",
      "But sales fell 12% in China, and also dropped in Japan and Europe."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze1erz9jxko",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 23:03:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The US currently has no high-speed rail services, but two are under construction, and more planned.",
    "story": [
      "The US is a country of 340 million people, 71 interstate highways, more than 5,000 public airports, and currently no high-speed railways.",
      "Yet with two high-speed rail (HSR) projects now under construction, and others planned, is the US finally on track to start catching up with the fast trains seen in China, Japan and Europe?",
      "Rick Harnish, of US campaign group High Speed Rail Alliance, says it is at least good to see the first two schemes being built.",
      "\"The first is the San Francisco to Los Angeles route,\" he explains. \"That's an incredibly challenging route to build because of the mountains in California.",
      "\"Then there's Las Vegas to Los Angeles, a relatively easy project to build, as it is flat land.\"",
      "In addition, there are plans for a HSR line from Portland in Oregon to Seattle in Washington State, and onto Vancouver in Canada. And another between Dallas and Houston.",
      "Yet Mr Harnish warns that planning efforts for the former are \"moving slowly\", while the Texas line is now more doubtful after President Trump's government cancelled a $63.9m (\u00a348m) grant.",
      "By marked contrast, the total length of China's HSR network will reportedly exceed 50,000 km (31,000 miles) this year.",
      "Meanwhile, the European Union has 8,556 km of HSR lines, led by Spain's 3,190 km.",
      "In the UK, the only current HSR line is High Speed 1, the 68 miles link between the Channel Tunnel and London St Pancreas. But High Speed 2 continues to be constructed from London Euston to Birmingham, despite well-publicised funding issues.",
      "While there is no universally agreed definition on what constitutes HSR, global railways trade group International Union of Railways says that trains generally need to be moving at more than 250 km/h (155 mph).",
      "So why does US lag behind Europe and especially China?",
      "\"We're a very car-addicted nation,\" says American rail industry journalist and author Will Doig. \"There's lots of people who just don't think we need it, or don't really want it coming through their area.",
      "\"And the US government has really shown a willingness to shut down investment in a lot of projects, especially rail.\"",
      "Further complicating the situation in the US is that the boss of the government-owned passenger train service Amtrak, Stephen Gardner, resigned last month. It was widely reported that he stood down after pressure from the White House.",
      "Amtrak currently does not operate any HSR trains. Later this year it is due to enter 28 new 160mph NextGen Acela trains into service on its Northeast Corridor route between Boston and Washington DC. However, only around 50 miles of the 457-mile line can presently allow trains to travel at more than 150mph.",
      "Amtrak is not involved in the high-speed lines being built in California and Nevada. The LA to San Francisco project, called California High-Speed Rail, is being led by the state of California, and due to be completed by 2033.",
      "The line from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Brightline West, is a privately-run project. It is expected to open in 2028.",
      "Globally, there are 23 nations with HSR, according to Mr Harnish. His non-profit organisation has the sole mission of bringing it to the US.",
      "Allowing HSR trains to run safely is far from straightforward, he adds. \"You can't have any crossings with highways, it needs to be very straight and a sealed corridor.\"",
      "In China the country is still building more and more HSR lines, with the total distance expected to reach around 60,000km by 2030.",
      "Chinese cities that get HSR links see their economies increase by 14.2%, according to data from Denmark-based think tank 21st Europe.",
      "Chinese firms are also helping to build HSR systems in other Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Will Doig, who wrote a book called High-Speed Empire, Chinese Expansion, and the Future of Southeast Asia, says that China is not just interested in helping its neighbours improve their rail networks.",
      "\"It is a way of China spreading its influence across a region that it felt was geopolitically strategic,\" he says.",
      "\"In some of these cases, countries have taken out loans from China so that China can then build the railways.\" He warns that this may put them \"in a position where they're beholden to China\".",
      "Europe's growing HSR network is testament to the continent's history of investing in its public infrastructure, says Kaave Pour from 21st Europe.",
      "His think tank is now calling for further expansion of HSR, so that it connects most capitals and main cities in the EU, and those in the UK.",
      "Mr Pour says that if the US wants to develop HSR it needs to start with a cultural shift, a move towards more public transport, and asking itself \"what type of future does it want?\".",
      "Mr Harnish from the High Speed Rail Alliance says that in order for HSR to work in the US, \"the federal government is an essential component\".",
      "Yet as already flagged, the White House has pulled the plug on giving the planned high-speed line between Houston and Dallas a federal grant. US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy described the project as a \"waste of taxpayers' money\".",
      "Scott Sherin is an executive at French train manufacturer Alstom. His firm is suppling Amtrak's new high-speed trains, but he questions whether the US has the political will \"to spend the public purse on rail versus other modes of transportation\".",
      "He also notes that any future HSR lines would struggle to get into city centres such as Dallas and Houston, because there are too many buildings. \"The issue is that the cities are so densely built [in their centres]\".",
      "Will Doig says that going forward he would love to see China helping to build more HSR in the US, but that he is not holding his breath.",
      "\"It's politically very difficult,\" he says. \"Which is too bad because without the animosity between the US and China, you could see how a partnership between them could really create great things for America, that America is not so good at building itself.\""

      "However, the ONS has said its unemployment figures should be treated with caution because of low response rates to the survey on which they are based.",
      "Other ONS figures showing the number of employees on companies' payrolls found the total fell by 47,000 in March and by an estimated 33,000 in April.",

      "The Bank keeps a close eye on wage growth as the concern is that if earnings grow quickly, firms will seek to push up prices, and this will put up the rate of inflation.",
      "\"Sticky wage growth may mean the Bank remains uneasy about inflationary pressures in the near term,\" Ms Gregory said.",
      "\"As a result, the 'gradual' interest rate cutting path will remain in the balancing act.\"",

    "summary": "Trade wars and volatile markets have contributed to a gold rush, but investors shouldn't put all their eggs in this one basket, warn experts",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this article",
      "\"What you have there is about \u00a3250,000 worth of gold,\" Emma Siebenborn says as she shows me a faded plastic tub filled with old, shabby jewellery - rings, charm bracelets, necklaces and orphaned earrings.",
      "Emma is the strategies director of Hatton Garden Metals, a family-run gold dealership in London's Hatton Garden jewellery district, and this unprepossessing tub of bric-a-brac is a small sample of what they buy over the counter each day. It is, in effect, gold scrap, which will be melted down and recycled.",
      "Also on the table, rather more elegantly presented in a suede-lined tray, is a selection of gold coins and bars. The largest bar is about the size and thickness of a mobile phone. It weighs a hefty 1kg, and it's worth about \u00a380,000.",
      "The coins include biscuit-sized Britannias, each containing precisely one ounce of 24 carat bullion, as well as smaller Sovereigns. These are all available to buy - and the recent surge in gold prices has led to a surge in demand.",
      "Zoe Lyons, who is Emma's sister and the managing director, has never seen anything like it \u2013 often she finds would-be sellers queuing in the street. \"There's excitement and buzz in the market but also nervousness and trepidation,\" she tells me.",
      "\"There's anxiety about which way the market is going to go next, and when you get those emotions, ultimately it creates quite big trades.\"",
      "At MNR jewellers a couple of streets away, a salesman agrees: \"Demand for gold has increased, definitely,\" he says.",
      "Gold is certainly on a roll. Its price has increased by more than 40% over the past year. In late April it rose above $3,500 (\u00a32,630) per troy ounce (a measurement for precious metals). This marked an all-time record, even allowing for inflation, exceeding the previous peak reached in January 1980. Back then the dollar price was $850, or $3,493 in today's money.",
      "Economists have attributed this to a variety of factors. Principal among them has been the unpredictable changes in US trade policy, introduced by the Trump administration, the effects of which have shaken the markets. Gold, by contrast, is seen by many as a solid investment. Fears about geopolitical uncertainty have only added to its allure. Many investors have come to appreciate the relative stability offered by a commodity once dismissed by the billionaire Warren Buffett as \"lifeless\" and \"neither of much use nor procreative\".",
      "\"It's the kind of conditions that we consider a bit of a perfect storm for gold,\" explains Louise Street, senior markets analyst at the World Gold Council, a trade association funded by the mining industry.",
      "\"It's the focus on potential inflationary pressures. Recessionary risks are rising, you've seen the IMF [International Monetary Fund] downgrading economic forecasts very recently\u2026\"",
      "But what goes up can also come down. While gold has a reputation as a stable asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations. In fact, in the past, major surges in the price have been followed by significant falls.",
      "So what is the risk this could happen again, leaving many of today's eager investors nursing big losses?",
      "What really triggered the goldrush",
      "Helped by its relative rarity, gold has been seen as an intrinsic store of value for centuries. The global supply is limited. Only around 216,265 tonnes have ever been mined, according to the World Gold Council, (the total is currently increasing by about 3,500 tonnes per year). This means that it is widely perceived as a \"safe haven\" asset that will retain its value.",
      "As an investment, however, it has both advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Unlike shares, it will never pay a dividend. Unlike bonds, it will not provide a steady, predictable income, and its industrial applications are relatively limited.",
      "The draw, however, is that it is a physical product that exists outside of the banking system. It is also used as an insurance policy against inflation: while currencies tend to lose value over time, gold does not.",
      "\"Gold can't be printed by central banks, and it can't be conjured out of thin air,\" says Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. \"In recent times, a big policy response from authorities when there's been a crisis has been: slash interest rates, boost money supply, quantitative easing, print money. Gold is seen as a haven from that, and therefore a store of value.\"",
      "There has recently been a significant rise in demand for gold from so-called Exchange Traded Funds, investment vehicles that hold an asset such as gold themselves, while investors can buy and sell shares in the fund.",
      "They are popular with large institutional investors \u2013 and their actions have helped to push up the price.",
      "When gold hit its previous record in January 1980, the Soviet Union had just invaded Afghanistan. Oil prices were surging, driving up inflation in developed economies, and investors were looking to protect their wealth. The price also rose sharply in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, leading to another peak in 2011.",
      "The recent increases appear to owe a great deal to the way markets have responded to the confusion triggered by the Trump administration.",
      "The most recent surge came after US President Donald Trump launched an online attack on Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve. Calling for immediate interest rate cuts, he described Mr Powell as a \"major loser\" for failing to reduce the cost of borrowing quickly enough.",
      "His comments were interpreted by some as an attack on the independence of the US central bank. Share markets fell, as did the value of the dollar compared to other major currencies \u2013 and gold hit its most recent record.",
      "But gold's recent strength is not wholly explained by the Trump factor.",
      "Fears of weaponisation of the dollar system",
      "The price has been on a steep upward curve since late 2022, partly, according to Louise Street, because of central banks. \"[They] have been net buyers of gold, to add to their official reserves, for the past 15 years,\" she explains. \"But we saw that really accelerate in the past three years.\"",
      "Central banks have collectively bought more than 1,000 tonnes of gold each year since 2022, up from an average of 481 tonnes a year between 2010 and 2021. Poland, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan and China were among the leading buyers last year.",
      "Analysts say central banks may themselves have been trying to build up buffers at a time of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty.",
      "According to Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs: \"In 2022 the reserves of the Russian Central Bank got frozen in the context of the invasion of Ukraine, and reserve managers of global central banks around the world realised, 'Maybe my reserves aren't safe either, what if I buy gold and hold it in my own vaults?'",
      "\"And so we have seen this big structural fivefold increase in demand for gold from central banks\".",
      "Simon French, chief economist and head of research at investment firm Panmure Liberum also believes that independence from dollar-based banking systems has been a major driver for central banks. \"I would look at China, but also Russia, their central bank is a big buyer of gold, also Turkey.",
      "\"There are a number of countries who fear weaponisation of the dollar system and potentially the Euro system,\" he says.",
      "\"If they are not aligning themselves with the US or the Western view, on diplomatic grounds, on military grounds\u2026 having an asset in their central bank that is not controlled by their military or political foes is quite an attractive feature.\"",
      "Another factor may now be helping to drive the gold market upwards: FOMO, or fear of missing out. With new all-time records being set, it has filtered through into everyday conversation in some quarters.",
      "Zoe Lyons believes that this is the case in Hatton Garden. \"[People] want a piece of the golden pie,\" she says, \"and they're willing to do that through buying physical gold.\"",
      "Safe, but for how long?",
      "The big question, though, is what happens next. Some experts believe the upward trend will continue, fuelled by unpredictable US policy, inflationary pressures and central bank buying. Indeed Goldman Sachs has forecast gold will reach $3,700/oz (\u00a32,800/oz) by the end of 2025 and $4,000 (\u00a33,000) by mid 2026.",
      "But it adds that in the event of a recession in the US or an escalation of the trade war it could even hit $4,500 (\u00a33,400) later this year.",
      "\"The US stock market is 200 times bigger than the gold market, so even a small move out of the big stock market or the big bond market would mean a big percent increase in the much smaller gold market,\" explains Daan Struyven.",
      "In other words, it wouldn't take a huge amount of turbulence in major investment markets to drive gold upwards.",
      "Yet others are concerned that the price of gold has risen so far, so fast that a market bubble is forming \u2013 and bubbles can burst.",
      "Back in 1980, for example, the dramatic spike in the gold price was followed by an equally remarkable correction, dropping from $850 (\u00a3640) in late January to just $485 (\u00a3365) in early April. By mid-June the following year, it stood at just $297 (\u00a3224) \u2013 a decline of 65% from its peak.",
      "The peak in 2011, meanwhile, was followed by a sharp dip, then a period of volatility. Within four months it had dropped by 18%. After plateauing for a while, it continued to fall, reaching a low point in mid-2013 that was 35% down from its highest.",
      "The question that remains is, could something similar happen now?",
      "Could the bubble burst?",
      "Some analysts do think prices will ultimately fall significantly. Jon Mills, an industry expert at Morningstar, made headlines in March when he suggested the cost of an ounce of gold could drop to just $1,820 over the next few years.",
      "His view was that as mining firms increased their production and more recycled gold entered the market, the supply would increase. At the same time central banks would ease off their buying spree, while other short-term pressures stimulating demand would subside, bringing prices down.",
      "Those forecasts have since been revised upwards slightly, largely because of increased mining costs.",
      "Daan Struyven disagrees. He believes there could be a short-term dip, but prices will generally continue to rise. \"If we were to get a Ukraine peace deal, or a rapid trade de-escalation, I think hedge funds would be willing to take some of their money out of gold and put it into risky assets, such as the stock market\u2026",
      "\"So you could see temporary dips. But we are quite confident that in this highly uncertain geopolitical setup, where central banks want safer reserve holdings, that they will continue to push demand higher over the medium term.\"",
      "Russ Mould believes there will, at the very least, be a lull in the upwards trend. \"Given that it has had such a stunning run, it would be logical to expect it to have a pause for breath at some stage,\" he says.",
      "But he believes that if there is a sharp economic slowdown and interest rates are slashed, the gold price could go higher in the long run.",
      "There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",
      "The curious case of why a billionaire wants to buy Royal Mail",
      "David Dimbleby: I thought the free market was with us forever - then Trump came along",
      "One problem for investors is working out whether the recent record price for gold was simply a staging point in a continued upward climb \u2013 to more than $4,000 for example \u2013 or the peak.",
      "Simon French at Panmure Liberum believes the peak may now be very close, and people piling into the market now in the hope of making big money are likely to be disappointed. Others have warned that those recently lured into buying gold by hype and headlines could lose out if the market goes into reverse.",
      "\"Short-term speculating can backfire, even though there will be a temptation to hang on to the coat-tails of the record run upwards,\" is how Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, has put it.",
      "\"Investors considering investing in gold should do so as part of a diversified portfolio \u2013 they shouldn't put all their eggs in a golden basket.\"",

    "summary": "Online orders paused, some customer data stolen - here's what we know about the chaos at M&amp;S.",
    "story": [
      "Marks & Spencer has revealed that some customer data was stolen during a recent cyber attack targeting the retailer.",
      "The company has been struggling to get services back to normal since the attack in April, which left some shelves empty, deliveries in limbo and online orders suspended.",
      "It told customers on Tuesday to remain cautious about receiving emails, calls or texts claiming to be from M&S.",
      "Here's what we know about the attack and the impact it is still having.",
      "Some customer data was stolen",
      "M&S has now revealed that some personal customer data was stolen during the attack.",
      "It says information taken could include contact details such as people's names, home addresses, phone numbers or email addresses.",
      "Dates of birth and online order history may also be among the data stolen.",
      "But it does not include useable payment or card details, or account passwords, M&S says.",
      "The retailer will prompt customers to reset passwords for \"peace of mind\".",
      "It adds that while users do not need to take any action, they should remain alert to possible attempts to extract or misuse their information.",
      "Online orders are still paused",
      "M&S's problems began over the Easter weekend, with customers reporting problems with Click & Collect and contactless payments.",
      "The company confirmed it was dealing with a \"cyber incident\" and although those services have resumed, on Friday 25 April, it paused online orders on its website and apps.",
      "Now, more than two weeks on, there is still no word on when online orders will resume.",
      "It is understood that customers who have received a ready-to-collect email can pick up their order in store, and orders placed after Wednesday 23 April will be refunded.",
      "Some stores were also missing certain food items, after the firm took some of its systems offline.",
      "Signs on empty shelves read: \"Please bear with us while we fix some technical issues affecting product availability.\"",
      "It is understood the availability of groceries in the majority of food halls improved over the early May Bank Holiday weekend.",
      "However, later reports suggested that some stores did not have all the items needed to make up meal deal offers.",
      "An M&S spokesperson said: \"Customers can still buy meal deals in our rail station stores but there are pockets of availability for some items. We are working hard to continue getting our products into stores.\"",
      "In addition, the company has pulled all job adverts from its website, with a message saying: \"Sorry you can't search or apply for roles right now, we're working hard to be back online as soon as possible.\"",
      "It was a ransomware attack",
      "There has been silence from M&S on what or who was behind the attack on its systems, but we now know it was a ransomware attack.",
      "This is a type of malicious software used to scramble important data or files after gaining access to a business' computer systems, essentially locking them away unless a ransom is paid.",
      "Hackers often threaten to leak or sell the data to pressure a business to pay up.",
      "A ransomware group called \"DragonForce\" told the BBC it was responsible for the attack on M&S, the Co-op and an attempted hack of Harrods and said there would be more attacks soon.",
      "DragonForce operates an affiliate cyber crime service so anyone can use their malicious software and website to carry out attacks and extortions.",
      "It is not known who is ultimately using the DragonForce service to attack the retailers, but some security experts say the tactics seen are similar to that of a loosely coordinated group of hackers who have been called Scattered Spider or Octo Tempest.",
      "The gang operates on Telegram and Discord channels and is English-speaking and young \u2013 in some cases only teenagers.",
      "The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has warned that criminals launching cyber attacks at British retailers are impersonating IT help desks to break into organisations.",
      "The Metropolitan Police has confirmed it is looking into the attack.",

      "'They wanted $4m': Lessons for M&S from other cyber attacks",
      "It's costing the company millions",
      "The cyber attack has already had a significant impact on the retailer, and the longer it takes them to deal with it, the bigger the hit to its bottom line.",
      "Its share price has fallen since the technical problems started, with more than half a billion pounds wiped off the company's value.",
      "Online accounts for about a third of M&S's clothing and home sales. On average, \u00a33.8m is spent on clothing and home products on its website and apps every day.",
      "Faced with the website problems, it's possible customers may have gone to an M&S store to buy something. But it's also likely that shoppers have turned to rival online retailers instead.",
      "The problems have coincided with a period of warmer weather, when people are likely to want to buy new summer clothes.",
      "Catherine Shuttleworth, retail analyst at marketing firm Savvy Marketing, said the online impact would have been immediate. \"Given the 'buy it now' culture other retailers will benefit from this opportunity.\"",
      "Jackie Naghten, a business consultant who has worked with big retailers including M&S, Arcadia and Debenhams, told the BBC: \"It's absolutely costing them fortunes.\"",
      "Suppliers are affected too",
      "One of Marks & Spencer's biggest suppliers told the BBC it has resorted to using pen and paper for orders.",
      "The boss of Greencore, which supplies sandwiches, rolls and wraps, says it also ramped up deliveries by a fifth to make sure there was more than enough food for the bank holiday weekend.",
      "Thea Green, chief executive of beauty brand Nails Inc, told the BBC her company had a major launch coming up and she was nervous about it, given the problems at M&S.",
      "\"It does have an impact on us \u2013 but it's a single-digit percentage of our business, so it's not a major impact. But they are a very relevant UK customer,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, M&S has also had to manage disruption to a small proportion of products that it supplies to Ocado, which delivers M&S online food orders and which is part-owned by M&S.",
      "M&S isn't giving many updates",
      "While the retailer was quick to inform customers of the breach, subsequent updates have been infrequent.",
      "Its revelation on 13 May that some customer data had been stolen by hackers marked only its fourth public statement on the hack in three weeks.",
      "\"I feel they have been keeping their powder dry. If they have not got anything positive to say then they are not saying anything,\" Ms Naghten said.",
      "Many of its official communications have featured apologies from the company's boss Stuart Machin but no mention of when normal business will resume.",
      "M&S has not commented on the nature of the cyber attack, which is not unusual in cases like this, but experts say the uncertainty risks damaging consumer trust in the brand.",
      "Ms Naghten believes M&S has \"another week\" before it would have to provide information on when normal service will resume."

    "published": "Mon, 12 May 2025 22:02:09 GMT",
    "summary": "The president promises sweeping price cuts \"almost immediately\", but experts say these are unlikely.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to reduce high prescription drug prices \u2013 but its details and long-term effects are far from clear.",
      "Citing figures that patients in other countries pay much less than Americans for pharmaceuticals, Trump said he would order drug companies to reduce their prices inside the US.",
      "He touted the move as \"one of the most consequential\" executive orders in US history, claiming prices would fall \"almost immediately, by 30% to 80%\".",
      "But experts are highly sceptical of the claims, and stock market moves indicate that investors think they will have little immediate effect.",
      "Why are American drug prices so high?",
      "The US has a particularly complex healthcare system - including a large private insurance industry, employer subsidies, and publicly funded insurance programmes for the elderly and poor, known as Medicare and Medicaid respectively.",
      "In many other developed countries, more centralised systems mean that officials can negotiate blanket rates for drugs, and in some cases refuse to buy if they deem the price too high.",
      "In 2021, the US Government Accounting Office made a comparison with Australia, Canada and France, and found that prescription drugs were on average two to four times more expensive in the US.",
      "Politicians from both US political parties have taken aim at the costs. During Monday's White House announcement, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr noted that prices had been a preoccupation of Democrats and a main target in socialist Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns.",
      "Both Trump in his first term and former President Joe Biden tried to tackle the issue, particularly the cost of life-saving drugs such as insulin, but US prices remain stubbornly high.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump and his health officials blamed the lack of progress on pharmaceutical lobbying efforts and large donations to members of Congress.",
      "\"The drug lobby is the strongest lobby,\" Trump told reporters. \"But starting today, the United States will no longer subsidise the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing.\"",
      "It should also be noted that Trump's trade tariffs \u2013 which he has consistently used to threaten other countries - could increase costs even further. Trump has previously said he will tax drugs imported into the US.",
      "What was in Trump's order?",
      "Trump's order is much wider than previous efforts to bring down costs - however, many details are yet to be worked out.",
      "The wording directs US officials to make sure that deals over drug costs made by foreign countries do not result in \"unreasonable or discriminatory\" price hikes for Americans.",
      "But what exactly is covered by those terms is unclear \u2013 as is the question of what measures the White House would take if \"unreasonable\" practices are discovered.",
      "The White House also wants drug companies to sell more products directly to consumers - cutting out insurance companies and pharmaceutical benefit managers - and look into importing drugs from foreign countries where they are sold at lower prices. That idea has previously hit stumbling blocks over safety and trade rules.",
      "An official said that Monday's order was the start of negotiations between the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and industry.",
      "What is Most Favoured Nation status?",
      "The order also proposed that the US be given Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status \u2013 meaning drug companies would be asked to match the lowest price for a drug abroad when selling to US consumers.",
      "\"Big pharma will either abide by this principle voluntarily or we'll use the power of the federal government to ensure that we are paying the same price as other countries,\" Trump told reporters.",
      "It was unclear what mechanism the White House would use to punish drug companies that refuse to voluntarily comply.",
      "Drug prices are very opaque, according to Alan Sager, a professor of health policy at Boston University. Drug manufacturers could easily argue that they were complying with the order by touting the price discounts that they already routinely provide on very high listed retail prices, he told the BBC.",
      "\"Will they act? Maybe. Will they claim they act? Sure,\" Prof Sager said.",
      "\"Whether this will signal a durable and meaningful cut in extraordinarily high US drug prices is very unclear,\" he said. \"This is rhetoric, not reality.\"",
      "How did markets react?",
      "Trump's preview of the announcement hit share prices of major drug makers, such as Pfizer, Eli Lilly and the UK's GSK.",
      "But they staged a quick recovery, rallying after the administration shared the scope of its plans \u2013 an indication that investors do not expect the moves to have a major impact.",
      "What else could hinder Trump's plan?",
      "To try to retain their profits in the US, drugs companies could simply pull out of other nations in which they are selling their products more cheaply, according to researchers Darius Lakdawalla and Dana Goldman at the University of Southern California.",
      "The researchers also said that foreign governments routinely underestimated the true value of drugs to patients, and that \"shifting to a European pricing model in the US would lead to shorter, less healthy lives for Americans\".",
      "Meanwhile, it is unclear how lower prescription drug prices would fit into Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda. The health secretary has consistently emphasised diet and exercise as the key to improving Americans' health \u2013 and has criticised the proliferation of many pharmaceutical products, including vaccines and drugs to treat mental illness.",
      "However, any potential reduction in drug prices is likely to be popular with Americans - as polls consistently show that high costs are a top concern when it comes to the US healthcare system.",
      "C Michael White, a pharmacy professor at the University of Connecticut, said that the results of the Trump administration's actions on drug prices \"will be minimal for many Americans\" but that any attempts towards greater transparency and lower costs \"are a positive step in the right direction\".",
      "But the order is expected to face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in courts and Congress.",
      "What does industry say?",
      "Industry groups are largely opposed to the executive order and say it will be counterproductive \u2013 potentially choking off the supply of drugs and funds for research while doing little to quell high costs.",
      "Stephen J Ubl, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement that \"importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal\" for American patients.",
      "John F Crowley, president of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, called MFN status \"a deeply flawed proposal that would devastate our nation's small- and mid-size biotech companies\" by potentially choking off funding for research.",
      "\"Patients and families are not a bargaining chip in a trade war, but that's exactly how they are being treated \u2013 first through proposed tariffs on our nation's medicines, now with foreign reference pricing in the name of fairness.\"",
      "But Alan Sager, the Boston University professor, was sceptical about the industry's arguments. He pointed out that the money used to research a drug was spent before any profits were made, and suggested that there might be other ways to fund research - such as large cash prizes for cures for specific diseases.",
      "Prof Sager suggested that real action to drive down drug prices would depend on the president's attention span.",
      "\"Given the president's apparent public vacillation on many topics, it just isn't clear that he'll stay with this problem or that he'll be willing and able to act effectively,\" he said.",

      "The US and China have agreed a truce to lower import taxes on goods being traded between the two countries.",
      "The agreement marks a major de-escalation of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies, which has sent shockwaves impacting countless other countries, including the UK.",
      "Here's what it all means.",
      "What has been announced?",
      "Both the US and China have confirmed a reduction in the tariffs they imposed on each other following the initial escalation by President Donald Trump earlier this year.",
      "The deal involves both nations cancelling some tariffs altogether and suspending others for 90 days, by 14 May.",
      "The result is that additional US tariffs on Chinese imports - that's the extra tariffs imposed in this recent stand-off - will fall to from 145% to 30%, while recently-hiked Chinese tariffs on some US imports will fall from 125% to 10%.",
      "China has also halted and scrapped other non-tariff countermeasures, such as the export of critical minerals to the US, which it put in place in response to the initial escalation.",
      "The US measures still include an extra 20% component aimed at putting pressure on Beijing to do more to curb the illegal trade in fentanyl, a powerful opioid drug.",
      "The announcement came after the two countries held talks in Switzerland, the first between the two countries since Trump sparked the latest tariff war.",
      "What happens after 90 days?",
      "Trying to predict the next steps in this ongoing trade war between the US and China  these past few months has been difficult to say the least.",
      "But this is a major agreement between the world's two powerhouse economies and has been broadly welcomed.",
      "Even if the suspended tariffs are reinstated after 90 days, because the vast majority of the tariffs that were announced after Liberation Day have been cancelled, US tariffs on China would only rise to 54% and Chinese tariffs on the US would rise to 34%.",
      "However, talks between both governments are set to continue, so a further deal might be struck.",
      "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the consensus from both countries was that \"neither side wants a decoupling\", while China's commerce ministry said the agreement was a step to \"lay the foundation to bridge differences and deepen co-operation\".",
      "So relations between the US and China are sounding more friendly, but as we've seen so far during this Trump presidency, things can change quickly.",
      "What goods do the US and China trade with each other?",
      "In a word - lots.",
      "In 2024, the biggest category of goods exported from the US to China were soybeans \u2013 primarily used to feed China's estimated 440 million pigs. The US also sent pharmaceuticals and petroleum.",
      "Meanwhile, China exported large volumes of electronics, computers and toys.",
      "The biggest category of US imports from China is smartphones, accounting for 9% of the total. A large proportion of these smartphones, Apple iPhones, are made in China.",
      "However, the US buys much more from China ($440bn) than it sells to it ($145bn), which is something Trump has long been unhappy with.",
      "His reasoning in part for introducing tariffs, and higher ones on countries which sell more to the US than they buy, is to encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and boost manufacturing jobs.",
      "The escalating trade war in recent months has led to a collapse in the amount of goods being shipped across the Pacific Ocean, but investors believe the truce will lead to a rebound, with shares up for some of the world's biggest shipping firms.",
      "Has either side won?",
      "Politicians on both sides have started and will no doubt continue to claim victory over this truce.",
      "Despite the US and China calling this a joint agreement, people in Beijing will interpret it as the Trump administration walking back from the tariffs, according to Janka Oertel, director of the Asia programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"We are back to square one, now negotiating can begin. The outcome is uncertain but China is in a psychologically stronger position now than before,\" she said.",
      "The US will argue its tariff rate on Chinese imports, although lower, is still hefty at 30%.",
      "\"This trade deal is a win for the United States, demonstrating President Trump's unparalleled expertise in securing deals that benefit the American people,\" a White  House statement said.",
      "Economists at Deutsche Bank have suggested the lowering of tariffs, and last week's UK-US deal on them, means there's both \"a likely cap and floor\" to Trump's rates.",
      "\"The UK has one of the least imbalanced relationships with the US and now has a universal tariff rate of 10%. China has one of the most imbalanced relationships and now has a tariff rate of 30%,\" said George Saravelos, head of FX research at the investment bank.",

    "summary": "How consumers are reacting to shipping changes that mean low-value packages entering the US no longer avoid tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Earlier this year, Deborah Grushkin, an enthusiastic online shopper from New Jersey, \"freaked out\".",
      "US President Donald Trump had signed an order to stop allowing packages from China worth less than $800 (\u00a3601) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures.",
      "It was a move, backed by traditional retailers, that had been discussed in Washington for years amid an explosion of packages slipping into the US under the limit.",
      "Many countries, including the UK, are considering similar measures, spurred in part by the rapid ascent of Shein and Temu.",
      "But in the US, Trump's decision to end the carve-out while ordering a blitz of new trade tariffs, including import taxes of at least 145% on goods from China, has delivered a one-two punch that has left businesses and shoppers reeling.",
      "US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the system, are warning the changes could spark failures of smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah brace for price hikes and shortages.",
      "With the 2 May deadline bearing down, the 36-year-old last month rushed in some $400 worth of items from Shein - including stickers, T-shirts, sweatshirts, Mother's Days gifts and 20 tubes of liquid eyeliner.",
      "\"I felt like maybe it was my last sort of hurrah,\" she says.",
      "Use of rules known as \"de minimis\", which allow low-value packages to avoid tariffs, customs inspections and other regulatory requirements, has surged over the last decade.",
      "Take-up accelerated during Trump's first term in office, when he raised tariffs on many Chinese goods.",
      "By 2023, such shipments represented more than 7% of consumer imports, up from less than 0.01% a decade earlier. Last year, nearly 1.4 billion packages entered the country using the exemption - more than 3.7 million a day.",
      "Advocates of the carve-out, which include shipping firms, say the system has streamlined trade, leading to lower prices and more options for customers.",
      "Those in favour of change, a group that includes lawmakers from both parties, say businesses are abusing rules intended to ease gifts between family and friends, and the rise has made it easier to slip products that are illegal, counterfeit or violate safety standards and other rules into the country.",
      "Trump recently called de minimis a \"scam\", brushing off concerns about higher costs. \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" he said.",
      "However, polls suggest concerns about his economic policies are rising as the changes start to hit home.",
      "Krystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has nervously been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently cancelling an order for curtains after seeing the price more than triple.",
      "Though she eventually found the same item for the original price in the platform's US warehouse network, she says the cost of her husband's fishing nets had more than doubled.",
      "\"I don't know who pays the tariff except the customer,\" she says. \"Everywhere is selling cheap stuff from China so I actually prefer being able to order directly.\"",
      "When the rules around de minimis changed last week, Temu said it would stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform, and that all sales would now be handled by \"locally based sellers\", with orders fulfilled from within the US.",
      "'End of an era'",
      "Even without the latest tariffs, economists Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal had estimated that ending de minimis would lead to at least $10.9bn in new costs, which they found would be disproportionately borne by lower income and minority households.",
      "\"It does kind of feel like the end of an era,\" says Gee Davis, a 40-year-old author from Missouri, who used Temu during a recent house move to buy small items such as an electric can opener and kitchen cabinet organisers.",
      "She says it was a relief to be able to easily afford the extras and the new rules felt like a \"money grab\" by the government to benefit big, entrenched American retailers like Amazon and Walmart that sell similar products - but at a bigger mark-up.",
      "\"I don't think it's right or fair that little treats should be [restricted] to people who are richer.",
      "\"It just would be a real bummer if everyone who was under a certain household income threshold was just no longer able to afford anything for themselves.\"",
      "As with other Trump policy changes, questions remain about the significance of the shift.",
      "The president was already forced to suspend the policy once before, as packages began piling up at the border.",
      "Lori Wallach, director at Rethink Trade, which supports ending de minimis for consumer safety reasons, says the end of the exemption is significant \"on paper\", but she fears the administration is taking steps that will weaken its implementation.",
      "She points to a recent customs notice, which said products affected by many of the new tariffs could enter the country through the informal process, a move that eases some regulatory requirements.",
      "\"Practically, because all of this stuff can come though informal entry, it's going to be extremely hard to collect tariffs or to be able to inspect really very much more than before the change happened,\" she says.",
      "'An insurmountable shift'",
      "Customs and Border Protection deny the move will undermine enforcement, noting that firms are still required to supply more information than before.",
      "Businesses have indicated they are taking the changes seriously.",
      "Both Shein and Temu last month warned customers that prices would rise, while Temu says it is rapidly expanding its network of US-based sellers and warehouses to protect its low prices.",
      "Other business groups say many smaller, less high-profile American brands that manufacture abroad for US customers are struggling - and may not survive.",
      "\"If the tariffs weren't in place, it would be like taking a little bit of bitter medicine,\" says Alex Beller, board member of the Ecommerce Innovation Alliance, a business lobby group and a co-founder of Postscript, which works with thousands of smaller businesses on text messaging marketing.",
      "\"But paired with the other tariffs, especially for brands that manufacture in China, it just becomes an insurmountable shift.\"",
      "In a letter to the government last month, men's clothing company Indochino, known for its custom suits made-to-order in China, warned that ending de minimis posed a \"significant threat to the viability\" of its business and other mid-size American firms like it.",
      "Steven Borelli is the chief executive of the athleisure clothing firm CUTS, which manufactures outside the US, shipping products to a warehouse in Mexico, from where packages are mailed to customers in the US.",
      "His firm has been pushing to reduce its reliance on China, halting orders in the country months ago. Still, he says he is now considering price increases and job cuts.",
      "He says his business has room to manoeuvre, since it caters to higher income customers, but he expects \"thousands\" of other brands to die without changes to the situation.",
      "\"We want more time,\" he says. \"The speed at which everything is happening is too fast for businesses to adjust.\""

      "However, a lot of consumers are wary of it, with some commenting online that they would look out for UK-produced beef in future.",
      "As part of the tariff deal the UK has agreed to allow up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef imports from the US tariff-free. That is the equivalent of one medium-sized steak per adult per year. Currently the US can export around 1,000 tonnes to the UK at a reduced 20% tariff rate, the UK's Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) said.",
      "In exchange, the UK will also be able to sell more beef to the US than it currently does, also up to 13,000 tonnes at a lower tariff than at present.",

      "Then, a highly critical internal report laid bare a torrid experience for those working on the replacement project that \"affected wellbeing and confidence at all levels\".",
      "Originally scheduled for September 2024, the replacement employment survey has been put back until at least next year, with Sir Ian warning MPs that it may not be fully ready before 2027.",
      "Criticisms",
      "This was not the only problem the ONS faced in 2024.",
      "ONS statisticians went on strike over the reversal of one of the most generous work-from-home policies in the civil service.",

    "story": [
      "When President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping taxes on imports from around the world last month, he said the measures aimed to right America's trade relationships.",
      "In his new pact with the UK, we got a glimpse of the kind of agreements he might seek to negotiate across the globe.",
      "Both the US and UK have so far offered limited details about the new trade deal, which both say is still being worked out in the weeks ahead.",
      "But anyone hoping the White House will either significantly roll back its tariffs - or win major concessions abroad - seem bound for disappointment.",
      "Under the outline presented on Thursday, the 10% import tax that Trump announced last month on most UK goods will remain intact.",
      "Otherwise, the plans mostly amounted to the White House agreeing to walk back some of the import taxes it has unveiled on strategic sectors, such as cars and steel.",
      "In exchange, the White House said it had won changes - which were unspecified - that would expand opportunities for sales of American beef, ethanol and other agricultural products in the UK.",
      "\"The actual substantive items that they negotiated are pretty narrow,\" said Stan Veuger, a senior fellow in economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. \"In some sense you could say they basically took the status quo, made marginal changes and called it a deal.\"",

      "US and UK agree deal slashing Trump tariffs on cars and metals",
      "What is in the UK-US tariff deal?",
      "What tariffs has Trump announced and why?",
      "The Trump administration, which has seen markets panic at its tariff announcements, was eager to sell the announcement as significant, describing it as a \"breakthrough\".",
      "In the UK, Sir Keir Starmer, who also has incentive to want to be seen as a solid negotiator, called it \"historic\", while noting there was more work to be done.",
      "Steelmakers and car firms in the UK did express relief, saying the tariff rollback would help save jobs.",
      "But it was hardly missed on anyone that despite progress, goods from the UK are still facing higher tariffs than they were a few weeks ago.",
      "In the US, most analysts agreed that substantive benefits would be limited, despite the two sides discussing trade on and off for nearly a decade.",
      "Mr Veuger noted that Trump in his first term was similarly willing to declare victory on deals with China, Mexico and Canada that experts likewise said would have narrow impact.",
      "\"I think for Trump the goal really is to have a deal and it doesn't really matter what it looks like in the substance, \" he said. \"It tells me it's not that hard to get to a deal but it also tells me there's not that much room to make changes.\"",
      "Thursday's announcements drew an unusually sharp rebuke from American carmakers, which noted that the plans made UK-made cars less expensive to import than many of the models made by their companies, which have operations in Mexico and Canada.",
      "Other analysts pounced on the irony of the president dismissing concerns that tariffs are driving up prices for dolls while he agrees to lower taxes on imported cars for the ultra-wealthy like Rolls-Royces and Bentleys, which are UK companies.",
      "The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said it welcomed the deal but other groups representing farmers, a key part of Trump's political base, were notably muted.",
      "The American Farm Bureau Federation called it an \"important first step\", while noting \"more work is needed\".",
      "\"This is a good deal for American farmers ... but it is at the end of the day a fairly narrowly-focused framework,\" said Lewis Lukens, former acting US Ambassador to the UK and deputy chief of mission to the US embassy in London during part of Trump's first term.",
      "\"It gives Trump a political victory with not too much really to show behind it.\"",
      "Republicans, traditionally a free-trade party, were quick to celebrate the achievement.",
      "Rep Adrian Smith, a Republican from Nebraska, who chairs a subcommittee on trade, told the BBC he was \"pleased\" over the initial trade pact.",
      "\"This is a significant step toward eliminating barriers to American products in foreign markets and friendshoring supply chains,\" he said, commending the administration for the swift negotiations, though noting he was happy to see details of the deal were still being negotiated \"to address additional concerns\".",
      "In a note to clients after the press conference, Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the announcement indicated \"rising desperation\" in the White House to ease its tariffs before they caused significant economic damage.",
      "But those economic risks are coming not from the UK, but America's relationship with China, which sent more than $400bn worth of goods to the US last year, more than six times that of the UK.",
      "Trump has hiked import taxes on Chinese products to at least 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with its own duties on American goods.",
      "Trade traffic between the two countries has dropped precipitously since last month, raising fears that the tariffs will lead not only to price rises, as had been widely predicted, but shortages as well.",
      "The two sides are set to have their first talks this weekend, but what will come out of them remain unclear.",
      "Meanwhile, the clock is ticking on a 90-day pause that Trump placed on some of the highest tariffs he had announced last month on partners such as the European Union, Vietnam and Cambodia.",

      "Economically this US deal is relatively small, although important to very specific sectors.",
      "It rolls back on some of the trade damage done by Trump's original announcement, in particular to the car industry. An insider told me the move from 27.5% to 10% would effectively save UK car exporters over \u00a31bn from what was an \"existential threat\" to the industry.",
      "While no longer existential, this remains painful. It is unclear how the quota will function, how it will account for foreign parts, for example, Chinese batteries, and is limited to 100,000 cars. JLR's much heralded new Jaguar was launched in the US with the hope of growing this number.",
      "The flip side of this is agricultural access for the US, for example, for beef, which is also subject to a quota. Other things were notable by their absence. There was no move on the digital service tax, or on tariffs for US cars.",
      "The biggest single decision, however, is the fact that the 10% so-called reciprocal tariff stays, even though the UK buys more from the US than the other way around. This confirms that the tariff is not negotiable for anybody, and could have wider consequences.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's White House slideshow appeared to point to a rather one sided \"deal\" where the UK had offered the US \"unprecedented access\" in order to save its car industry.",
      "The US had trebled tariffs on the UK from 3.4% to 10%, and the UK has cut its tariffs by two-thirds from 5.1% to 1.8%. It does not seem very \"reciprocal\".",
      "There is an important \"but\" here. The UK and US view these numbers through very different lenses.",
      "From the US perspective, the trebling of tariffs is a tax on foreigners that \"wins\" revenue for US Treasury. From the UK perspective, the tariff is a tax on domestic consumers that increases inflation, so a lower value is in and of itself good.",
      "Over at the Bank of England, the lack of retaliation and acceptance of diverted goods from Asia are among the reasons that inflation is now rising more gently, which has enabled today's interest rate cut with more to come.",
      "The Governor Andrew Bailey told me that he hoped the deal would mark the first of many which would calm global trade tensions.",
      "The real win here could be that this agreement on tariffs will keep the US sweet whilst leaving the door open to a substantive deal with the European Union.",
      "By maintaining UK food standards and not, for example, accepting hormone treated beef or chlorinated chicken, a \"full fat\" food and farm export deal with the EU, similar to Switzerland's, is now clearly on the cards in the next fortnight. This could slash post Brexit red tape for key exporters both ways.",
      "Then you have an overall picture of a growing economy, with good trade relations with the US, EU, India and soon the Gulf too, with rates being cut.",

      "Going back to the Moon after half a century, and then to Mars, literally means reinventing the wheel.",
      "After all, Mars is a long way to come back if you get a flat.",
      "\"One thing you cannot have is a puncture,\" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin.",
      "The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover.",
      "Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears.",
      "As for the Moon, the US Artemis missions aim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027.",
      "Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030.",
      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",
      "Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May).",
      "Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface.",
      "Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes.",
      "ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet.",

      "Trump is then expected to attend a summit of Gulf leaders in the city on 14 May, before travelling to Qatar that same day, and then ending his three-day trip in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 15 May.",
      "The economic importance of the region to Trump is highlighted by the fact that the visit to Saudi Arabia was due to be the first overseas trip of his second term in the White House. That was before the death of Pope Francis necessitated Trump attending his funeral in Rome towards the end of April.",
      "Saudi Arabia was also the first country that Trump visited during his first term of office, going against the modern practise of US presidents to start with the UK, Canada or Mexico.",
      "Securing new investments in the US from Gulf states, and particularly from their state-backed sovereign wealth funds, will help Trump to signal back home that his \"America First\" agenda is delivering results.",
      "The presidential visit is drawing top Wall Street and Silicon Valley leaders to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-US investment forum on 13 May in Riyadh will feature CEOs from BlackRock, Palantir, Citigroup, IBM, Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Franklin Templeton.",
      "The push comes amid economic headwinds, as President Trump's new import tariffs have significantly disrupted global trade, confidence, and the US economy itself. US economic output fell in the first three months of this year, its first fall in three years.",
      "Back in January, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia would invest $600bn (\u00a3450bn) in the US over the next four years. However, Trump has already said that he'd like that to rise to $1tn, including purchases of more US military equipment.",
      "According to Ali Shihabi \u2013 a Saudi commentator and author, with close ties to the Saudi government \u2013 a number of economic agreements will be signed during the trip.",
      "\"These deals will further integrate the Saudi and US economies together, joint ventures in the kingdom, in the United States, procurements of American weapons and goods,\" says Mr Shihabi.",

      "Meanwhile, the UAE has already committed to investing $1.4tn in the US over the next 10 years, in sectors such as AI, semiconductors, energy and manufacturing. This was announced by the White House in March after the UAE's national security advisor, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, met President Trump in Washington.",

    "story": [
      "It's going to be a very sexy summer, a touch of romantic, cowboy and rock and roll.",
      "That's according to Mehdi Sousanne, at least. And he should know. He's a designer for Zara who helps create the clothes for a brand that's one of the most successful stories in High Street fashion.",
      "Zara is owned by Inditex, the world's biggest fashion retailer, which runs a string of store chains including Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear.",
      "It relies on 1,800 suppliers across the world, but nearly all the clothes are brought to Spain where the company is based, to be despatched to stores in 97 countries.",
      "Zara doesn't advertise and rarely gives interviews. But as it marks 50 years since the opening of its first store, I've come to its vast campus in Galicia to meet the boss and workers for a rare glimpse into how the secretive brand operates.",
      "It's a time when the company finds itself having to navigate fast-changing markets, with growing competition from ultra-cheap online players Shein and Temu, who ship their goods direct from China, as well as uncertainty surrounding US tariffs.",
      "But Oscar Garcia Maceiras, Inditex's CEO, says US President Donald Trump's tariffs won't disrupt its supply chains or change Zara's plans to expand further in the US, now its second biggest market.",
      "\"Bear in mind that for us, diversification is key. We are producing in almost 50 different markets with non-exclusive suppliers so we are more than used to adapt ourselves to change,\" he tells me.",
      "The business has certainly adapted and grown since its first store opened a short drive away in the town of A Coruna.",
      "It now has 350 designers, with the staff coming from some 40 different countries.",
      "\"There are no rules in general. It's all about feelings,\" says Mehdi, who works on delivering the key pieces for the season.",
      "He says inspiration can come from anyone ranging from the \"street\" to the cinema\u00a0 as well as the catwalks. He likes to sketch his ideas once an all-important mood board has been created.",
      "Listen as the BBC goes behind the scenes at Zara's headquarters",
      "Listen as the BBC goes behind the scenes at Zara's headquarters",
      "In the pattern cutting room, the designs are turned into paper samples, and are pinned on to mannequins. Dozens of seamstresses then run up the first fabric samples on the spot for a first fitting.",
      "Pattern maker Mar Marcote has been with the business 42 years and still uses a magnifying glass to examine each item of clothing before it finally goes into production.",
      "\"When you finish the item and see that it looks good, and then sometimes sells out, it's marvellous,\" she says.",
      "Zara is a business that has changed the way we shop.",
      "In the old days, retailers released just two main collections a year, Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter. For decades, most chains have outsourced manufacturing to lower-cost factories in the far east with the clothes arriving up to six months later.",
      "Zara went against conventional wisdom by sourcing a lot of its clothes closer to home and changing products much more frequently. That meant it could respond much faster to the latest trends and drop new items into stores every week.",
      "Just over half of its clothes are made in Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Turkey. There's a factory doing small production runs on site at HQ, with another seven nearby, which it also owns.",
      "As a result, it can turn around products in a matter of weeks.",
      "More basic fashion staples are produced with longer lead times in countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh.",
      "Logistics and data are other factors behind its success. Every piece of clothing is packaged and despatched from its distribution centres in Spain, as well as one in the Netherlands.",
      "\"What is absolutely critical is the level of accuracy,\" says CEO Mr Maceiras.",
      "\"It's something that allows us to make the right decision in the last possible minute, in order to assess properly the appetite from our customers, in order to adapt our fashion proposition to the profile of our customers in different locations.\"",
      "In other words, getting the right products to the right shops.",
      "At HQ, product managers then receive real-time data on how clothes are selling in stores worldwide, and \u2013 crucially \u2013 feedback from customers, which is then shared with designers and buyers, who can adjust the ranges along the season according to demand.",
      "Unlike some other High Street rivals, it only discounts when it stages its twice-yearly sales.",
      "But is Zara starting to lose its shine after posting slower sales growth at the start of this year?",
      "\"The key challenge for Inditex is continuing to be relevant in a fashion world that continues to get faster and cheaper,\" says William Woods, European retail analyst for Bernstein.",
      "Not only are mainstream rivals like H&M, Mango and Uniqlo trying to catch up, the market has been disrupted by Shein and Temu.",
      "Shein racked up $38bn in global sales last year, just a whisker behind Inditex.",
      "Asked how much of a threat Shein and Temu's success poses to Zara, Mr Maceiras stresses that its business model doesn't rely on price.",
      "\"Of course, we are looking at providing our customers our products at an affordable price. But for us, it's critical to provide customers fashion that should be inspirational, with quality, creativity and sustainable.\"",
      "Zara has come a long way since its founder Amancio Ortega started the business.",
      "The company is still majority-owned by his family and his daughter Marta is now chairwoman of the group.",
      "Now aged 89, Mr Ortega remains famously reclusive but still pops in, according to Mr Maceiras.",
      "\"He's a presence, a physical or moral presence, absolutely every day.\""

    "story": [
      "High above the Arctic Circle, the archipelago of Svalbard lies halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.",
      "Frozen, mountainous, and remote, it's home to hundreds of polar bears and a couple of sparse settlements.",
      "One of those is Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost town, and just outside the settlement, in a decommissioned coal mine, is The Arctic World Archive (AWA) - an  underground vault for data.",
      "Customers pay to have their data stored on film and kept in the vault, for potentially hundreds of years.",
      "\"This is a place to make sure that information survives technology obsolescence, time and ageing. That's our mission,\" says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside.",
      "Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archive's metal door.",
      "Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored.",
      "\"It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,\" Mr Bjerkestrand says.",
      "\"It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it.\"",
      "Since the archive's launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries.",
      "Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck.",
      "The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads.",
      "It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters.",
      "\"Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data,\" said Mr Bjerkstand. \"There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers.\"",
      "According to him, Svalbard is the perfect place, for hosting a secure data storage facility.",
      "\"It's far away from everything! Far away from wars, crisis, terrorism, disasters. What could be safer!\"",
      "Underground it's dark, dry and chilly, with temperatures remaining sub-zero all year-round; conditions which Mr Bjerkestrand claims are ideal for keeping the film safe for centuries.",
      "Should global warming cause the thick Arctic permafrost to thaw, the vault is still robust enough to preserve its contents he says.",
      "At the back of the chamber, another large metal box contains GitHub's Code Vault.",
      "The software developer has archived hundreds of reels of open source code here, which are the building blocks underpinning computer operating systems, software, websites and apps.",
      "Programming languages, AI tools, and every active public repository on its platform, written by its 150 million users, are also stored here.",
      "\"It's incredibly important for humanity to secure the future of software, it's become so critical to our day to day lives,\" Githhub's chief operating officer, Kyle Daigle tells the BBC.",
      "His firm has explored a variety of long-term storage solutions, he said, and there are challenges. \"Some of our existing mechanisms can be stored for a very long time, but you need technology to read them.\"",
      "At Piql's headquarters in southern Norway, data files are encoded onto photosensitive film.",
      "\"Data is a sequence of bits and bytes,\" explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips.",
      "\"We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image [or frame] is about eight million pixels.\"",
      "Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes.",
      "The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev.",
      "\"We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film.\"",
      "One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future.",
      "That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well.",
      "Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential \"digital Dark Age\", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete.",
      "That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past.",
      "Many firms offer long-term data storage.",
      "Cassettes of magnetic tape known as LTO (Linear Tape Open), are the most common form, but newer innovations promise to revolutionise how we preserve information.",
      "For example, Microsoft's Project Silica has developed 2mm-thick panes of glass, onto which chunks of data is transferred by powerful lasers.",
      "Meanwhile a team of scientists from the University of Southhampton have created a so-called 5D memory crystal, which has saved a record of the human genome.",
      "That's also been placed in the Memory of Mankind repository, another vault safeguarding historic documents, hidden in a salt mine in Austria.",
      "The Arctic World Archive receives deposits three times a year, and as the BBC visited, recordings of endangered languages and the manuscripts of the composer Chopin, were among the latest reels placed in the vault.",

      "However, the council denied this and said it was only sent \"as a work in progress with a small group of professionals for their insight and views\".",
      "\"It was presented as this is what we will teach to children, there was intention there,\" said Mr Conroy, a former personal, social and health education co-ordinator in schools, who did not receive the presentation from the council directly.",
      "When Mr Conroy first saw the slide in question, he said it was \"terrifying\" and there was not any additional information about safety on other slides.",
      "\"The idea that someone is saying it's OK to strangle a person if you get a 'yes' is atrocious,\" added Mr Conroy of Men at Work.",

      "\"I'm requesting both versions of this PowerPoint presentation,\" said the Conservative Senedd member who sits on the Children, Young People and Education Committee.",
      "\"We shouldn't disguise the fact those responsible for creating the content originally deemed this appropriate. We need to look into this to make sure children are being taught properly.\"",
      "Despite the council saying that the slide was not to be used in isolation, she said: \"It does not negate from that fact those responsible for the content originally deemed it appropriate. This is where I have my concerns.\"",
      "Asghar said she had written to the council leader but was without a reply.",
      "The example has raised concerns from parents, experts and politicians about what is being taught to children in school during sex education lessons.",

      "\"This is up to government to take control of sex ed materials, opening sex ed up to the market means anyone can set up to tell children how to have sex.\"",

    "story": [
      "C\u00e9line Dion made a rare appearance during the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest with a brief, pre-recorded message.",
      "The star won the contest for Switzerland in 1988, and it had been rumoured she would take the stage as the ceremony returns to the country this year.",
      "\"I'd love nothing more than to be with you,\" she said in a video, apparently ruling out that possibility. \"Switzerland will forever hold a special place in my heart. It's the country that believed in me and gave me the chance to be part of something so extraordinary.\"",
      "The semi-final saw 10 acts qualify for Saturday's grand finale, including Swedish entrants KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is the runaway favourite.",
      "Their song, an accordion-led comedy number whose title translates to \"let's take a sauna\", has a 40% chance of winning, according to bookmakers.",
      "If the prediction comes true, it would be Sweden's eighth Eurovision title - making them the most victorious country in the contest's history (they are currently tied with Ireland, on seven wins each).",
      "Fifteen acts performed at Tuesday's semi-final in Basel's St Jakobshalle. These are the ones who made the cut.",
      "Norway: Kyle Alessandro \u2013 LighterAlbania: Shkodra Elektronike \u2013 ZjermSweden: KAJ \u2013 Bara Bada BastuIceland: V\u00c6B \u2013 R\u00d3ANetherlands: Claude \u2013 C'est La ViePoland: Justyna Steczkowska \u2013 GAJASan Marino: Gabry Ponte \u2013 Tutta L'ItaliaEstonia: Tommy Cash \u2013 Espresso MacchiatoPortugal: NAPA \u2013 DeslocadoUkraine: Ziferblat \u2013 Bird of Pray",

      "Portugal: NAPA \u2013 Deslocado",
      "Ukraine: Ziferblat \u2013 Bird of Pray",
      "That means that the Eurovision dreams of Azerbaijan, Belgium, Cyprus, Croatia and Slovenia have all ended for 2025.",
      "Of those, the biggest surprise was Belgium's Red Sebastian, whose rave anthem Strobe Lights had been predicted to finish among the top five.",
      "His disqualification came on the day of his 26th birthday.",
      "Ten more acts will progress to the main competition after Thursday's second semi-final.",
      "The \"Big Five\" countries, who contribute the most financially to the competition (France, Germany, Spain, the UK and Italy) qualify automatically, as do last year's winners, Switzerland.",
      "Dion's video message came during the ceremony's interval, as votes were being cast.",
      "Although she was unable to be there in person, it was a coup for organisers. The singer has stepped away from the limelight in recent years due to health issues related to stiff-person syndrome (SPS), a neurological condition that causes muscle spasms and makes it difficult for her to walk.",
      "After a four-year break, she made an emotional comeback at last summer's Paris Olympics, singing Edith Piaf's classic Hymne \u00e0 l'Amour from the Eiffel Tower.",
      "Speculation over a potential Eurovision appearance has been mounting since Swiss singer Nemo won the 2024 contest.",
      "In her video, Dion said it was \"beautiful and emotional\" to see the young singer lift the trophy, and recalled that her victory in 1988 \"was a life-changing moment for me\".",
      "\"To the people of Switzerland, thank you for your love,\" she continued. \"This night is yours and I hope you feel as proud as I do.\"",
      "After repeating her message in French, several former Eurovision contestants appeared on stage to cover Dion's winning song from 1988, Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi (Don't Leave Without Me).",
      "However, organisers said they had not given up hope of the star appearing at the final this weekend.",
      "\"We are still in close contact with her,\" they said in a statement.",
      "Tuesday's semi-final opened with Icelandic group V\u00c6B, two brothers with the unregulated energy of former Irish entrants Jedward.",
      "They were followed by Polish star Justyna Steczkowska, who hung precariously above the stage on two ropes, as she sang her witchy hymn to mother earth, Gaja.",
      "The acrobatics continued with Slovenian musician Klemen, who was suspended upside down during his ballad How Much Time Do We Have Left?",
      "The song was a tribute to his wife, who has recently recovered from cancer, but the emotional performance wasn't enough to clinch him a position in the final.",
      "Taking a lighter note was Estonia's Tommy Cash, whose quirky anthem Espresso Macchiato was interrupted by a \"stage invader\" - actually a dancer who replicated his noodle-limbed dance moves.",
      "The arena was awash with Ukranian flags for Ziferblat, whose prog-pop anthem Bird Of Pray is a message of hope and resilience to families separated by the country's ongoing war with Russia.",
      "Italy's Lucio Corsi brought 70s glam rock vibes with his track Volevo Esse Un Duro, which even featured a visual call-back to David Bowie and Mick Ronson's iconic 1972  performance of Starman on Top Of The Pops.",
      "Bosnian singer Marko Bo\u0161njak was all black eyeliner and sinister energy for his kill-your-enemies anthem Poison Cake, while Dutch singer Claude took the opposite approach, brimming with positivity throughout his upbeat performance of C'est La Vie.",
      "And Swiss singer Zo\u00eb M\u00eb was bathed in a sea of mobile phone lights as she performed Voyage , an understated and rather beautiful plea for kindness and understanding.",
      "However, KAJ were the artists to beat - with the entire audience stomping along to their goofy sauna anthem (\"Damn it, turn up the heat!\")",
      "The song, performed in the V\u00f6r\u00e5 dialect, is a radical departure from Sweden's tried and tested formula of slick pop anthems.",
      "It was the surprise winner at the Melodifestivalen, the hotly-contested show that selects the country's Eurovision entry, and has gone on to top the Swedish pop charts for 11 weeks.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, the band - who are actually from the Swedish-speaking part of Finland - said it was strange to enter the contest as the presumed favourite.",
      "\"We are feeling the pressure a bit,\" they admitted, \"but we're gonna go out there, have fun, bring the steam, bring the sauna culture, and we'll see how far it goes.\""

      "Kim Kardashian has given emotional testimony to a Paris court, telling judges she thought she was going to die at the hands of masked gunmen who stole millions of dollars of jewellery from her in a luxury hotel suite in 2016.",
      "The reality TV star and businesswoman - who was bound and had a gun held to her head during the ordeal - faced her alleged attackers for the first time while giving evidence in the case.",
      "Nine men and one woman are on trial for the armed burglary of \u00a310m (\u00a37.55m) worth of jewellery, including a diamond engagement ring from her ex-husband Kanye West.",
      "Kardashian, who gave testimony in a seat in front of the BBC, spoke for more than three hours in court on Tuesday.",
      "Her evidence was at times interrupted by apologies from two defendants.",
      "After one of the defendants, Aomar Ait Khedache, 71, sitting metres from Kardashian in the courtroom expressed his regret, she turned to him and said she forgave him.",
      "Referencing her activism in the US to improve the justice system and her dreams of becoming a lawyer, she thanked Khedache for his apology letter.",
      "\"I do appreciate it, I forgive you,\" she said to him in the stand, while crying.",
      "\"But it doesn't change the emotion, the feelings and the trauma and the way my life has changed.\"",
      "\"I just want to thank everyone, especially the French authorities, for allowing me to testify today and tell my truth,\" the TV star told the court on Tuesday which was packed with media.",
      "The trial for the crime committed more than nine years ago has been long-anticipated and closely followed by press.",
      "Wearing a tailored black suit and diamond jewellery, Kardashian was supported in the courtroom by her mother, Kris Jenner, several friends, and a bevy of bodyguards.",
      "She faltered at times in her first hour of giving testimony, fidgeting with her long nails, and pausing when overwhelmed by emotion and fighting back tears. However she appeared to relax and gather strength the longer she went on, her voice becoming steadier.",
      "She also expressed forgiveness for one of the defendants, who issued an apology to her during her testimony.",
      "Tuesday's session in court was the first time Kardashian had relayed to a criminal court her account of the armed burglary, and the extent of her fears during and after the attack.",
      "'I was sure they were going to shoot me'",
      "She recounted how she had been in town for Paris Fashion Week on 2 October, and had retired for the night at around 03:00 when two masked gunmen wearing police uniforms burst into her room, dragging with them the hotel's receptionist who had been bound and gagged.",
      "She managed to call her bodyguard before one of the men then took her phone off her. They snatched her engagement ring, which had been lying on the bedside table, and then \"picked me up off the bed and grabbed me and took me down the hallway\" to look for more jewellery,\" she said.",
      "One of the men held a gun to her back at this point, and \"that was the first moment I thought, should I run for it? But it wasn't an option so I just stayed,\" she said, adding that she realised she should just \"do whatever they say\" for her safety.",
      "Kardashian said she was then thrown onto the bed and her hands bound with zip ties. At this point, she told the concierge: \"Please translate to them that I have babies, I have to make it home.\"",
      "One of the men then pulled her towards him, which opened her robe, under which she wasn't wearing anything.",
      "She told the court she was afraid she was going to be raped, saying she said a prayer to mentally prepare herself.",
      "But then her legs were tied together and a gun pointed at her. She said at that point, \"I was sure that's when they were going to shoot me.\"",
      "She thought of her family at that point, offering them a \"prayer\" that they would not have to experience her killing.",
      "She expressed fear for her sister,  Kourtney, having to walk into the hotel room to find that \"I would be shot dead on the bed and she would see that and have that memory forever.\"",
      "When asked by the judge David de Pas if she thought she was going to die she replied in a small voice: \"I absolutely did think I was gonna die.\"",
      "Kardashian said she looked in the eyes of the man who tied her up to try to remember details - and that he told her if she remained quiet, she would be ok.",
      "After the robbers took the jewellery, they dashed out of the suite, leaving Kardashian in the bathroom. She said she then managed to free her hands from the cable ties and hopped down the staircase to the first floor of the suite, where her stylist and friend Simone Harouche helped release the other ties.",
      "The two then ran out onto the balcony where they called for help while hiding in the bushes. Kardashian said she was worried the men would return, and that when Parisian police turned up, she couldn't trust them because the robbers had also been wearing police uniforms.",
      "During the testimony in the packed courtroom, Kardashian also answered several questions from the judge about why her security were not present at the time.",
      "Her usual team had been sent to accompany her sister Kourtney to the club, while Kim had stayed in.",
      "She told the court she did not have a bodyguard with her because up until the robbery, she and her family had not believed they needed that level of security. She said she had previously always felt safe to go out on the streets of Paris on her own, and they had been comfortable with their security team staying at a different hotel.",
      "\"Everything changed\" after Paris, she said, noting that she employs up to six people to guard her house at night now, and that she started to get a \"phobia of going out\" because she thought people would \"see me out and know my home was empty\".",
      "\"I can't even sleep at night if I know there's not multiple security\" guards, she said, noting her concern about copycat attacks, and that her Los Angeles house was robbed even before the family returned from the Paris trip.",
      "Seeking closure",
      "Kardashian's testimony on Tuesday was interrupted at several points by offers of apology from two of the defendants in the court room, who have pleaded guilty to the charge. While she accepted Khedache's apology, she did not acknowledge the presence of the other defendants who are contesting the charges.",
      "She ignored her former driver Gary Madar who is accused of having tipped off the burglary ring about her whereabouts. He has denied the charges.",
      "She also expressed anger over one of the defendants who has pleaded guilty, Yunice Abbas, who published a memoir in 2021 prior to the trial titled '\"I Held Up Kim Kardashian\".",
      "Kardashian told the court on Tuesday she was \"really shocked when I saw there was a book\".",
      "\"Not only did he do this, but now [he's] making money off that - my jewellery, my memories, the watch my dad who passed away gave me when I graduated high school. I can't get that back.\"",
      "She also told the court she wanted closure from the trial's proceedings.",

    "story": [
      "French film star G\u00e9rard Depardieu has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in Paris and given a suspended jail term of 18 months.",
      "The 76-year-old actor was accused by the two women of groping them during work on a film in 2021. Depardieu had denied the allegations against him and his lawyer said he would appeal.",
      "A court in Paris found that one of the women, a set dresser named Am\u00e9lie, had given consistent evidence while the actor's accounts had changed over time.",
      "She told reporters afterwards she was \"very moved\" and satisfied with the verdict, which for her was \"a victory, a major step forward\".",
      "Depardieu was also convicted of assaulting an assistant director called Sarah, which was not her real name.",
      "The actor was not in court to hear the verdict but was instead working on a film set in the Azores.",
      "Carine Durrieu-Diebolt, the lawyer acting for the two women, said she hoped the verdict marked the end of impunity for an artist in the film industry.",
      "\"It's a victory for two women on a film set but it's a victory for all the women behind this case and I'm thinking of all of Depardieu's other victims,\" she told reporters.",
      "The lawyer also noted the case had come to an end hours before the Cannes film festival was due to start.",
      "The judge said there was no reason to doubt the word of the two women victims, who had told the court how Depardieu had touched them on intimate parts of the body, using lewd language.",
      "He placed Depardieu on a list of sex offenders and ordered him to pay compensation of \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3840) each to Am\u00e9lie and Sarah for \"secondary victimisation\", a recent innovation covering the additional suffering for the women from the trial itself.",
      "Depardieu's lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous had accused the women of lying during their evidence.",
      "G\u00e9rard Depardieu denies allegations of sexual assault at combative trial",
      "G\u00e9rard Depardieu's sexual assault trial set to begin",
      "The assaults took place in September 2021 when Depardieu was making a film called Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) about an ageing actor coming to terms with his declining powers.",
      "This was Depardieu's first trial on sexual assault charges. Several other women have made similar allegations in the media, and an alleged rape case could come to trial in the future.",
      "After the trial, the actor was invited to join his close friend and fellow actor Fanny Ardant for a film-shoot in the Azores.",
      "At the end of the trial in Paris in late March, prosecutor Laurent Guy said: \"It's perfectly possible to be an excellent actor and a great father - and still commit a crime.",
      "\"You are not here to pass judgment on French cinema. You are here to judge G\u00e9rard Depardieu, just as you would any other citizen.\"",
      "Claude Vincent, representing one of the two women plaintiffs, described Depardieu as a \"misogynist\" and a \"case-study in sexism\".",
      "Depardieu's lawyer had demanded an acquittal and called the plaintiffs' team \"more militants than lawyers\".",
      "\"They cannot bear that there should even be a defence. They think any defence is a supplementary assault,\" he told the court.",
      "The first plaintiff - 54-year-old set decorator Am\u00e9lie - told the court that after a minor argument with Depardieu, he caught her between his legs and held her by the hips.",
      "The second woman - a 34-year-old assistant film director - said the actor had touched her buttocks and breasts through her clothes on three separate occasions. She chose to maintain her anonymity and was not in court to hear the verdict.",
      "Depardieu denied the allegations, saying only that he might have touched the women accidentally or to keep his balance.",
      "At the end of the hearings, Depardieu said: \"My name has been dragged through the mud by lies and insults.",
      "\"A trial can be a very special experience for an actor. Seeing all this anger, the police, the press. It's like being in a science fiction film, except it's not science fiction. It's life.\"",
      "He thanked the prosecution and defence teams for giving him insights into how courts operate. \"These lessons may be an inspiration for me one day if I get to play a lawyer,\" he said.",
      "Depardieu said he had not worked as an actor for three years since the sexual allegations against him began to circulate.",
      "However earlier this month it was reported that he had begun working on a film directed by Fanny Ardant. Depardieu is playing a magician on a mysterious island, according to media reports.",
      "Ardant appeared with Depardieu in Les Volets Verts and spoke in his defence at the trial.",
      "\"Genius - in whatever form it takes - carries within it an element of the extravagant, the untamed, the dangerous. (Depardieu) is the monster and the saint,\" she said.",
      "Another veteran French actress took Depardieu's side on Monday. In a rare interview with French television, Brigitte Bardot, 90, deplored how \"talented people who touch the buttocks of a girl are consigned to the deepest dungeon.\"",
      "\"Feminism isn't my thing,\" Bardot said. \"Personally, I like men.\""

      "Eoin McCullough SC, acting for the broadcaster, told the High Court in Dublin the allegation had been \"thoroughly investigated\".",
      "He also stated it would have been \"irresponsible\" for the information to be ignored.",

      "Lauren: Well, Holly and I were in the theatre, so we just didn't renew our contracts, whereas Charlotte was actually a deputy head teacher.",
      "Charlotte: The head was one of my closest friends and a lot of the kids had already seen us at gigs \u2013 so everyone knew it was gonna happen. It was just a matter of time.",
      "Are you prepared for how overwhelming Eurovision week is?",
      "Lauren: Yeah, but we're quite good at immersing ourselves in what we're doing.",
      "Charlotte: Even if there wasn't a bubble around us, the three of us make a bubble. Eurovision is all we talk about, even if we're not together.",
      "Lauren: And then I'm sure from the 18th of May onwards, we'll have a fair amount of downtime.",
      "Holly-Anne: The comedown is going to be rough.",
      "What are your hopes for the result?",
      "Holly-Anne: We do have a preference. And I think the closer we get to it, the more hungry we are for a good result. A placement in the single digits would be nice.",
      "You have loads of festival performances booked for the summer \u2013 so life won't   grind to a halt afterwards.",
      "Lauren: That's so true. And actually, every experience that we're having in the lead-up to May 17, that's Eurovision as well.",
      "Charlotte: All the places we've been to and the people we've met \u2013 it literally feels like a girls' holiday.",
      "Holly-Anne: Even if we get zero points, we'll still be singing together, even if it's in my living room.",
      "What's the one memory you'll take away from this?",
      "Lauren: I will always, always remember the feeling of finding out we'd represent the UK. We've been around for a long time, and we've had a lot of 'noes' as a band, so when we auditioned, we assumed this would be another one. 'Thank you so much, but we're going in another direction'.",
      "So to finally get a yes after all these years, and to start living what feels like a dream come true with your two best friends? I will never forget that phone call.",

    "summary": "With just a week to go, here's our guide to the songs and artists taking part in Eurovision 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The 2025 Eurovision Song Contest pops its cork on Sunday, with a \"turquoise carpet\" parade featuring competitors from all 37 nations.",
      "But the competition really begins on Tuesday, when the first semi-final will see five countries unceremoniously kicked out.",
      "Another six will lose their place at the second semi-final on Thursday, before the Grand Final takes place in Basel, Switzerland, on Saturday, 17 May.",
      "This year's entrants include two returning contestants, one professional opera singer, a thinly veiled allusion to sexual emissions and a dance anthem about a dead space dog.",
      "It's a lot to take in.",
      "To help you prepare, here's a guide to all 37 songs in the contest, which I've sorted into rough musical categories, mainly for my own sanity (it didn't work).",
      "Left-field pop bangers",
      "Win or lose, UK contestants Remember Monday have given headline writers a gift with the title of their entry: What The Hell Just Happened?",
      "A souped-up, full throttle pop anthem, it cherry-picks the best bits of Queen, Andrew Lloyd Webber and the Beatles, presumably to remind voters of Britain's rich musical heritage.",
      "With eight tempo changes, it could prove tricky for voters to grasp, but the band's stellar harmonies and sparkling personalities should carry them through.",
      "Crucially, the song avoids the Eurovision cliches of jackhammer dance anthems and windswept balladry \u2013 something Remember Monday have in common with this year's favourites.",
      "Sweating it out at the top are Swedish representatives KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is an ode to the restorative powers of the sauna, complete with dancers in skimpy towels.",
      "Unreasonably catchy, it's won the approval of Abba's Bjorn Ulvaeus, whose been   singing the track in his own private sauna. As you do.",
      "Stiff competition comes from Austrian singer JJ, and his operatic ballad Wasted Love.",
      "A timeworn story of unrequited love, it leans on his training as a counter-tenor, before exploding into an unexpected techno breakdown.",
      "A favourite with the bookies, the song's only Achilles heel is its similarity to last year's winner, Nemo.",
      "Distinctive in a different way is Ireland's entry, Laika Party \u2013 a 90s trance-pop anthem about a dog who was sent to space by Russia and left to die there.",
      "Singer Emmy aims for a hopeful spin on a tragic story but, despite a peppy performance, it's a bit of a downer.",
      "More palatable is Luxembourg's Laura Thorn, whose La Poup\u00e9e Monte Le Son is a callback to France Gall's 1965 winning entry, Poup\u00e9e De Cire, Poup\u00e9e De Son.",
      "Where the original was about a \"fashion doll\" operated by songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, Thorn's response is all about taking control.",
      "\"If you think a man like you can manipulate me, go back to your mum,\" she scolds. Yeouch.",
      "Other countries sucking up to Italy",
      "Rome must be blushing. This year features not one, but two, songs about the vibrant culture of Il Bel Paese.",
      "The first comes, not surprisingly, from San Marino \u2013 the independent microstate that nestles inside north-central Italy.",
      "Titled Tutta L'Italia, it celebrates everything from the county's football team and its vineyards, to the Mona Lisa (under her Italian name Gioconda).",
      "Written by Gabry Ponte \u2013 one of the brains behind Eiffel 65's Blue (Da Ba Dee) \u2013 it's a slight, but fun, mixture of dance beats, traditional accordion playing and the folk dances of Calabria.",
      "The staging could be its downfall, though, with Gabry marooned behind his DJ decks while the singers, who for some reason wish to remain anonymous, obscure their faces with masks.",
      "More memorable, but definitely more unhinged, is Estonia's Espresso Macchiato.",
      "Performed by Tommy Cash (the only Eurovision contestant to have appeared on a Charli XCX record) it's an affectionate-ish caricature of Italian stereotypes, featuring the indelible lyric: \"Life is like spaghetti, it's hard until you make it\".",
      "Smut!",
      "I'm trying to give up sexual innuendo, but Eurovision is making it har... difficult.",
      "A trio of artists are trying to sneak smut past the censors, led by Malta's Miriana Conte, with a throbbing club track called Serving.",
      "In its original form, the song's chorus revolved around the phrase \"serving kant\" \u2013 the word kant being Maltese for \"singing\" and a homophone for an English term that definitely doesn't mean singing.",
      "It's a reference to a well-known phrase in the drag / ballroom world; but several countries complained it broke broadcasting guidelines, prompting a hasty re-write.",
      "If the stunt was meant to generate headlines it worked, but now that Miriana has our attention, she's not letting go.",
      "Her performance, featuring a giant disco ball pursed between two red lips, is gloriously OTT, and she has an enviable set of pipes. Too bad the song is riddled with Europop cliche.",
      "Another contestant doubling his entendres is Australia's Go-Jo, who wants us to \"take a sip\" of milkshake from his \"special cup\". Interpret that how you want but I'd be wary of hitching a lift in his ice cream van, if I were you.",
      "With a smattering of Electric Six's saucy disco funk, Milkshake Man is tasty enough to get Australia back in the finals after only achieving a semi last year.",
      "Finally, we have Finland's Erika Vikman, whose song Ich Komme is billed as a \"joyous message of pleasure, ecstasy and a state of trance\".",
      "Structured to mimic the pneumatic realities of lovemaking, it recalls iconic gay anthems such as Kylie's Your Disco Needs You and Donna Summer's Hot Stuff \u2013 and ends with Erika shooting into the sky astride a massive gold microphone that's definitely not a stand-in for a phallus.",
      "Three songs inspired by cancer",
      "Little in life is more devastating than the phrase \"I'm afraid it's cancer\".",
      "The disease will affect one in two of us and, although survival rates have dramatically improved, the impact can be devastating.",
      "This year, three separate Eurovision contestants have been touched by cancer, inspiring songs of unmatched heartbreak and reflection.",
      "French singer Louane captures it best. Her song Maman, is an intimate conversation with her mother, who died when she was just 17 years old.",
      "Over three verses, Louane describes the \"emptiness\" she was felt; and how she filled the void with bad behaviour and meaningless love affairs. But, as the song progresses, she tells her mum she's settled down and found purpose... by becoming a mother herself.",
      "She sings it beautifully, with a mixture of regret and strength. And when her daughter's voice appears in the final moments of the song, it would take a steely heart not to shed a tear.",
      "Over in Norway, 19-year-old Kyle Alessandro shared a similar story, when his mother was diagnosed with cancer in autumn 2023. Thankfully, she's now in remission, but something she said during her treatment inspired his Eurovision entry: \"Never lose your light.\"",
      "Kyle took that phrase and turned it into a thumping pop song about surviving adversity. \"Nothing can burn me now,\" he sings. \"I'm my own Lighter.\"",
      "Klemen Slakonja, meanwhile, is a comedian best known in Slovenia for his impressions of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin -  but his ballad, How Much Time Do We Have Left was written after his wife, actress Mojca Fatur, was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer.",
      "As he sings, Klemen's dancers raise him into the air and hold him upside down, to represent the disorientation the family felt.",
      "\"When she read her diagnosis, our world turned upside down and I felt that rush of blood in my head, the same one I feel whenever I am upside down in the performance,\" he told Eurovision World.",
      "Defying the odds, Mojca survived, and joins him on stage at Eurovision. It's a deeply intimate and moving moment.",
      "The bops",
      "Listening to this year's line-up, it's like the contestants all heard Cascada's Evacuate the Dancefloor and went, \"Nah, we're good, thanks\".",
      "There are club bangers everywhere, with Belgium's Red Sebastian (named after the crab in The Little Mermaid, bless him) submitting an entire song about the loved-up liberation of an all-night rave.",
      "\"Where no words are needed to feel the connection / Where clocks never tick and where love is the ending.\"",
      "A favourite with fans, the 90s rave elements of Strobe Lights feel a little dated to me, but his meticulously-choreographed performance is a treat.",
      "Denmark's Sissal takes a similar sound, with a throwback Euro-bop called Hallucination that effortlessly evokes two-time Eurovision winner Loreen.",
      "Sissal said her biggest goal was for the audience to feel they couldn't sit down during the song. Mission accomplished.",
      "Germany, meanwhile, are pitching for a home run with Baller, a super-catchy trance anthem that wouldn't sound out of place at Berlin superclub Berghain.",
      "Performed by Austrian siblings Abor & Tynna, it's languishing in the middle of the field, after Tynna developed laryngitis, robbing the duo of the chance to impress fans at Eurovision's various pre-parties. But now that she's recovered, the song could rise up the rankings.",
      "That's less likely for V\u00e6b, aka the Icelandic Jedward. Their energetic dance-rap song, R\u00f3a, is all about rowing from Iceland to the Faroe Islands, \"because no matter what happens in life you just keep on rowing through the waves\".",
      "Sadly, it's not as deep as it sounds.",
      "Spanish star Melody fares better with Esa Diva, a pumping house track with a sprinkling of flamenco guitar, that documents her journey to fame.",
      "And Azerbaijan's Mamagama go all Maroon 5 on Run With U, a smooth pop song elevated by a twinkling riff on the saz \u2013 a long-necked plucked instrument similar to the lute.",
      "Post-immigrant pop",
      "OK, so I've stolen that description from Shkodra Elektronike.",
      "They're an Albanian duo living in Italy, who fuse the ethnic music of their hometown, Shkod\u00ebr, to a progressive electronic sound.",
      "Their song Zjerm (Fire) imagines a time when cross-cultural understanding would lead to peace and harmony \u2013 a world without a need for soldiers and ambulances, and where \"oil would smell like lilac\" (no, me neither).",
      "Greece's entry, Asterom\u00e1ta, is also rooted in history and memory, as Klavdia describes the unbreakable bond that refugees share with their homeland.",
      "\"Even if they cross the seas / They shall never forget the sacred earth they called home,\" she sings, in a haunting ballad that blends traditional Greek and Pontic elements with soaring strings.",
      "Taking a more upbeat approach is Dutch singer Claude. A refugee from the bloody civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he moved to the Netherlands at the age of nine and fell in love with Eurovision while waiting in the refugee centre.",
      "His song, C'est La Vie, is a tribute to his mum, who taught him to see the positive in their situation.",
      "Fizzing with freedom and joy, it combines elements of chanson and French-Caribbean zouk, and looks set for a top 10 placing.",
      "Witchcraft, sorcery and moody goth boys",
      "The success of \"goth gremlin witch\" Bambie Thug at last year's Eurovision has conjured a veritable coven of imitators in 2025.",
      "Polish singer Justyna Steczkowska, representing her country for the second time, even includes a Slavic magic spell in her song, Gaja \u2013 summoning the spirit of the mother Earth to \"cleanse\" her of a toxic relationship.",
      "It's a suitably intense performance, with Justyna singing long sustained notes and playing a furious violin solo, before being hoiked into the rafters on a pair ropes.",
      "What a time to be alive.",
      "Marko Bo\u0161njak, meanwhile, is cooking up a Poison Cake to feed to his tormentors - chiefly the people who bombarded him with homophobic hate messages after he was selected to represent Croatia.",
      "The criticism was so intense that he lost his voice and couldn't leave the house for five days.",
      "His song is suitably melodramatic, replete with guttural synths and creepy playground chants. It's a little overbaked, but should still sail through to the finals.",
      "Taking a more ethereal approach are Latvian group Tautumeitas, whose song Bur Man Laimi translates as \"a chant for happiness\".",
      "Reminiscent of Bjork and Enya, its overlapping folk harmonies are based on traditional Latvian wedding songs, making it one of this year's most captivating entries. I fear it may be too subtle to score well, though.",
      "Further mystery is provided by, Theo Evan, Cyprus's answer to Nick Jonas. The lyrics to his song, Shh, are a riddle, written by former tennis player Elke Tiel, whose \"hidden truth will only be revealed on the Eurovision stage in May\".",
      "He opens his performance perched between two pieces of scaffolding in a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's famous Vitruvian Man sketch \u2013 so there's a clue.",
      "Shh is one of a number of gothic pop songs, sung by brooding young men with interesting hair.",
      "Among the best is Kiss Kiss Goodbye, by Czechia's Adonxs, who divebombs from an angelic falsetto to an unsettling baritone as he confronts his absent father.",
      "Lithuanian band Katarsis are an interesting experiment, with a deliberately downbeat rock song that declares \"the foundations of everything have begun to rot\".",
      "Titled Tavo Akys (your eyes), it builds to a compelling climax, but it's hard to see it being a vote-winner, unless Eurovision suddenly attracts an audience of depressed emo teens.",
      "Rounding out the field are Armenian singer Parg, with the Imagine Dragons-inspired Survivor and Serbia's Princ, whose overwrought ballad is called Mila.",
      "Both performers give it their all, but the songs don't feel strong enough to survive the semi-finals.",
      "70s rock throwbacks",
      "Four years after M\u00e5neskin's victory, Eurovision's rock revival continues apace.",
      "Italy are back at it again, thanks to Lucio Corsi \u2013 think David Bowie as Pierrot \u2013 and his glam rock ballad Volevo Essere Un Duro (I wanted to be tough).",
      "A delicate anthem for people who feel they don't fit in, it recalls how Lucio was bullied as a kid, and how he's  grown to embrace his fragility. At one point, he sings: \"Instead of a star, [I'm] just a sneeze.\"",
      "It's a timeless bit of songwriting that pulls off that crucial Eurovision trick of sounding new and familiar all at once.",
      "Portuguese indie band Napa also have a 70s vibe, channelling Paul McCartney's Wings on the soft rock tear-jerker Deslocado (out of place).",
      "It's another song about migration, written after the band were forced to relocate from Madeira to the Portuguese mainland due to the economic crisis.",
      "\"Even though we've been here for a few years we always have that desire to go back, and that anguish of saying goodbye to family,\" said singer Guilherme Gomes.",
      "Last but not least are Ukraine's Ziferblat, who continue the country's astonishing run of high-quality entries in the midst of a war with Russia.",
      "Their song, Bird Of Pray, is an unexpected mix of 70s new wave band Cars, birdsong and the guitar riff from Rachel Stevens' Sweet Dreams My LA Ex \u2013 while the lyrics are full of hope for a peaceful reunion with their loved ones.",
      "It's better than that makes it sound.",
      "The ballads",
      "Where would Eurovision be without a raven-haired woman bellowing into a wind machine set to \"hurricane\"?",
      "Israel has strong form in this category, and sets the bar again with New Day Will Rise, a melancholy piano ballad sung in a mixture of English, French and Hebrew.",
      "The song's performed by Yuval Raphael, a 24-year-old who narrowly escaped with her life at the 2023 Nova music festival, where an attack by Hamas claimed the lives of 378 people and triggered Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza.",
      "It's hard not to interpret her lyrics as a response to those events \u2013 \"everyone cries, don't cry alone\". As a result, her participation hasn't received the same level of criticism as Eden Golan, who represented Israel last year.",
      "That can't be said for Georgia's contestant, Mariam Shengelia, who has been booed during pre-Eurovision appearances for her alleged support of the country's authoritarian, pro-Russian, anti-LGBT ruling party, Georgian Dream.",
      "Shengelia has denied the accusations, pointing out that her song \u2013 a stirring, quasi-militaristic ballad called Freedom \u2013 is about \"freedom of choice, freedom to love, freedom to live as you want to live\".",
      "\"No amount of manufactured hate will change that,\" she told the Eurovision fan site Wiwibloggs.",
      "Montenegro's Nina \u017di\u017ei\u0107 tackles domestic abuse in Dobrodo\u0161li, a brooding and refined orchestral ballad.",
      "The singer, who previously entered Eurovision in 2013 with the cyborg pop oddity Igranka, delivers her lyrics with passion and sincerity, but somehow the song never quite takes off.",
      "Last but not least, we have defending champions Switzerland, represented by 24-year-old Zo\u00eb M\u00eb, who describes herself as a \"little fairy\".",
      "Appropriately enough, her self-penned song, Voyage is delicate as a fairy's wings,   fluttering with a soft-spoken plea to treat each other with kindness.",
      "Automatically qualifying for the final, it's a welcome oasis of calm amidst the steamy sauna sessions, moody goth haircuts and thrusting innuendo.",

    "summary": "Eurovision songwriters, judges and more discuss crafting the ideal anthem.",
    "story": [
      "The Eurovision Song Contest was watched by around 163 million people last year \u2013 meaning there are potentially 163 million different opinions on what makes a perfect entrant.",
      "Do you go for a soulful ballad, guaranteed to leave Europe misty-eyed and full of love and peace?",
      "Or do you opt for a cheesy extravaganza, complete with saucy takes on regional costumes and eye-popping staging that will have the entire continent (and Australia) raving in their living rooms?",
      "The perfect song",
      "Forensic musicologist at Boston's Berklee College of Music Joe Bennett has analysed hundreds of Eurovision finalists, identifying two dominant musical styles.",
      "One is the \"Euro-banger\" - high-energy, 120+ BPM songs with kick drums and synth-heavy production, like Sweden's winning entries Euphoria (Loreen, 2012) and Heroes (M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w, 2015).",
      "The other is the slow-burning ballad - typically around 70 BPM, such as Portugal's Amar Pelos Dois (Salvador Sobral, 2017) and the Netherlands' Arcade (Duncan Laurence, 2019).",
      "There is a clich\u00e9 that Eurovision songs are only about love and peace \u2013 reinforced by a song performed during the 2016 contest's interval about writing a perfect Eurovision song, called Love Love Peace Peace.",
      "According to Bennett, there is some validity to this, with every Eurovision song falling under six broad lyrical themes: \"love, unity, self-assertion, partying, history and songs about making music\".",
      "He adds that \"songs of self-assertion or lyrical self-empowerment do very well\" - as seen with Austria's 2014 winner Rise Like a Phoenix (Conchita Wurst).",
      "Keep staging simple and effective",
      "Acts might be tempted to go over the top on staging, but this may not be the way to secure victory, according to our experts.",
      "Songwriter Thomas Stengaard co-wrote Denmark's 2013 winner Only Teardrops (as well as this year's UK entry What the Hell Just Happened by Remember Monday). He puts his success down, in part, to its simple staging, which he says made it easy to remember.",
      "\"If you asked a kid to draw that staging, they could. It was a girl with no shoes on, two guys playing the drums and a flute guy. Very simple, but it worked.\"",
      "Vocal coach Carrie Grant, who led the UK's jury in 2014 and came sixth in the contest as part of Sweet Dreams in 1983, agrees.",
      "\"There is nothing worse than having an artist whose stage has lots of money but their performance doesn't warrant it,\" she says. \"It makes that performance seem worse.\"",
      "The 2014 winner (and Carrie's personal favourite) was Conchita Wurst \u2013 the first act to win the contest without backing singers or dancers on stage since 1970.",
      "What made Conchita stand out was that she was a bearded drag queen. Carrie believes Eurovision fans love things that are quirky and that \"embrace the LGBT community\".",
      "But she adds that Conchita wasn't a gimmick but instead \"a brilliant singer who could deliver what we call in vocal coaching 'money moments'\".",
      "The key is key",
      "Minor-key songs increasingly dominate Eurovision.",
      "Bennett debunks the idea that \"major equals happy, minor equals sad\", adding that \"minor keys are more a shorthand for emotional depth\".",
      "In 2023, 85% of finalists performed in minor keys, according to the Press Association. In the last 20 years, only two major-key songs have won - 2011's Running Scared (for Azerbaijan) and 2017's Amar Pelos Dois.",
      "Professor Elizabeth Hellmuth Margulis, a researcher in music cognition at Princeton, highlights source sensitivity \u2013 our instinct to associate a song's sound with its intended context. A few bars of a techno song, for example, and we have a mental image of a dark nightclub, and of the sort of DJ who might perform there.",
      "This means certain minor keys now immediately signal \"Eurovision-ness\" to audiences.",
      "Remember Monday's What the Hell Just Happened was written at a songwriting camp, with multiple songwriters working together at a countryside retreat to write the perfect song for this year's UK act.",
      "The song was intentionally written in a major key to stand out in a sea of minor-key songs - similar to the UK's 2022 second-place entry, Spaceman by Sam Ryder (B Major).",
      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 of this year\u2019s Eurovision songs",
      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 of this year\u2019s Eurovision songs",
      "Have a surprise up your sleeve",
      "Repetition is important to make a song stick in the mind, says Margulis. But songs should avoid being too repetitive. Margulis says that what particularly makes a song catchy is \"not only when they are heard repeatedly, but also when they throw in some kind of surprise twist\".",
      "Bucks Fizz's 1981 winner for the UK, Making Your Mind Up, is a classic example. First, the song changes key, quickly followed by a memorable costume change in which the female singers' skirts were ripped off to reveal shorter skirts \u2013 a joint visual and musical twist.",
      "Earlier Eurovision winners were often mocked for their nonsense lyrics, like Sweden's 1984 winner Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley, but Bennett argues this highlights Eurovision's strong focus on melody.",
      "\"Eurovision really needs big melodic hooks. You want people across Europe to be singing that melody. The need for a very accessible, catchy chorus is essential.\"",
      "Key changes have long been a way to introduce novelty into Eurovision songs. The 2000s saw multiple winners follow this formula, including Olsen Brothers' Fly on the Wings of Love for Norway (2000), and Serbia's Molitva in 2007.",
      "But as Bennett points out, though they are still present in around a fifth of finalists, no song with a final chorus key change has won since Molitva almost 20 years ago.",
      "Stengaard's song for this year's UK act Remember Monday is certainly full of surprises. BBC music correspondent Mark Savage said the song featured \"a dizzying array of key changes and tempo shifts\".",
      "The song is the songwriter's answer to the question he asks himself whenever he writes for Eurovision: \"How do you stand out in a contest where everyone wants to stand out?\"",

    "story": [
      "The Swiss city of Basel is going into party mode this weekend, as it prepares to welcome the Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "It's been 36 years since Switzerland last hosted the contest, after Celine Dion won in 1988, so the wait to roll out Eurovision's famous turquoise carpet has been long.",
      "Switzerland hosted the first ever Eurovision at Lugano in 1956, but its record since Dion's victory in Dublin has been mixed.",
      "Between 2007 and 2010, and again between 2015 and 2018, its entries failed to even qualify for the final. Swiss singer Nemo finally won last year with The Code.",
      "Perhaps because of that, Basel is determined to make this contest memorable for all the right reasons. At 1.3km (0.8 miles), its turquoise carpet will be Eurovision's longest ever, stretching from Basel town hall, across the river Rhine all the way to the Eurovision village.",
      "The head of Basel's government, Conradin Cramer, believes his city of just 175,000 residents is the natural home for Eurovision's estimated half a million visitors.",
      "Because of its borders with both France and Germany, Basel is \"the heart of Europe\", he says. What's more, he points out, the city has a long humanist tradition; when other cities in medieval Europe were cracking down on free thinkers, Basel welcomed them.",
      "So Basel, with its geographic location and its history of tolerance, and Eurovision with its tradition of inclusivity and diversity are, he says \"the perfect match\".",
      "How to win Eurovision, according to the experts",
      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 Eurovision songs",
      "Ireland asks Eurovision organisers for discussion over Israel",
      "Last year's contest in Malmo attracted thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators and further protests against the war in Gaza are expected in Basel too.",
      "Police have not yet released their plans to manage this, but have said that everyone should have the right to express their opinion, as long they stay within the law, and do not risk the safety of others.",
      "Throughout the contest they say 1,300 officers will be on duty. Basel has also unveiled a security operation to ensure visitors can enjoy the song contest safely. They are promising \"mobile awareness teams\", safe retreats for victims of violence or hostility and a 24-hour hotline. The concept, which Basel officials describe as unique, aims to prevent violence, sexual assault or harassment, and racist aggression and insults.",
      "The awareness teams, recognisable by their pink jackets, will be available 24 hours a day across the city. Basel's security director Stephanie Eymann said the teams were a \"low-threshold\" measure to give visitors a chance to report harassment or assaults, and seek protection, even if some might not want to approach the police.",
      "The entire town appears to have embraced the event, with turquoise welcome flags now waving from every lamp post. Tickets for the contest itself sold out in minutes, but Basel is promising that there will be \"something for everyone\", ticket or no ticket, and most of it will be free.",
      "\"There will be concerts all over the city, there will be art projects,\" says tourism director Letizia Elia. Basel has 40 museums and galleries in a space of just 37 square kilometres, a record for a European city, and they are all getting involved.",
      "An exhibition featuring works by Andy Warhol, Mark Rothko, Wassily Kandinsky, and Pablo Picasso has opened at the Beyeler Foundation, where Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone's We are Poems rainbow sculpture sits on the roof. There's also a Glitz and Glam exhibition at Basel's museum of natural history.",
      "The celebrations have spread across Switzerland, with competitions across the country for the best school band \u2013 the top four will get a spot on stage in Basel.",
      "But hosting an event like Eurovision is never hitch-free, and this one is no exception. The final choice of Basel as a venue was only made at the end of August last year, allowing just over seven months to organise everything.",
      "Then came objections from evangelical Christian groups, who claimed Eurovision undermined traditional family values and that performers regularly sang about satanism and the occult. They gathered enough signatures to force a referendum aimed at banning public money for the event.",
      "But on 24 November voters gave a huge yes to the song contest; with 66.6% approving Basel's budget of almost $40m. Conradin Cramer had expected a referendum, because \"that's how Switzerland works, it's perfectly fine.\" But he was still delighted at the size of the vote in favour: \"It shows this is a city where people really want to do this.\"",
      "He is very conscious that the global debate around diversity and inclusion has changed in the year since Swiss singer Nemo became the first non-binary person to win Eurovision.",
      "The overriding message of Basel, Mr Cramer says, is \"everyone is welcome\".",
      "On-stage and in the dressing rooms though, things are stricter. EBU, which runs the contest itself, has stuck to its rules saying performers can only bring their own national flags onstage or into the green rooms. This means that they will not be able to fly the Pride flag or that of any other gender identity or sexuality.",
      "Fans, however, will be able to bring whatever flags they like into the arena.",
      "Last year Swiss winner Nemo did wave a non-binary flag during the performance, but said they had to 'smuggle' the flag in. This year LGBTQ+ groups say they are disappointed the EBU has not relaxed the rules.",
      "\"Banning our symbols is a slap in the face for the LGBTIQ community', said Swiss group Pink Cross. \"It sends the wrong message at a time when queer communities across Europe are facing increasing hostility.\"",
      "EBU has said that the guidelines were designed to create clarity and balance explaining: \"Eurovision needs no flag to demonstrate its alliance and celebration of the LGBTQ+ community.\"",
      "Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump's administration is actively removing government support for diversity and inclusion measures, and he is asking partnered European institutions (including some Swiss universities) to do the same.",
      "That's why Basel, says Mr Cramer, should take a stand, even if the EBU will not.",
      "\"These are our European values. People and nations are coming together in a friendly championship. Whoever you are, if you are young, if you are not that young, if you are straight, if you are gay, if you are female, male, or if you are non-binary, this is all perfectly fine. And I think this is not just what Basel stands for, this is what Europe should stand for.\"",
      "So if everyone is welcome, how do they get there? The host country being Switzerland, punctual transport is catered for. Swiss railways is laying on hundreds of extra trains. In Basel, the trams will run 24 hours a day.",
      "And, for those who are really in Eurovision mode, there is even a karaoke tram, where passengers can take a free 90-minute journey right across town, all the while singing their hearts out."

    "summary": "GPs are deeply divided over assisted dying with personal beliefs shaping their views, BBC research reveals.",
    "story": [
      "Family doctors in England are deeply divided on the issue of assisted dying, BBC research on plans to legalise the practice suggests.",
      "The findings give a unique insight into how strongly many GPs feel about the proposed new law - and highlight how personal beliefs and experiences are shaping doctors' views on the issue.",
      "BBC News sent more than 5,000 GPs a questionnaire asking whether they agreed with changing the law to allow assisted dying for certain terminally ill people in England and Wales.",
      "More than 1,000 GPs replied, with about 500 telling us they were against an assisted dying law and about 400 saying they were in favour.",
      "Some of the 500 GPs who told us they were against the law change called the bill \"appalling\", \"highly dangerous\", and \"cruel\". \"We are doctors, not murderers,\" one said.",
      "Of the 400 who said they supported assisted dying, some described the bill as \"long overdue\" and \"a basic human right\".",
      "\"We are keeping human bodies alive in the most inhumane manner,\" one said. They asked: \"How do we ethically justify forcing these bodies to continue to exist in decrepitude?\"",
      "We cannot know whether the GPs who responded to the BBC are representative of all family doctors.",
      "How could assisted dying laws change across the UK?",
      "California man invites BBC to witness his death as MPs debate assisted dying",
      "'I could live 30 years but plan to die': How assisted dying law is dividing Canadians",
      "It comes as MPs will this week again debate proposed changes to the controversial bill, with a vote in parliament expected on whether to pass or block it next month.",
      "If assisted dying does become legal in England and Wales, it would be a historic change for society.",
      "Current laws prevent medics from helping any patient to carry out their wish to die. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow any doctor to be involved in assisted dying, but GPs are often a large part of the practice in other countries. On Tuesday, a separate bill to legalise assisted dying in Scotland passed an initial vote.",
      "The BBC's research, carried out over a few weeks in March and April, is the first in-depth look at how GPs in England feel about the proposed new law.",
      "Nine out of 10 GPs who said they were against legalising assisted dying worried terminally ill patients would consider it because they felt guilty about being a burden on their loved ones or the health service.",
      "\"The right to die becomes a duty to die for those who feel a burden on family,\" said one GP.",
      "Another common concern was patients might be coerced. Some told us they had treated elderly people with family members they suspected of being more focussed on their inheritance than their relatives.",
      "More than half of the group who opposed a law change said it would be against their religious beliefs.",
      "They spoke about life being \"sacred\" and called assisted dying \"sinful\". Some referred to the commandment \"thou shalt not kill\".",
      "Another argument from those who said they were against assisted dying was the health system should instead focus on improving end-of-life care.",
      "One GP said creating an assisted dying law was \"scandalous\" when hospices were largely funded by charities rather than by the state.",
      "Separately, on Tuesday the Royal College of Psychiatrists said that while the group \"remains neutral\" on the principle of assisted dying, it \"just cannot support this bill\".",
      "In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, the college's president Dr Lade Smith cited a lack of requirements concerning the \"unmet needs\" of patients, and a shortage of psychiatrists to process requests.",
      "\"We're concerned that there isn't a requirement to think about any unmet needs a person might have. A person with a terminal illness... they may be in pain, they have difficulty with their housing, their finances because they haven't been able to work, they might feel lonely, isolated,\" Dr Smith said.",
      "Dr Gordon Macdonald, CEO of Care Not Killing said there was a \"black hole\" in the hospice budget and \"we need better care not killing\".",
      "Dying with dignity",
      "More than 400 GPs told us they supported a law change, with some describing feeling \"traumatised\" and \"haunted\" by watching people die in \"severe pain or distress\".",
      "Of those who said they were in favour, more than nine in 10 respondents believed it could allow patients to have a dignified death.",
      "Some shared personal experiences: telling us about watching their parents losing dignity or begging to die. One said their sick wife prayed every evening to not wake up in the morning.",

    "story": [
      "If you ask these three doctors about being GPs, their answers are remarkably similar.",
      "\"It can be the best job in the world,\" one tells me. It's \"a privilege\" another says. They all talk about how they love getting to know their patients and their families.",

      "Here, three doctors - Abdul Farooq, Susi Caesar and Gurpreet Khaira, who all have a different view on assisted dying - tell us how they feel about the proposals.",
      "'A red line I would never cross'",
      "Dr Abdul Farooq is 28 and relatively new to his career as a GP.",
      "We meet at his home in east London. He gives his baby daughter a bottle of milk before heading around the corner to pray in his local mosque.",
      "His religion is absolutely key to his views on assisted dying.",
      "\"I believe in the sanctity of life. As a Muslim, I believe that life is a gift from God, and that no one has the right to take that away,\" he says.",
      "Dr Farooq feels taking your own life is wrong, and so, he says, it would be \"sinful\" for him to be involved in that process - even indirectly.",
      "If this law passed - and a patient came to him asking for help to die - he would refer them to another doctor.",
      "He says anything beyond that would be \"a red line I would never cross\".",
      "Dr Farooq's objections are also informed by his professional experience, particularly his time working in a hospital.",
      "He describes seeing \"undignified deaths\" - people passing away on busy wards - and says the health system is not getting the basics right in end-of-life care.",
      "\"There is so much we can do to make patients comfortable, if we have the right resources available,\" he tells me.",
      "\"We have a whole field of medicine called palliative medicine that is there to help people towards the end of their life. So why are we not throwing all our resources and money into that and actually making the process of death less scary?\"",
      "He's also concerned about specific parts of the proposed law. Doctors would have to assess if terminally ill patients are expected to die within six months before they are approved for an assisted death.",
      "Dr Farooq sees this as problematic. The final day or so is easy to predict, he says, but adds that some patients he's expected to die within six months can still be alive a year later.",
      "Is there anything that could change his mind on assisted dying?",
      "\"No,\" Dr Farooq says without hesitation. \"I'm strongly against it. Personally and professionally, I think it's the wrong thing to do for patients.\"",

      "She thinks Henning would be proud of her for talking to us about her views because he was a long-term believer in assisted dying.",
      "When he was diagnosed with a terminal illness, Dr Caesar says he became \"terribly scared about the manner of his dying\".",
      "\"My father was a very proud man, and the thing that was unbearable to him was the idea that he would lose control at the end of his life - of his bodily functions, of his mind, of his ability to be the person that he was.\"",
      "By the end, Dr Caesar says her father's \"medication never quite kept up with his symptoms.\" For her, the argument over assisted dying comes down to patient choice.",
      "\"Everybody is going to die. Every individual deserves the comfort of choice about how they die. I would want it for myself,\" she tells me.",
      "She acknowledges that many of her colleagues have \"very, very reasonable concerns\" about assisted dying. But she says \"we have the wisdom to set up systems that will work and get over some of these hurdles.\"",
      "I ask if Dr Caesar's support for assisted dying would translate into her working in this area.",
      "\"I will be at the front of the queue to help people to have the death that they wanted,\" she says. \"I think that's the core joy of my job - being with people to the very end of their health journey.\"",
      "'A very guilty place'",
      "Dr Gurpreet Khaira doesn't have any of the certainty of Dr Farooq and Dr Caesar.",

      "She says it felt very important for her to have a choice about the end of her life.",
      "Now, she's a picture of health, striding along a hillside with ease.",
      "As a GP with decades of experience, she worries that vulnerable patients might opt for assisted dying rather than be a burden to their loved ones. Or that some families might coerce vulnerable patients into it.",
      "\"That is one of my biggest areas of personal conflict. I know that there are lots of plans to put safeguards in.",
      "\"You can be the best doctor or advocate in the world, but you may not pick up where someone is being controlled or manipulated.\"",
      "For her, there's a fundamental conflict between her personal and professional experiences.",
      "But, she adds: \"As a doctor, I'd be very reluctant to be handing over a syringe for a patient to make that choice.\"",
      "Balancing up these two sides leaves her \"in a very guilty place\", she says, but adds that it's not a weakness to be open minded. For her, making this decision is an \"evolving process\".",
      "Personal experience shaping opinions",
      "It's striking when talking to Dr Farooq, Dr Caesar and Dr Khaira, how much their views on assisted dying reflect their core belief systems.",
      "In that respect, GPs are possibly much like the rest of us.",
      "If this bill does pass into law, doctors will have to consider whether they are willing to work in the area of assisted dying, or not. They could be asked to be involved in the process - whether that's holding preliminary discussions with patients who want to die, to prescribing a substance for someone to end their own life.",

      "The trial, named Partner, took place at 23 sites in England, Scotland and Wales. Before surgery, 39 women with early stage breast cancer were given olaparib, also known as Lynparza, together with chemotherapy.",

      "Care providers have said the government is taking away the \"lifeline\" of overseas recruitment without fixing the problems that make it difficult to recruit UK staff.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister, announced sweeping reforms to immigration on Monday, including plans to end the recruitment of care workers from overseas.",
      "Even with staff being brought in from other countries, official estimates show there were 131,000 vacancies in social care in England last year.",
      "Care companies said some services will struggle to survive without international recruits.",
      "\"The sector has been propping itself up with dwindling resources, rising costs, and mounting vacancies,\" said Prof Martin Green of Care England, which describes itself as the largest representative body for independent care providers.",
      "\"Taking (international recruitment) away now with no warning, no funding, and no alternative, is not just short-sighted - it's cruel,\" he said.",
      "Sir Keir said the visa changes were part of a drive \"to reduce immigration significantly\" and that the government wanted to create \"a migration system that is controlled, selective and fair\".",
      "The government said care providers could extend visas for existing staff and recruit migrants already in the UK who have yet to find a job. It also promised a new fair pay agreement for care staff and wanted companies to recruit and train more people from UK.",
      "However, Dr Jane Townson of the Homecare Association said the government was introducing the changes \"in a vacuum\" as a fair pay agreement is a long way off and there is \"no plan to deliver the care workers our country needs.\"",
      "Social care has been in crisis for years, with council funding of services squeezed, significant staff-shortages and growing demand from an ageing population. Plans for reform have been delayed time and again.",
      "While care workers were clapped along with health workers during the pandemic, that did not translate into an improvement in pay or status.",
      "About 1.7 million people work in social care in England, according to Skills for Care, the official body that monitors the workforce.

      "Post-Covid, some staff left care work because they felt burnt out while others who still loved the job felt they could not afford the increases in the cost of living.",
      "Between April 2021 and March 2022, social care vacancies reached a record high of 165,000, a 52% increase on the year before.",
      "By December 2021, the warnings of imminent collapse prompted Boris Johnson's Conservative government to make care work a shortage occupation, making it easier for companies to look overseas for staff.",
      "Recruits had to earn a minimum of \u00a320,480 a year to qualify for the visa, and they could bring family with them.",
      "There was a rapid rise in overseas recruitment \u2013 in 2022/23 80,000 people arrived in the UK to work in care and in 23/24, there were another 105,000 visas.",
      "Many care companies said bringing in those staff was the difference between providing services and collapsing. However, there was also abuse of this new route into the UK. For instance, some people were exploited, ending up paying middlemen thousands for travel and sponsorship certificates.",
      "The Home Office says 470 care companies have had their licence to recruit international staff revoked since 2022. It estimates that has led to about 40,000 staff being displaced. Companies say many will have already found alternative care work.",
      "In March 2024, Rishi Sunak's Conservative government tightened the visa requirements. This included saying recruits could no longer bring family with them. It has led to a significant fall in the number of care workers arriving from abroad.",
      "In the year up to December 2024, 9,500 visas were granted to people entering the UK to provide \"caring personal services\", according to the government.",
      "However, in the four years since staff shortages were most acute, relatively little has changed to encourage more UK people to work in care. There has been an ongoing government funded recruitment campaign and talk of the need to improve the pay and status of staff, but many workers fear solutions remain a long way off.",
      "The independent Casey Commission started work last month to draw up plans for adult social care. It has been described by ministers as a \"once in a generation opportunity to transcend party politics and build consensus on the future of the sector\". Its first update is due next year and its final report by 2028.",
      "At a time when the NHS is struggling, social care is more important than ever as it can keep vulnerable people out of hospital and support patients when they return home.",
      "Many care workers will say it is an incredibly rewarding job and with overseas recruitment being closed, the question is what needs to change to encourage more UK people to take on the role?"

      "At the point of his suspension in 2024, the MTPS said Dr Dixon's \"misconduct was so serious that action needed be taken to protect members of the public\".",
      "But, the tribunal considered that a longer period of suspension would be unduly punitive, especially taking into account the period that Dr Dixon had already been the subject of fitness to practise proceedings.",
      "As founder of the Pelvic Floor Society, he drew heavily on claims he had made in medical publications about the success rates of the rectopexy mesh surgery he pioneered.",

      "\"Many other surgeons who are writing articles will cite these articles and base their conclusions on these.",
      "\"Sometimes or often these papers are used when guidelines are formulated or referred to. So their conclusions can go on to influence many different things .\"",
      "The BBC has separately approached more than 40 former mesh patients of Dr Dixon via the Rectopexy Mesh Victims and Support group.",
      "None of them recognise the follow up form which he had claimed to have used in publications for up to five years post operative follow up.",
      "They include Debbie Cooper Jones, a dentist from Gloucester.",
      "She said: \"He seemed to have done quite a lot of research from the papers that were on his website.",

      "She said embarrassment about her symptoms as a teenager meant she had struggled to advocate for her condition to be taken seriously.",
      "Prof Julie Cornish, a leading pelvic health doctor, said many patients required surgery for pelvic health problems but that simpler solutions were possible when symptoms were spotted sooner.",
      "'I wouldn't poo if my husband was at home'",
      "Women 'scared to laugh or sneeze' due to incontinence",
      "Ms Nicklas, who works in north Wales, said before her surgery she was \"taking laxatives like they were smarties\" but \"still struggling to go to the toilet\".",
      "\"I was forever living in floaty dresses because of the bloating and even bought maternity jeans just to be comfortable,\" she said.",
      "\"If I was able to go [for a poo] it would only be as a result of irrigation or an enema. I'd come home from work and spend an hour on the toilet \u2013 I had no life, because I was always uncomfortable.\"",
      "She added: \"On one occasion I didn't go to the toilet for four weeks and was admitted to hospital.",
      "\"They said I was so full of poo, everything had just stopped working.\"",
      "Despite various tests and changes to her diet, no cause was ever found, but years of constipation had a long lasting impact on Ms Nicklas' pelvic organs \u2013 causing pain, vaginal bleeding and bloating.",
      "Ms Nicklas' large bowel was removed in 2022.",
      "As an adult, Ms Nicklas said she advocated for her symptoms to be taken seriously, but as a teenager she said embarrassment about bodily functions had made that more difficult.",
      "\"Looking back now, why is that such an embarrassing thing?",
      "\"Why is going to the toilet so embarrassing when it's just a normal function that everybody does?",
      "\"Would my constipation have been better if I hadn't have refused to go to the toilet unless I was at home and my brothers weren't around and no one could hear me? Because that's not healthy decision making,\" she added.",
      "\"As a result of the constipation and so many years of it my body's been affected.",
      "\"Your pelvic floor gets absolutely destroyed by the fact that you're constantly trying to go but you can't go.\"",
      "Prof Cornish, a colorectal surgeon, said pelvic health issues affected both men and women.",
      "\"It is a public health issue that actually we need to be giving information to people at an earlier stage \u2013 and it's not just women and girls, it's also boys and men because pelvic health issues affect everybody in different ways,\" she said.",
      "\"We're not just talking about gynaecological bits, we're talking about the bladder and bowel which can be impacted and that does have a bearing on things like pelvic organ prolapse.",
      "\"So if you are chronically constipated for many years you are far more likely to develop problems with a prolapse.\"",
      "The need for better understanding is part of the reason why Prof Cornish set up the Everywoman health festival in Cardiff, which is now in its third year.",
      "A thousand tickets will be given free to teenagers this year, with educational sessions planned on menstrual health, pelvic health and knowing basic body parts.",
      "Shakira Hassan, a specialist women's health physiotherapist, treats a wide range of conditions including pelvic pain, bladder, bowel and prolapse issues, where pelvic organs have lowered out of place.",
      "\"If you were to examine most women over 40, 50% of those women will actually have a pelvic organ prolapse, so it's about being able to educate and empower those women to be able to still lead a really normal and well life,\" she said.",
      "Ms Hassan said stigma was a huge factor, which could be worse in some cultures.",
      "\"We know that potentially one in three women will experience some urinary incontinence and potentially one in four women will experience some level of faecal incontinence throughout their life. That's huge numbers \u2013 it's really common.\"",
      "\"Education is key,\" said Prof Cornish.",
      "\"And the difficulty is that whilst there are some people who have that understanding or are able to access that education, you're essentially disenfranchising a large proportion of the population who may not be able to access it, and they may end up being the patients that I see more of.",
      "\"You see the inequalities that are out there.",
      "\"But all of this leads to a massive delay in treatment and usually an increase in the severity of symptoms and treatments needed.",
      "\"We all have a responsibility for our own health and that is going to be key \u2013 it's not just about off-loading it to the NHS, so I think the more we teach our children, that's going to empower them to take responsibility going forward.\"",

      "In the assisted dying bill making its way through Westminster, a terminally ill person is defined as someone who has less than six months to live.",
      "The Scottish bill, meanwhile, does not have a life expectancy timescale. It instead refers to an advanced and progressive disease that is expected to cause premature death.",
      "McArthur acknowledged concerns about the definition, but said he does not believe it should include life expectancy, citing advice from medical experts.",
      "MSPs will be able to further scrutinise the bill at stage two, where they can also propose changes.",

      "There are likely to be significant changes to Liam McArthur's current proposals before a final vote in the coming months.",

    "summary": "The PM knows cutting immigration is crucial to his credibility, political editor Chris Mason writes.",
    "story": [
      "It is perhaps little wonder immigration is as politically charged an issue as it is, when you consider two things.",
      "Firstly, as I wrote here, the numbers point to it being the stand-out UK social and demographic change of the 21st century.",
      "And secondly, it is also one of the biggest and most transparent political failings, when you compare rhetoric to reality.",
      "There were the projections made by Sir Tony Blair's government two decades ago that allowing unlimited migration from central and eastern Europe would tempt modest numbers of people to move here \u2013 and huge numbers turned up.",
      "In the 2010s, the Conservatives repeatedly promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands a year, and repeatedly failed.",
      "The numbers then rocketed after Brexit, the very act that meant UK governments were entirely responsible for immigration policy for the first time in a generation.",
      "Most people miss most political debates most of the time, but some are sufficiently totemic they are not just noticed but make the political weather.",
      "The arguments over immigration are one of them \u2013 and what I have just set out tells you why.",
      "This is the generational context within which this prime minister's promises perch.",
      "It is a longevity of failure that senior politicians of various political persuasions privately accept \u2013 perhaps more so than any other single issue \u2013 has seeded a cynicism and a disillusion with how we are governed.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer's language felt like an acknowledgement of that central point: here was a Labour prime minister, a former human rights lawyer, claiming \"we risk becoming an island of strangers.\"",
      "It is a phrase some, particularly on the left, regard as repulsive.",
      "Others counter that it is a widely held perception which it is high time those in high office shared.",

      "PM promises tougher visa rules to fix 'broken' migration system",

      "Labour wrestle with the many practical and political trade-offs around immigration policy, just as other parties in government have as well.",
      "In practical terms, staffing care homes, building new houses \u2013 can these things be done without an influx of folk from abroad?",
      "Interestingly, Sir Keir took issue with the long-standing view of many that immigration helps drive or at least prop up economic growth.",
      "The other context here is the insurgency of Reform UK.",
      "Nigel Farage argues, as he has for years and years, that politicians have been far too slow to get how much immigration matters to so many people.",
      "Labour are acutely aware of Farage's capacity to communicate in a way that resonates with those who feel successive governments have not just ignored them on this issue, but belittled and demeaned their views too.",
      "That is why the prime minister is using the language he is now.",
      "And there is another thing going on here too.",
      "This is a week of muscular language and intent, firstly primarily on legal migration now, and in a few days on illegal migration too.",
      "By next week the focus will switch to an anticipated new deal between the UK and the European Union, and within it, the likelihood of a youth mobility plan \u2013 meaning young people from the UK can travel more freely around Europe, and those from the EU can come here.",
      "Ministers will insist this doesn't amount to freedom of movement, nor immigration \u2013 because visits in both directions will be strictly age and time limited.",
      "But you can be certain there will be a row about it.",
      "These then are the short, medium and long-term reasons why the prime minister and his team know that their plan for delivering a sustained downward trend to the net migration numbers is absolutely crucial to their credibility.",

    "story": [
      "Care providers have said the government is taking away the \"lifeline\" of overseas recruitment without fixing the problems that make it difficult to recruit UK staff.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister, announced sweeping reforms to immigration on Monday, including plans to end the recruitment of care workers from overseas.",
      "Even with staff being brought in from other countries, official estimates show there were 131,000 vacancies in social care in England last year.",
      "Care companies said some services will struggle to survive without international recruits.",
      "\"The sector has been propping itself up with dwindling resources, rising costs, and mounting vacancies,\" said Prof Martin Green of Care England, which describes itself as the largest representative body for independent care providers.",
      "\"Taking (international recruitment) away now with no warning, no funding, and no alternative, is not just short-sighted - it's cruel,\" he said.",
      "Sir Keir said the visa changes were part of a drive \"to reduce immigration significantly\" and that the government wanted to create \"a migration system that is controlled, selective and fair\".",
      "The government said care providers could extend visas for existing staff and recruit migrants already in the UK who have yet to find a job. It also promised a new fair pay agreement for care staff and wanted companies to recruit and train more people from UK.",
      "However, Dr Jane Townson of the Homecare Association said the government was introducing the changes \"in a vacuum\" as a fair pay agreement is a long way off and there is \"no plan to deliver the care workers our country needs.\"",
      "Social care has been in crisis for years, with council funding of services squeezed, significant staff-shortages and growing demand from an ageing population. Plans for reform have been delayed time and again.",
      "While care workers were clapped along with health workers during the pandemic, that did not translate into an improvement in pay or status.",
      "About 1.7 million people work in social care in England, according to Skills for Care, the official body that monitors the workforce. It is often a minimum or just above minimum wage job, with little recognition of the increasing responsibility and complexity of the support staff provide to older and disabled people.",

      "How many people come to work and study in the UK?",
      "Putting it bluntly, if someone can earn more working, for instance, in a supermarket for fewer, less strenuous hours, then that is the option many will chose.",
      "Post-Covid, some staff left care work because they felt burnt out while others who still loved the job felt they could not afford the increases in the cost of living.",
      "Between April 2021 and March 2022, social care vacancies reached a record high of 165,000, a 52% increase on the year before.",
      "By December 2021, the warnings of imminent collapse prompted Boris Johnson's Conservative government to make care work a shortage occupation, making it easier for companies to look overseas for staff.",
      "Recruits had to earn a minimum of \u00a320,480 a year to qualify for the visa, and they could bring family with them.",
      "There was a rapid rise in overseas recruitment \u2013 in 2022/23 80,000 people arrived in the UK to work in care and in 23/24, there were another 105,000 visas.",
      "Many care companies said bringing in those staff was the difference between providing services and collapsing. However, there was also abuse of this new route into the UK. For instance, some people were exploited, ending up paying middlemen thousands for travel and sponsorship certificates.",
      "The Home Office says 470 care companies have had their licence to recruit international staff revoked since 2022. It estimates that has led to about 40,000 staff being displaced. Companies say many will have already found alternative care work.",
      "In March 2024, Rishi Sunak's Conservative government tightened the visa requirements. This included saying recruits could no longer bring family with them. It has led to a significant fall in the number of care workers arriving from abroad.",
      "In the year up to December 2024, 9,500 visas were granted to people entering the UK to provide \"caring personal services\", according to the government.",
      "However, in the four years since staff shortages were most acute, relatively little has changed to encourage more UK people to work in care. There has been an ongoing government funded recruitment campaign and talk of the need to improve the pay and status of staff, but many workers fear solutions remain a long way off.",
      "The independent Casey Commission started work last month to draw up plans for adult social care. It has been described by ministers as a \"once in a generation opportunity to transcend party politics and build consensus on the future of the sector\". Its first update is due next year and its final report by 2028.",
      "At a time when the NHS is struggling, social care is more important than ever as it can keep vulnerable people out of hospital and support patients when they return home.",
      "Many care workers will say it is an incredibly rewarding job and with overseas recruitment being closed, the question is what needs to change to encourage more UK people to take on the role?"

    "summary": "Troop numbers are down, morale is weak and some equipment is in a poor state - will the government's Strategic Defence Review be enough to turn that around?",
    "story": [
      "On a March day this year, a British nuclear-armed submarine quietly returned to its base on the west coast of Scotland after a record-breaking 204 days underwater. HMS Vanguard had 130 crew members on board. They had spent nearly seven months without fresh air or daylight, and with little communication.",
      "Patrols of the UK's nuclear-armed submarines are supposed to last no longer than three months. But the last eight patrols have all exceeded five months, as the navy's ageing fleet of submarines requires ever more time in maintenance. It means the submariners on board are spending longer and longer underwater.",
      "A submariner who was on board one of those long patrols described to me a worrying situation in which the crew ran low on food and medicines. Towards the end of the patrol he described how hungry crew members rummaged for tins of food in hidden compartments inside the submarine. He said they even had to make bread out of custard powder, because they'd run out of flour.",
      "The navy has long found it difficult to recruit sailors into its Submarine Service, often known as the \"Silent Service\".",
      "But the case of the 204-day patrol by HMS Vanguard raises a wider issue.",
      "Virtually everyone agrees that Britain's armed forces are depleted. Troop numbers are down, morale is weak, and some ageing equipment is in a poor state. And all this comes at a time of greater geopolitical uncertainty, as the threat from Russia looms large across Europe.",
      "Within the next few months, the government will publish its long-awaited Strategic Defence Review - a consultation launched by Sir Keir Starmer shortly after he arrived in Downing Street last summer, designed to identify threats to Britain and recommend how the armed forces can meet them. But there are already doubts over how much it can realistically achieve.",
      "So, as the world becomes more dangerous, what can the government do to reverse the decline - and restore the UK to military readiness?",
      "Dwindling troop numbers",
      "Politicians from all sides, along with military chiefs, admit Britain's armed forces have been \"hollowed out\". It's true for the Royal Navy and the RAF - and perhaps most acutely, in the British army.",
      "In 2010 the regular Army was nearly 110,000 strong. Now, it is struggling to meet its target of 73,000 soldiers - not enough to fill Cardiff's Principality Stadium.",
      "Earlier this year defence minister and former Royal Marine, Al Carns, told a conference at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank, that the entire British Army could be \"expended\" within six to 12 months if it fought a war on a similar scale to the Ukraine conflict.",
      "Last summer the head of the army, General Sir Roly Walker, said the Army needed to be ready to fight a war by 2027 - an admission it isn't ready to fight one in its current state. He said the Army needs to leverage technology, such as drones, new software, and artificial intelligence.",
      "But Justin Crump, an Army Reserve Officer who heads the risk and intelligence company Sibylline, argues that boosts to technology won't make up for the lack of military hardware.  \"We have big gaps and they're not going to get filled overnight,\" he says.",
      "The government is also promising to streamline the bureaucratic process of ordering new kit - trying to learn the painful lessons of past mistakes. By the time they eventually arrive, the delivery of hundreds of new Ajax armoured vehicles will have taken more than a decade.",
      "Weaknesses in its Nato commitments",
      "Speak to any government minister about security, they'll no doubt talk about Nato. It's the cornerstone of the UK's security, the government says, and one that has only become more important since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "According to its Nato commitments, the UK is supposed to be able to field tens of thousands of troops at short notice to defend any Nato territory \u2013 with a war-fighting division made up of tanks, artillery, and heavy armour.",
      "But a former senior General told the BBC that in a real war it would run out of ammunition, spares and supplies within weeks or even days. Nor does Britain have much in terms of ground-based air defences \u2013 not enough to protect key military bases in the UK, yet alone its towns and cities.",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Russia's next move? The countries trying to Putin-proof themselves",
      "Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground",
      "The weaknesses in Britain's contribution to Nato became starkly apparent in February this year, when a group of British MPs visited a Nato military site in Tapa, Estonia, where British soldiers are deployed (alongside Danish and French troops). The point of the base is to deter or slow down an invasion from Russia - which is just 80 miles away over a land border.",
      "Mike Martin, a Liberal Democrat MP and former British Army Officer, said the Estonia visit was like going back in time, seeing the same equipment as when he first joined the Army as a reservist in 2004: ageing Challenger 2 tanks and Warrior armoured vehicles. What one former General described to me  as \"legacy kit from the 1980's\" - old and dwindling in numbers.",
      "About 1,000 British troops are stationed at the site. At the time of the MPs' visit they were armed with some drones - though not many. Nor did they have much in the way of systems to block or jam enemy drones, either. They also have a handful of long-range artillery guns - important for land warfare. The British Army currently has a total of just 14. Even tiny Estonia has double that number.",
      "Defence sources say that since the MPs' visit, the Army has now begun to test some of the new technology it wants to introduce. They say it \"will help soldiers see further, and strike faster\".",
      "Talk of thousands of British troops being sent to Ukraine for a lengthy deployment, if there were to be a ceasefire in its war with Russia, would present another huge challenge.",
      "In the recent past the British army has just about managed to sustain a prolonged military campaign. But in Afghanistan, between 2006 and 2014, it was only fighting lightly armed Taliban insurgents. Even then it was stretched - with nine thousand troops being constantly rotated every six months.",
      "Crump says \"Afghanistan was painful enough, and we had 20,000 more people\". While he says  providing a reassurance force for Ukraine \"might be doable \u2013 it would rapidly wear us down\".",
      "Questions over the price tag",
      "The government says it is addressing these challenges with its Strategic Defence Review. John Healey, the Defence Secretary, claims it will lead to the \"biggest shake up of UK defence for over 50 years\".",
      "But past reviews have rarely lived up to expectation \u2013 not least because the money available rarely matches ambitions. Most reviews are quickly overtaken by events. Harold Wilson's defence review of 1966 was overtaken just three years later by a crisis in Northern Ireland; whilst Tony Blair's review of 1998 came just three years before 9/11.",
      "Indeed, when work on this review began, the US - under President Joe Biden - was still the UK's closest and most reliable military partner. Now that's less clear.",
      "There are also questions over the price tag. The review's terms of reference assumes that defence spending will be capped at 2.5% of the UK's national income, or Gross Domestic Product (GDP). But few in defence believe that'll be enough.",
      "One of the independent experts leading the review, General Sir Richard Barrons, has already said the UK should be spending at least 3% of GDP on its armed forces. Meanwhile, Nato's Secretary General, Mark Rutte, is pressing allies to increase defence spending to \"north of 3%\". President Donald Trump has gone even higher, urging Nato countries to spend 5%.",
      "The government's \"ambition\" is to boost spending to 3% at some time in the next parliament - which will have the added bonus of boosting growth, ministers say. Just last week Sir Keir said that extra investment will create a \"defence dividend\" for jobs and prosperity.",
      "Others think the review is too narrow in focus. A former military chief told the BBC that a review should first identify threats to the UK, and then work out how to shape the Armed Forces. It was \"bonkers\", they added, to conduct a defence review without it being \"nested\" in a broader cross-government security review.",
      "An MoD spokesperson said that boosts to defence spending \"will make Britain stronger and safer in an insecure world and will help us build a modern and resilient Armed Forces, with cutting-edge capabilities\".",
      "The defence review, they added, is \"wide-ranging and working at pace, looking hard at the threats we face and all the capabilities we need to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century\".",
      "Low morale and cases of harassment",
      "Attempts to broaden the Army's appeal - including high-profile recruitment campaigns targeting the so-called \"snowflake\" generation - have not been enough to reverse the decline. Nor have a series of slick television adverts called \"Belonging\", which aim to highlight the camaraderie of life in the forces.",
      "Last year, the UK's armed forces were losing 300 more full-time personnel each month than they'd been recruiting.",
      "In a MoD survey last year nearly six in ten military personnel rated morale as low. Just four in 10 said they were satisfied with service life \u2013 the lowest since records began.",
      "This government is trying to boost morale by improving military accommodation, plus last year's pay rise of 6% for armed forces personnel was the largest in two decades.",
      "Part of the problem is a broader cultural one: fewer people have an emotional connection with the armed forces, Crump says. The average Briton is now more likely to know someone in jail than serving in the military, he adds.",
      "Last year, the Army apologised to Kerry-Ann Knight, a black female soldier who fronted Army recruitment campaigns, after she described years of racist abuse and bullying that made her life while serving a \"living hell\".",
      "High profile stories of bullying and sexual harassment within the military can't have helped - particularly for women and minorities.",
      "The MoD has set a recruiting goal of 30% women by 2030, but they currently make up less than 12% of the regular armed forces - a figure which has hardly shifted in a decade.",
      "Britain is not alone in struggling to fill its ranks. It's a problem experienced by many western nations relying on volunteers. Some governments have now introduced some form of conscription. In March, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced a plan to make all Polish men undergo compulsory military training.",
      "But there appears to be little appetite for conscription among the British public. A YouGov poll in September 2023 found that just 28% of the British public would support a one year military service. Younger people were particularly opposed.",
      "The government wants to get people interested from a young age, by expanding cadet forces in secondary schools. The MoD is also trying to keep better records of those troops who have left, and who could be recalled in a crisis.",
      "An MoD spokesperson said: \"We are committed to fixing Armed Forces recruitment and have already given personnel the largest pay rise in decades, scrapped 100 outdated recruitment policies, and passed legislation through the Commons to introduce a new Armed Forces Commissioner to improve service life.\"",
      "AI on the battlefield?",
      "Whatever comes out of the defence review, there is no expectation that troop numbers will increase in the near future.",
      "Analysts are, however, looking at radical solutions - including the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the battlefield. The most obvious example is AI-enabled drones, which are already being used in Ukraine to identify targets on their own, to deadly effect. But some also envisage a future in which machines could collect data on adversaries.",
      "A large land war in Europe is now focusing minds. Senior British military officers, as well as politicians, have repeatedly stated the UK 's armed forces must be ready to fight. But there still appears to be a temptation to use their power and influence much further away from home.",
      "Last month, HMS Prince of Wales - one of the Navy's two aircraft carriers \u2013 left Portsmouth on an eight-month voyage to the other side of the world. It's the biggest UK defence endeavour this year, involving nearly 4,000 personnel, along with the support of allies, sailing to the Pacific and back.",
      "Healey says it will demonstrate the UK's ability to deploy a major military force around the world, while at the same time promoting British trade.",
      "Emma Salisbury, a fellow at the Council on Geostrategy, a think tank, says the carrier's Pacific deployment holds a powerful symbolic importance. \"It's a message not just of deterrence against Russia, but also against China,\" she says. \"In the world as it is now, we can't look at things geographically. Everything is interconnected. It's linking together our alliances and partnerships on a global scale.\"",
      "But the deployment also highlights the challenges of trying to do more with less. Britain can only afford to have an episodic appearance in the Indo-Pacific. And the Trump administration has warned UK and other European allies to focus on their own doorstep, rather than faraway adventures. The carrier deployment is another strain on finite resources.",
      "Of course, ministers maintain that their soon-to-be published defence review really could reset the dial and restore the UK to military readiness. But so far no government has really been willing to tackle the greatest dilemma for UK defence: do less or spend a lot more.",

      "The government's efforts to fix the prison crisis may not work without \"bold investment decisions\", the leading union for the probation service has said.",
      "Ian Lawrence, general secretary of Napo, said a review of sentencing policy by former Conservative Justice Secretary David Gauke \"may come to little effect\" if the probation service was underfunded.",
      "The union boss said he supported proposals to scrap short sentences for some offenders and toughen up community orders supervised by probation officers.",
      "But he said probation staff were already \"overworked\" and suggested any \"cost cutting\" could increase pressure on the service.",
      "\"I'm struggling to see how a package of sentencing reform can work without the necessary support,\"  Lawrence told the BBC.",
      "A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said a \"crisis\" in the justice system had \"put a huge strain on the probation service\".",
      "\"We are hiring 1,300 new probation officers, investing in technology to cut back on admin, and increasing focus on those offenders who pose the greatest risk to the public,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "\"This will ease pressure on the service, help cut reoffending and keep our streets safe.\"",
      "Gauke is understood to be considering recommending the idea of scrapping short prison terms as part of the sentencing review.",
      "The review comes as prisons across the country are struggling to deal with overcrowding after the number of offenders behind bars hit a new high.",
      "In an interim report, Gauke warned that unless radical changes were made, prisons in England and Wales could run out of cells by early next year.",
      "Gauke's sentencing review is expected to be published this month, before the government sets out its spending plans for departments in June.",
      "\"Napo would welcome any initiatives to reduce the numbers of people in our prison estate,\" Lawrence said.",

      "But the chancellor has not yet stated which departments will have less money to spend, meaning it's not clear how the probation service will be affected.",
      "The money allocated to government departments for the three years beyond 2025-26 will be set out in the spending review in June.",
      "Lawrence said a reduction in funding for the Ministry of Justice, which oversees the probation service, could mean less funding to support offenders in the community and worse outcomes.",
      "\"In other words, they go out of prison and they've got no option but to commit crime because they have no means of supporting themselves,\" he said.",
      "\"They're back in prison within weeks. And so it goes on and that costs the taxpayer millions.\"",
      "A source at the Prison Reform Trust, a charity, said the probation service would need to be resourced properly if there was more community sentencing.",

      "Pay dispute",
      "In a national inspection report, the probation watchdog said there was a high shortfall of officers in some regions and workloads were a problem.",
      "Lawrence said Napo was in dispute with the prison and probation service over pay progression and workloads.",
      "He said the union had submitted a claim for a 12% pay rise for probation staff this year.",
      "That's way above the increases independent pay review bodies have advised the government to give teachers (4%) and NHS workers (3%).",

      "\"We think senior leaders in [the service] have a responsibility to let ministers know the gravity of the situation,\" he said.",

      "The announcement offers relief for key UK industries from some of the new tariffs President Donald Trump has announced since his return to the White House in January.",
      "But it will leave a 10% duty in place on most goods from the UK.",
      "Though hailed by the leaders of the two countries as significant, analysts said it did not appear to meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries, as they stood before the changes introduced by Trump this year.",
      "No formal deal was signed on Thursday and the announcements from both governments were light on details.",
      "Speaking from a Jaguar Land Rover factory in the West Midlands, Sir Keir Starmer described the agreement as a \"fantastic platform\".",
      "\"This historic deal delivers for British business and British workers protecting thousands of British jobs in key sectors including car manufacturing and steel,\" he said, adding that the \"the UK has no greater ally than the United States\".",
      "At the White House, Trump called it a \"great deal\" and pushed back against criticism that he was overstating its importance.",
      "\"This is a maxed out deal that we're going to make bigger,\" he said.",
      "What is in the UK-US tariff deal?",
      "US agreement leaves the UK open to do a much more significant EU deal",
      "What's in the deal?",
      "The two sides said the US had agreed to reduce the import tax on cars - which Trump had raised by 25% last month - to 10% for 100,000 cars a year.",
      "That will help luxury carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover and Rolls Royce, but could limit growth in the years ahead, as it amounts to roughly what the UK exported last year.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK was days away from losing thousands of jobs at carmakers facing US tariffs.",
      "\"This was very serious,\" he said. \"It would have meant people would have lost their jobs without this breakthrough.\"",
      "Tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump raised earlier this year to 25%, have also been slashed, according to the Prime Minister's Office. The US said instead it would establish a quota, as had existed previously.",
      "The two countries also each agreed to allow the import of up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef from the other country, according to documents released by the US Trade Representative.",
      "The US said the change would significantly expand its sales of beef to the UK, which had previously faced 20% duties and were capped at 1,000 metric tonnes.",
      "Overall, the US said the deal would create a $5bn (\u00a33.8bn) \"opportunity\" for exports, including $700m in ethanol and $250m in other agricultural products.",
      "\"It can't be understated how important this deal is,\" US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said.",
      "What's the reaction?",
      "UK Steel director General Gareth Stace welcomed the agreement, saying it would offer \"major relief\" to the steel sector.",
      "\"The UK government's cool-headed approach and perseverance in negotiating with the US clearly paid off,\" he said.",
      "Other business groups expressed more uncertainty.",
      "\"It's better\u00a0than yesterday but it's definitely not better than five weeks ago,\" said Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, which represents firms in the two countries and supports free trade.",
      "\"I'm trying to be excited but I'm struggling a bit.\"",
      "While Labour MPs praised the deal, opposition parties asked for more detail and scrutiny in Parliament.",
      "Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the deal, saying it amounted to tariffs being lowered by the UK, while being hiked in the US.",
      "\"This is not a historic deal with the US,\" she said. \"We've been shafted.\"",
      "The Liberal Democrats demanded a vote on the deal in Parliament, saying it would show \"complete disrespect to the public\" if MPs were denied a say.",
      "Sir Ed Davey said: \"When it comes to any trade deal - and especially one with someone as unreliable as Donald Trump - the devil will be in the detail.",
      "\"One thing is clear, Trump's trade tariffs are still hitting key British industries, threatening the livelihoods of people across the UK.\"",
      "Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage said the deal was a \"step in the right direction\".",
      "He told the BBC there was more detail to come but in the round it was a welcome development.",
      "\"The important point is that we are doing stuff, we are making a move,\" he said. \"It's a Brexit benefit we were able to do this.\"",
      "Win for US ranchers?",
      "The US and UK have been discussing a trade deal since Trump's first term. They came close to signing a mini-agreement at that time.",
      "But the US has long pushed for changes to benefit its farmers and pharmaceutical issues, which had been non-starters politically for the UK.",
      "It was not clear how much those issues had advanced.",
      "The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said the agreement in-principle had delivered a \"tremendous win\" for American ranchers but the US Meat Export Federation, which tracks trade barriers for farmers in the US, said it was still trying to pin down information about the changes.",
      "The UK said there would be no weakening in food standards for imports.",
      "While the UK appears to have made some commitments, \"the devil will be in the details,\" said Michael Pearce, deputy chief economist at Oxford Economics, which said it was making no change to its economic forecasts as a result of the announcement.",
      "Other issues loom.",
      "Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to tax imports of pharmaceuticals, in a bid to ensure the US has a strong manufacturing base for critical medicines.",
      "The UK said the US had agreed to give British firms \"preferential treatment\".",
      "But Ewan Townsend, a lawyer at Arnold & Porter, who works with health care firms, said the industry was now \"left waiting to see exactly what this preferential treatment will mean\"."

    "story": [
      "A Labour MP has raised fresh concerns over the government's failure to properly monitor whether migrants leave the UK after their visas expire.",
      "The UK does not record all individuals leaving the country through border checks,  relying instead on matching flight, sea, and rail  passenger data with visa records.",
      "The government has promised to set out plans to crack down on record-high levels of migration in the next few weeks.",
      "But former Blair-era minister Clive Betts warned the border system \"continue to fail\" without proper exits checks leaving a risk of people staying illegally and working in \"the black economy\".",
      "How many people come to work and study in the UK?",
      "Has the government really 'returned' 24,000 people?",
      "Net migration - the number of people coming to the UK, minus the number leaving - hit a record 906,000 in the year to June 2023, and then fell to 728,000 in the year to June 2024.",
      "But the Office of National Statistics (ONS) has admitted the figures are not completely accurate and are instead an \"experimental\" statistic - which has previously led to the systematic underestimating of EU migrants and overestimating of others.",
      "New rules introduced by former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a bid to reduce migration levels are thought to have contributed to the latest fall in numbers.",
      "Since April 2024, those apply for a visa have needed a job offer with a salary at least \u00a338,700 - an increase of nearly 50% from the previous \u00a326,200 minimum.",
      "The threshold does not apply to some jobs - such as in health and social care, and teachers on national pay scales.",
      "During an evidence session of the Public Accounts Committee, Marc Owen, the director for visa status said his team \"were not tracking every single individual\" working in the UK.",
      "Pressed by Betts at the committee, Mr Owen said the government \"can only know\" if someone has left the country by matching airline passenger data with visa records.",
      "Instead of tracking exits, the Home Office relies on employers carrying out visa checks and enforcement squads to catch those overstaying their visas.",
      "\"We use our immigration enforcement services to visit illegal working places on the basis of intelligence and to collect people and to return them as they can,\" he said.",
      "Home Office Permanent Secretary Dame Antonia Romeo said overstaying is \"a problem\" the department is now \"fixing,\" with support from HMRC and local councils.",
      "\"We're not saying it's been solved,\" she said. \"We are identifying the issues and putting in place fixes.\"",
      "The Home Office were also working to modernise border security and boost digital checks, Mr Owen said.",
      "Currently the Home Office do not know who is \"here or not, that is the reality\", Betts said.",
      "Visa holders who have not \"gone through your systems they just disappear and they're in the black economy,\" he warned.",
      "Betts told the BBC the lack of exit checks were the symptom of a \"general failure of the border system over several governments\" leading to a splintered fight against abuse of the system.",
      "Betts urged the government to make visa checks the backbone of its new immigration plan, expected imminently.",
      "Full details of government's immigration plans are due to be published in a new immigration white paper later in May.",
      "A Home Office spokesperson has previously said: \"Under our plan for change, our upcoming Immigration White Paper will set out a comprehensive plan to restore order to our broken immigration system.\"",

      "\"Carla has done so much to prove we can take our values to the wider audience needed to win - and to give us the credible, Parliament-based leadership we need to win even bigger,\" he said.",

      "The Greens have also faced challenges balancing their coalition of voters, which now encompasses cities like Bristol as well as more rural areas like Ramsay's seat.",
      "Ramsay has been vocal in his opposition to new pylons in his constituency, which some have seen as in conflict with the party's support for renewable energy.",
      "Polanski praised Denyer as \"a brilliant leader\", who \"cut through in 2024\".",

      "Home working appears to have led to a bigger decline in after-work drinking in city centres outside London, a Lords committee has heard.",
      "Urban economist Paul Swinney told peers that pub spending data suggested that in the capital, post-work drinks have switched from Friday to Thursday.",
      "But a similar shift could not be seen in other large British cities, he added, where spending in bars was more likely to shift into the weekend.",
      "He also added that a decline in city-centre spending had not been matched by a similar increase for high streets outside urban centres.",
      "Could Thursday be 'the new Friday' for Londoners?",
      "Homeworkers get 24 more minutes of sleep a day",
      "Mr Swinney, director of the Centre for Cities think tank, was among various experts giving evidence to a special House of Lords committee set up earlier this year to examine the impact of remote and hybrid working in the UK.",
      "Last month, the think tank published research on the pre and post-pandemic spending patterns of city-centre workers in pubs and bars around their places of work, by comparing credit and debit card data from 2019 and 2024.",
      "The analysis showed that during that period, the share of weekly spending in pubs in central London on Fridays fell, whilst on Thursdays it rose, making it the most most popular night of the week.",
      "But a similar pattern was not seen in the data for nine other large British cities, including Glasgow, Liverpool, Bristol, Newcastle and Sheffield.",
      "Surveys have shown Friday has become the most popular day for office workers to work from home, with attendance during the middle of the week returning to more similar levels to before the Covid pandemic.",
      "'Shift to weekend'",
      "Explaining the spending data to peers on Thursday, Mr Swinney said that in London \"the Friday night drink hasn't so much gone away, it's just shifted to a Thursday\".",
      "\"But when we looked at other large cities, that wasn't the case,\" he added.",
      "\"It appeared from the data that we have that the post-work drink has reduced in those other places.",
      "\"Actually the shift seems to go into the weekend, which seems to be workers coming in from a leisure perspective, rather than going out after work\".",
      "The data analysed by the Centre for Cities showed that 32% of weekly pub spending in big cities outside London now takes place on a Saturday, suggesting workers are more likely to return on weekends to socialise than in the capital.",
      "Supermarket spending",
      "Elsewhere in the session, Mr Swinney said a decline in city-centre spending since the rise in remote and hybrid working had not been matched by an equivalent rise in spending on \"local High Streets\".",
      "\"That might have happened a little bit, but certainly not to the extent that people were suggesting [during the pandemic],\" he told the committee.",
      "He added that suburban supermarkets had \"probably been the biggest winner\" from the shift in spending patterns since Covid.",
      "He said more flexible working patterns had led to some immediate benefits for workers, including reduced travel cost and more flexibility.",
      "But he added it could be \"two, three, ten years down the line\" before the long-term impact on economic productivity could be properly assessed.",

      "\"I'm worried that some of the vulnerable in our society might feel that they are a burden and that they may therefore opt or feel under pressure to end their life prematurely.\"",

      "The prime minister said measures in the white paper, a blueprint for future laws, would make the system \"controlled, selective and fair\".",
      "Here is a summary of the key measures.",
      "Work visas tightened - for some",
      "Overseas workers will now generally need a degree-level qualification to apply for the main skilled worker visa, instead of the equivalent of A-level, reversing a change made under Boris Johnson's government.",
      "This higher threshold will not apply to those already in the UK renewing their visa - but ministers say it will prevent new visa applications for around 180 jobs, reducing immigration by around 39,000 a year by 2029.",

      "At the same time, the government wants to expand eligibility for its dedicated work visa for graduates of elite universities outside the UK.",
      "It says a \"targeted and capped\" expansion of the scheme could see the number of qualifying institutions double, from around 40 currently.",
      "The visa for international students who plan to set up a business in the UK will also be reviewed, and ministers say they want to make it easier for \"top scientific and design talent\" to apply for the global talent visa.",
      "Longer residency waits",
      "Immigrants will typically have to live in the UK for 10 years before applying for the right to stay indefinitely \u2013 double the current five-year period.",
      "Under the plans, this period could be reduced through a new \"earned settlement\" system, under which people would be awarded points to reflect their contribution to the UK \"economy and society\".",
      "It is not yet clear when this longer qualifying period will kick in - details of the new system, along with a similar scheme that will apply to applications for citizenship, will be consulted on later this year.",

      "Care visa scrapped",
      "A dedicated visa for social care workers introduced during the Covid pandemic will close to new applicants next month.",
      "Ministers say the visa, which was tightened last year, was a key driver of increased immigration in the years after Brexit, and better pay in the sector can solve longstanding recruitment problems.",
      "Visa extensions will be permitted until 2028, and those who already have working rights will be able to switch sponsor during the term of their visa.",
      "Stricter student rules",
      "Overseas graduates will only be able to stay in the UK for 18 months after their studies, instead of two years currently.",
      "Ministers are also thinking of charging English universities a new 6% tax on tuition fee income from international students, which they are promising to reinvest into the higher education and skills system.",

      "Refugee pilot extended",
      "A \"limited pool\" of people who lack refugee status in the UK but have been recognised as refugees by the United Nations will be allowed to use existing sponsored worker routes to come to the UK to work.",
      "Ministers say this will build on a three-year EU-sponsored pilot project that saw around 100 skilled refugees and their families allowed to work in specified sectors such as IT, construction and engineering.",
      "Tougher English tests",
      "Language requirements for all work visas will increase, whilst adult dependents of visa-holders will be required to demonstrate a basic understanding of English to come on a spousal and partner route.",

      "Skills and training",

    "story": [
      "When it comes to reducing UK immigration, there have been plenty of promises and targets from successive governments over the last 15 years, but the numbers remain high.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer is now pledging to \"take back control of our borders\", promising tighter rules to bring down the numbers \"significantly\".",
      "BBC Verify examines the measures set out by the government and the challenges ahead.",
      "What's happened to the numbers?",
      "Migration levels have hit \"unprecedented levels\" in recent years, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "Net migration to the UK - total permanent arrivals minus total permanent departures - reached a record 906,000 in the year ending in June 2023 and then fell to 728,000 in the year ending in June 2024.",
      "The continued high levels persist, despite previous government efforts to bring the numbers down. For example, in 2010 the Conservatives pledged to reduce net migration to the \"tens of thousands\".",
      "Annual net migration is expected to come down to about 315,000 by the end of the Parliament.",
      "That's according to the central forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent body that scrutinises the public finances.",
      "That estimate, however, would still be higher than most years in the past decade.",
      "What's been driving immigration?",
      "The vast majority of migrants come to the UK for study or work.",
      "And many of the work visas have been for people coming to do jobs in health and social care.",
      "However, applications for health and social care visas have come down sharply in the past two years after the rules were tightened by the last Conservative government and this decline will ultimately feed into the official net migration statistics in the coming years.",
      "Does immigration help economic growth?",
      "There's been much discussion about the link between immigration and economic growth.",
      "The White Paper - which sets out the government's plan - says the UK economy needs to wean itself off a reliance on cheap overseas labour.",
      "While taking questions from journalists, the prime minister claimed the idea immigration leads to higher economic growth \"doesn't hold\".",
      "Economists do not agree about the exact impact that simply adding more people to an economy has on growth and prosperity.",
      "New arrivals might increase the country's overall level of economic activity - measured by GDP. But on a per-person basis, GDP could be stagnant or falling. Also a larger population puts more pressure on demand for public services and housing.",
      "However, if immigrants are filling important gaps in the labour market which would otherwise not be filled - especially jobs that require specific skills - then economists generally think that immigrants can boost GDP per head and general prosperity.",
      "The OBR says that increased migration generally increases economic growth but \"the size of this impact and the effect on per person living standards is highly uncertain\".",
      "The OBR's point about growth per person is important because the government has made growth of this measure a key priority.",
      "Growth per person fell in 2023 and was flat in 2024.",
      "What about social care?",
      "There are gaps in our labour market which have been substantially filled by migrants in recent years, most notably social care.",
      "And there were still estimated to be 131,000 vacant posts in adult social care in England in 2023.",
      "Care providers argue stopping them recruiting from overseas will likely make that gap bigger.",
      "Non-immigrants could theoretically fill many of these posts and working-age people who are economically inactive could potentially be deployed in this sector if they could be encouraged and helped into work.",
      "Yet the main barrier to recruitment in social care has been the level of pay, which is currently too low to attract sufficient numbers of British workers.",

      "Starmer promises to cut migration as Farage and Badenoch criticise PM's plan",
      "Proposals will lead to significant immigration cut, vows PM",
      "Amy Clark, commercial director of a Cornwall care home chain, told the BBC that the measures could cause challenges because \"recruiting locally is very, very difficult\".",
      "The government could increase the levels of pay in social care, but that would leave them under pressure to increase grants to local authorities and potentially raise taxes to fund it.",
      "Problems with social care recruitment were also highlighted by Madeleine Sumption, deputy chair of the Migration Advisory Committee.",
      "\"We've seen widespread reports of exploitation, people coming in who are quite vulnerable earning very low wages.",
      "\"So I am not surprised the government has chosen to close overseas recruitment because it's caused them so much difficulty,\" she said.",
      "What about universities?",
      "Overseas students have been a major contributor to levels of net migration in recent years.",
      "But they are also a significant source of funding for UK universities.",
      "A large reduction in overseas students numbers would undermine the finances of many universities and a number are already in severe financial difficulties.",
      "The government wants to monitor more closely how universities recruit international students.",
      "It is also proposing a limit on the time international students can remain in the UK after graduating. Foreign students would only have 18 months to look for a job, down from 2-3 years previously.",
      "Universities UK - which represents 141 universities - has urged the government \"to think carefully\" about the impact of its measures.",
      "If overseas student numbers did fall, the government could make up the shortfall in universities' revenue by increasing central government grants but, again, that could require an increase in taxes.",
      "Alternatively, it could further increase domestic students' tuition fees, although that would also be contentious.",
      "What about skilled migrants?",
      "The government says it still wants to attract high-skilled individuals \"who play by the rules and contribute to the economy\".",
      "However, the PM also stressed that some parts of the economy are \"addicted\" to importing cheap labour, rather than investing in training UK workers.",
      "As an example, Sir Keir said the number of engineering apprenticeships had fallen in recent years, while visas for overseas workers in this area had gone up.",
      "Figures in the government's new immigration plan show that the number of UK work visas issued for engineering professionals rose from 3,427 in 2021 to 5,495 in 2024.",
      "Meanwhile, the number of new apprenticeships in engineering in England fell from 26,970 in 2021-22 to 18,520 in 2024-25.",
      "But if the government wants many more home-trained engineers that will likely come with a cost in terms of a higher training budget.",
      "While that investment could come partly from firms, it could also mean more public spending and possibly tax rises.",
      "According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, total public spending on adult education and skills has fallen by 24% in real terms since 2010.",
      "Reacting to the government's proposals, Make UK - which represents manufacturers - said firms are being forced to recruit overseas staff because domestic skills training is \"fundamentally flawed\".",

      "In Wales, the problem was found to be worst in towns and cities - with more than 35% of urban areas seeing \"unacceptable\" levels of litter.",
      "There was also a 286% increase in the number of the most dirty streets, graded \"D\" for cleanliness.",

      "\"It's not very nice if you've got people coming down to visit, and all they can see is rubbish.\"",
      "'Heart-breaking'",
      "Fellow Splott resident Lynne Thomas, who organises monthly volunteer litter picks, said much of the litter was caused by people incorrectly putting their bins out.",
      "\"The seagulls are getting savvy - if there's any food elements in any of the bags they're there in seconds - they will have it, they will shred it and strew it across the streets,\" she said.",

      "\"Trying to find the money we need to provide these litter services is a real difficulty - we're all struggling with it,\" said Ms Burnett, who also represents the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA).",
      "The need for increased funding for education and social care had meant other budgets were being squeezed, she warned.",
      "\"It's a huge issue for every single local authority in Wales,\" she added.",

      "It is also unclear exactly where the object re-entered the atmosphere.",

      "This is why experts think it may have survived an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere.",
      "However, Kosmos 482's parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely to have degraded after more than 50 years in space.",
      "Mr Lemmens explained that the \"re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently\". He said it happens weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones.",

    "story": [
      "An artificial intelligence (AI) tool has been used to sort through comments  about botox and lip fillers, that were submitted as part of a public consultation, in what officials said was the first use of this kind in the UK.",
      "Officials set the tool to work sifting responses to a Scottish government consultation on regulating non-surgical cosmetic procedures.",
      "They found it came up with \"nearly identical\" results, when compared to humans set the same task.",

      "Consult is one of a planned set of government AI-powered tools that have collectively been dubbed \"Humphrey\" after the wily senior civil servant, Sir Humphrey Appleby, from the classic 1980s sitcom Yes, Minister. The series often took aim at excessive bureaucracy in government.",
      "In this trial the AI tool examined 2,000 submissions. But public consultations, which gather the views of UK citizens on issues under consideration by ministers, can generate tens of thousands of responses.",
      "It was able to identify themes amongst the responses, and counted and catalogued answers accordingly - with human experts checking its work at both stages.",
      "Consult's findings were then examined to see how they compared to a team of human experts working in parallel.",
      "Technology secretary Peter Kyle said the initial success of the trial meant that Consult would be used across government \"very soon\".",

      "One is that they sometimes invent information - a failing known as \"hallucinating\".",
      "Because the AI was only being asked to carry out a relatively limited task, officials said hallucination would not be a major problem.",
      "Such AI tools, built using what are known as \"large language models\" have also displayed bias, as they adsorb the prejudices inherent in the human-generated data on which they are trained.",
      "But experts who worked with Consult had found it reduced bias overall,  the government said, by removing opportunities for individual human analysts to \"project their own preconceived ideas\".",
      "Consult has also been tested to check it can handle language containing spelling mistakes and other errors.",

    "summary": "It argues the regulations could threaten the privacy and safety of Wikipedia's volunteer contributors.",
    "story": [
      "Wikipedia is taking legal action against new Online Safety Act regulations it says could threaten the safety of its volunteer editors and their ability to keep harmful content off the site.",
      "The Wikimedia Foundation - the non-profit which supports the online encyclopaedia - is seeking a judicial review of rules which could mean Wikipedia is subjected to the toughest duties required of websites under the act.",
      "Lead counsel Phil Bradley-Schmieg said it was \"unfortunate that we must now defend the privacy and safety of Wikipedia's volunteer editors from flawed legislation\".",
      "The government told the BBC it was committed to implementing the act but could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.",
      "It's thought this is the first judicial review to be brought against the new online safety laws - albeit a narrow part of them - but experts say it may not be the last.",
      "\"The Online Safety Act is vast in scope and incredibly complex,\" Ben Packer, a partner at law firm Linklaters, told the BBC.",
      "The law would inevitably have impacts on UK citizens' freedom of expression and other human rights, so as more of it comes into force \"we can expect that more challenges may be forthcoming\", he told the BBC.",
      "These will add to the array of challenges the act already faces, from claims its burdensome rules are forcing harmless small websites to close - to those who argue the law and its enforcement are too weak and not up to the job.",
      "Why is Wikipedia unhappy?",
      "The OSA requires the regulator, Ofcom, to categorise platforms according to a number of factors, including how many users they have and what features they offer.",
      "Those designated \"Category 1\" - the highest level - will face additional duties to keep users safe.",
      "In very simple terms, sites are most likely to be classed as Category 1 if they allow millions of UK users to interact and share content with each other, and have systems that recommend content.",
      "These rules were originally designed to target the services where UK users were most likely to encounter harmful content - but Wikipedia is concerned they are so vaguely defined there is \"a significant risk\" it will be included in Category 1.",
      "If that happened, the consequences for the army of volunteers who write and edit articles could be serious and would reach beyond the UK, the Foundation argues.",
      "It has singled out additional duties which could, in effect, require the site to verify the identities of its volunteers - something it fears could expose them to data breaches, stalking, vexatious lawsuits or even imprisonment by authoritarian regimes.",
      "\"We would be forced to collect data about our contributors, and that would compromise their privacy and safety, and what that means is that people would feel less safe as contributors\", Rebecca MacKinnon the Wikimedia Foundation's vice president of global advocacy told the BBC",
      "\"We've seen in other parts of the world, when people do not feel safe contributing to Wikipedia, then they shy away from controversial topics that may be challenging to to people who are powerful, and that reduces the quality and the usefulness of the encyclopaedia\".",
      "'Outlier' services",
      "The Wikimedia Foundation stresses it is not trying to challenge the OSA in general, or the idea that there should be Category 1 services subject to additional duties.",
      "Instead, it is challenging parts of the so-called \"Categorisation Regulations\" that set out how the regulator Ofcom will decide which sites will have to follow the most stringent duties.",
      "It argues, as currently defined, they risk not only inappropriately catching sites such as Wikipedia but also missing some platforms which should be abiding by tougher rules.",
      "\"The Regulations do not just risk overregulating low risk \"outlier\" services, like Wikipedia,\" Phil Bradley-Schmieg wrote in a blog post.",
      "\"As designed, the regulations will also fail to catch many of the services UK society is actually concerned about, like misogynistic hate websites\".",
      "The foundation argues its volunteers already do an effective job of keeping harmful content off the platform.",
      "After the 2024 Southport murders, volunteers worked night and day to provide reliable and neutral information Mr Bradley-Schmieg wrote.",
      "Ben Packer argues the foundation will have a high bar to cross to convince a court that the Secretary of State acted unlawfully making the regulations.",
      "\"Typically, it is difficult to succeed in a judicial review challenging regulations,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"Here, Wikimedia will be challenging regulations set by the Secretary of State on the advice of Ofcom, after they had conducted research and consultation on where those thresholds should be set,\" he pointed out.",
      "Ofcom has not yet categorised any services, but has requested information from a number of sites - including Wikipedia - and is awaiting responses.",
      "In a statement it said: We note the Wikimedia Foundation's decision to challenge the categorisation regulations set by the Secretary of State under the Online Safety Act.\"",

    "story": [
      "Apple is asking an appeals court to pause a US district judge's recent ruling in a case which could determine the future of its highly lucrative App Store.",
      "Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found last week the tech giant wilfully violated an order she had previously made in a case filed by Fortnite-maker Epic Games.",
      "That order - handed down in 2021 - demanded Apple refrain from anti-competitive conduct and pricing and allow outside payment options in the App Store.",
      "Last week she determined Apple was flouting that demand - a finding Apple has now called \"extraordinary.\"",
      "The iPhone maker has alleged in a court filing that her order unlawfully prevents the company from controlling \"core aspects of its business operations.\"",
      "\"A federal court cannot force Apple to permanently give away free access to its products and services, including intellectual property,\" the company's lawyers wrote.",
      "Case origins",
      "Both of Judge Gonzalez Rogers' judgements stem from an antitrust case filed by Epic Games.",
      "In 2020, Epic accused the iPhone-maker of possessing an illegal monopoly with its App Store, which collected commissions of between 15% and 30% on in-app purchases.",
      "The judge rejected Epic's monopoly claims, but found Apple was stopping developers from giving users alternative payment options in violation of California competition rules.",
      "She ordered Apple to make changes that would help developers steer customers to cheaper payment options outside of the Apple ecosystem.",
      "Last year, Epic accused Apple of failing to comply by creating a new set of fees for developers instead.",
      "In a contempt order last week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple continued to interfere with competition, saying that internal company documents showed Apple deliberately violated her 2021 injunction.",
      "'Substantial sums'",
      "On Wednesday, Apple requested an appeals court take action, including by lifting a ban that stops it from charging developers fees on purchases made outside the App Store.",
      "The company wrote that such restrictions \"will cost Apple substantial sums annually\" and are based on conduct that has not been found unlawful.",
      "\"Rather, they were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance with an earlier state-law Injunction that is itself invalid,\" Apple wrote.",
      "In response, Epic Games said Judge Gonzalez Rogers' contempt order last week was already benefitting consumers.",
      "\"Apple has faced a surge of genuine competition as developers have updated their apps with better payment methods, better deals, and better consumer choice,\" Epic wrote in a post on the social media platform X.",
      "The company criticized Apple's motion as \"a last ditch effort to block competition and extract massive junk fees at the expense of consumers and developers.\"",
      "Epic says it is on track with plans to bring Fortnite back to iPhones and iPads.",
      "Apple removed Fortnite from its App Store in 2020 after Epic unveiled an in-app payment system into the game.",
      "The move led to the current court battle between the two companies.",
      "Apple did not directly addresses Judge Gonzalez Rogers' stunning rebuke of company executives in its court filing.",
      "In her most recent order, she said CEO Tim Cook ignored executive Phillip Schiller's urging to have Apple comply with her injunction, and allowed then-Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri to convince him not to.",
      "\"Cook chose poorly,\" she wrote.",
      "The company documents she reviewed reveal \"that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option\", she wrote.",
      "Judge Gonzalez Rogers said she would refer the matter to the US Attorney for Northern District of California to investigate if a criminal contempt proceeding against Apple is appropriate.",
      "Apple said last week it would comply with the court's order while it appeals.",

    "summary": "Giant tyre firms are testing tyres that can survive conditions on the Moon and Mars.",
    "story": [
      "Going back to the Moon after half a century, and then to Mars, literally means reinventing the wheel.",
      "After all, Mars is a long way to come back if you get a flat.",
      "\"One thing you cannot have is a puncture,\" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin.",
      "The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover.",
      "Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears.",
      "As for the Moon, the US Artemis missions aim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027.",
      "Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030.",
      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",
      "Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May).",
      "Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface.",
      "Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes.",
      "ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet.",
      "The work might have some useful applications here on Earth.",
      "While working on his doctorate at the University of Southern California, Dr Cole joined a Nasa entrepreneurial programme to work on commercialising some of the technology from the Mars super-elastic rover tyre.",
      "An early product this year will be nickel-titanium bicycle tyres.",
      "Priced around $150 (\u00a3120) each, the tyres are much more expensive than regular ones, but would be extremely durable.",
      "He also plans to work this year on durable tyres for motorbikes, aimed at areas with rough roads.",
      "For all this, his \"dream\" remains to play a part in humanity's return to the Moon.",

    "story": [
      "High above the Arctic Circle, the archipelago of Svalbard lies halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.",
      "Frozen, mountainous, and remote, it's home to hundreds of polar bears and a couple of sparse settlements.",
      "One of those is Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost town, and just outside the settlement, in a decommissioned coal mine, is The Arctic World Archive (AWA) - an  underground vault for data.",
      "Customers pay to have their data stored on film and kept in the vault, for potentially hundreds of years.",
      "\"This is a place to make sure that information survives technology obsolescence, time and ageing. That's our mission,\" says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside.",
      "Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archive's metal door.",
      "Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored.",
      "\"It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,\" Mr Bjerkestrand says.",
      "\"It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it.\"",
      "Since the archive's launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries.",
      "Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck.",
      "The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads.",
      "It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters.",
      "\"Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data,\" said Mr Bjerkstand. \"There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers.\"",
      "According to him, Svalbard is the perfect place, for hosting a secure data storage facility.",
      "\"It's far away from everything! Far away from wars, crisis, terrorism, disasters. What could be safer!\"",
      "Underground it's dark, dry and chilly, with temperatures remaining sub-zero all year-round; conditions which Mr Bjerkestrand claims are ideal for keeping the film safe for centuries.",
      "Should global warming cause the thick Arctic permafrost to thaw, the vault is still robust enough to preserve its contents he says.",
      "At the back of the chamber, another large metal box contains GitHub's Code Vault.",
      "The software developer has archived hundreds of reels of open source code here, which are the building blocks underpinning computer operating systems, software, websites and apps.",
      "Programming languages, AI tools, and every active public repository on its platform, written by its 150 million users, are also stored here.",
      "\"It's incredibly important for humanity to secure the future of software, it's become so critical to our day to day lives,\" Githhub's chief operating officer, Kyle Daigle tells the BBC.",
      "His firm has explored a variety of long-term storage solutions, he said, and there are challenges. \"Some of our existing mechanisms can be stored for a very long time, but you need technology to read them.\"",
      "At Piql's headquarters in southern Norway, data files are encoded onto photosensitive film.",
      "\"Data is a sequence of bits and bytes,\" explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips.",
      "\"We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image [or frame] is about eight million pixels.\"",
      "Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes.",
      "The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev.",
      "\"We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film.\"",
      "One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future.",
      "That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well.",
      "Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential \"digital Dark Age\", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete.",
      "That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past.",
      "Many firms offer long-term data storage.",
      "Cassettes of magnetic tape known as LTO (Linear Tape Open), are the most common form, but newer innovations promise to revolutionise how we preserve information.",
      "For example, Microsoft's Project Silica has developed 2mm-thick panes of glass, onto which chunks of data is transferred by powerful lasers.",
      "Meanwhile a team of scientists from the University of Southhampton have created a so-called 5D memory crystal, which has saved a record of the human genome.",
      "That's also been placed in the Memory of Mankind repository, another vault safeguarding historic documents, hidden in a salt mine in Austria.",
      "The Arctic World Archive receives deposits three times a year, and as the BBC visited, recordings of endangered languages and the manuscripts of the composer Chopin, were among the latest reels placed in the vault.",

      "Trump has agreed to \"say hello\" to Syria's interim president on Wednesday in Saudi Arabia as part of his tour of the Middle East, the White House said.",
      "The announcement of the lifting of sanctions was met with elation in the Syrian capital of Damascus, where cheering, dancing and celebratory gunfire were heard.",

      "He also called for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist group who overthrew Assad, to be de-listed as a terrorist organisation. It is designated as one by the UN, US, EU and UK, among many others, as it started as a splinter group of al-Qaeda, which it broke away from in 2016.",
      "Al-Sharaa repeated these calls at a joint press conference with France's President Emmanuel Macron last week, saying \"these sanctions were imposed on the previous regime because of the crimes it committed, and this regime is gone.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Los Angeles judge has reduced the sentence of Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are serving life in prison for the 1989 murders of their parents in a Beverly Hills mansion, making them eligible for parole.",
      "Judge Michael Jesic resentenced the brothers to 50 years to life. A decision on their potential release must next be made by the state parole board, which will hold a hearing in the case next month.",
      "The district attorney had argued vehemently against a lower sentence, saying the brothers were not rehabilitated. The Menendezes claimed they killed Kitty and Jose Menendez out of self-defence after years of sexual abuse.",
      "The case, which has prompted books and documentaries, still divides many Americans.",
      "After the judge agreed to resentence them on Tuesday afternoon, the brothers delivered an emotional statement to the court.",
      "They went through grim details of the brutal killings and their decision to reload their shotguns and keep shooting their parents at point-blank range in the living room of their home. The siblings were aged 18 and 21 at the time.",
      "\"I had to stop being selfish and immature to really understand what my parents went though in those last moments,\" Erik Menendez, 54, told the court.",

      "\"I lied to you and forced you into a spotlight of public humiliation,\" he said to his family.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the decision to resentence the pair was \"monumental\" and carried \"significant implications for the families involved\".",
      "Much of the hearing centred on what the brothers have been doing in prison for the last 30 years.",
      "Family members and those who worked with them in prison detailed the educational courses they completed and programmes they created to improve the lives of inmates, including a hospice initiative for the elderly and sick.",
      "Judge Jesic called the brothers' work while in prison \"remarkable\", but noted that their 1996 sentences to life without parole were justified at the time.",
      "He said under the guidelines, they were eligible for resentencing, issuing his new sentence of 50 years to life. The brothers have been held in custody since 1990.",
      "'A great day'",
      "As the judge continued reading, the brothers smiled and waved to their attorneys and family members who crowded into the courtroom. Family members embraced with smiles.",
      "\"Today is a great day,\" defence lawyer Mark Geragos told reporters outside court. He said they were \"one huge step closer to bringing the boys home\".",
      "Anamaria Baralt, the brothers' cousin who testified inside court earlier in the day, said their family was elated.",
      "\"It is a difficult process,\" she said of the parole hearing that awaits the brothers, but noted they will \"eagerly step through those doors if it means we can have them home\".",

      "The district attorney's office, which fiercely opposes the brothers being released, questioned each witness about Erik and Lyle Menendez's \"litany of lies\" they have clung to since the murders.",

    "story": [
      "Former Uruguayan President Jos\u00e9 Mujica, known as \"Pepe\", has died at the age of 89.",
      "The ex-guerrilla who governed Uruguay from 2010 to 2015 was known as the world's \"poorest president\" because of his modest lifestyle.",
      "Current President Yamand\u00fa Orsi announced his predecessor's death on X, writing: \"thank\u00a0you\u00a0for\u00a0everything\u00a0you\u00a0gave\u00a0us\u00a0and\u00a0for\u00a0your\u00a0deep\u00a0love\u00a0for\u00a0your\u00a0people.\"",
      "The politician's cause of death is not known but he had been suffering from oesophageal cancer.",
      "Because of the simple way he lived as president, his criticism of consumerism and the social reforms he promoted - which, among other things, meant Uruguay became the first country to legalise the recreational use of marijuana - Mujica became a well-known political figure in Latin America and beyond.",
      "His global popularity is unusual for a president of Uruguay, a country with just 3.4 million inhabitants where his legacy has also generated some controversy.",
      "In fact, even though many tended to see Mujica as someone outside the political class, that was not the case.",
      "He said his passion for politics, as well as for books and working the land, was passed on to him by his mother, who raised him in a middle-class home in Montevideo, the capital city.",
      "As a young man, Mujica was a member of the National Party, one of Uruguay's traditional political forces, which later became the centre-right opposition to his government.",
      "In the 1960s, he helped set up the Tupamaros National Liberation Movement (MLN-T), a leftist urban guerrilla group that carried out assaults, kidnappings and executions, although he always maintained that he did not commit any murder.",
      "Influenced by the Cuban revolution and international socialism, the MLN-T launched a campaign of clandestine resistance against the Uruguayan government, which at the time was constitutional and democratic, although the left accused it of being increasingly authoritarian.",
      "During this period, Mujica was captured four times. On one of those occasions, in 1970, he was shot six times and nearly died.",
      "He escaped from prison twice, on one occasion through a tunnel with 105 other MLN-T prisoners, in one of the largest escapes in Uruguayan prison history.",
      "When the Uruguayan military staged a coup in 1973, they included him in a group of \"nine hostages\" who they threatened to kill if the guerrillas continued their attacks.",
      "During the more than 14 years he spent in prison during the 1970s and 1980s, he was tortured and spent most of that time in harsh conditions and isolation, until he was freed in 1985 when Uruguay returned to democracy.",
      "He used to say that during his time in prison, he experienced madness first hand, suffering from delusions and even talking to ants.",
      "The day he was freed was his happiest memory, he says: \"Becoming president was insignificant compared to that.\"",
      "From guerrilla to president",
      "A few years after his release, he served as a lawmaker, both in the Chamber of Representatives and in the Senate, the country's lower and upper houses respectively.",
      "In 2005, he became minister in the first government of the Frente Amplio, the Uruguayan leftist coalition, before becoming Uruguay's president in 2010.",
      "He was 74 years old at the time, and, to the rest of the world, still unknown.",
      "His election marked an important moment for the Latin American left, which was already strong on the continent at that time. Mujica became leader alongside other left-wing presidents such as Luis In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in Brazil and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela.",
      "However, Mujica governed in his own way, demonstrating pragmatism and audacity on several occasions, political commentators say.",
      "During his administration, amid a fairly favourable international context, the Uruguayan economy grew at an average annual rate of 5.4%, poverty was reduced, and unemployment remained low.",
      "Uruguay also drew global attention for the social laws passed by parliament during those years, such as the legalisation of abortion, the recognition of same-sex marriage, and state regulation of the marijuana market.",
      "While in office, Mujica rejected moving into the presidential residence (a mansion), as heads of state around the world usually do.",
      "Instead, he remained with his wife - politician and former guerrilla Luc\u00eda Topolansky - in their modest home on the outskirts of Montevideo, with no domestic help and little security.",
      "This combined with the fact that he always dressed casually, that he was often seen driving his light blue 1987 Volkswagen Beetle and gave away a large portion of his salary, led some media outlets to call him \"the world's poorest president\".",
      "But Mujica always rejected that title: \"They say I'm the poorest president. No, I'm not,\" he told me in a 2012 interview at his home. \"Poor are those who want more [...] because they're in an endless race.\"",
      "Despite Mujica preaching austerity, his government did significantly increase public spending, widening the fiscal deficit and leading his opponents to accuse him of waste.",
      "Mujica was also criticised for failing to reverse the growing problems in Uruguayan education, despite having promised that education would be a top priority for his administration.",
      "However, unlike other leaders in the region, he was never accused of corruption or of undermining his country's democracy.",
      "By the end of his administration, Mujica had a high domestic popularity rating (close to 70%) and was elected senator, but also spent part of his time travelling the world after he stepped down as president.",
      "\"So what it is that catches the world's attention? That I live with very little, a simple house, that I drive around in an old car? Then this world is crazy because it's surprised by [what is] normal,\" he reflected before leaving office.",
      "Mujica retired from politics in 2020 though he remained a central figure in Uruguay.",
      "His political heir, Yamand\u00fa Orsi, was elected president of Uruguay in November 2024 and his group within the Frente Amplio obtained the largest number of parliamentary seats since the country's return to democracy.",
      "Last year, Mujica announced he had cancer and references to his age and the inexorable proximity of death became more frequent - but he always accepted the final outcome as something natural, without drama.",
      "In the last interview he gave the BBC in November last year, he said: \"One knows that death is inevitable. And perhaps it's like the salt of life.\"",

    "story": [
      "Joe Biden's aides have hit back at a new book that accuses a White House inner circle of covering up the former US president's \"physical deterioration\" during his ill-fated re-election campaign.",
      "According to the book, Original Sin, Biden's condition during his 2024 presidential run was said to be so poor that aides discussed putting him in a wheelchair.",
      "A spokesperson for Biden, 82, said \"evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity\" and maintained the Democrat had been \"a very effective president\".",
      "The book, by CNN's Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson of Axios, is due to be released on 20 May.",
      "Biden abruptly ended his re-election campaign last July shortly after his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump, a Republican.",
      "Party insiders blamed him for exiting the race too late, leaving his replacement, Vice-President Kamala Harris, 107 days to challenge Trump, who swept to victory.",
      "Ahead of the book's release, Biden last week gave his first interview since leaving the White House to the BBC, saying: \"I don't think it would have mattered\" if he had left the race sooner.",
      "While the book largely cites anonymous sources in interviews with more than 200 people, one of the few to be quoted on the record is David Plouffe, who worked on Vice-President Harris's campaign.",
      "\"We got so screwed by Biden as a party,\" the book quotes Plouffe as saying.",
      "The authors write: \"Biden's physical deterioration - most apparent in his halting walk - had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election.",
      "\"Given Biden's age, [his physician Kevin O'Connor] also privately said that if he had another bad fall, a wheelchair might be necessary for what could be a difficult recovery,\" the book adds.",
      "Biden's physical condition had declined so much, the authors said, that aides had sought to ensure he walked shorter distances, used handrails when mounting stairs, and wore trainers more often.",
      "At the time, Biden aides repeatedly told reporters his altered gait was due to a foot fracture in November 2020 and his subsequent refusal to consistently wear his prescribed surgical boot.",
      "In a statement to Axios, an anonymous Biden aide said: \"Yes, there were physical changes as he got older, but evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity.\"",
      "The spokesperson added: \"We are still waiting for someone, anyone, to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline.",
      "\"In fact, the evidence points to the opposite - he was a very effective president.\"",
      "Tapper and Thompson's book also says that Biden did not recognise George Clooney at a star-studded California campaign fundraiser last June  hosted by the Hollywood star.",
      "\"Thank you for being here,\" Biden told Clooney at the event, apparently unaware he was speaking to the Academy Award winner.",
      "\"You know George,\" an aide reportedly told Biden, as he was struggled to work out Clooney's identity.",
      "Not long after the incident, Clooney wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times calling on Biden to quit the race. The actor was one of the first major donors to publicly withdraw his support.",
      "The book also alleges that Biden forgot the names of veteran aides, including trusted loyalist Mike Donilon, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and White House communications director Kate Bedingfield.",

    "story": [
      "Former world champion cyclist Rohan Dennis has been given a two-year suspended sentence over a car incident in Australia which killed his wife, fellow Olympian Melissa Hoskins.",
      "Dennis pleaded guilty to one aggravated count of creating the likelihood of harm, after Hoskins was struck by the car he was driving during a fight outside the couple's Adelaide home in 2023.",
      "A judge said Dennis had disregarded his wife's safety, but was not criminally responsible for her death.",
      "Hoskins' parents spoke outside the court after sentencing, saying they were \"glad\" the case was over and they hoped the family could \"move on\".",
      "The court had previously heard that Dennis and Hoskins were arguing about kitchen renovations shortly before the incident occurred, and Hoskins had held on to the car her husband was driving as he tried to leave.",
      "While sentencing Dennis, Judge Ian Press said calling the incident tragic \"really does not do justice to the grief, the anguish and the turmoil those events have brought into the lives of those who knew and loved your wife\".",
      "He said he understood that Dennis had tried to \"de-escalate the argument\" by driving off, but said it did not excuse his actions.",
      "\"It was your obligation to stop the vehicle when driving that vehicle became dangerous to her physical wellbeing,\" he said, according to a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).",
      "\"That you did not stop because you wanted to leave, is a very poor reason for not doing so.\"",
      "Hoskins was taken to hospital after being struck but later died of her injuries.",
      "Dennis was initially charged with dangerous driving causing death and driving without due care and pleaded not guilty, but he later admitted to a single, lesser charge.",
      "Dennis' lawyer had argued that he had no intention of harming his wife and either did not know or was \"reckless to the fact\" that Hoskins was holding onto the car.",
      "She  told an earlier hearing that despite his \"stoic\" front, Dennis felt a \"deep, deep grief\".",
      "On Wednesday, Judge Press emphasised that Dennis was not criminally responsible for causing Hoskins' death, and accepted he was remorseful.",
      "\"I accept you have a sense of responsibility for all that occurred. I accept you have anguished over what could have been different if you had acted in some other way,\" Judge Press said.",
      "In victim impact statements read to the court last month, Hoskins' mother said that while she accepted Dennis wouldn't have intentionally hurt her daughter, his temper was his \"downfall\" and \"needs to be addressed\".",
      "Speaking outside court, Peter and Amanda Hoskins said they missed their daughter \"terribly\".",
      "\"She was someone really special,\" Mr Hoskins said.",
      "He said the family was yet to receive an apology from Dennis, but expected it \"will come with time\".",
      "\"It's now time for us to move on, which would be Melissa's expectations of us,\" Mr Hoskins said, adding it was important for the couple to have a \"well-mannered relationship\" with Dennis going forward.",
      "\"There are two young children caught up in this tragedy... Clearly, we want to continue to be an integral part of [the] children's lives and their future.\"",
      "Hoskins was a world champion cyclist in the Australian team pursuit in 2015, and a two-time Olympian. Her death triggered a wave of tributes from around the world.",

      "Dennis retired at the end of the 2023 season after a cycling career in which he won a silver medal team pursuit at the London 2012 Olympics and a road time trial bronze at Tokyo 2020. He also won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in 2022.",

      "Warning: This story contains details that some readers may find distressing.",
      "Ms Ventura fell 'in love' with Mr Combs",
      "Prosecutors began by questioning Ms Ventura - one of their two central witnesses in the case - about her 11-year, on-and-off relationship with Mr Combs.",
      "Now 38 and pregnant with her third child, she met Mr Combs when she was a 19-year-old aspiring singer and he was 37.",
      "His record label would later sign Ms Ventura as an artist, and shortly afterwards their romantic relationship began.",
      "At the time, she testified, she felt like they were in a monogamous relationship, though she knows now that he had other girlfriends.",
      "She said she \"fell in love\" with the \"larger-than-life entrepreneur and musician\". But it was not long before she noticed another side to him, she said.",
      "Mr Combs wanted to 'control' every part of her life, Ms Ventura says",
      "Mr Combs wanted to \"control\" her life, Ms Ventura said. She said he paid for her home, her cars, her phone and other technology that he would sometimes take away to \"punish\" her.",
      "\"Control was everything, from the way that I looked... to what I was working on,\" Ms Ventura said.",
      "Eventually, she claimed, the control turned violent. Mr Combs would \"bash on my head, knock me over, drag me and kick me\" frequently, Ms Ventura testified, sometimes through tears.",
      "She alleged that she was left with swollen lips, black eyes and knots on her forehead.",
      "Ms Ventura felt 'humiliated' by 'freak-offs'",
      "Prosecutors spent hours on Tuesday asking Ms Ventura about so-called \"freak-offs\".",
      "Ms Ventura told the court how Mr Combs introduced her to the sexual events  during the first year of their relationship. They would hire a male escort or stripper to have sex with Ms Ventura while Mr Combs watched.",
      "Ms Ventura told the court that she first tried the encounters to make Mr Combs \"happy\". But she said they humiliated her, and sometimes lasted three to four days.",
      "\"I felt pretty horrible about myself,\" she told the court, wiping away tears. \"It made me feel worthless.\"",
      "Ms Ventura told the court she never wanted to have sex with anyone but Mr Combs, and claimed she would take myriad drugs - marijuana, ecstasy and ketamine - to help her perform to Mr Combs' satisfaction, but also to \"disassociate\".",
      "The drugs were \"a way to not feel it for what it really was\", she said, \"having sex with a stranger I didn't really want to be having sex with\".",
      "Mr Combs flew male escorts in for freak-offs, court hears",
      "As prosecutors pressed Ms Ventura about the \"freak-offs\", she told the court of how Mr Combs would direct her to find male escorts, strippers or dancers to have sex with while he watched.",
      "She alleged that Mr Combs would pay the men anywhere from $1,500 to $6,000 in cash, depending on their performance.",
      "They found the men through stripper companies and sites like Craigslist. Some of their photos were displayed to the jurors, including Daniel Phillip, who finished his testimony earlier on Tuesday.",
      "Ms Ventura and Mr Combs had the enounters in cities around the world, including Los Angeles, New York, Las Vegas and Ibiza, Spain, Ms Ventura testified.",
      "Sometimes, men would be flown in during vacations, she alleged, and Mr Combs would direct her to ask staff to pay for and arrange their travel, calling them new employees.",
      "Among other charges, prosecutors are trying to prove that Mr Combs engaged in sex trafficking - human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation - and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Mr Combs 'directed', Ms Ventura says",
      "As prosecutors pressed Ms Ventura for graphic details, one key element emerged: Ms Ventura claimed that Mr Combs controlled every part of the encounters.",
      "He chose the outfits she wore - down to the extremely high heels she kept on for hours - as well as the sexual acts that transpired and the lighting, Ms Ventura told jurors.",
      "\"If Sean wanted something to happen, that was what was going to happen,\" she said. \"I couldn't say no.\"",

      "She said freak-offs had a very specific \"pattern\" of sexual acts each time.",
      "\"He was controlling the whole situation,\" she alleged. \"He was directing it.\"",

      "After one of the defendants, Aomar Ait Khedache, 71, sitting metres from Kardashian in the courtroom expressed his regret, she turned to him and said she forgave him.",
      "Referencing her activism in the US to improve the justice system and her dreams of becoming a lawyer, she thanked Khedache for his apology letter.",

      "The trial for the crime committed more than nine years ago has been long-anticipated and closely followed by press.",
      "Wearing a tailored black suit and diamond jewellery, Kardashian was supported in the courtroom by her mother, Kris Jenner, several friends, and a bevy of bodyguards.",
      "She faltered at times in her first hour of giving testimony, fidgeting with her long nails, and pausing when overwhelmed by emotion and fighting back tears. However she appeared to relax and gather strength the longer she went on, her voice becoming steadier.",
      "She also expressed forgiveness for one of the defendants, who issued an apology to her during her testimony.",
      "Tuesday's session in court was the first time Kardashian had relayed to a criminal court her account of the armed burglary, and the extent of her fears during and after the attack.",
      "'I was sure they were going to shoot me'",
      "She recounted how she had been in town for Paris Fashion Week on 2 October, and had retired for the night at around 03:00 when two masked gunmen wearing police uniforms burst into her room, dragging with them the hotel's receptionist who had been bound and gagged.",
      "She managed to call her bodyguard before one of the men then took her phone off her. They snatched her engagement ring, which had been lying on the bedside table, and then \"picked me up off the bed and grabbed me and took me down the hallway\" to look for more jewellery,\" she said.",
      "One of the men held a gun to her back at this point, and \"that was the first moment I thought, should I run for it? But it wasn't an option so I just stayed,\" she said, adding that she realised she should just \"do whatever they say\" for her safety.",
      "Kardashian said she was then thrown onto the bed and her hands bound with zip ties. At this point, she told the concierge: \"Please translate to them that I have babies, I have to make it home.\"",
      "One of the men then pulled her towards him, which opened her robe, under which she wasn't wearing anything.",
      "She told the court she was afraid she was going to be raped, saying she said a prayer to mentally prepare herself.",
      "But then her legs were tied together and a gun pointed at her. She said at that point, \"I was sure that's when they were going to shoot me.\"",
      "She thought of her family at that point, offering them a \"prayer\" that they would not have to experience her killing.",
      "She expressed fear for her sister,  Kourtney, having to walk into the hotel room to find that \"I would be shot dead on the bed and she would see that and have that memory forever.\"",
      "When asked by the judge David de Pas if she thought she was going to die she replied in a small voice: \"I absolutely did think I was gonna die.\"",
      "Kardashian said she looked in the eyes of the man who tied her up to try to remember details - and that he told her if she remained quiet, she would be ok.",
      "After the robbers took the jewellery, they dashed out of the suite, leaving Kardashian in the bathroom. She said she then managed to free her hands from the cable ties and hopped down the staircase to the first floor of the suite, where her stylist and friend Simone Harouche helped release the other ties.",
      "The two then ran out onto the balcony where they called for help while hiding in the bushes. Kardashian said she was worried the men would return, and that when Parisian police turned up, she couldn't trust them because the robbers had also been wearing police uniforms.",
      "During the testimony in the packed courtroom, Kardashian also answered several questions from the judge about why her security were not present at the time.",
      "Her usual team had been sent to accompany her sister Kourtney to the club, while Kim had stayed in.",
      "She told the court she did not have a bodyguard with her because up until the robbery, she and her family had not believed they needed that level of security. She said she had previously always felt safe to go out on the streets of Paris on her own, and they had been comfortable with their security team staying at a different hotel.",
      "\"Everything changed\" after Paris, she said, noting that she employs up to six people to guard her house at night now, and that she started to get a \"phobia of going out\" because she thought people would \"see me out and know my home was empty\".",
      "\"I can't even sleep at night if I know there's not multiple security\" guards, she said, noting her concern about copycat attacks, and that her Los Angeles house was robbed even before the family returned from the Paris trip.",
      "Seeking closure",
      "Kardashian's testimony on Tuesday was interrupted at several points by offers of apology from two of the defendants in the court room, who have pleaded guilty to the charge. While she accepted Khedache's apology, she did not acknowledge the presence of the other defendants who are contesting the charges.",
      "She ignored her former driver Gary Madar who is accused of having tipped off the burglary ring about her whereabouts. He has denied the charges.",
      "She also expressed anger over one of the defendants who has pleaded guilty, Yunice Abbas, who published a memoir in 2021 prior to the trial titled '\"I Held Up Kim Kardashian\".",
      "Kardashian told the court on Tuesday she was \"really shocked when I saw there was a book\".",
      "\"Not only did he do this, but now [he's] making money off that - my jewellery, my memories, the watch my dad who passed away gave me when I graduated high school. I can't get that back.\"",
      "She also told the court she wanted closure from the trial's proceedings.",

    "summary": "The foreign minister says raising concerns publicly amounts to interference in domestic affairs.",
    "story": [
      "Zambia's foreign minister has warned diplomats against interfering in the country's affairs, days after the US ambassador raised concerns about the \"systematic theft\" of drugs donated to the southern African state.",
      "Mulambo Haimbe said there was an \"increasing tendency\" by envoys to ignore diplomatic channels, and this could undermine the \"spirit of mutual respect\".",
      "He did not name anyone, but his comments were seen as being directed at the US ambassador to Lusaka, Michael Gonzales.",
      "Last week, Gonzales called a press conference to announce that the US was cutting $50m (\u00a337m) of health aid to Zambia because of the theft of life-saving medications that the US had provided for patients.",
      "He added that he had decided to go public after holding more than 30 fruitless meetings with senior Zambian officials.",
      "In his response, Haimbe said that addressing the government through the media amounted to interference and was in breach of diplomatic conventions.",
      "\"We remain open to addressing any matters of concern through appropriate diplomatic channels,\" the minister added.",
      "Last week, the US embassy said it had presented its findings of the alleged corruption to Zambian officials in April last year, and had offered help to stop further theft and to bring the culprits to justice.",
      "However, no action was taken by the Zambian authorities, it added.",
      "On Monday, Zambia's Home Affairs Minister Jacob Mwiimbu said that a forensic audit on the alleged theft had been completed and handed over to security agencies for further action.",
      "About 75 people have been arrested in a countrywide crackdown that saw more than 400 health facilities raided over the alleged scam, he said.",
      "\"There will be no sacred cows in this pursuit,\" Mwiimbu added.",
      "Gonzales said that an inspection carried out by US officials at more than 2,000 pharmacies last year had found that most were selling drugs and medical supplies donated by the US.",
      "Zambia's Health Minister Elijah Muchima earlier said the problem of theft predated the current government, which took office in 2021.",
      "Muchima also said several Zambian officials had been sacked following the thefts identified by the US, and that \"an advanced digital stock tracking system\" had been set up to monitor the supply of medicines.",
      "The cut in US assistance, expected to take effect next year, would affect drugs to treat malaria, HIV and TB.",
      "But the health minister has reassured Zambians that there were sufficient stocks of all drugs so there was \"no immediate risk of shortages\".",
      "Gonzales said the recent US measure was separate to the foreign aid freeze announced by President Donald Trump in January.",
      "The freeze has affected health programmes across Africa, including shipments of critical medical supplies, among them HIV drugs.",

    "story": [
      "How do you measure misery? For journalists the usual way is to see it, to feel it, to smell it.",
      "Beleaguered Palestinian colleagues in Gaza are doing that, still doing invaluable reporting at great risk to themselves. More than 200 have been killed doing their jobs.",
      "Israel does not allow international journalists into Gaza.",
      "Denied the chance of eyewitness reporting \u2013 one of the best tools of the job \u2013 we can study, from a distance, the assessments of aid organisations operating in Gaza.",
      "Gaza parents desperate as children face starvation under Israeli blockade",
      "Gaza parents desperate as children face starvation under Israeli blockade",
      "Pascal Hundt, deputy director of operations at the International Committee of the Red Cross said last week that civilians in Gaza faced \"an overwhelming daily struggle to survive the dangers of hostilities, cope with relentless displacement, and endure the consequences of being deprived of urgent humanitarian assistance.\"",
      "He added: \"This situation must not\u2014and cannot\u2014be allowed to escalate further.\"",
      "But it might, if Israel continues the plunge deeper into war that resumed on 18 March when it broke a two-month ceasefire with a massive series of air strikes.",
      "Israel had already sealed the gates of Gaza. Since the beginning of March, it has blocked all shipments of humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies.",
      "The return to war ended any chance of moving on to the ceasefire's proposed second phase, which Israel and Hamas had agreed would end with the release of all the remaining hostages in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.",
      "That was unacceptable to the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the ultra-nationalist religious extremists who keep him in power.",
      "They want Gaza's Palestinians to be replaced by Jewish settlers. They threatened to topple Netanyahu's government if he did not go back to war, and the end of Netanyahu's political career would bring the day of reckoning for his part in Israel's failure to prevent the deadly Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023. It might also force a conclusion in his long trial on corruption charges.",
      "Prime Minister Netanyahu is now promising a new \"intense\" offensive into Gaza in the days after President Donald Trump finishes his swing through the wealthy Arab oil monarchies in the Gulf later this week.",
      "The offensive includes a plan to displace massive numbers of Palestinian civilians on top of waves of artillery, air strikes and death. \"To displace\" is a cold verb. It means families having only handfuls of minutes to flee for their lives, from an area that might be hit immediately to one that might be hit later. Hundreds of thousands have done so repeatedly since the war began.",
      "Gaza was one of the most overcrowded places on earth before the war. Israel's plan is to force as many Gazans as possible into a tiny area in the south, near the ruins of the town of Rafah, which has been almost entirely destroyed.",
      "Before that happens, the UN humanitarian office estimates that 70% of Gaza is already effectively off limits to Palestinians. Israel's plan is to leave them in an even smaller area. The UN and leading aid groups reject Israeli claims that Hamas steals and controls food that comes into Gaza. They have refused to cooperate with a scheme proposed by Israel and the US that would use private security firms, protected by Israeli troops, to distribute basic rations.",
      "Far from Gaza, in London, I talked to Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of Unrwa, the UN agency that supports Palestinian refugees. He told me that he was running out of words \"to describe the misery and the tragedy affecting the people in Gaza. They have been now more than two months without any aid\".",
      "\"Starvation is spreading, people are exhausted, people are hungry... we can expect that in the coming weeks if no aid is coming in, that people will not die because of the bombardment, but they will die because of the lack of food. This is the weaponisation of humanitarian aid.\"",
      "If words are not enough, look at the most authoritative data-driven assessment of famine and food emergencies in the regular reports issued by Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC. It is a joint venture by UN agencies, aid groups and governments that measures whether a famine is happening.",
      "The latest IPC update says Gaza is close to famine. But it says that the entire population, more than two million people, almost half of whom are children, is experiencing acute food insecurity. In plain English, that means they are being starved by Israel's blockade.",
      "The IPC says that 470,000 Gazans, 22% of the population, are in a classification it calls \"Phase 5 \u2013 catastrophe.\" The IPC defines it as a condition in which \"at least one in five households experience an extreme lack of food and face starvation resulting in destitution, extremely critical levels of acute malnutrition and death.\"",
      "In practical terms, the phase five classification, the most acute used by the IPC, estimates that \"71,000 children and more than 17,000 mothers will need urgent treatment for acute malnutrition\".",
      "Thousands of tons of the food, medical aid and humanitarian supplies that they need are sitting only a few miles away, on the other side of the border in Egypt.",
      "In London I asked Mr Lazzarini whether he agreed with those who have accused Israel of denying food and humanitarian aid to civilians as a weapon of war.",
      "\"I have absolutely no doubt,\" he said, \"that this is what we have witnessed during this last 19 months, especially during this last two months. That's a war crime. The quantification will come from the ICJ [International Court of Justice] not from me, but what I can say, what we see, what we observe, food and humanitarian assistance is indeed being used to meet the political or military objective in the context of Gaza.\"",
      "I asked Mr Lazzarini whether the blockade, on top of a year and half of war and destruction, might amount to genocide. That is the accusation against Israel levelled by South Africa and other states at the ICJ in The Hague.",
      "\"Listen, by any account, the destruction is massive. The number of people who have been killed is huge and certainly underestimated. We have seen the systematic destruction also of a school, of a health centre. People have been constant pinballs within Gaza, moving all the time. So there is absolutely no doubt that we are talking about massive atrocities. Genocide? It could end up to genocide. There are many elements which could go in this direction.\"",
      "Israel's defence minister Israel Katz has made no secret of Israel's tactics. Last month Katz said that the blockade was a \"main pressure lever\" to secure victory over Hamas and to get the all the hostages out. The National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir agreed. He wrote that: \"The cessation of humanitarian aid is one of the main levers of pressure on Hamas. The return of aid to Gaza before Hamas gets on its knees and releases all of our hostages would be a historic mistake.\"",
      "Netanyahu's plans for another offensive, and the remarks made by Katz, Ben-Gvir and others, horrified Israeli families with hostages still inside Gaza. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum which represents many of them, said minister Katz was pushing an \"illusion... Israel is choosing to seize territory before the hostages.\"",
      "Dissident Israeli military reservists also protested, saying that they were being forced to fight again not for Israeli security but for the political survival of the Israeli government. In the air force reserve, 1,200 pilots signed an open letter saying that prolonging the war served mainly \"political and personal interests and not security ones\". Netanyahu blamed a small group of \"bad apples\" for the open letter.",
      "For many months Netanyahu and his government have also accused Mr Lazzarini of lying. One official report posted online in January of this year was headed \"Dismantling Unrwa Chief Lazzarini's Falsehoods\". It claimed that he had \"consistently made false statements which have profoundly misinformed the public debate on this issue\". Unrwa, Israel says, has been infiltrated and exploited by Hamas to an unprecedented degree. It says some Unrwa employees took part in the attacks of 7 October.",
      "Mr Lazzarini denies the personal accusations directed at him by Israel and the broader ones aimed at Unrwa. He says Unrwa investigated 19 staff named by Israel and concluded nine of them may have a case to answer. All 19 were suspended. Mr Lazzarini said that since then Unrwa had received \"hundreds of allegations from the State of Israel. Each time, as a rule-based organisation, we keep asking for substantiated information\". He said they had never received it.",
      "All wars are political, and none more than the ones between Israel and the Palestinians. The war engages and enrages the outside world as well the belligerents.",
      "Israel argues that self-defence justifies its actions since 7 October 2023 when Hamas, Islamic Jihad and others attacked Israel, killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, and took 251 others hostage. Any other government, it says, would have done the same.",
      "Palestinians and an increasingly concerned and outraged chorus of states, including some of Israel's key European allies, say that does not justify the continuation of the most devastating assault on Palestinians since the war of 1948, when Israel gained its independence, which Palestinians call \"the catastrophe\".",
      "Even President Trump shows signs of distancing himself from Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that the people of Gaza must be fed.",
      "The allegation that the total denial of food to Gazan civilians is more evidence of an Israeli genocide against Palestinians has outraged Benjamin Netanyahu, his government and many Israeli citizens. It produced rare political unity in Israel. The leader of the opposition Yair Lapid, normally a stern critic of Netanyahu, condemned \"a moral collapse and a moral disaster\" at the ICJ.",
      "Genocide is defined as the destruction, in whole or in part, of a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. The International Criminal Court (ICC), a separate body, has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister on war crimes charges, which they reject. The three Hamas leaders who were also the subject of ICC warrants have all been killed by Israel.",
      "It is not too soon to think about the longer-term impact of this devastating war, even though its end is not in sight. Mr Lazzarini told me that \"in the coming years we will realise how wrong we have been\u2026 on the wrong side of the history. We have under our watch let a massive atrocity unfold.\"",
      "It started, he said, with the Hamas attacks on Israel on the 7 October: \"The largest killing of Israeli and Jewish in the region since World War II\" had been followed by a \"massive\" military response by Israel.",
      "It was, he said, \"disproportionate, basically almost leading to the annihilation of an entire population in their homeland... I think there is a collective responsibility from the international community, the level, the passivity, the indifference being shown until now, the lack of political, diplomatic, economic action. I mean, it's absolutely monstrous, especially in our countries where we have said 'never again'.\"",
      "Ahead may be an attempt to realise Donald Trump's dangerous fantasy of Gaza as the Dubai of the Mediterranean, rebuilt and owned by America and without Palestinians. It has given shape to cherished dreams of Israeli extremists who threaten of the removal of Palestinians from the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean.",

      "Depardieu was also convicted of assaulting an assistant director called Sarah, which was not her real name.",
      "The actor was not in court to hear the verdict but was instead working on a film set in the Azores.",

      "The judge said there was no reason to doubt the word of the two women victims, who had told the court how Depardieu had touched them on intimate parts of the body, using lewd language.",
      "He placed Depardieu on a list of sex offenders and ordered him to pay compensation of \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3840) each to Am\u00e9lie and Sarah for \"secondary victimisation\", a recent innovation covering the additional suffering for the women from the trial itself.",

      "The assaults took place in September 2021 when Depardieu was making a film called Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) about an ageing actor coming to terms with his declining powers.",
      "This was Depardieu's first trial on sexual assault charges. Several other women have made similar allegations in the media, and an alleged rape case could come to trial in the future.",
      "After the trial, the actor was invited to join his close friend and fellow actor Fanny Ardant for a film-shoot in the Azores.",
      "At the end of the trial in Paris in late March, prosecutor Laurent Guy said: \"It's perfectly possible to be an excellent actor and a great father - and still commit a crime.",
      "\"You are not here to pass judgment on French cinema. You are here to judge G\u00e9rard Depardieu, just as you would any other citizen.\"",
      "Claude Vincent, representing one of the two women plaintiffs, described Depardieu as a \"misogynist\" and a \"case-study in sexism\".",

      "\"They cannot bear that there should even be a defence. They think any defence is a supplementary assault,\" he told the court.",
      "The first plaintiff - 54-year-old set decorator Am\u00e9lie - told the court that after a minor argument with Depardieu, he caught her between his legs and held her by the hips.",
      "The second woman - a 34-year-old assistant film director - said the actor had touched her buttocks and breasts through her clothes on three separate occasions. She chose to maintain her anonymity and was not in court to hear the verdict.",

      "The 21-year-old had been serving in the Israeli army on the border of Gaza when he was captured by Hamas militants on 7 October 2023.",
      "On Monday, Israel paused its military operations in Gaza for a few hours to facilitate the transfer. A senior Hamas official told the BBC the release was intended as a goodwill gesture and as part of efforts to reach a new ceasefire deal ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East on Tuesday.",

      "On Monday, he was seen with masked Hamas fighters as they handed him over to Red Cross workers in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.",

      "Israeli officials have said the plans for their expanded offensive include seizing all of Gaza indefinitely, forcibly displacing Palestinians to the south, and taking over aid distribution with private companies despite opposition from the UN and its humanitarian partners, who say they will not co-operate because it appears to \"weaponise\" aid.",

    "story": [
      "As the noise and colour of a two-month election campaign subsides, a game of thrones between the two most powerful families in the Philippines resumes.",
      "President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr, and his Vice-President, Sara Duterte, are embroiled in a bitter feud, and a battle for power.",
      "As allies they won a landslide victory in the last presidential election in 2022.",
      "But as their relationship has fractured - he accusing her of threatening to assassinate him, she accusing him of incompetence and saying she dreamed of decapitating him - this mid-term election has become a critical barometer of the strength of these two political dynasties.",
      "And the results were not great news for the Marcos camp. Typically incumbent presidents in the Philippines get most of their picks for the senate elected in the mid-term election. The power of presidential patronage is a significant advantage, at least it has been in the past.",
      "But not this time.",
      "Only six of the 12 winning senators are from the Marcos alliance, and of those one, Camille Villar, is only half in his camp, as she also accepted endorsement from Sara Duterte.",
      "Four of the senators are in the Duterte camp, including the president's sister Imee Marcos. Two were in the top three vote-winners, ahead of any Marcos candidate.",
      "For a sitting president, this is a poor result.",
      "Senators are elected on a simple, nationwide vote, which is a good indication of national opinion. The result could weaken the authority of the Marcos administration in the last three years of his term, and it casts doubt on the plan to incapacitate Sara Duterte by impeaching her.",
      "The Marcos-Duterte relationship has been deteriorating almost since the start of their administration three years ago. But it was only this year that it ruptured completely.",
      "The decision by the president's allies in Congress to start impeaching the vice-president was the first irreparable breach.",
      "Then in March President Marcos sent Sara's father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, to the International Criminal Court to face charges of crimes against humanity over his brutal war on drugs. The police have also now filed criminal charges against her.",
      "The gloves were off. Impeachment would result in Sara Duterte being barred from public office, ending her ambition to replace President Marcos at the next election.",
      "Right now she is the frontrunner, and few doubt that, if successful, she would use the power of the presidency to seek vengeance against the Marcos's.",
      "But impeachment requires two thirds of the 24-seat senate to vote for it, which is why this mid-term election mattered so much to both camps.",
      "Politics in the Philippines is a family business. Once a family achieves political power, it holds onto it, and passes it around the various generations.",
      "While there are around 200 influential families, the Dutertes and Marcoses sit at the top of the pyramid.",
      "The Marcoses have been in politics for 80 years. The current president's father ruled from 1965 to 1986, imposing martial law, and plundering billions of dollars from the national purse.",
      "Bongbong Marcos' mother, Imelda, who at the age of 95 cast her vote in this election from a wheelchair, is an even more notorious figure, and not just for her shoe collection.",
      "His sister Imee has been re-elected to the senate, thanks to her decision to defect to the Duterte camp.",
      "His eldest son Sandro is a congressman, and his cousin Martin Romualdez is speaker of the lower house and a likely presidential candidate in 2028 - probably the reason why Bongbong Marcos was so keen to drive through the impeachment of Sara Duterte.",
      "In the president's home province of Ilocos Norte, his wife's cousin has been elected governor, his nephew elected vice-governor, and two other cousins elected as city councillors. Up there, Marcoses always win.",
      "Much the same is true of the Dutertes in their stronghold in Davao at the other end of the country.",
      "Even from his prison cell in The Hague, former President Duterte ran for mayor of Davao, and won easily, even though all voters got to see of him was a life-size cardboard cutout.",
      "His absence will not matter though, because the previous mayor was his son Sebastian, who now takes over the vice-mayor's job. Dutertes have been mayors of Davao for 34 out of the last 37 years.",
      "The problem confronting both camps is that the senators also typically come from big political families, or are celebrities in their own right \u2013 many candidates come from a media or showbiz background.",
      "They have interests and ambitions of their own. Even if officially allied with one camp or the other, there is no guarantee they will stay loyal, especially on the issue of impeachment.",
      "\"Senators in the Philippines are very sensitive to national public opinion, because they imagine themselves as vice presidents or presidents in-waiting,\" says Cleve Arguelles, a political scientist who runs WR Numero Research, which monitors public opinion.",
      "\"So, they are always trying to read the public mind, and side with public opinion because of their future political ambitions.\"",
      "In recent months public sentiment has not been on the president's side.",
      "Bongbong Marcos has never been a good public speaker, and his stage appearances in the campaign did little to lift his flagging popularity.",
      "His management of the economy, which is struggling, gets low marks in opinion polls, and his decision to detain former President Duterte and send him to the International Criminal Court is being portrayed by the Duterte family as a national betrayal.",
      "At an impromptu rally in Tondo, a low-income neighbourhood in Manila's port area, Sara Duterte played an emotionally-charged video of the moment her father was taken into custody at Manila's international airport and put on a private jet to The Hague. She portrayed this as unforgivable treatment of a still popular former president.",
      "\"They didn't just kidnap my dad, they stole him from us,\" she told the cheering crowd.",
      "Also on stage was President Marcos's elder sister Imee, who disagreed with the extradition and jumped ship to the Duterte camp \u2013 though most observers view this as a cynical move to capitalise on Duterte popular support, so she could lift her own flagging campaign to retain her senate seat.",
      "It worked. From polling low through much of the campaign, Imee Marcos managed to scrape into the \"magic twelve\", as they call the winning senators.",
      "What happens now is difficult to predict, but the Marcos camp certainly faces an uphill battle to get Sara Duterte impeached.",
      "Bongbong Marcos: The Philippine president battling the Dutertes",
      "Sara Duterte: The 'alpha' VP who picked a fight with Philippines' president",
      "Of the 24 senators, only a handful are automatically loyal to the president. The rest will have to be persuaded to go along with it, , and that won't be easy.",
      "This election has shown that the Dutertes still have very strong public support in some areas, and some in the Marcos election alliance are already on record as saying they oppose impeaching the vice-president. The same goes for the 12 senators who were not up for election this year.",
      "One bright spot for the president could be the surprise election of senators Bam Aquino and Francis Pangilinan, both from the liberal wing of politics.",
      "Few polls had predicted their wins, which suggest a public desire for politicians outside the Marcos-Duterte feud.",
      "Neither is a friend of the Marcos clan \u2013 liberals were the main opposition to the Marcos-Duterte team in the 2022 election.",
      "But they were strongly opposed to the strongman style of former President Duterte, and may fear his pugnacious daughter becoming president in 2028. That may be enough to get them to vote for impeachment.",
      "The impeachment trial is expected to start in July. The Dutertes can be expected to continue chipping away at the president's battered authority in public, and both camps will be lobbying furiously behind the scenes to get senators onto their side.",
      "No president or vice-president has ever been successfully impeached in the Philippines. Nor have any president and vice president ever fallen out so badly.",

      "After months of delays, a judge is hearing arguments both for and against Erik and Lyle Menendez's bid to receive a lesser sentence - which could ultimately lead to their paroled release.",
      "Prosecutors have argued the brothers meticulously planned the 1989 killings to access their parents' fortune, still have not taken accountability and should not be released. The brothers have said they acted out of self-defence after years of abuse and have been rehabilitated.",
      "The notorious case, which has prompted books, documentaries and dramas, still divides America.",
      "The brothers appeared virtually for the hearing, both wearing bright blue shirts and sitting in the same room. At the start of the hearing, they appeared upbeat and smiled, even waving to their legal team.",

She said they admitted they tried to steer their previous trial - with Lyle telling her he'd asked a witness to lie when testifying.",
      "\"They are very different men from the boys they were,\" she said.",

      "This was Depardieu's first trial on sexual assault charges. Several other women have made similar allegations in the media, and an alleged rape case could come to trial in the future.",
      "After the trial, the actor was invited to join his close friend and fellow actor Fanny Ardant for a film-shoot in the Azores.",
      "At the end of the trial in Paris in late March, prosecutor Laurent Guy said: \"It's perfectly possible to be an excellent actor and a great father - and still commit a crime.",
      "\"You are not here to pass judgment on French cinema. You are here to judge G\u00e9rard Depardieu, just as you would any other citizen.\"",

      "The second woman - a 34-year-old assistant film director - said the actor had touched her buttocks and breasts through her clothes on three separate occasions. She chose to maintain her anonymity and was not in court to hear the verdict.",
      "Depardieu denied the allegations, saying only that he might have touched the women accidentally or to keep his balance.",
      "At the end of the hearings, Depardieu said: \"My name has been dragged through the mud by lies and insults.",
      "\"A trial can be a very special experience for an actor. Seeing all this anger, the police, the press. It's like being in a science fiction film, except it's not science fiction. It's life.\"",
      "He thanked the prosecution and defence teams for giving him insights into how courts operate. \"These lessons may be an inspiration for me one day if I get to play a lawyer,\" he said.",
      "Depardieu said he had not worked as an actor for three years since the sexual allegations against him began to circulate.",

      "Coming on the heels of captain Rohit Sharma quitting a few days earlier, it adds up to a double whammy for India who embark on a tough tour of England for a five-Test series come June without their two most experienced batters.",
      "Like Sharma, Kohli took to Instagram, where he commands more than 270 million followers, to make his retirement public.",
      "\"As I step away from this format, it's not easy \u2013 but it feels right\u2026'' he explained to his disconsolate fans.",
      "Tributes for Kohli have come in a deluge since: from fellow cricketers, past and present, old and young, and also legends from other disciplines like tennis ace Novak Djokovic and football star Harry Kane, which highlights the sweep and heft of Kohli's global appeal.",
      "Leading India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in 2008, Kohli was fast tracked into international cricket by the then-chairman of selectors, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar, against the judgement of others in the cricket establishment.",
      "\"Many in the Indian cricket board felt he was too young but he was scoring heavily in domestic cricket, and the hunger to succeed was palpable in him,\" recalls Vengsarkar.",
      "An example of Kohli's obsessive passion for the sport comes imbued with poignancy. Kohli was playing his second Ranji Trophy match for Delhi. His father passed away suddenly with his team in a crisis. After the funeral, he went back and scored a battling 90.",
      "Vengsarkar's approving eye earned Kohli an ODI debut in 2009. At 23, he was the youngest member of India's 2011 ODI World Cup winning team under MS Dhoni. A few weeks later, he made his Test debut in the West Indies. Some months on, the disastrous tour of Australia with his place under threat, Kohli made a gritty maiden century and never looked back. Within a couple of years he established himself as the pre-eminent batter of his generation.",
      "Brash and provocative, without a benign muscle in his body, he was as volatile as potassium on water in his early years. He was unafraid to take on the most reputed opponents, often indulging in on-field fracases that sometimes earned him criticism.",
      "Happily, this was not to become his defining identity in cricket. Prolific run-getting in dashing style across formats provided another more compelling dimension and was to take him to the pinnacle.",
      "When his idol Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013, Kohli, allying unbridled ambition with his abundant skills, grabbed the baton hungrily and went on to sketch one of the most stellar careers in cricket history.",
      "He wielded the bat like a Jedi, with great skill and telling thrust to slay opponents, as it were. Coupled with his high-octane persona, his scintillating batting made him a cult hero whose very presence ensured blockbuster box-office returns everywhere he played.",
      "Kohli always wore his passion on his sleeve. He was always demonstrative and dramatic on the field but over a period of time, misplaced angst was sublimated into a raging inner pursuit of excellence that took him to dizzying heights.",
      "Marriage to film star Anushka Sharma made them the country's foremost power couple, putting both under the glare of even more intense spotlight.",
      "Metaphorically, Kohli's outstanding exploits, especially in the first decade of his career, epitomised the emerging India of the 21st century: unabashedly, unrelentingly ambitious, discarding all past demons, willing to take on the best in the world.",
      "His achievements across formats are monumental.",
      "In ODIs, he is third in run aggregate behind Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakarra, but boasts the best average (57.88) among batters who have played more than 100 games. His ability to win ODI matches in the most daunting run chases is the stuff of folklore, many of his record 51 centuries coming in such pursuit.",
      "In T20s, his run aggregate and centuries don't put him the top 5, but he's immortalised himself with incredible knocks, notably 82 not out in a emotion-charged, pulsating match against arch-rivals Pakistan in the 2022 World Cup and a vital 76 in the 2024 final against South Africa which helped India win the title.",
      "He is also the highest run scorer in the history of the Indian Premier League.",
      "At one point, Kohli averaged 50-plus in all three formats, making him the most productive and versatile batter of his era - way ahead of contemporaries Joe Root, Kane Williamson and Steve Smith. The four were locked in a fascinating, long-running race for batting supremacy.",
      "When it appeared he would break all batting records, Kohli's career took an inexplicable downturn. From the start of the pandemic, the flow of runs began to ebb and centuries became a trickle. In his pomp \u2013 between 2014 and 2019 \u2013 he had been unstoppable, at one time scoring six double centuries in just 18 months.",
      "The drought of runs hit him most adversely in Test cricket where his average, from a high of 55-plus in 2019 slumped to the current 46.75. In this period, Kohli also lost the captaincy, though his stellar standing in international cricket remained untouched.",
      "Kohli finishes his Test career with 9,230 runs, which puts him 19th overall in aggregate, and fourth among Indians behind Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar, all of whom finished with a 50-plus average and more centuries. But to judge him only on this yardstick would diminish the massive impact he has had on this format .",
      "As captain, Kohli easily hurdles over Gavaskar, Tendulkar and Dravid. In Test cricket, winning 40 of the 68 matches he led in, making him the fourth most successful in the format. In the Indian context, this assumes Himalayan proportions.",
      "Former Australia captain Greg Chappell says that Kohli's energy, grit, sense of purpose and aura was \"transformative\" for Indian cricket. Chappell marks him out as the most influential Indian captain, ahead of even Sourav Ganguly and M S Dhoni.",
      "Former India captain and chief coach Ravi Shastri, who collaborated with Kohli for years, gives first-hand perspective.",
      "\"Kohli made India into a fighting unit, especially when playing overseas,\" says Shastri.",
      "The lack of ICC and IPL titles according to Shastri, is misleading as an index to his  captaincy ability.",
      "\"He always played to win, sought and nurtured fast bowlers to win overseas, demanded high intent and supreme fitness from all players, putting himself in the forefront, not as a backseat driver.\"",
      "For seven years when Kohli and Shastri collaborated, India were in the top three in ICC rankings in all formats almost continuously which is unprecedented.",
      "The most cherished and significant triumph of  this period came in 2018 when India beat Australia in its own backyard in a Test series for the first time ever.",
      "Australia is where Kohli had launched himself into batting greatness, scoring 692 runs in four Tests in 2014-15. In 2018, he contributed as captain and batter to break an hitherto unassailable psychological barrier. In 2020 touring Australia, Kohli played only one match (which was lost) returning home for the birth of his child. But India, having overcome the mental barrier two years earlier, went on to win the rubber in a melodramatic see-saw series.",
      "Australia was Kohli's happy hunting ground and his last visit Down Under in late 2024 grabbed worldwide attention. He began with a roar, hitting  a century in the first test at Perth. But his form fizzled out alarmingly and made only 190 runs in the five Tests.",
      "How much this contributed to his decision to retire is moot. Advancing years, the dislike of being constantly under harsh scrutiny, wanting to be close to his young family and behind the scene shenanigans that abound in Indian cricket have doubtless played a part too.",
      "Kohli ends his retirement post on Instagram enigmatically.",
      "\"I'll always look back at my Test career with a smile. #269 signing off,\" he wrote.",
      "The greatest ambassador for the five-day format in the last decade and a half had moved into the sunset.",

    "summary": "William Ruto has the uncanny ability to attract numerous alternative handles, most are unflattering.",
    "story": [
      "Kenya's President William Ruto is a man of many nicknames.",
      "Deputy Jesus, El Chapo, Hustler and Chicken Seller are just some that he has acquired in recent years.",
      "As is often the case when people are given alternative monikers, some are affectionate but some are intended to mock and reflect a profound anger.",
      "A history of the president's aliases offer a window into how the perception of him has changed.",
      "Ruto has acknowledged the rechristening trend, joking recently that Kenyans are \"finishing\" him with the numerous labels.",
      "\"You have given me so many names. I had the name William Kipchirchir Samoei Ruto. You added Survivor\u2026 Zakayo... now you are at Kasongo (the title of a Congolese song about abandonment and heartbreak). Will you stop at ten, or should I prepare for more?\" he recently asked.",
      "The crowd, at a rally in the capital, Nairobi, responded that they had yet more.",
      "Before he was elected president in 2022, Ruto attracted handles that bolstered his reputation as a man of the people.",
      "Hustler - Kenyan parlance for someone eking out a living against the odds - helped portray him as someone who would prioritise the needs of the struggling folk.",
      "Chicken Seller, referring to his childhood when he hawked poultry on the roadside, resonated with many who saw his life as an epitome of their own.",
      "\"These were very positive [names]. They sold him to the public in terms of votes,\" political analyst Prof Herman Manyora told the BBC arguing that they helped catapult him into the top job.",
      "\"Names really stick with Ruto,\" he added.",
      "But the president has been a high-profile figure in Kenyan politics for a long time, including serving as deputy president for nine years up until 2022, and has never been far from controversy.",
      "Prof Manyora recalls the label Arap Mashamba \u2013 which translates as \"son of farms\" \u2013 coined just under a decade ago and relates to Ruto's ownership of vast tracts of land across the country. Concerns have been raised about how some of these have been acquired.",
      "In 2013, a court ordered Ruto to surrender a 100-acre (40-hectare) farm and compensate a farmer who had accused him of grabbing it during the 2007 post-election violence. He denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Ruto's penchant for quoting Bible verses also earned him the Deputy Jesus tag.",
      "However, it is since his rise to the presidency that the nickname manufacturers have been working overtime \u2013 with at least a dozen being created - and they have become increasingly critical.",
      "One that has stood out is Zakayo - Swahili for the name Zaccheaus, a Biblical figure who is portrayed as a greedy tax collector who climbed a tree to see Jesus.",
      "The \u2018tax collector\u2019 president sparking Kenyan angerBBC identifies security forces who shot Kenya anti-tax protesters",
      "The \u2018tax collector\u2019 president sparking Kenyan anger",
      "BBC identifies security forces who shot Kenya anti-tax protesters",
      "Ruto's government ntroduced a raft of unpopular taxes and many Kenyans began to say that he had betrayed the \"hustlers\".",
      "\"He failed to deliver after becoming president,\" Prof Manyora said.",
      "The pain of paying more taxes, and a perception that the extra money will be wasted,  is often the focus many conversations.",
      "Last year, young people came out onto the streets of Nairobi for weeks of protests, which turned deadly, against a fresh government proposal to raise taxes that was later dropped.",
      "The chant \"Ruto must go\" became a rallying call for the demonstrators and now Must Go has become another way to refer to the leader.",
      "The creative christeners have also focussed on the allegation that the president enjoys foreign travel.",
      "Hence the title Vasco da Ganya \u2013 a play on the name of the 15th Century Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, and the Swahili word danganya, which means \"to lie\".",
      "Africa's 'flying presidents' under fire",
      "Africa's 'flying presidents' under fire",
      "Ruto's honesty has also been called into question with Kaunda Uongoman, which mimics late Congolese musician Kanda Bongoman.",
      "The first part refers to the president's love for the Kaunda suit - a safari jacket with matching trousers \u2013 and Uongoman, which incorporates the Swahili word uongo, meaning \"lies\".",
      "But the president seems impervious to this volley of verbal attacks.",
      "Government spokesman Isaac Mwaura said the manifold nicknames \"don't raise concerns\" in the office of the president but simply \"capture how people view a person\".",
      "Ruto is \"very hands on and doing his best to transform the economy... It's normal for any leader to have many nicknames as this signifies his various attributes and initiatives as a leader\", he told the BBC.",
      "Mwaura also argued that in spite of the Zakayo nickname, the government has had to raise taxes to pay for new projects, reduce the budget deficit and fix the economy.",
      "Nevertheless, when people have gone beyond inventing new names and used satire and forms of art to ridicule the president, there has been a negative reaction from officials.",
      "Some cartoons and AI-generated images, including showing the president in a casket, have been described as \"reckless\" and \"distasteful\".",
      "Some of the alleged producers of this online content have been victims of abductions. This, Prof Manyora said, should been seen as a sign of intolerance by the government.",
      "Lachon Kiplimo, a 23-year-old university student, said that while he supported the president, some of the promises he has made are sometimes \"unrealistic\", which fuels the nicknames.",
      "He cited the use of El Chapo, referring to the former Mexican drug lord, after Ruto promised a machine that would produce a million chapatis (also known as chapo in Kenya) every day to feed schoolchildren in the capital.",
      "Mr Kiplimo however reckons that the way the president brushes off the monikers, and in fact seems to embrace them, shows how strong he is.",
      "Prof Manyora believes the young people who come up with the alternative labels for the president do it as a form of catharsis, a way of releasing tension.",
      "This view is backed up by 24-year-old student Margaret Wairimu Kahura, who said that many Kenyans \"are in a lot of pain\".",
      "She feels that the mockery is a way of letting Ruto know how the youth are feeling.",
      "She says that no other Kenyan president has been subjected to this level of lampooning, and \"so this is unique [but] in a bad way\".",
      "It is true that previous heads of state had had nicknames but they have not been so numerous.",
      "The last President, Uhuru Kenyatta, was called Kamwana (\"young boy\"), Jayden (a Kenyan reference to a pampered or lazy child) and Wamashati (for his love of print shirts).",
      "His predecessor, Mwai Kibaki, was known as General Kiguoya (a general who is afraid) and Fence Sitter.",
      "Perhaps the age of social media, with its insatiable appetite for new content to keep people amused has increased the trend towards name calling.",
      "But for many, like Ms Kahura, the volume of nicknames for Ruto are a genuine reflection of \"the different problems that people are facing\".",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e373yzndro",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 23:35:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Recent hostilities were a reminder of how easily a crisis could escalate into catastrophe.",
    "story": [
      "In the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons.",
      "Yet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre.",
      "Even scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with a nightmare scenario where a terrorist attack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan.",
      "Six years later, a real-world stand-off - though contained by a US-brokered ceasefire on Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be.",
      "As the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral.",
      "President Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a \"nuclear conflict\". On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \"[There] is no tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats.",
      "\"Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,\" Modi added.",
      "India and Pakistan each possess about 170 nuclear weapons, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons.",
      "The bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US.",
      "\"India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,\" he told the BBC.",
      "One reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the \"time or money\" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a \"clear qualitative\" edge in naval nuclear capability.",
      "Since testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine.",
      "India, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions.",
      "Further ambiguity emerged in 2016, when then\u2013defence minister Manohar Parrikar suggested India shouldn't feel \"bound\" by the policy, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)",
      "The absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developments offer clear clues to its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "Pakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation.",
      "In 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that \"nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India\", and would only be used if \"the very existence of Pakistan as a state\" was at stake.",
      "In his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\" who feared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weapons during the 2019 stand-off with India.",
      "Around the same time, Pakistani media quoted a senior official issuing a stark warning to India: \"I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surprise\u2026 You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region.\"",
      "During the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not \"hesitate to use any weapon\" to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal for possible deployment.",
      "But there is scepticism on both sides over such claims.",
      "Former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan \"knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory\" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts.",
      "\"Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,\" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC.",
      "But nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. \"This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,\" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC.",
      "In March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's government sacked three air force officers for the \"accidental firing of a missile\".)",
      "Yet, the danger of nuclear war remains \"relatively small\" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary.",
      "\"So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,\" he said.",
      "\"In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy.\" ('Use it or lose it' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)",
      "Sumit Ganguly, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, believes that \"neither India nor Pakistan wants to be labelled as the first violator of the post-Hiroshima nuclear taboo\".",
      "\"Furthermore, any side that resorts to the use of nuclear weapons would face substantial retaliation and suffer unacceptable casualties,\" Mr Ganguly told the BBC.",
      "At the same time, both India and Pakistan appear to be beefing up their nuclear arsenal.",
      "With new delivery systems in development, four plutonium reactors and expanding uranium enrichment, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal could reach around 200 warheads by the late 2020s, according to The Nuclear Notebook, researched by the Federation of American Scientists' Nuclear Information Project.",
      "And as of early 2023, India was estimated to have about 680kg of weapons-grade plutonium - enough for roughly 130-210 nuclear warheads, according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials.",
      "Despite repeated crises and close calls, both sides have so far managed to avoid a catastrophic slide into nuclear conflict. \"The deterrent is still holding. All Pakistanis did was to respond to conventional strikes with counter-conventional strikes of their own,\" writes Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst.",
      "Yet, the presence of nuclear weapons injects a constant undercurrent of risk - one that can never be entirely ruled out, no matter how experienced the leadership or how restrained the intentions.",
      "\"When nuclear weapons can be involved, there is always an unacceptable level of danger,\"John Erath, senior policy director at the non-profit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told the BBC.",
      "\"The Indian and Pakistani governments have navigated these situations in the past, so the risk is small.  But with nuclear weapons, even a small risk is too large.\""

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygyjy7kz5o",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 01:02:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Trade wars and volatile markets have contributed to a gold rush, but investors shouldn't put all their eggs in this one basket, warn experts",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this article",
      "\"What you have there is about \u00a3250,000 worth of gold,\" Emma Siebenborn says as she shows me a faded plastic tub filled with old, shabby jewellery - rings, charm bracelets, necklaces and orphaned earrings.",
      "Emma is the strategies director of Hatton Garden Metals, a family-run gold dealership in London's Hatton Garden jewellery district, and this unprepossessing tub of bric-a-brac is a small sample of what they buy over the counter each day. It is, in effect, gold scrap, which will be melted down and recycled.",
      "Also on the table, rather more elegantly presented in a suede-lined tray, is a selection of gold coins and bars. The largest bar is about the size and thickness of a mobile phone. It weighs a hefty 1kg, and it's worth about \u00a380,000.",
      "The coins include biscuit-sized Britannias, each containing precisely one ounce of 24 carat bullion, as well as smaller Sovereigns. These are all available to buy - and the recent surge in gold prices has led to a surge in demand.",
      "Zoe Lyons, who is Emma's sister and the managing director, has never seen anything like it \u2013 often she finds would-be sellers queuing in the street. \"There's excitement and buzz in the market but also nervousness and trepidation,\" she tells me.",
      "\"There's anxiety about which way the market is going to go next, and when you get those emotions, ultimately it creates quite big trades.\"",
      "At MNR jewellers a couple of streets away, a salesman agrees: \"Demand for gold has increased, definitely,\" he says.",
      "Gold is certainly on a roll. Its price has increased by more than 40% over the past year. In late April it rose above $3,500 (\u00a32,630) per troy ounce (a measurement for precious metals). This marked an all-time record, even allowing for inflation, exceeding the previous peak reached in January 1980. Back then the dollar price was $850, or $3,493 in today's money.",
      "Economists have attributed this to a variety of factors. Principal among them has been the unpredictable changes in US trade policy, introduced by the Trump administration, the effects of which have shaken the markets. Gold, by contrast, is seen by many as a solid investment. Fears about geopolitical uncertainty have only added to its allure. Many investors have come to appreciate the relative stability offered by a commodity once dismissed by the billionaire Warren Buffett as \"lifeless\" and \"neither of much use nor procreative\".",
      "\"It's the kind of conditions that we consider a bit of a perfect storm for gold,\" explains Louise Street, senior markets analyst at the World Gold Council, a trade association funded by the mining industry.",
      "\"It's the focus on potential inflationary pressures. Recessionary risks are rising, you've seen the IMF [International Monetary Fund] downgrading economic forecasts very recently\u2026\"",
      "But what goes up can also come down. While gold has a reputation as a stable asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations. In fact, in the past, major surges in the price have been followed by significant falls.",
      "So what is the risk this could happen again, leaving many of today's eager investors nursing big losses?",
      "What really triggered the goldrush",
      "Helped by its relative rarity, gold has been seen as an intrinsic store of value for centuries. The global supply is limited. Only around 216,265 tonnes have ever been mined, according to the World Gold Council, (the total is currently increasing by about 3,500 tonnes per year). This means that it is widely perceived as a \"safe haven\" asset that will retain its value.",
      "As an investment, however, it has both advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Unlike shares, it will never pay a dividend. Unlike bonds, it will not provide a steady, predictable income, and its industrial applications are relatively limited.",
      "The draw, however, is that it is a physical product that exists outside of the banking system. It is also used as an insurance policy against inflation: while currencies tend to lose value over time, gold does not.",
      "\"Gold can't be printed by central banks, and it can't be conjured out of thin air,\" says Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. \"In recent times, a big policy response from authorities when there's been a crisis has been: slash interest rates, boost money supply, quantitative easing, print money. Gold is seen as a haven from that, and therefore a store of value.\"",
      "There has recently been a significant rise in demand for gold from so-called Exchange Traded Funds, investment vehicles that hold an asset such as gold themselves, while investors can buy and sell shares in the fund.",
      "They are popular with large institutional investors \u2013 and their actions have helped to push up the price.",
      "When gold hit its previous record in January 1980, the Soviet Union had just invaded Afghanistan. Oil prices were surging, driving up inflation in developed economies, and investors were looking to protect their wealth. The price also rose sharply in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, leading to another peak in 2011.",
      "The recent increases appear to owe a great deal to the way markets have responded to the confusion triggered by the Trump administration.",
      "The most recent surge came after US President Donald Trump launched an online attack on Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve. Calling for immediate interest rate cuts, he described Mr Powell as a \"major loser\" for failing to reduce the cost of borrowing quickly enough.",
      "His comments were interpreted by some as an attack on the independence of the US central bank. Share markets fell, as did the value of the dollar compared to other major currencies \u2013 and gold hit its most recent record.",
      "But gold's recent strength is not wholly explained by the Trump factor.",
      "Fears of weaponisation of the dollar system",
      "The price has been on a steep upward curve since late 2022, partly, according to Louise Street, because of central banks. \"[They] have been net buyers of gold, to add to their official reserves, for the past 15 years,\" she explains. \"But we saw that really accelerate in the past three years.\"",
      "Central banks have collectively bought more than 1,000 tonnes of gold each year since 2022, up from an average of 481 tonnes a year between 2010 and 2021. Poland, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan and China were among the leading buyers last year.",
      "Analysts say central banks may themselves have been trying to build up buffers at a time of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty.",
      "According to Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs: \"In 2022 the reserves of the Russian Central Bank got frozen in the context of the invasion of Ukraine, and reserve managers of global central banks around the world realised, 'Maybe my reserves aren't safe either, what if I buy gold and hold it in my own vaults?'",
      "\"And so we have seen this big structural fivefold increase in demand for gold from central banks\".",
      "Simon French, chief economist and head of research at investment firm Panmure Liberum also believes that independence from dollar-based banking systems has been a major driver for central banks. \"I would look at China, but also Russia, their central bank is a big buyer of gold, also Turkey.",
      "\"There are a number of countries who fear weaponisation of the dollar system and potentially the Euro system,\" he says.",
      "\"If they are not aligning themselves with the US or the Western view, on diplomatic grounds, on military grounds\u2026 having an asset in their central bank that is not controlled by their military or political foes is quite an attractive feature.\"",
      "Another factor may now be helping to drive the gold market upwards: FOMO, or fear of missing out. With new all-time records being set, it has filtered through into everyday conversation in some quarters.",
      "Zoe Lyons believes that this is the case in Hatton Garden. \"[People] want a piece of the golden pie,\" she says, \"and they're willing to do that through buying physical gold.\"",
      "Safe, but for how long?",
      "The big question, though, is what happens next. Some experts believe the upward trend will continue, fuelled by unpredictable US policy, inflationary pressures and central bank buying. Indeed Goldman Sachs has forecast gold will reach $3,700/oz (\u00a32,800/oz) by the end of 2025 and $4,000 (\u00a33,000) by mid 2026.",
      "But it adds that in the event of a recession in the US or an escalation of the trade war it could even hit $4,500 (\u00a33,400) later this year.",
      "\"The US stock market is 200 times bigger than the gold market, so even a small move out of the big stock market or the big bond market would mean a big percent increase in the much smaller gold market,\" explains Daan Struyven.",
      "In other words, it wouldn't take a huge amount of turbulence in major investment markets to drive gold upwards.",
      "Yet others are concerned that the price of gold has risen so far, so fast that a market bubble is forming \u2013 and bubbles can burst.",
      "Back in 1980, for example, the dramatic spike in the gold price was followed by an equally remarkable correction, dropping from $850 (\u00a3640) in late January to just $485 (\u00a3365) in early April. By mid-June the following year, it stood at just $297 (\u00a3224) \u2013 a decline of 65% from its peak.",
      "The peak in 2011, meanwhile, was followed by a sharp dip, then a period of volatility. Within four months it had dropped by 18%. After plateauing for a while, it continued to fall, reaching a low point in mid-2013 that was 35% down from its highest.",
      "The question that remains is, could something similar happen now?",
      "Could the bubble burst?",
      "Some analysts do think prices will ultimately fall significantly. Jon Mills, an industry expert at Morningstar, made headlines in March when he suggested the cost of an ounce of gold could drop to just $1,820 over the next few years.",
      "His view was that as mining firms increased their production and more recycled gold entered the market, the supply would increase. At the same time central banks would ease off their buying spree, while other short-term pressures stimulating demand would subside, bringing prices down.",
      "Those forecasts have since been revised upwards slightly, largely because of increased mining costs.",
      "Daan Struyven disagrees. He believes there could be a short-term dip, but prices will generally continue to rise. \"If we were to get a Ukraine peace deal, or a rapid trade de-escalation, I think hedge funds would be willing to take some of their money out of gold and put it into risky assets, such as the stock market\u2026",
      "\"So you could see temporary dips. But we are quite confident that in this highly uncertain geopolitical setup, where central banks want safer reserve holdings, that they will continue to push demand higher over the medium term.\"",
      "Russ Mould believes there will, at the very least, be a lull in the upwards trend. \"Given that it has had such a stunning run, it would be logical to expect it to have a pause for breath at some stage,\" he says.",
      "But he believes that if there is a sharp economic slowdown and interest rates are slashed, the gold price could go higher in the long run.",
      "There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",
      "The curious case of why a billionaire wants to buy Royal Mail",
      "David Dimbleby: I thought the free market was with us forever - then Trump came along",
      "One problem for investors is working out whether the recent record price for gold was simply a staging point in a continued upward climb \u2013 to more than $4,000 for example \u2013 or the peak.",
      "Simon French at Panmure Liberum believes the peak may now be very close, and people piling into the market now in the hope of making big money are likely to be disappointed. Others have warned that those recently lured into buying gold by hype and headlines could lose out if the market goes into reverse.",
      "\"Short-term speculating can backfire, even though there will be a temptation to hang on to the coat-tails of the record run upwards,\" is how Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, has put it.",
      "\"Investors considering investing in gold should do so as part of a diversified portfolio \u2013 they shouldn't put all their eggs in a golden basket.\"",

    "story": [
      "I grew up in Nepal's capital watching the Himalayas. Ever since I left, I've missed sweeping, panoramic views of some of the highest mountain peaks on Earth.",
      "Each time I visit Kathmandu, I hope to catch a glimpse of the dramatic mountain range. But these days, there's usually no luck.",
      "The main culprit is severe air pollution that hangs as haze above the region.",
      "And it's happening even during the spring and autumn months, which once offered clear skies.",
      "Just last April, the international flight I was in had to circle in the sky nearly 20 times before landing in Kathmandu, because of the hazy weather impacting visibility at the airport.",
      "The hotel I checked in at was at a reasonable height from which mountains are visible on a clear day \u2013 but there was no such day during my two-week stay.",
      "Even from the major vantage point of Nagarkot, just outside Kathmandu, all that could be seen was haze, as if the mountains did not exist.",
      "\"I no longer brand the place for views of 'sunrise, sunset and Himalayas' as I did in the past,\" said Yogendra Shakya, who has been operating a hotel at Nagarkot since 1996.",
      "\"Since you can't have those things mostly now because of the haze, I have rebranded it with history and culture as there are those tourism products as well here.\"",
      "During an earlier trip a year ago, I was hopeful I would be able to see the mighty Himalayan peaks on a trek in the mesmerising Annapurna region \u2013 but had hardly any luck there either.",
      "Scientists say hazy conditions in the region are becoming increasingly intense and lasting longer, reducing visibility significantly.",
      "Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change.",
      "June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low.",
      "Traditionally, March to May and October to November were the best times for business because that was when skies remained clear and visibility was best.",
      "But with rising temperatures and a lack of rain, and worsening air pollution, the spring months are now seeing thick haze with low visibility. Those conditions are beginning as early as December.",
      "'No sighting means no business'",
      "Lucky Chhetri, a pioneering female trekking guide in Nepal, said hazy conditions had led to a 40% decrease in business.",
      "\"In one case last year, we had to compensate a group of trekkers as our guides could not show them the Himalayas due to the hazy conditions,\" she added",
      "An Australian tourist who has visited Nepal more than a dozen times since 1986 described not seeing the mountains as a \"major let-down\".",
      "\"It wasn't like this 10 years ago but now the haze seems to have taken over and it is extraordinarily disappointing for visitors like me,\" said John Carrol.",
      "Krishna Acharya, the provincial chair of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal in the western Gandaki province, says the trekking industry is in deep trouble.",
      "\"Our member trekking operators are getting depressed because no sighting of the Himalayas means no business. Many of them are even considering changing professions,\" he told the BBC.",
      "On the Indian side, near the central Himalayas, hoteliers and tour operators say haze is now denser and returns quicker than before.",
      "\"We have long dry spells and then a heavy downpour, unlike in the past. So with infrequent rain the haze persists for much longer,\" said Malika Virdi, who heads a community-run tourism business in the state of Uttarakhand.",
      "However, Ms Virdi says tourists are persistent - with many who didn't catch the mountain range returning to try their luck again.",
      "The western Himalayas in Pakistan have been relatively less affected by the haze because the mountains are relatively far from cities.",
      "But locals say that even the ranges that were once easily visible from places like Peshawar and Gilgit are often no longer seen.",
      "\"The sheet of haze remains hanging for a longer period and we don't see the mountains that we could in the past,\" said Asif Shuja, the former head of Pakistan's environmental protection agency.",
      "Hazes and dust storms increasing",
      "South Asian cities regularly top lists of places with highest levels of air pollution in the world.",
      "Public health across the region has been badly impacted by the toxic air, which frequently causes travel disruption and school closures.",
      "Vehicular and industrial emissions, dust from infrastructure construction and dry gravel roads as well as the open burning of waste are major sources of air pollution year-round.",
      "This is compounded by soot from massive forest fires - which are increasing due to a longer dry season - and the burning of crop residues after the harvest by farmers in northern India, Pakistan and Nepal.",
      "Weather conditions keeping warmer air above cooler air trap these pollutants and limit vertical air movement - preventing pollution from dispersing.",
      "\"Hazes and dust storms are increasing in South Asia, and this trend is projected to continue due to climate change and other factors,\" Dr Someshwor Das from the South Asia Meteorological Association told the BBC.",
      "In 2024, the number of hazy days recorded at the airport in Pokhara, a major tourism hub in western Nepal, was 168 - up from 23 in 2020 and 84 in 2021, according to Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology.",
      "Experts believe the Himalayas are probably the worst affected mountain range in the world given their location in a populous and polluted region.",
      "This could mean the scintillating view of the Himalayas could now largely be limited to photographs, paintings and postcards.",

      "Those in the know, then, are not surprised that US President Donald Trump - known for his unorthodox diplomacy - has touched a raw nerve in Delhi.",
      "On Saturday, he took to social media to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\", brokered by the US.",
      "Later, in another post he said: \"I will work with you both to see if, after a thousand years, a solution can be arrived at, concerning Kashmir.\"",
      "The Kashmir dispute dates back to 1947, when India got independence from British rule and was partitioned to create Pakistan. Both neighbours claim the Kashmir region in whole, but administer it only in part.",

      "While US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels, prevented a bigger conflagration, President Trump's offer has put Delhi in a spot.",
      "\"Obviously, it would not be welcome by the Indian side. It goes against our stated position for many years,\" Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary, tells the BBC.",

      "President Trump's recent comments have irked many Indians, who see this as an attempt to \"internationalise\" the Kashmir dispute.",

      "\"Kashmir is one of the most critical issues for the international community. The recent rapid escalation proves that the sabre-rattling can go out of hand,\" Mr Ali says.",
      "India's assertive diplomacy, particularly since Modi took over in 2014, has been seen as a sign of its confidence as a rising global economic power.",
      "But it will have to pull off a tough balancing act, to stave off Trump's advances.",
      "The US has courted India in recent years as a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. India is a key member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue group (Quad), along with the US, Australia and Japan, that was formed to counter Chinese expansionism in the Indo-Pacific.",

      "The previous American administrations were aware of India's sensitivities towards the Kashmir issue and largely stayed away from interfering with it. But with Trump, there's a question mark over whether that position still holds.",
      "The US is the largest trading partner of India with bilateral trade reaching about $130bn (\u00a398bn) in 2024. Modi's government is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington to avoid tariffs.",

      "Any attempt to broaden the talks - on contentious bilateral issues like the now suspended river water-sharing treaty or the status of Kashmir - will invite strong criticism at the domestic level, a trap that Modi is well aware of."

      "\"The consensus from both delegations this weekend is neither side wants a decoupling,\" said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during a press conference in Geneva.",
      "\"And what had occurred with these very high tariffs... was the equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade.\"",
      "Economists admit that this agreement is better than expected.",
      "\"I thought tariffs would be cut to somewhere around 50%,\" Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management in Hong Kong, told Reuters news agency.",
      "But in fact, US tariffs on Chinese imports will now fall to 30%, while Chinese tariffs on US goods will drop to 10%.",
      "\"Obviously, this is very positive news for economies in both countries and for the global economy, and makes investors much less concerned about the damage to global supply chains in the short term,\" he added.",
      "Trump hailed the progress on Sunday on his Truth Social site: \"Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner.\"",
      "Beijing has also softened its tone considerably\u2013 and perhaps for good reason.",
      "China can take the pain of an economic war with America \u2013 to an extent. It is the lead trade partner for more than 100 other countries.",
      "But officials have become increasingly concerned about the impact the tariffs could have on an economy that is already struggling to deal with a property crisis, stubbornly high youth unemployment and low consumer confidence.",
      "Factory output has slowed and there are reports that some companies are having to lay off workers as production lines of US-bound goods grind to a halt, bringing trade to a standstill.",
      "Data on Saturday showed China's consumer price index dropped 0.1 percent in April, the third month in a row of decline as consumers hold back from spending and businesses drop prices to compete for customers.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said on Monday that the agreement reached with the US was an important step to \"resolve differences\" and \"lay the foundation to bridge differences and deepen cooperation\".",
      "Such a positive statement from Beijing would have seemed inconceivable just a month ago.",
      "The two sides have also agreed to more talks, or an \"economic and trade consultation mechanism\", as Beijing puts it.",
      "But Trump's characterisation of a \"total reset\" in relations may be overly optimistic as there is a slight sting in the tail in Beijing's statement.",
      "The Commerce Ministry ended with a reminder of who it sees as being in the wrong.",
      "\"We hope that the US will continue to work with China to meet each other halfway based on this meeting, thoroughly correct the wrong practice of unilateral tariff increases,\" said the spokesperson.",
      "Chinese state media also had a warning for Washington. Xinhua News Agency's commentary claimed China's \"goodwill and patience has its limits, and it will never be used on those who repress and blackmail us without pause or have no qualms about going back on their word\".",
      "Leaders in Beijing will want to portray an image of strength both to its own people and to the international community. They will want to appear as if they have not budged an inch.

      "This \"victory\" is only for 90 days. The tariffs are only paused temporarily to allow for negotiations.",
      "It will allow some trade to flow, and it will soothe worried markets.",
      "But the root of the problem still exists. China still sells far more to the United States than it buys. And there are other, far thornier differences to unpick, from Chinese government subsidies, to key industries, to geopolitical tensions in the Taiwan Strait and beyond.",
      "The fight for a more balanced trade relationship is far from over \u2013 it has simply moved.",
      "The frontline has shifted from China's factory floors and American supermarkets to negotiating tables in both Beijing and Washington."

    "story": [
      "The US and China have agreed a truce to lower import taxes on goods being traded between the two countries.",
      "The agreement marks a major de-escalation of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies, which has sent shockwaves impacting countless other countries, including the UK.",
      "Here's what it all means.",
      "What has been announced?",
      "Both the US and China have confirmed a reduction in the tariffs they imposed on each other following the initial escalation by President Donald Trump earlier this year.",
      "The deal involves both nations cancelling some tariffs altogether and suspending others for 90 days, by 14 May.",
      "The result is that additional US tariffs on Chinese imports - that's the extra tariffs imposed in this recent stand-off - will fall to from 145% to 30%, while recently-hiked Chinese tariffs on some US imports will fall from 125% to 10%.",
      "China has also halted and scrapped other non-tariff countermeasures, such as the export of critical minerals to the US, which it put in place in response to the initial escalation.",
      "The US measures still include an extra 20% component aimed at putting pressure on Beijing to do more to curb the illegal trade in fentanyl, a powerful opioid drug.",
      "The announcement came after the two countries held talks in Switzerland, the first between the two countries since Trump sparked the latest tariff war.",
      "What happens after 90 days?",
      "Trying to predict the next steps in this ongoing trade war between the US and China  these past few months has been difficult to say the least.",
      "But this is a major agreement between the world's two powerhouse economies and has been broadly welcomed.",
      "Even if the suspended tariffs are reinstated after 90 days, because the vast majority of the tariffs that were announced after Liberation Day have been cancelled, US tariffs on China would only rise to 54% and Chinese tariffs on the US would rise to 34%.",
      "However, talks between both governments are set to continue, so a further deal might be struck.",
      "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the consensus from both countries was that \"neither side wants a decoupling\", while China's commerce ministry said the agreement was a step to \"lay the foundation to bridge differences and deepen co-operation\".",
      "So relations between the US and China are sounding more friendly, but as we've seen so far during this Trump presidency, things can change quickly.",
      "What goods do the US and China trade with each other?",
      "In a word - lots.",
      "In 2024, the biggest category of goods exported from the US to China were soybeans \u2013 primarily used to feed China's estimated 440 million pigs. The US also sent pharmaceuticals and petroleum.",
      "Meanwhile, China exported large volumes of electronics, computers and toys.",
      "The biggest category of US imports from China is smartphones, accounting for 9% of the total. A large proportion of these smartphones, Apple iPhones, are made in China.",
      "However, the US buys much more from China ($440bn) than it sells to it ($145bn), which is something Trump has long been unhappy with.",
      "His reasoning in part for introducing tariffs, and higher ones on countries which sell more to the US than they buy, is to encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and boost manufacturing jobs.",
      "The escalating trade war in recent months has led to a collapse in the amount of goods being shipped across the Pacific Ocean, but investors believe the truce will lead to a rebound, with shares up for some of the world's biggest shipping firms.",
      "Has either side won?",
      "Politicians on both sides have started and will no doubt continue to claim victory over this truce.",
      "Despite the US and China calling this a joint agreement, people in Beijing will interpret it as the Trump administration walking back from the tariffs, according to Janka Oertel, director of the Asia programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"We are back to square one, now negotiating can begin. The outcome is uncertain but China is in a psychologically stronger position now than before,\" she said.",
      "The US will argue its tariff rate on Chinese imports, although lower, is still hefty at 30%.",
      "\"This trade deal is a win for the United States, demonstrating President Trump's unparalleled expertise in securing deals that benefit the American people,\" a White  House statement said.",
      "Economists at Deutsche Bank have suggested the lowering of tariffs, and last week's UK-US deal on them, means there's both \"a likely cap and floor\" to Trump's rates.",
      "\"The UK has one of the least imbalanced relationships with the US and now has a universal tariff rate of 10%. China has one of the most imbalanced relationships and now has a tariff rate of 30%,\" said George Saravelos, head of FX research at the investment bank.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 May 2025 22:02:09 GMT",
    "summary": "The president promises sweeping price cuts \"almost immediately\", but experts say these are unlikely.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to reduce high prescription drug prices \u2013 but its details and long-term effects are far from clear.",
      "Citing figures that patients in other countries pay much less than Americans for pharmaceuticals, Trump said he would order drug companies to reduce their prices inside the US.",
      "He touted the move as \"one of the most consequential\" executive orders in US history, claiming prices would fall \"almost immediately, by 30% to 80%\".",
      "But experts are highly sceptical of the claims, and stock market moves indicate that investors think they will have little immediate effect.",
      "Why are American drug prices so high?",
      "The US has a particularly complex healthcare system - including a large private insurance industry, employer subsidies, and publicly funded insurance programmes for the elderly and poor, known as Medicare and Medicaid respectively.",
      "In many other developed countries, more centralised systems mean that officials can negotiate blanket rates for drugs, and in some cases refuse to buy if they deem the price too high.",
      "In 2021, the US Government Accounting Office made a comparison with Australia, Canada and France, and found that prescription drugs were on average two to four times more expensive in the US.",
      "Politicians from both US political parties have taken aim at the costs. During Monday's White House announcement, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr noted that prices had been a preoccupation of Democrats and a main target in socialist Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns.",
      "Both Trump in his first term and former President Joe Biden tried to tackle the issue, particularly the cost of life-saving drugs such as insulin, but US prices remain stubbornly high.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump and his health officials blamed the lack of progress on pharmaceutical lobbying efforts and large donations to members of Congress.",
      "\"The drug lobby is the strongest lobby,\" Trump told reporters. \"But starting today, the United States will no longer subsidise the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing.\"",
      "It should also be noted that Trump's trade tariffs \u2013 which he has consistently used to threaten other countries - could increase costs even further. Trump has previously said he will tax drugs imported into the US.",
      "What was in Trump's order?",
      "Trump's order is much wider than previous efforts to bring down costs - however, many details are yet to be worked out.",
      "The wording directs US officials to make sure that deals over drug costs made by foreign countries do not result in \"unreasonable or discriminatory\" price hikes for Americans.",
      "But what exactly is covered by those terms is unclear \u2013 as is the question of what measures the White House would take if \"unreasonable\" practices are discovered.",
      "The White House also wants drug companies to sell more products directly to consumers - cutting out insurance companies and pharmaceutical benefit managers - and look into importing drugs from foreign countries where they are sold at lower prices. That idea has previously hit stumbling blocks over safety and trade rules.",
      "An official said that Monday's order was the start of negotiations between the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and industry.",
      "What is Most Favoured Nation status?",
      "The order also proposed that the US be given Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status \u2013 meaning drug companies would be asked to match the lowest price for a drug abroad when selling to US consumers.",
      "\"Big pharma will either abide by this principle voluntarily or we'll use the power of the federal government to ensure that we are paying the same price as other countries,\" Trump told reporters.",
      "It was unclear what mechanism the White House would use to punish drug companies that refuse to voluntarily comply.",
      "Drug prices are very opaque, according to Alan Sager, a professor of health policy at Boston University. Drug manufacturers could easily argue that they were complying with the order by touting the price discounts that they already routinely provide on very high listed retail prices, he told the BBC.",
      "\"Will they act? Maybe. Will they claim they act? Sure,\" Prof Sager said.",
      "\"Whether this will signal a durable and meaningful cut in extraordinarily high US drug prices is very unclear,\" he said. \"This is rhetoric, not reality.\"",
      "How did markets react?",
      "Trump's preview of the announcement hit share prices of major drug makers, such as Pfizer, Eli Lilly and the UK's GSK.",
      "But they staged a quick recovery, rallying after the administration shared the scope of its plans \u2013 an indication that investors do not expect the moves to have a major impact.",
      "What else could hinder Trump's plan?",
      "To try to retain their profits in the US, drugs companies could simply pull out of other nations in which they are selling their products more cheaply, according to researchers Darius Lakdawalla and Dana Goldman at the University of Southern California.",
      "The researchers also said that foreign governments routinely underestimated the true value of drugs to patients, and that \"shifting to a European pricing model in the US would lead to shorter, less healthy lives for Americans\".",
      "Meanwhile, it is unclear how lower prescription drug prices would fit into Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda. The health secretary has consistently emphasised diet and exercise as the key to improving Americans' health \u2013 and has criticised the proliferation of many pharmaceutical products, including vaccines and drugs to treat mental illness.",
      "However, any potential reduction in drug prices is likely to be popular with Americans - as polls consistently show that high costs are a top concern when it comes to the US healthcare system.",
      "C Michael White, a pharmacy professor at the University of Connecticut, said that the results of the Trump administration's actions on drug prices \"will be minimal for many Americans\" but that any attempts towards greater transparency and lower costs \"are a positive step in the right direction\".",
      "But the order is expected to face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in courts and Congress.",
      "What does industry say?",
      "Industry groups are largely opposed to the executive order and say it will be counterproductive \u2013 potentially choking off the supply of drugs and funds for research while doing little to quell high costs.",
      "Stephen J Ubl, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement that \"importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal\" for American patients.",
      "John F Crowley, president of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, called MFN status \"a deeply flawed proposal that would devastate our nation's small- and mid-size biotech companies\" by potentially choking off funding for research.",
      "\"Patients and families are not a bargaining chip in a trade war, but that's exactly how they are being treated \u2013 first through proposed tariffs on our nation's medicines, now with foreign reference pricing in the name of fairness.\"",
      "But Alan Sager, the Boston University professor, was sceptical about the industry's arguments. He pointed out that the money used to research a drug was spent before any profits were made, and suggested that there might be other ways to fund research - such as large cash prizes for cures for specific diseases.",
      "Prof Sager suggested that real action to drive down drug prices would depend on the president's attention span.",
      "\"Given the president's apparent public vacillation on many topics, it just isn't clear that he'll stay with this problem or that he'll be willing and able to act effectively,\" he said.",

      "The man approaching us was placed under sanctions by Britain and the EU last year after they said he had used  \"physical aggression, threatened families at gunpoint, and destroyed property as part of a targeted and calculated effort to displace Palestinian communities\".",
      "In a case reported by our colleagues at BBC Eye Investigates last year, a Palestinian grandmother alleged that Moshe Sharvit had forced her to leave her family home in October 2023. Ayesha Shtayyeh also said he pointed a gun at her head and threatened to kill her.",

      "She said her family's troubles began after Moshe Sharvit established a so-called 'outpost'- a settlement that is illegal under both Israeli and international law - chasing away the family's sheep, damaging property and constantly threatening them. The alleged incident with the gun was the final straw.",
      "Moshe Sharvit did not respond to BBC Eye's requests for a response to Ayesha's account.",
      "Back on the mountainside, the man accused of this violence stopped his car and approached us. Nodding towards Gil Alexander he asked us: \"Do you know he's a very dangerous guy?\"",
      "When our translator explained to Moshe Sharvit we were from the BBC he said: \"Ah the BBC\u2026 great lovers of Israel\u2026\" He went on to call us bad and dangerous people.",
      "Addressing our translator he said: \"So, do you understand that they're the people who are most dangerous to the State of Israel?\"",
      "Then he phoned the police, asking them to come to the scene. When he wasn't calling the police he filmed us filming him.",
      "Moshe Sharvit and Gil Alexander represent starkly different visions of Israel's future.",
      "Moshe Sharvit believes all of the West Bank - which settlers and the Israeli government call Judea and Samaria - were given by God to the Jews.",
      "In this he is supported by senior ministers in the government, including the Minister of Finance, Bezalel Smotrich, and the Minister of Public Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir. Both men are settlers and leaders of far-right ultranationalist parties.",
      "Smotrich has said Gaza will be \"totally destroyed\" and that its people will be \"totally despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places\".",
      "The 'other places' he envisages are foreign countries. Ben-Gvir, who is responsible for the police, has convictions for inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organisation.",
      "Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, relies on the support of the far-right settler movement to keep his government in power.",
      "He criticised the sanctions imposed on Moshe Sharvit and other settlers, saying his government viewed the move \"with great severity\". US sanctions against Moshe Sharvit were dropped when President Donald Trump came to power.",
      "The UN's top court ruled last year that Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories is against international law and that all settlement activity is illegal.",
      "Israel rejects this and argues that settlements are necessary for security, citing lethal attacks by Palestinian gunmen on settlers, such as the killing of three people last January in the West Bank.",
      "Settlement expansion is anathema to Gil Alexander. He considers himself a Zionist, but within the existing borders of Israel.",
      "These are the frontiers that existed before it seized the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war.",
      "He is part of a network called the Jordan Valley Activists \u2013 Moshe Sharvit calls them \"anarchists\" - offering solidarity, and working for peaceful co-existence with the Palestinians.",
      "\"What they [the settlers] want to see happen,\" Gil Alexander told us, \"[is] that it will be an area completely free of Arabs. It isn't Moshe. It's all the people above him who sent him here. Meaning from the top\".",
      "Moshe Sharvit's desire to have the Jordan Valley empty of Palestinians is shared by the leader of the regional council, a government-supported body, David Elhayani, who has visited the sanctioned settler.",
      "In his air conditioned office about 15km (9 miles) from Moshe Sharvit's settler outpost he told us \"the notion of settler violence is an invention of the anarchist, extreme left meant to harm the settlement image\".",
      "As for the future of the Palestinians, he was emphatic. They should go to neighbouring Jordan.",
      "\"This country needs to be free of Arabs. It's the only way. It's a global interest. Why global? Because the minute there won't be Arabs here it will be a Jewish nation for the Jews who won't have to hurt each other, there won't be conflict, there won't be anything.\"",
      "Gil Alexander and Moshe Sharvit have a history of antagonism. During an altercation on a Palestinian farmer's land in January 2023, Moshe Sharvit says Gil Alexander tried to seize his firearm from its holster.",

      "He says he feared Moshe Sharvit was going to use the weapon. As a result, Moshe Sharvit got a restraining order which forbids Gil Alexander from being within 2.5km (1.5 miles) of his farm.",
      "The police have charged Gil Alexander with illegal possession of a weapon (the one he allegedly tried to take from Moshe Sharvit) and assault. The issue will be considered by the Israeli courts.",
      "Moshe Sharvit himself is the subject of a restraining order forbidding him to approach a Palestinian family living near his outpost for six months, since March this year.",
      "During our encounter the settler claimed that Gil Alexander had breached his restraining order by taking us to the high ground overlooking the valley. The peace activist told us later that he had mistakenly strayed just over half a kilometre inside the area of the order.",
      "Although Moshe Sharvit's settlement is illegal, even under Israeli law, it has not been removed.",
      "Human rights organisations and numerous eyewitnesses testify that the Israeli army and police frequently stand by while settlers attack Palestinian villages.",
      "The violence has escalated sharply since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 kidnapped, and which triggered the Gaza war.",
      "According to a report issued by the UN office for Humanitarian Affairs there were 1,804 attacks by settlers against Palestinians in the period January 2024 to March 2025.",
      "The Israeli human rights group, Yesh Din (There is Law), reported that only 3% of complaints made against settlers resulted in a conviction. In six days last month - from 22 to 28 April - the UN recorded 14 incidents involving settlers that left 36 Palestinians injured.",
      "In the tense atmosphere on the mountainside, and wanting to avoid any escalation, we decided to leave.",
      "As we walked away, Moshe Sharvit went to his jeep and drove ahead of us, stopping where the track turned down the mountain. Our way out was blocked. There was no-one we could appeal to apart from the man preventing us from leaving.",
      "Again, he phoned the police asking them to come. Gil Alexander phoned the police and his lawyer. Our team was worried that more settlers would come.",
      "Then something surprising happened. I suggested to Moshe Sharvit that he should agree to be interviewed. After a brief pause, he said: \"Bring the camera.\"",
      "What followed was less an interview, than a series of declarations. He was doing the work of God, he said.",
      "Why did local Bedouin shepherds say they were very afraid of him? I asked.",
      "\"No, that is a lie. They're telling stories so the world will think we're crazy. It's not true. It's all lies that are built on lies of dozens of years of lying\u2026\" he said.",
      "\"The Arabs, since the formation of the country and before - all the past 77 years they've been preoccupied with harming the people of Israel, harming the land of Israel and causing the nation of Israel to be miserable and pitiful. But they don't understand that the harder they try, the Lion will wake from his sleep and within one day we'll end this story.\"",
      "He repeated the analogy of the Lion later in the interview saying, in what sounded like ominous words, that the Palestinians were \"pushing the lion so hard into the corner that there will be no choice left but to finish this story\".",
      "\"7 October was small. One day it'll be big.\"",
      "As for peaceful co-existence such as Gil Alexander supports, he said there was \"no such thing as peace with enemies who try to destroy you\".",
      "Moshe Sharvit's brother Harel was killed fighting in Gaza in December 2023.",
      "His world is the pastureland, the stony hills of the Jordan Valley, his sheep and cattle, the bed and breakfast he has opened.",
      "He produced a glossy video, replete with a backing track of American country music, to promote his venture.",
      "He spoke with contempt for the British sanctions against him. They were a new kind of antisemitism, he claimed.",
      "\"The minute someone tries to hurt me I get stronger. My spirit\u2026I receive energies, my spirit continues on its mission, I continue advancing forward and planting roots deep into the land of Israel. I'm not bothered by Britain or America or anyone.\"",
      "Then he drove away. We were free to move on. Later as we were having lunch in a caf\u00e9 about 15km (nine miles) away, a policeman appeared, looking for Gil Alexander.",
      "He went with the police officer for questioning. After about an hour he returned, telling us he had been ordered not to enter the Jordan Valley for two weeks. He plans to lodge his own complaint against Moshe Sharvit over the incident.",
      "We went to Gil Alexander's home in a kibbutz inside Israel that overlooks the Valley. Gunmen from the Palestinian city of Jenin fired at the kibbutz two years ago.",
      "Gil Alexander is not a pacifist. If he is attacked by Hamas or any other group, he will defend himself.",
      "He said: \"A son of our friends, two months ago he was killed here by a terrorist. He was a soldier in the reserves, 46 years old with six children. He volunteered for the reserves to protect me.\"",
      "\"If the army hadn't been there, they would have come here. He was killed while defending me. And today he is buried next to my two sons.\"",
      "But Gil Alexander seemed weary as we sat drinking tea amid the bright red flowers of his well-tended garden, and the fluttering yellow flags that symbolise Israel's hostages held in Gaza.",
      "He spoke of a beloved nephew killed fighting in Lebanon in an earlier war.",
      "Did he not, I wondered, at the age of 72, think about retiring from the struggle and enjoying his garden? He laughed.",
      "There was no chance of that. After two of his sons took their own lives \u2013 one was in the army, the other was about to enter the military \u2013 he had found a purpose in working for what he calls the \"humanitarian\" ideals of Judaism.",

    "summary": "Many children in a Brazil town lost the ability to walk, so one scientist set about discovering why.",
    "story": [
      "Before Silvana Santos arrived in the little town of Serrinha dos Pintos more than 20 years ago, residents had no idea why so many local children had lost the ability to walk.",
      "The remote town in north-eastern Brazil is home to fewer than 5,000 people, and is where biologist and geneticist Santos identified and named a previously unknown condition: Spoan syndrome.",
      "Caused by a genetic mutation, the syndrome affects the nervous system, gradually weakening the body. It only appears when the altered gene is inherited from both parents.",
      "Santos's research marked the first time the disease had been described anywhere in the world. For this and later work, she was named one of the BBC's 100 most influential women in 2024.",
      "Before Santos arrived, families had no explanation for the illness affecting their children. Today, residents talk confidently about Spoan and genetics.",
      "\"She gave us a diagnosis we never had. After the research, help came: people, funding, wheelchairs,\" says Marquinhos, one of the patients.",
      "Serrinha dos Pintos: a world of its own",
      "Where Santos is from in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil's largest and wealthiest city, many of her neighbours were members of the same extended family originally from Serrinha. Many of them were cousins of varying degrees, married to each other.",
      "They told Santos that many of people in their hometown couldn't walk, but that no-one knew why.",
      "One of the neighbours' daughters, Zirl\u00e2ndia, suffered from a debilitating condition: as a child, her eyes moved involuntarily and over time, she lost strength in her limbs and needed to use a wheelchair, requiring help with even the simplest tasks.",
      "Years of investigation would lead Santos and a research team to identify these as symptoms of Spoan syndrome.",
      "They would go on to find 82 other cases worldwide.",
      "At the invitation of her neighbours, Santos visited Serrinha on holiday. She describes her arrival as stepping into \"a world of its own\" - not just because of the lush scenery and mountain views, but also due to what seemed to be a notable social coincidence.",
      "The more she walked and spoke with locals, the more surprised she was at how common marriages between cousins were.",
      "Serrinha's geographical isolation and little inward migration mean that many of the population are related, making marriage between cousins far more likely and more socially acceptable.",
      "Worldwide, marriages between relatives were estimated at around 10% in the early 2010s. More recent data shows the rate varies widely, from over 50% in countries like Pakistan, to 1-4% in Brazil and less than 1% in the US and Russia. Most children born to pairs of cousins are healthy, experts say.",
      "But these marriages do face a higher risk of a harmful genetic mutation being passed down through the family.",
      "\"If a couple is unrelated, the chance of having a child with a rare genetic disorder or disability is about 2\u20133%. For cousins, the risk rises to 5\u20136% per pregnancy,\" explains geneticist Luzivan Costa Reis from Brazil's Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.",
      "A 2010 study led by Santos showed that more than 30% of couples in Serrinha were related, and a third of them had at least one child with a disability.",
      "Long road to diagnosis",
      "Santos set out to find a diagnosis for the people of Serrinha and she began planning a detailed genetic study, requiring multiple trips and eventually leading to her relocating to the region.",
      "She drove the 1,250 miles (2,000km) to and from S\u00e3o Paulo many times in the early years of her research. She collected DNA samples door-to-door, chatting to locals over coffee and gathering family stories, all the while trying to locate the mutation causing the disease.",
      "What was supposed to be three months of fieldwork turned into years of dedication.",
      "It all led to the publication in 2005 of the team's study revealing the existence of Spoan in the Brazilian hinterland.",
      "Santos's team found that the mutation involves the loss of a small fragment of a chromosome, which causes a gene to overproduce a key protein in brain cells.",
      "\"They said it came from Maximiano, a womaniser in our family,\" recalls farmer Lol\u00f4, whose daughter Rejane has Spoan.",
      "Lol\u00f4, now 83, married his cousin and never left Serrinha. He still tends cattle and relies on family to care for Rejane, who struggles with daily tasks.",
      "But the genetic mutation behind Spoan is far older than the legend of Old Maximiano: it likely arrived more than 500 years ago with early European settlers in the north-east of Brazil.",
      "\"Sequencing studies show strong European ancestry in patients, supporting records of Portuguese, Dutch, and Sephardic Jewish presence in the region,\" says Santos.",
      "The theory gained strength after two Spoan cases were found in Egypt, and further studies showed that the Egyptian cases also shared European ancestry, pointing to a common origin in the Iberian Peninsula.",
      "\"It likely came with related Sephardic Jews or Moors fleeing the Inquisition,\" says Santos. She believes more cases may exist globally, especially in Portugal.",
      "Understanding the risks",
      "Although there's been little progress toward a cure, tracking patients has brought some change. Rejane recalls how people used to be called \"cripples\". Now, they're simply said to have Spoan.",
      "Wheelchairs brought not just independence, but also helped prevent deformities - in the past, many with the condition had been left simply lying in bed or on the floor.",
      "As Spoan progresses, physical limitations worsen with age and by 50, nearly all patients become fully dependent on carers.",
      "This is the case for In\u00e9s's children, who are among the oldest in Serrinha. Chiquinho, 59, can no longer speak, and Marquinhos, 46, has limited communication abilities.",
      "\"It's hard to have a 'special' child. We love them the same, but we suffer for them,\" says In\u00e9s, who is married to a second cousin.",
      "Larissa Queiroz, 25, the niece of Chiquinho and Marquinho, also married a distant relative. She and her husband, Saulo, only discovered their common ancestor after several months of dating.",
      "\"In Serrinha dos Pintos, deep down, we're all cousins. We're related to everyone,\" she says.",
      "Couples like Larissa and Saulo are the focus of a new research project which Santos is also involved in. Backed by Brazil's Ministry of Health, it will screen 5,000 couples for genes linked to serious recessive diseases.",
      "The goal is not to stop cousin marriages, but to help couples understand their genetic risks, says Santos. Now a university professor, she also leads a genetics education centre and works to expand testing in the north-east of Brazil.",
      "Though she no longer lives in Serrinha dos Pintos, every visit feels like coming home.",
      "\"It's as if Santos is family,\" says In\u00e9s."

      "Hopkins kept busy part of the time with his job cleaning Alcatraz, sweeping the floors and buffing them \"until they shined\", he said.",
      "He was sent to prison in 1952 in Jacksonville, Florida, for his role in a series of robberies and kidnappings. He was part of a group that took hostages to get through roadblocks and steal cars, he said.",
      "The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon",
      "The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon",
      "At Alcatraz, Hopkins had some infamous neighbours. The facility housed many violent criminals over its 30 years - Al Capone; Robert Stroud, a murderer known as the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\"; and crime boss James \"Whitey\" Bulger - making it the subject of a host of films and television shows.",
      "A 22-acre island, 1.25 miles (2km) off San Francisco and surrounded by freezing waters with strong currents, Alcatraz was originally a naval defence fort. It was rebuilt in the early 20th century as a military prison. The US Justice Department took it over in the 1930s, transforming the facility into a federal prison to address rampant organised crime at the time.",
      "Even in the high-security prison, Hopkins said he still managed to get into trouble and spent many days in the facility's \"D Block\" - solitary confinement where inmates who misbehaved were held and rarely let out of their cells.",
      "His longest stint there - six months - came after he tried to help several other prisoners, including notorious bank robber Forrest Tucker, escape Alcatraz, Hopkins said. He helped steal hacksaw blades from the prison's electric shop to cut the prison bars in the basement kitchen.",
      "The plan didn't work - prison guards discovered the blades in other inmates' cells, Hopkins said. \"A few days after they locked them up, they locked me up,\" he said.",
      "But that did not stop one of the inmates.",
      "In 1956, when Tucker was taken to a hospital for a kidney operation, he stabbed his ankle with a pencil so prison guards would have to remove his leg irons, Tucker told the New Yorker. Then, as he was taken to get an X-ray, he overpowered hospital orderlies and ran away, he said.",
      "He was captured in a hospital gown in a cornfield hours later.",
      "As more prisoners attempted to escape Alcatraz over the years, officials ramped up security, Hopkins said.",
      "\"When I left there in 1958, the security was so tight you couldn't breathe,\" he said.",
      "All told, there were 14 separate attempts over the years involving 36 inmates, according to the National Park Service.",
      "One of the most famous involved Frank Morris, and brothers Clarence and John Anglin, who escaped in June 1962 by placing papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads in their beds and breaking out through ventilation ducts. They were never found, but the FBI concluded that they drowned in the cold waters surrounding the island.",
      "A year later, the prison shut down after the government determined it would be more cost-effective to build new prisons than to keep the remote island facility in operation.",
      "Now it's a publicly run museum visited by millions each year that generates about $60m (\u00a345m) a year in revenue for park partners.",
      "The building is decrepit, with peeling paint, rusted pipes, and crumbling toilets in each cramped cell. Construction on the main prison facility began in 1907, and more than a century of exposure to the elements has rendered the place all but uninhabitable.",
      "Trump said this week, however, that he wants his government to re-open and expand the island prison for the country's \"most ruthless and violent offenders\".",
      "Alcatraz \"represents something very strong, very powerful\" - law and order, Trump said.",
      "But experts and historians said Trump's proposal to re-establish the prison is far-fetched, as it would cost billions to repair and bring up to date with other federal facilities.",
      "Hopkins agrees. \"It would be so expensive,\" he said.",
      "\"Back then, the sewage system went into the ocean,\" he added. \"They'd have to come up with another way of handling that.\"",
      "Hopkins left Alcatraz five years before it closed down for good. He had been transferred to a prison in Springfield, Missouri and given psychiatric medication that improved his behaviour and helped him heal psychological issues, he said.",
      "But the avid Trump supporter said he does not believe the president's proposal is serious.",
      "\"He don't really want to open that place,\" Hopkins said, adding that Trump was trying to \"get a point across to the public\" about punishing criminals and those who enter the US illegally.",
      "Hopkins was released in 1963, working first at a truck stop before taking on other jobs. He went back to his home state of Florida, where now he has a daughter and grandson.",
      "After several decades reflecting on his crimes and life in Alcatraz, he wrote a 1,000-page memoir, with nearly half of the book detailing his troubled behaviour, he said.",
      "\"You wouldn't believe the trouble I caused them when I was there,\" he said. \"I can see now, looking back, that I had problems.\"",

    "summary": "It is a safeguard against unlawful imprisonment - but the White House is \"actively looking\" at pausing it.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump's administration is \"actively looking at\" suspending habeas corpus, the principle that a person should be able to challenge their detention in court.",
      "Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, says the legal principle is a \"privilege\" that could be suspended to make it easier to detain and deport immigrants.",
      "Recent court challenges by migrants and dissenting students who have been held in immigration detention centres have cited habeas corpus as a reason for their release.",
      "But what the legal procedure does - and what could happen if it were to be suspended - is complex.",
      "What does habeas corpus mean?",
      "Scholars say the principle that a person should not be illegally imprisoned pre-dates the Magna Carta, and has been a cornerstone of the legal system in the UK, US and other democratic countries around the world for centuries.",
      "Roughly translated from Latin, habeas corpus means \"you should have the body\" - as in, a person must be able to appear before a court so that a judge can assess if that person has been lawfully detained.",
      "Also known as the \"Great Writ of Liberty\", habeas corpus grants prisoners the right to challenge their imprisonment in a court of law.",
      "Is habeas corpus a right in the US Constitution?",
      "Article One of the US Constitution states that \"the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\".",
      "While this is the only time habeas corpus is mentioned in the Constitution, it has become an important part of US law - and has frequently been fought over in the courts, including the US Supreme Court.",
      "Has habeas corpus been suspended before?",
      "Abraham Lincoln became the first US president to suspend habeas corpus in 1861, during the American Civil War.",
      "That led to a showdown with Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, who said it was Congress - not the executive branch of government - that had the power to suspend the writ.",
      "Lincoln continued to suspend habeas corpus in specific incidences, according to the National Constitution Center, and in 1863 Congress approved suspending it for the duration of the war when \"the public safety may require it\".",
      "It was also suspended several times in the years following the Civil War, during the Reconstruction period, to quash rebellions by the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan group.",
      "After the bombing of Pearl Harbour by the Japanese in World War Two, habeas corpus was suspended in Hawaii, which paved the way for the arrest of Japanese Americans on the island.",
      "What do modern courts say about habeas corpus?",
      "The courts have found that both US citizens and non-citizens have the right to habeas corpus. In 2008, the US Supreme Court extended this to include non-citizens detained in a foreign prison - such as Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.",
      "But just because prisoners have the right to challenge their detention, it does not guarantee they will be able to leave custody.",
      "Succeeding with a habeas corpus petition is extremely rare - most people who are detained have been detained for lawful reasons, courts have generally found.",
      "Asadullah Haroon Gul was the first Guantanamo detainee to win a habeas corpus petition in 2021. He was transferred back to Afghanistan more than a decade after the US Supreme Court found that detainees had habeas corpus privileges.",
      "But as Trump's administration has ramped up arrests of illegal immigrants and student dissenters, habeas corpus has received renewed legal interest.",
      "In April, the Supreme Court ruled that migrants being deported under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act must be given enough notice of their removal to file petitions. It temporarily blocked some deportations in Texas for this reason.",

    "summary": "During a 40-year screen career, Robert Benton received six Oscar nominations and won three times.",
    "story": [
      "Robert Benton, the Oscar-winning filmmaker who helped reset the rules in Hollywood as the co-creator of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" and later received mainstream validation as the writer-director of \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and \"Places in the Heart,\" has died at age 92.",
      "Benton's son, John Benton, said that he died Sunday at his home in Manhattan of \"natural causes.\"",
      "During a 40-year screen career, the Texas native received six Oscar nominations and won three times: for writing and directing \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and for writing \"Places in the Heart.\" He was widely appreciated by actors as attentive and trusting, and directed Oscar-winning performances by Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and Sally Field. Although severe dyslexia left him unable to read more than a few pages at a time as a child, he wrote and directed film adaptations of novels by Philip Roth, E.L. Doctorow and Richard Russo, among others.",
      "Benton was an art director for Esquire magazine in the early 1960s when a love for French New Wave movies and old gangster stories \u2014 and news that a friend got $25,000 for a Doris Day screenplay \u2014 inspired him and Esquire editor David Newman to draft a treatment about the lives of Depression-era robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, imagining them as prototypes for 1960s rebels.",
      "Their project took years to complete as Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard were among the directors who turned them down before Warren Beatty agreed to produce and star in the movie. \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" directed by Arthur Penn and starring Beatty and Faye Dunaway, overcame initial critical resistance in 1967 to the film's shocking violence and became one of the touchstones of 1960s culture and the start of a more open and creative era in Hollywood.",
      "The original story by Benton and Newman was even more daring: they had made Clyde Barrow bisexual and involved in a 3-way relationship with Bonnie and their male getaway driver. Beatty and Penn both resisted, and Barrow instead was portrayed as impotent, with an uncredited Robert Towne making numerous other changes to the script. \"I honestly don't know who the 'auteur' of 'Bonnie and Clyde' was,\" Benton later told Mark Harris, author of \"Pictures at a Revolution,\" a book about \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and four other movies from 1967.",
      "Over the following decade, none of Benton's films approached the impact of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" although he continued to have critical and commercial success. His writing credits included \"Superman\" and \"What's Up, Doc?\" He directed and co-wrote such well-reviewed works as \"Bad Company,\" a revisionist Western featuring Jeff Bridges, and \"The Late Show,\" a melancholy comedy for which his screenplay received an Oscar nomination.",
      "His career soared in 1979 with his adaptation of the Avery Corman novel \"Kramer vs. Kramer,\" about a self-absorbed advertising executive who becomes a loving parent to his young son after his wife walks out, only to have her return and ask for custody. Starring Hoffman and Streep, the movie was praised as a perceptive, emotional portrait of changing family roles and expectations and received five Academy Awards, including best picture. Hoffman, disenchanted at the time with the film business, would cite \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and Benson's direction for reviving his love for movie acting.",
      "Five years later, Benton was back in the Oscars race with a more personal film, \"Places in the Heart,\" in which he drew upon family stories and childhood memories for his 1930s-set drama starring Fields as a mother of two in Texas who fights to hold on to her land after her husband is killed.",
      "\"I think that when I saw it all strung together, I was surprised at what a romantic view I had of the past,\" Benton told The Associated Press in 1984, adding that the movie was in part a tribute to his mother, who had died shortly before the release of \"Kramer vs. Kramer.\"",
      "Benton was born in Waxahachie, Texas, outside of Dallas. He owed his early love for movies to his father, telephone company employee Ellery Douglass Benton, who, instead of asking about homework, would take his family to the picture shows. The elder Benton would also share memories of attending the funerals of outlaws Barrow and Parker, Texas natives who grew up in the Dallas area.",
      "Robert Benton studied at the University of Texas and Columbia University, then served in the U.S. Army from 1954 until 1956. While at Esquire, Benton helped start the magazine's long-standing Dubious Achievement Award and dated Gloria Steinem, then on staff at the humor magazine Help! He married artist Sallie Rendigs in 1964. They had one son.",
      "Between hits, Benton often endured long dry spells. His latter films included such disappointments as the thrillers \"Billy Bathgate,\" \"The Human Stain\" and \"Twilight.\" He had much more success with \"Nobody's Fool,\" a wry comedy released in 1994 and starring Paul Newman, in his last Oscar-nominated performance, as a small-town troublemaker in upstate New York. Benton, whose film was based on Russo's novel, was nominated for best adapted screenplay.",
      "\"Somebody asked me once when the Academy Award nominations came out and I'd been nominated, 'What's the great thing about the Academy Awards?'\" Benton told Venice magazine in 1998. \"I said, 'When you go to the awards and you see people, some of whom you've had bitter fights with, some of whom you're close friends with, some people you haven't seen in ten years, some people you just saw two days before \u2014 it's your family.' It's home. And home is what I've spent my life looking for.\"",

      "Ventura is a critical witness in the prosecution's case against Combs, who has been accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and exploiting women for decades until his\u00a0arrest\u00a0on multiple charges last September. The music mogul could receive a lifetime prison sentence if convicted on all of them.",
      "Ventura's testimony will likely last the rest of the week. Here are some key takeaways from it so far.",
      "Violence occurred \"frequently\"",
      "In her initial statements before the court, Ventura, now pregnant with her third child and married to personal trainer Alex Fine, recalled her and Combs' early interactions and how she started to see a different side of him over time. She said she met Combs when she was a newly signed singer at 19, and their burgeoning friendship became romantic two years later.",
      "She also described his alleged violence throughout their 10-year on-off relationship, recounting instances where he knocked her over, kicked and dragged her, and stomped on her head, causing black eyes and bruises on her body. When asked, Ventura said the abuse she endured happened \"frequently.\"",
      "Combs is seen attacking Ventura in video footage CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0last year, which shows him throwing her to the floor, kicking and dragging her in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel.",
      "\"Control was everything\"",
      "Ventura characterized Combs as physically and psychologically abusive throughout the first hours of her testimony.",
      "\"Control was everything \u2014 from the way that I looked, to what I was working on that day, who I was speaking to,\" she said. \"Control was an all-around thing to a certain point.\"",
      "Combs allegedly introduced Ventura to \"freak offs,\" drug-fueled events where he is accused of forcing women to perform sex acts with hired sex workers, which were a focus of the indictment outlining his alleged crimes.",
      "Ventura said Combs broached the idea of sexual encounters involving voyeurism during the first year of their relationship, and he would hire an escort or dancer with whom he would watch her engage while he directed them. The singer testified she felt confused and nervous, \"but I also loved him very much and wanted to make him happy.\"",
      "She testified she worried about making Combs angry because of how much control he had over her life and career, and the possibility that he could blackmail her by releasing images of the \"freak offs.\" Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Combs often recorded these performances with or without participants' consent.",
      "A shift in the relationship",
      "Ventura recalled Combs looking out for her when she first met him. They fell in love, she said, while spending time together in the studio or traveling elsewhere.",
      "\"I think I was just enamored by him. We were just having a good time. It was really fun at this point,\" she told the court. But as her appearance, transportation, rent and overall lifestyle came under Combs' control, Ventura said her music career \u2014 and record deal \u2014 eventually took a backseat to the alleged \"freak offs,\" which left her feeling humiliated.",
      "She testified that despite recording hundreds of songs and nine albums while she was with Combs, the work was never released because \"freak offs\" became her job. They took up too much time and energy to leave room for other pursuits, Ventura said, adding that she would stay up for several days at a time to party, drink and have sex with strangers.",

      "Who is Cassie Ventura? Hotel video a key piece of evidence",
      "Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, rose to fame with the single \"Me & U\" on her self-titled debut album. The song landed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in 2006.",

      "Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. The suit also said Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the footage.",
      "\"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,\" Ventura said in a statement to CBS News at the time. \"With the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\"",

    "summary": "Kim Kardashian took the witness stand at the Paris trial of 10 people who stand accused over a 2016 robbery in the French capital during which she was held at gunpoint.",
    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 Kim Kardashian\u00a0took the witness stand for four-and-a-half hours Tuesday in the trial over the 2016 armed robbery in which a masked gang made off with $10 million worth of her jewelry as she visited the French capital. Kardashian testified that one member of the gang pulled her to him while she was in just a bathrobe.",
      "\"I was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,\" Kardashian said. \"I absolutely did think I was going to die,\" she added.",
      "\"I thought about my sister, thought she would walk in and see me shot dead and have that memory in her forever,\" she told the court, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Kardashian testified the robbery happened at around 3 a.m. at her hotel. She was in bed about to fall asleep when she heard people stomping up the stairs and then entering her bedroom wearing police uniforms.",
      "Kardashian said that once they got inside her suite, the masked thieves pointed a gun at her.",
      "\"Then I heard one of the gentlemen forcefully say, 'Ring! Ring!' in English, with an accent, pointing,\" she told the court, according to Reuters, apparently referring to the $4 million diamond ring given to her by her then-husband Kanye West, now known as Ye. The couple\u00a0settled for divorce\u00a0in 2022.",
      "\"It was at the end of the bed, so he grabs my leg and pulls me toward him on the bed so the robe is opened and everything is exposed,\" Kardashian said. \"And that was the moment when I thought he would rape me. But he ended up tying me up and closed my legs.\"",
      "During Tuesday's testimony, Kardashian also responded directly to one of the defendants after she was read an apology letter in court.",
      "\"I forgive you,\" Kardashian told Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the man alleged to be the brains behind the robbery, after his lawyer read a letter to the court sent by his client to the celebrity a year after the robbery, in which he said he was sorry.",
      "At the central Paris courthouse where the trial is taking place, there was intense security and crowd control measures in place. The court opened early to allow journalists and members of the public access ahead of Kardashian's afternoon appearance.",
      "Flanked by four bodyguards, Kardashian entered the courthouse by the rear entrance. As she mounted the stone steps, she turned, took off her dark sunglasses and smiled at the gathered crowd of fans, curious passersby and press photographers.",
      "Dressed in black, with her hair up in a chignon, the celebrity was accompanied by her mother, Kris Jenner.",
      "The hearing was not broadcast publicly, as France rarely allows cameras in courtrooms. Some 400 reporters applied to attend the trial, but there were only 40 places allocated for media inside the courtroom. A side room was set up for 200 more journalists to watch a live transmission from inside the courtroom.",
      "After giving evidence all afternoon, Kardashian left the courthouse with her mother and bodyguards, without speaking to the crowds of fans and press waiting for her.",
      "Kardashian's lawyers said she was determined to testify in person about the night she was allegedly tied up and robbed at gunpoint while she was in Paris for Fashion Week. Ten people \u2014 nine men and a woman \u2014 face charges including robbery and kidnapping against the American media personality and the concierge of the residence where she was staying on the night of Oct. 2, 2016.",
      "Before the celebrity took the stand herself, her longtime friend-turned-stylist Simone Harouche told the court on Tuesday that she heard Kardashian begging for her life during the attack in the hotel suite they were sharing.",
      "\"'I have babies and I need to live!' That is what she kept on saying, 'Take everything. I need to live,'\" Harouche told the court. \"I was scared that she was raped or violated. I thought the worst.\"",
      "Prosecutors have told the court that when the gang, dressed as police officers, arrived at the luxury suites hotel known only as \"The No Address\" where Kardashian was staying, they demanded that the concierge, at gunpoint, guide them to \"the rapper's wife,\" a reference to her then-husband.",
      "In interviews and on her family's reality TV show, Kardashian has described being terrified during the intrusion, thinking she was going to be raped and killed.",
      "\"They dragged me out to the hallway on top of the stairs, that's when I saw the gun, like clear as day,\" she said on her show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" adding: \"It makes me so upset thinking about it.\"",
      "The robbers, some of whom escaped on bicycles, have been dubbed \"the Grandpa robbers\" as most of the suspects were in their 60s at the time of the heist.",
      "As they fled, they dropped a diamond and platinum cross that was found the next morning by a local resident. The rest of the haul has not been recovered.",
      "The DNA of two of the accused was found at the scene, and they have admitted taking part in the robbery. Khedache, now 69, is accused of masterminding the heist. Known as \"Old Omar,\" he reportedly told investigators he had no idea who Kardashian was, but had heard from a waiter friend about the amazing jewelry she wore when she was out dining in Paris.",
      "Khedache wrote to Kardashian in 2017, while he was in custody, to apologize. Her lawyers said he wrote after he heard her speak of how traumatic the experience had been.",
      "\"I want to reach out to you as a human being to tell you how much I regret my actions, how much I was moved and touched to see your tears,\" Khedache wrote. \"Of course, we cannot undo the past but I hope this letter will make you gradually forget the traumatism you experienced through my fault.\"",
      "Kardashian wept as she listened, then said: \"I appreciate the letter. I forgive you for what happened. That said, it doesn't change my trauma nor the fact that my life was changed forever.\"",
      "Khedache responded: \"Your forgiveness is like the sun lighting me up. Thank you.\"",
      "Yunice Abbas, the 71-year-old who has already admitted in court that he was the lookout, told Kardashian: \"I formally, sincerely apologize.\"",
      "In court on April 29, he expressed \"total regret\" for his part in the heist. He said he understood afterward that, \"when you steal a lady's purse, it can be traumatic\" for her.",
      "A police officer who testified for the prosecution told the court Kardashian appeared \"traumatized\" in the immediate aftermath of the robbery.",
      "Lawyers for some of the accused expressed concern as the trial opened last month that Kardashian's fame would distract from the essentials of the case.",
      "Chloe Arnoux, who represents Khedache, told reporters: \"He is, in fact, rather worried about seeing all you, journalists, because he is afraid that his case will not be treated the same way it would be if there were not such a famous person involved in it.\"",
      "Kardashian's lawyer Michael Rhodes said in April that the reality TV star and entrepreneur had \"tremendous appreciation and admiration for the French judicial system,\" and \"wishes for the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion in accordance with French law and with respect for all parties to the case.\"",

      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu was convicted Tuesday of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in Paris in 2021 and handed an 18-month suspended sentence. The 76-year-old actor had denied the charges that he forcefully groped a set decorator and an assistant producer on the set of \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\").",
      "Depardieu was not in court for the verdict or sentencing on Tuesday, as he's currently filming in Portugal. His lawyer said he would appeal the verdict.",
      "Depardieu was accused by a set decorator, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, who said the actor grabbed and groped them during filming in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "\"I am deeply moved, I'm very happy with this decision,\" the assistant producer, identified in court only as Am\u00e9lie, said after Tuesday's decision was handed down. \"It is a victory for me, a step forward. Justice was served, I feel.\"",
      "Taking the stand in March for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses, but after the Depardieu published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court in March that Depardieu was diabetic and had undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse in March, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They said they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all.\"",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",

      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"freak offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",
      "2016 hotel security video",
      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"freak off.\" Combs' lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said.",
      "Jury selection",
      "A jury of 12 jurors and six alternates was sworn in on Monday.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers.",
      "It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial.",
      "Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors.",
      "In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\" nor acknowledge \"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\"",
      "They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\"",

      "TV, film and media executive Barry Diller spent a decade at ABC, where he helped popularize the made-for-TV \"Movie of the Week.\" In his new memoir, \"Who Knew\" (to be published on May 20 by Simon & Schuster), Diller writes about his career, including a lesson about the limitations of too much information \u2013 when instinct (for, like, what makes an intriguing Movie of the Week?) may be a better predictor of success.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Tracy Smith's interview with Barry Diller on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" May 11!",
      "\"Who Knew\" by Barry Diller",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We were good on titles in the early days",
      "Women in Chains was one of my favorites; it was a horrible movie, but what a promotable title.",
      "Scream, Pretty Peggy wasn't bad, either.",
      "Sometimes the staff would ask, \"Is it commercial?\" and I would brutalize them, because rather than using their instincts, they were trying to predict the public's appetite, which I said then and say now, over and over again, simply isn't possible. Neither is using research to help make decisions. No amount of research on ideas is worth the paper (or computer screen) it's printed on. Data can tell you what has happened, not what can or will happen.\u00a0Data is often harmful to instinct, and I believe this to be true for making not only creative decisions but many business decisions. PowerPoint can be the enemy; structured information often narrows the sieve just when you need to broaden it out in the spaces between information and real understanding. Overtraining our brains on data alone doesn't confer an advantage, and it can be a deterrent if it's the only decision-making component. That's often the problem with MBA students, who come armed with all the business tools and case studies but little simple human instinct. I do not believe that using instinct rather than deep, hard numerical or fact-based data to help with decision-making is the lazier process. Too much information can overload, overcomplicate, and obscure what is at the essence of any proposal: Is it a good idea, and does it make any common sense?",
      "You rarely get the perfect project or the perfect script. In all my experience I probably haven't read ten scripts out of a thousand that are so fully realized, so utterly and incontrovertibly great that you just scream, \"Make it!\" One of those, though, was the day in 1970 that Leonard Goldberg, who had recently moved on from ABC to run a large television production company, called up and said, \"You must read this script right now.\" It was called Brian's Song, the story of the deep bond between a Black and a white pro football player, one who will die of cancer. I wept as I read it. I called him up and said, \"We can only screw it up from here\u2014it's perfect\u2014let's go.\" Often referred to as one of the finest television films ever made\u2014and one of the greatest sports films as well\u2014it was nominated for nine Emmys and won five. Another of those few times, Dan Curtis, a leading ABC daytime producer, sent me a manuscript of an as-yet-unpublished novel called The Kolchak Papers. I read it in two or three hours\u2014it was the contemporary tale of a vampire in Las Vegas\u2014and I told Dan, \"This is as good a story as I've ever read.\" And what a great idea: Las Vegas, a city most alive at night\u2014the perfect place for a vampire to live.",
      "Out of that novel we made The Night Stalker, which turned out to be so good that we held a screening for the senior ABC management, who all said, \"That's a great movie. We should release it theatrically!\" I fought against that, saying, \"Yes, it's a great movie, but it's a Movie of the Week, and that's where it belongs.\" We aired the film in early January 1972, and it became ABC's highest-rated Movie of the Week, drawing about 50 million people, a record. The Night Stalker spawned a sequel (The Night Strangler) and a television series (Kolchak: The Night Stalker), and it was followed by two more made-for-TV movies and a subsequent remake of the series.

    "summary": "In his combination business memoir and personal journey, the former media exec opens up about topics he had vowed never to talk about, including his early relations with men, as well as his decades-long relationship with designer Diane von Furstenberg.",
    "story": [
      "Last week, a few steps from Manhattan's Little Island, the people enjoying sunshine on the High Line took little notice of the man who helped create this corner of the world, the legendary businessman Barry Diller.",
      "\"When you're up here, even though you're not up very high, you really are elevated, [with] a totally different perspective of the city,\" Diller said.",
      "Talk about different perspectives: At 83, Diller himself is now inviting people to take another look at him. Next week he'll release his memoir, more than ten years in the making. In \"Who Knew\" he names plenty of names, tells wild stories, and bares his soul about things he says he'd vowed never to talk about in public.",
      "In his preface he writes, \"When I was young, I was far too afraid. I'm no longer that. And I'm too old to care.\"",
      "Afraid of what? \"I was afraid of secrets being revealed,\" he said. \"I was afraid of, I thought I didn't qualify. I think, just afraid of revealing myself.\"",
      "Diller says he was in grade school when he first realized he might be gay. \"Eleven or twelve years old, or 13, I got on my bike, and I rode down to the Beverly Hills Public Library. And I looked for books on homosexuality. And everything I read was, like, horrible. And I got on my bike and I rode home and thought, I'm a condemned person. I mean, for a little kid, that's not great.\"",
      "He had his first sexual encounter at age 16. I asked, \"Did you tell your friends? Did you tell anybody about it?\"",
      "\"Of course not! Are you kidding? I didn't tell myself,\" Diller replied. \"I mean, I thought \u2013 oh, what did I think? I thought, Oh, I did that. I don't have to do it again.\"",
      "\"I did this thing with a guy, but that's the end of it?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, I don't need to do that again,\" Diller said. \"And then a month later, I did. And then I knew.\"",
      "But at the time, he thought it best to keep it a secret. He vowed never to lie about it, only to keep it quiet. He writes that, through his life, his sexuality was like an \"anvil on a wire\" hanging over his head. \"Yes, because I was afraid,\" he said. \"Listen, this is in the '60s and '70s. Well, I think probably I was being realistic that, first of all, my sexuality was confused. And I thought, Well, if I reveal it, what am I actually gonna reveal?",
      "\"I didn't want to risk what a lot of other people had risked, even at that time. I mean, talking about homosexuality, talking about bi-, whatever sexuality is, was something that scared the hell out of me,\" he said.",
      "In private, Diller lived in fear of being found out, but in public he was one of the gutsiest leaders in the game. As a junior executive at ABC, he pioneered the highly-successful movie of the week, and later created the even-more successful TV miniseries, with landmark events such as \"Roots.\"",
      "When \"Roots\" first aired in 1977, more than half the U.S. population tuned in. \"You really were having 30 to 40 to 50,000,000 people watching at one time, 'cause there was of course no recorder,\" he said. \"It was appointment viewing. And everyone in America came to the appointment.\"",
      "And then, the man who conquered TV went to the movies, becoming, at age 32, head of Paramount.",
      "Did he feel like he belonged? \"Oh my God, no,\" he said. \"When I became chairman of Paramount \u2013 and I was this kid from television, of all things \u2013 it was like, 'How in God's name did that happen? That is an accident of history that will be quickly corrected.'\"",
      "But the kid from TV knew how to tell a good story, and gave the green light to a string of films that have since become classics, like 1977's \"Saturday Night Fever.\"",
      "It was during those early days at Paramount that Diller met fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. Interestingly, they didn't click at first. \"Yeah, the first time I met her, I never wanted to see her again, 'cause she was dismissive of me and whatever,\" he said. \"But then, the second time that we met, which was a few months later, within minutes, it was pure desire.\"",
      "\"It was a steamy romance,\" I said.",
      "\"Yes. Oh, yes, it was those things.\"",
      "\"And you make it clear \u2013 I mean, I'll just put it out there \u2013 your relationship with Diane is not just platonic.\"",
      "\"No. No. It didn't start that, no, no, no, no.\"",
      "\"You're lovers.\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"It seems to me like one of the points you're trying to make in the book is that it doesn't have to be a mutually-exclusive thing \u2013 that you can be in love with Diane and, at the same time, be attracted to men?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Diller. \"I don't see anything mutually exclusive with that, no. I mean, other people may, but I don't. If I know that the person cares about me, I'm not jealous of anything else. So, that's just luck, I guess.\"",
      "Diller says he owes much of his professional success to luck as well. And he has had a lot of it: In the '80s, as the chairman of Fox, he created a fourth TV network, Homer Simpson and all.",
      "Asked if he gets bored by success, Diller replied, \"Yes, definitely. I mean, once it's there, what are you going to do with it?\"",
      "In the '90s, Diller switched gears again, investing in home shopping, and eventually scooping up a bunch of internet businesses that became household names, like Expedia and Match.com.",
      "And in-between, he and Furstenberg helped create the High Line, donating their time and tens of millions of dollars. \"It doesn't cure cancer,\" he said. \"It's not going to change the dynamics of the world, eradicate disease, or whatever. But it brings pleasure to people.\"",
      "He says he has a similar goal with this book: to share a good story. And that means telling the truth \u2013 to finally let go of a secret he's been holding onto for a lifetime.",
      "I asked, \"You do touch on these feelings of, Maybe I was wrong?\"",
      "\"I don't know that I was wrong about not talking about my private life; I think I was a coward,\" Diller said. \"And I don't like that. But that is the truth. I was. I did not have \u2013 and I wish I did \u2013 I did not have the courage, at that time, to make declarations.\"",
      "\"Does that weigh on you?\"",
      "\"I wouldn't call it weighing on me,\" he said, \"but it is something that, of course, I've thought \u2026\"\u00a0 He paused. \"But it didn't turn out so terribly.\"",
      "The same might be said of his personal life, too: Diller and von Furstenberg were married in 2001, and they're as strong as ever.",
      "He calls his relationship with her the bedrock of his life. \"Well, I don't know any better description than bedrock,\" Diller said. \"The best times for us are when it's just us. And after almost 50 years, how lucky do you get?\"",

    "published": "Sun, 11 May 2025 09:39:07 -0400",
    "summary": "The Oscar-nominated actress talks about playing the activist whose 1990s lawsuit demanding equal pay with her male colleagues went all the way to the Supreme Court, and how her own mother inspired her performance.",
    "story": [
      "If you don't know the name Lilly Ledbetter, how's this for an introduction? \"Lilly Ledbetter did not set out to be a trailblazer or a household name,\" said President Obama in 2009. \"She was a good hard worker who did her job, and she did it well for nearly two decades before discovering that for years she was paid less than her male colleagues for doing the very same work.\" Forty percent less, by most accounts.",
      "Now, a new film, \"Lilly,\" starring Patricia Clarkson, chronicles Ledbetter's David-and-Goliath-type fight for equal pay against her employer, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, in Alabama.",
      "Asked what she knew about Ledbetter before reading the script, Clarkson replied, \"Well, that she was one of the most remarkable human beings ever put on this Earth, a true, true American hero. A grave injustice had been committed against her. But she was also dealing with misogyny, ageism. But yet, she was this amazing manager. She rose.\"",
      "A female manager at a tire factory in the 1970s was almost unheard of. But Ledbetter needed the money to help her husband support their two kids. In 1998, she found a list of names and salaries of her male counterparts, all of whom made far more than she did.",
      "As the movie depicts, Ledbetter found an anonymous note, left for her in her locker, that detailed the pay discrepancies. \"And she was devastated,\" said her daughter, Vickie Ledbetter Saxon. \"She told me she didn't know how she was going to get through the shift. She was humiliated.\"",
      "Ledbetter filed suit, and was awarded $3.8 million in back pay and damages. But a court of appeals overturned the verdict. She never saw a dime.",
      "Her case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, where a 5-4 ruling in favor of Goodyear stated that she had waited too long to file a discrimination claim (the statute of limitations was just 180 days).",
      "\"She was extremely devastated by that,\" said Saxon. \"And I thought it was over, I really did.\"",
      "It wasn't. By then, Ledbetter was nearly 70, and became a symbol of unequal treatment in the workplace. She made it her life's mission to correct pay disparity, and she maintained her activism well into her 80s.",
      "In a speech to the Democratic National Convention in 2008, Ledbetter said, \"Equal pay for equal work is a fundamental American principle.\"",
      "On January 29, 2009, President Obama signed his first piece of legislation: the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which effectively ended the statute of limitations on fair-pay claims.",
      "Clarkson said, \"People care about her journey. It's like: I get you. I know who the hell you are. I know what you went through. I've been through it, too. And whether you're a man or a woman or you're Black or White or young or old, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, whether you were gay or straight, everybody struggles in this way.\"",
      "Clarkson has played a string of memorable characters, from a heroin addict in \"High Art,\" to the mom in \"Easy A.\" She says Hollywood is no exception.",
      "Asked if she believes she was paid equally throughout her career, Clarkson replied, \"Oh, no. Oh, no. No. When I was first working, I was paid scale, which is just the barest of minimum. Young men in the movie with me who had the same amount of words or scenes that I had were making a salary. But I was being paid scale. I didn't know that I was making way less to the dollar. But not anymore, baby!\"",
      "Clarkson says to become Lilly, she spent time in a New York City park: \"Every time I went somewhere, or I just would walk around the street, I was like, 'That's Lilly, that's Lilly, that's Lilly.' I mean, everybody, she's everywhere.\"",
      "She especially found Lilly in her own mother, Jackie Clarkson, a New Orleans City Councilwoman and Louisiana state representative. \"What I brought forth was the best of me, my mother, to play Lilly, because I had this shining example,\" she said. \"It's very hard for me to watch 'Lilly.' My mother is there. My mother is a very kindred spirit with Lilly.\"",
      "When she got the part, her mom was her first call. \"You know, 'cause I've played a lot of complicated women, and she was like, 'Oh, Patty. Oh, Patty. This is so glorious. This is wonderful. You're finally gonna be in a movie everybody can see!'\"",
      "Clarkson says playing Ledbetter is the privilege of her life.",
      "Asked what she learned about herself by playing Lilly, Clarkson said, \"I need to always strive to care more, to be better, to try to be a better human being, to be a better citizen.\"",

    "summary": "Letters reversing the layoffs arrived a day before House and Senate hearings with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. where he was expected to face questions about the layoffs.",
    "story": [
      "The head of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and a handful of teams at the agency had their layoff notices rescinded Tuesday, multiple officials say, and several worker safety programs that had been eliminated by layoffs last month are being restored.",
      "Letters reversing the layoffs arrived in the inboxes of some NIOSH staff a day ahead of House and Senate hearings Wednesday with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. where he was expected to face questions about the layoffs.",
      "Health officials and scientists being brought back to work include everyone in NIOSH's respiratory health division, division of safety research, division of compensation and analysis support and National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy has been working hard to ensure that the critical functions under NIOSH remain intact. The Trump Administration is committed to supporting coal miners and firefighters, and under the Secretary's leadership, NIOSH's essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations,\" HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email.",
      "A handful of NIOSH staff working in the agency's World Trade Center Health Program previously had their layoffs reversed, after a second round of cuts at the agency earlier this month.",
      "\"While we celebrate with those who received a rescission letter from HHS, I am mindful that others did not. I am hopeful that we can continue to make the case for reinstating everyone at NIOSH,\" the agency's now-reinstated director, Dr. John Howard, wrote in the email.",
      "The reinstatements mean that some NIOSH programs might soon be able to resume, after they were previously hobbled by the layoffs.",
      "For example, the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory had been forced to suspend new approvals of equipment like new N95 respirators and protective gear for firefighters after the initial round of cuts on April 1. Investigations of workplace health risks through NIOSH's Health Hazard Evaluation program were also upended by the layoffs, but staff working in those probes have now been reinstated.",
      "But many workers also remain effectively laid-off at the wide-ranging agency, which functions as the research and testing counterpart to the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration.",
      "In NIOSH's Spokane and Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, laid-off scientists and engineers were called back to work, but only for a few more weeks to wind down their laboratories and research before their layoff notices take effect. Those NIOSH employees have not received letters formally rescinding their layoffs, unlike some of their colleagues.",
      "Part of their work includes overseeing miner safety programs like the personal dust monitors, or PDM, required by the Department of Labor for coal miners. NIOSH is responsible for testing PDM's accuracy. The monitors are needed to reduce the risk of black lung disease.",
      "NIOSH had also been in the process of developing similar monitors for miners exposed to silica dust, before the layoffs gutted the teams overseeing that work.",
      "Other NIOSH teams like the Health Effects Laboratory Division were also not listed among the reinstatements.",
      "Other parts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which currently houses NIOSH, also remain off the job, despite calls from states and lawmakers for their reinstatements. HHS previously said it was planning on moving what remained of NIOSH into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "Among the CDC scientists still laid-off include the agency's laboratories for investigating STD and viral hepatitis, which upended work helping states investigate outbreaks. Staff in the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for a range of issues including lead poisoning and cruise ship outbreaks, also have not been reinstated.",
      "Other workers who have been promised by their supervisors that they would be reinstated elsewhere at HHS have also so far not received notices, like at the Food and Drug Administration's drug safety labs in Puerto Rico and Detroit.",
      "While their counterparts at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco were reinstated, multiple scientists in those labs said they had yet to receive formal written notices revoking their layoffs, weeks after they were told they would be reinstated.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cpi-report-today-april-2025-inflation-trump-tariffs/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 18:48:56 -0400",
    "summary": "The CPI report was cooler than expected, although inflation is still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in April\u00a0rose\u00a02.3% on an annual basis, rising less than economists had expected yet still reflecting price hikes that remain above the Federal Reserve's goal of bringing down inflation to a 2% rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.4% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "April's reading reflects the lowest level since February 2021, government data shows.",
      "On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%, lighter than the 0.3% pace forecast by economists.",
      "Housing costs were a major driver of inflation last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. And energy costs also ticked higher, despite lower gasoline prices, due to increases in natural gas and electricity costs.",
      "Grocery prices dropped slightly last month, declining 0.1% from March. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs dropped 12.7% to $5.12 in April, marking the first month-to-month decline in egg prices since October 2024.",
      "Still, egg prices remain near historic highs as a persistent outbreak of bird flu continues to wipe out flocks of egg-laying hens. The April figure is 79% higher than the same month a year earlier, when the price averaged $2.86 per dozen.",
      "What experts say",
      "Economists are looking for early signs that Mr. Trump's tariffs are trickling through to American households. Because tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. companies, which largely pass on the added costs to shoppers, they are at some point expected to boost consumer prices.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach on Mr. Trump's tariffs, which he said could boost inflation and blunt economic growth. But so far, the tariff impact hasn't shown up in economic data, which typically is backward-looking because it reflects activity from the previous month.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced tariffs, such as his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" levies, and then backed off from them. On April 9, he hit the pause button with a 90-day delay, scaling back the tariffs to a 10% rate.",
      "And on Monday, the Trump administration and China agreed to a temporary but significant easing of tariffs imposed over the last couple months, scaling back the import duties on Chinese-made goods from 145% to 30%.",
      "Meanwhile, some consumers and businesses rushed to order goods ahead of the tariffs' imposition, aiming to skirt the new import duties by front-loading their purchases. Because of this, the impact of the tariffs might not show up in economic data for another few months, economists say.",
      "\"[I]n reality, the data for April is likely to be largely unaffected by President Trump's announcements on Liberation Day,\" said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, in an email. \"This is because exemptions were granted for goods that had left exporting countries before 2 April, and because consumers and businesses rushed to front-run tariffs in February and March.\"",
      "He added, \"As such, both the Fed and global investors will still need to be a bit more patient before they can properly assess the impact of the trade uncertainty on consumer prices.\"",
      "What does the CPI report mean for your money",
      "Because of the tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S., inflation may not rise as much as earlier anticipated, noted EY's Daco, who said he's lowered his year-end CPI forecast by 0.4 percentage points to 3.2%.",
      "With inflation still expected to pick up later this year, albeit at a lower pace than earlier forecast, the Fed may decide to cut rates twice in 2025, rather than the three cuts Daco had earlier expected. He added that he believes the first rate cut will occur in September, rather than July.",
      "April's cooler-than-expected data may also give the Fed more breathing room to hold off\u00a0on cutting rates as it assesses the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies, said Carl Weinberg, chief economist with High Frequency Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"The Fed can stand still on rate hikes and cuts based on this data while it patiently waits to see the impact of erratic policy changes on prices in the months ahead, at least for now,\" Weinberg said.",
      "The result for consumers and businesses could be a longer wait for relief on borrowing costs, as the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate helps determine what banks, credit card companies and other lenders charge borrowers.",

      "Positioned at the front of the business class section, the Polaris Studio suites will include a host of luxury amenities for travelers who are willing to dish out more money for the premium experience. Among the offerings are skincare kits, flatbed seating with ottomans, champagne service, and exclusive dining options including \"curated food and drinks,\" according to the United website.",
      "Also included are wireless charging, Bluetooth connectivity and 27-inch screens. United Polaris Studio seats will also be 25% larger than standard United Polaris seats and come with privacy doors, the airline said.",

      "The Boeing 787-9 aircraft will have 99 premium seats total, the most of any in United's fleet and the highest percentage among U.S. carriers, according to the airline. That number includes seating in eight United Polaris Studio and 56 United Polaris business class suites.",
      "Despite the focus on offering a more luxurious travel experience, United also wants to enhance flights for passengers with more modest budgets.",
      "\"[W]e also know we need to pay attention to the rear of the aircraft, because the bulk of the passengers are flying in the main cabin, not in the Polaris cabin,\" Nocella said. \"And we've made efforts to make sure that that experience is going to get better, not worse.\"",
      "This nose-to-tail transformation comes as the luxury travel sector continues to expand. Demand for luxury tourism and hospitality is expected to grow faster than any other travel segment, according to a 2024 McKinsey & Company report.",

      "In tracking costs associated with what the group calls a \"basket of American dream essentials,\" LISEP says its Minimal Quality of Life index provides a truer picture of how Americans are faring than standard economic data, such as the nation's gross domestic product and jobless rate.",
      "The findings? For the bottom 60% of U.S. households, a \"minimal quality of life\" is out of reach, according to the group, a research organization focused on improving lower earners' economic well-being.",
      "\"The middle class has been declining \u2014 we just haven't recognized it fully,\" LISEP Chairman Gene Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's really dangerous because it's the kind of thing that leads to social unrest, and it's not fair. The American dream is not that it's given to you \u2014 it's that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead and achieve the things in life that you want to achieve. It's not living in a tent, not having to steal.\"",
      "Peering beneath the surface",
      "By those standards, the lowest-earning Americans around the U.S. are falling well short, according to LISEP.\u00a0 These households, which in 2023 earned an average of $38,000 per year, would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index, which also includes professional clothing and basic leisure activities.",
      "\"Traditional headline economic indicators like GDP and unemployment tell us the economy is thriving, but they don't reflect the lived reality of most Americans,\" Ludwig said in a statement. \"Americans are working harder than ever, fueling our economic growth, but the benefits of that hard work are not being distributed in a way that supports upward mobility for too many middle- and low-income Americans.\"",
      "From 2021 to 2023, the cost of affording what amounts to a basic level of economic security doubled, according to LISEP's analysis. Housing and health care costs surged, while the amount of savings required to attend an in-state, public university soared 122%.",
      "Meanwhile, median earnings for the bottom 60% of income earners fell 4% over that span when adjusting for the cost of goods tracked by the group's index, according to LISEP. Income growth for these households has also lagged, rising 0.37% per year during the same period \u2014 less than half as much as for the top 40% of earners, the group found.",
      "The gap between how much low-income families earn and how much they need to afford a minimum cost of living is expected to keep widening, Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Assuaging concerns among consumers and on Wall Street\u00a0\u2014 at least for the time being \u2014 a U.S. agreement with China,\u00a0announced on Monday\u00a0by the White House, would effectively reduce the level of U.S. taxes still in place on Chinese goods to about 30% from 145%. China meanwhile, has agreed to cut its tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "President Trump also recently announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom. Britain says the deal will cut tariffs on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum. As part of the agreement, a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff.",
      "Still,\u00a0uncertainty reigns. With that in mind, CBS News spoke with shopping expert Trae Bodge, who shared the following tips for consumers who are looking to avoid any added strain on their already strained household budgets.",
      "Look for sales: Start at the sales rack",
      "With summer fast approaching, retailers are likely to advertise Memorial Day sales. Official Memorial Day sales tend to start the weekend before Memorial Day. However, many retailers, including Lands' End and DreamCloud mattresses, have started hosting sales as early as the beginning of May.",
      "Father's Day and July 4th sales, along with Amazon Prime Day-scheduled for July, also offer shoppers opportunities to secure discounted retail prices on a range of goods and appliances.",
      "Check where products are from",
      "Not all goods are impacted equally by the tariffs. There is currently a 25% tariff on goods from\u00a0Canada and Mexico. However, certain products under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) are exempt. Under the USMCA, most goods traded between the U.S., Mexico and Canada are exempt from tariffs, as long as they meet rules of origin requirements-meaning the product must be made primarily in North America.",
      "Canadian cosmetics company Lush, for example, does not have tariffs on its products.",
      "Purchase domestic products",
      "Certain produce \u2014 including tomatoes, bell peppers and cucumbers imported from Mexico \u2014 could see price hikes over the coming months. Shoppers should turn to domestically produced staples, like apples, potatoes and oranges to avoid price hikes.",
      "Toilet paper is one item that shoppers shouldn't be worried about. According to the North Carolina State's College of Natural Resources, roughly 99% of toilet paper Americans use is made in the United States.",
      "What items will be hit hardest?",
      "Electronics and toys are the most likely to be hit the hardest by tariffs. 80% of toys are imported from China and toy maker Mattel has already warned of increasing prices. Overall, shoppers should consider whether an item is worth purchasing, especially if price hikes are coming.",
      "According to Trae Bodge, shoppers shouldn't panic shop. Instead, they should consider what items they were already planning on purchasing and possibly move the purchasing timeline up. \"So, if your dishwasher is on its last legs and you were thinking about getting one anyway \u2014 or your car, your laptop \u2014 those are the things that I would think about getting now,\" said Bodge. \"But, again, not in a panic.\""

    "summary": "A House Republican bill would require Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer or be enrolled in school for at least 80 hours a month.",
    "story": [
      "A massive change could soon be in the works for the 71 million Americans on Medicaid, with House Republicans unveiling new legislation on Sunday that would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage.",
      "The proposal is part of an effort by House Republicans to find $880 billion in savings over the next decade to help pay for President Trump's tax bill, which will extend his 2017 tax cuts while introducing some new reductions, like eliminating taxes on tips.",
      "Because President Trump has vowed not to touch Medicare \u2014 the health insurance program for people 65 and older \u2014 Republican lawmakers have turned their sights to Medicaid, which provides health coverage for low- and middle-income households. GOP lawmakers contend that Medicaid should be scrutinized because it's prone to financial waste, and that, by doing so, the program will be better able to serve the people who need it.",
      "\"Medicaid is hugely problematic because it has a lot of fraud, waste and abuse,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana,\u00a0said\u00a0in February. Rooting out waste \"preserves the programs, so it is available for those who desperately need it.\"",
      "Some policy experts and Democrats in Congress warn that slashing Medicaid would hurt many vulnerable Americans, with millions likely to lose coverage if the bill passes, while also posing a financial risk to some hospitals that rely on the program.",
      "\"[Nowhere] in the bill are they cutting 'waste, fraud, and abuse' \u2014 they're cutting people's health care and using that money to give tax breaks to billionaires,\" said Rep. Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees health care spending, in a May 12\u00a0statement about the new bill.",
      "The House Republican bill could change considerably as it moves through the legislative process. More than a dozen House Republicans have told Johnson and GOP leaders they will not support cuts to the health care safety net programs that their constituents depend on.",
      "\"Community engagement requirement\"",
      "Under the House bill, many Medicaid recipients would be subject to something the measure calls a \"community engagement requirement.\" That provision would mandate that people who are enrolled in the program either work, participate in volunteer work or be enrolled in an educational program for at least 80 hours a month.",
      "Medicaid recipients also would have to verify their community engagement eligibility twice a year. The bill also adds a more rigorous income verification process for those who enroll in the Affordable Care Act's health care coverage.",
      "There are exceptions for the work requirement, however. The bill states that people who are under 19 years old as well as women who are pregnant or who are under postpartum medical care are among those who can receive a waiver.",
      "If the bill is passed, the requirements would take effect Jan. 1, 2029.",
      "Republicans have previously sought to tie receiving government benefits to work requirements, with one GOP lawmaker in 2023 seeking to tighten these rules for the food-stamp program because he said believed that \"work is the best pathway out of poverty.\"",
      "Some policy experts who study Medicaid, food stamps and other social safety net programs say that there's little evidence that work requirements increase employment, partly because most people who receive such aid and who are able to work are already doing so.",
      "About 92% of people under 65 years old who aren't receiving disability benefits were working full- or part-time in 2023, or else unable to work because of duties such as attending school or caregiving obligations, according to a recent\u00a0analysis from heath publication KFF. The remaining 8% were either retired, couldn't find work or weren't working for another reasons.",
      "Two states \u2014 Georgia and Arkansas \u2014 have added work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped the mandate after a court struck it down in 2019, a year after it was implemented.",
      "Bumped off the rolls",
      "A 2020 analysis of Arkansas' work requirements found that 18,000 adults lost coverage after the policy went into effect, with more than half of those reporting that they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 saying they delayed taking medications because of cost. The requirements didn't boost employment, the study, by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, also found.",
      "Georgia maintains a work requirement for a Medicaid expansion program called Pathways to Coverage, which provides insurance to some low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify for coverage. But that program has fallen short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative hurdles involved in verifying employment as well as technical glitches, according to a Pro Publica report.",
      "\"[W]ork requirements are the worst sort of red tape \u2014 blocking health coverage for working people, people with serious health conditions and people with disabilities,\" said Laura Harker, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Public Policies, a public policy think tank, in a December post about Georgia's program.",
      "An April 2025 estimate from the Urban Institute finds that as many as 5.2 million people ages 19- to 55-years-old could lose coverage if federal work requirements go into effect for Medicaid.",
      "Other cost-cutting measures",
      "Some Medicaid recipients who make more than 100% of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $32,000 a year for a family of four \u2014 would be required under the House GOP bill to pay out-of-pocket costs for some services. Those fees, which would not apply to emergency room visits, prenatal care, pediatric visits or primary care check-ups, would be limited to $35 per visit.",
      "And applicants could not qualify for Medicaid if they have a home that is valued at more than $1 million.",
      "The proposed bill also targets any immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally or without documentation. It reduces by 10% the share the federal government pays to states that allow those immigrants to sign up for Medicaid, such as California or New York. To qualify for Affordable Care Act coverage, enrollees would have to prove they are \"lawfully present.\"",

      "Effective May 14, the tariff rate on low-value imports from China will be slashed to 54%. Additionally, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy, for a period of 90 days.",
      "Mr. Trump alleged in an April 2\u00a0executive order\u00a0that shippers in China had been exploiting the loophole to \"hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices.\"",

American shoppers relied on the de minimis loophole, too, for bargain-basement prices that couldn't be matched for goods made in the U.S.",

      "With the end of the loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies, many goods from China and other countries will no longer\u00a0be as low-priced as they once were. Trade experts also note that to comply with the law, importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) now face a new administrative challenge: the burden of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. That could mean substantial delays in shipments, experts note.",
      "What is the de minimis loophole?",
      "The provision was introduced in 1938 as Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting negligible duties on low-value goods at a high cost to the government.",
      "From 2018 to 2023, the value of low-value e-commerce exports from China ballooned from $5.3 billion to $66 billion, according to a February report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The 1938 provision has been the \"primary path\" for Chinese exports to enter the U.S. market, the report notes.",
      "Why did Trump eliminate the de minimis exemption?",
      "President Trump in February said he would eliminate the loophole because he didn't believe China was taking sufficient action to stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump in April signed an executive order eliminating the duty-free treatment for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2. As of Friday, packages that would have qualified for exemption under the de minimis provision will \"be subject to all applicable duties,\" the executive order states.",

      "\"We put an end to it,\" he said.",
      "Goods from China are subject to new tariffs of up to 145%, while Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S.",

      "\"The way we shop online will never be the same,\" Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of Publican, a company that authenticates shipment documentation, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Specifically, \"everything will take more time, cost more money, and everything that's price-sensitive won't be available,\" he said.",
      "The rise of trade between the U.S. and China allowed for a much greater variety of goods to enter U.S. markets. But the end of the loophole will lead to a \"much diminished market,\" said Mary Lovely, an international trade expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "If prices of Chinese goods rise, there will be less demand, and sellers could decide to import fewer goods.",
      "\"You'll see much diminished market and at some point it won't be worth it to import to a small market,\" so you'll see products disappearing, Lovely said.",
      "Could the new rule cause delays?",
      "Requiring millions more packages to be inspected daily will create a challenge for CBP, experts noted.",
      "\"It will be an administrative nightmare, so you will see a lot of delays,\" Ryan Young, a trade policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "It's unclear if the government has enough CBP agents to efficiently inspect packages and enforce policies, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"As these adjustments are made, a key question remains, which is the ability of CBP to effectively regulate and enforce these measures,\" Ben Tzion said. \"As of today. CBP does not have that ability.\"",
      "\"Without personnel, you'll have backlogs and pile ups and U.S. customs might have to get more warehousing space,\" Young added.",
      "Who might benefit?",

    "summary": "Here's what an agreement by the U.S. and China to suspend steep tariffs for 90 days means for consumers, businesses and the economy.",
    "story": [
      "A\u00a0tariff truce\u00a0between the U.S. and China announced on Monday will offer companies some relief, but also prolong the kind of economic uncertainty that makes it hard for businesses to plan for the future.",
      "Beginning May 14, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy. China will reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%.",
      "But clinching a long-term trade deal is likely to prove challenging, while the reduced 30% tariff rate could still lead to price hikes for consumers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It remains to be seen whether the U.S. and China can agree to a trade deal that keeps tariffs from rebounding in 90 days,\" analysts with Gavekal, an investment research firm, said in a report. \"So far, only the U.K. has reached an agreement with the U.S., and that doesn't tell us much.\"",
      "Is the 30% tariff permanent?",
      "No. Absent a formal trade deal, there's no guarantee that President Trump won't again raise tariffs on China once the truce expires after 90 days and that Beijing won't also retaliate. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the new baseline tariff a \"floor\" in an interview with Bloomberg Surveillance.",
      "\"This is just a 90-day pause that allows the two countries to work toward a deal,\" supply-chain expert Sina Golara, an assistant professor at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Is a 30% tariff on Chinese imports still high?",
      "Under the agreement, the U.S. will lower tariffs on Chinese goods from as much as 145% to 30%. Still, that represents a steep hike on the level of U.S. levies on China before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "\"If you look at where we were pre-'Liberation Day' or when Trump took office, this 'agreement' is just a baseline tariff increase to 30% across the board,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, referring to the phrase President Trump used in announcing a barrage of tariffs on April 2. \"While it's a walk-back from the prohibitive 145% tariffs, it still leaves us no closer to any concessions or renegotiations vis-\u00e0-vis China than we were.\"",
      "Tariff rates aren't the only potential sticking points as the countries continue to negotiate.",
      "\"The two countries have a lot of grievances in many dimensions, so it's not just tariff rates,\" Golara noted. \"It's where they strand on other trade barriers, the trade imbalance, and the U.S. accusing China of currency manipulation, so there's a lot to discuss. It makes sense for them to want to take more time.\"",
      "What does the U.S-China truce mean for economic growth?",
      "There's good news here: If both countries' reduced tariffs remain in place, consumer confidence is likely to improve and boost spending. That should help contain U.S. inflation and help support the job market, according to Oxford Economics associate economist Grace Zwemmer.",
      "The announcement also reduces the odds of the U.S. economy entering a recession this year, according to experts. Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet lowered his forecast for a recession to 35% from more than 50%.",
      "Will shipments from China start flowing again?",
      "Large and small businesses alike in the U.S. have warned that higher tariffs will raise consumer prices, while some companies have canceled orders from Chinese factories because of the high levies.",
      "\"It's very clear that Trump was staring down the barrel of a huge drop in imports from China across the busiest shipping season, as companies build inventory for Christmas and the holiday season,\" Groundwork Collaborative's Jacquez told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0 \"There were more announcements from companies about burning through their inventory and having to pass costs to customers, or having to cease importing from China.\"",
      "Freight shipments from China are expected to surge during the 90-day tariff pause, as companies bulk up their inventories to guard against the trade talks foundering and levies rising. \u00a0As a result, shipping rates will rise, and squeeze smaller businesses, whose margins are already thin.",
      "\"Right now, you'll see a huge rush in trying to get imports in from China in this 90-day period. That will strain shipping logistics just as it did in Covid, when everything opened back up,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Will consumer prices still rise?",
      "Businesses still face added costs with 30% tariffs in place, and they are likely to pass some of those expense onto consumers. But the price hikes could be less substantial depending on how companies handle tariffs, according to Georgia State University's Golara.",
      "\"If we have a mix of some companies handling tariffs well, we won't see broad-based inflation rise to a painful level. We might see pocketed effects in different and specific products and sectors,\" he said.",
      "Other experts agree the pause is good news for companies and consumers.",
      "\"The tariffs were so punishing that it was creating this incentive not to import anything from China,\" Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The announcement is also good news because it means supply is not going to be as restrained as it was.\"",
      "It doesn't mean the U.S. it completely out of the woods, though. \"It's still a significant increase in taxes for American consumers. We are still in a worse position than we were,\" de Rugy said.",
      "How are companies reacting?",
      "Businesses are still grappling with significant economic uncertainty, making it hard to plan for the future.",
      "\"If you're a small business and don't know what your inputs will cost next week or in 90 days, it's going to be extremely difficult to do business in this uncertain environment,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Kim Vaccarella, founder and CEO of Bogg, a U.S-based beach bag and accessories company that makes its products in China, has been scrambling to shift at least some of its manufacturing to Vietnam and Sri Lanka because of the Trump administration's stepped-up tariffs.",
      "\"We were looking at alternatives and set up viable sources in both countries, and we were working toward manufacturing there,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Then came The White House's announcement on Monday. With the U.S. earlier this year having raised its country-based tariffs on Vietnam and Sri Lanka to o46% and 44%, respectively, China may again be Vaccarella's best option.",
      "\"Now we are back to square one, because at 30% it's less expensive to manufacture in China,\" she said. \"If tariffs stay at 30% or go lower, it just looks like we spent a lot of money quickly trying to ramp up production somewhere else, because that would have been more acceptable under this current nightmare.\"",
      "A leading index of small business optimism has fallen every month this year, although it remains above its levels before the November presidential election.",
      "Vaccarella had warned customers that the price of her company's\u00a0bags could jump as early as July. \"But 30% we can work with,\" she said. \"There might have to be a small increase, but it won't be what it would have been at 145%.\"",

      "A bitcoin mining firm backed by President Trump's son Eric will go public this year, the company announced Monday, deepening the Trump family's interest in cryptocurrency.",
      "American Bitcoin \u2014 which lists Eric Trump as its co-founder and has its roots in a company backed by Donald Trump Jr. \u2014 is merging with the publicly-traded Gryphon Digital Mining. The all-stock transaction will allow the firm backed by the Trump brothers to be listed on the Nasdaq exchange. The merger is expected to close as early as the third quarter of this year.",
      "The company's goals, according to an overview posted Monday, are to mine new bitcoin \"below market cost\" and to build up a reserve of the cryptocurrency.",
      "\"Our vision for American Bitcoin is to create the most investable Bitcoin accumulation platform in the market,\" Eric Trump said in a statement.",
      "American Bitcoin was launched in March, with crypto mining firm Hut 8 owning a majority stake.

      "What is bitcoin mining \u2014 and why is it controversial?",
      "Mining is an essential part of how bitcoin operates. The currency isn't centralized, and instead relies on independent actors \u2014 known as miners \u2014 who carry out complicated math problems to verify bitcoin transactions and list them on a public ledger known as a blockchain. As a reward for this work, miners earn units of bitcoin for crunching the numbers successfully.",
      "The value of a bitcoin stands at around $102,000, and the reward for mining decreases over time as the number of bitcoin in circulation increases, making mining a lucrative endeavor.",
      "But mining is controversial because it's extremely energy-intensive, with miners operating gigantic data centers filled with server racks that carry out the mathematical operations necessary to mine. A team from Cambridge University estimates bitcoin uses about 187.9 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, more than the entire country of Egypt.",

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts accusing Mr. Trump of \"crypto corruption.\"",

    "summary": "Since the pandemic, the monthly rent for a typical apartment around the U.S. has surged almost 30% to $1,858, Zillow data shows.",
    "story": [
      "With home prices near a record high and mortgage rates remaining elevated, renting a place to live around the U.S. is today considered a\u00a0better alternative to buying. But here's the catch: Rents are surging, too.",
      "Zillow calculates\u00a0that renters need at least $80,000 in annual income to comfortably afford the typical apartment rental \u2014 up from $60,000 in 2020. And if you want to live in a larger urban area, apartment hunters now need to earn $100,000 or more to live in Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco and San Jose, while even modestly sized Riverside, California, requires six figures for people to keep their heads above water, according to the real estate firm.",
      "\"Today renters need to make six figures to afford the typical rental in eight major metropolitan areas \u2014twice as many as before the pandemic,\" said Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow. \"That means renters have less money in their budgets for essentials like groceries and transportation, or for saving for a down payment.\"",
      "The typical guidance is to spend no more than 30% of your income on rent. To put that in perspective, that's $2,500 a month for someone making $100,000. To stay below the 30% threshold, renters in the eight cities listed by Zillow need to make at least six figures.",
      "\"This Zillow data backs up what every renter has been feeling when they've been looking for an apartment or trying to renew their lease,\" said Rachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable housing. \"Not just in New York City, but across the country, the cost of housing is skyrocketing and they just can't keep up.\"",
      "Here's a look at where around the country you need to earn six figures to afford the rent \u2014 plus cities where you might be able to get away with a lower salary.",
      "Most and least expensive",
      "It's no surprise that New York City tops Zillow's list. The Big Apple has in many ways has come to represent the home affordability crisis. According to the Zillow analysis, New York City dwellers need annual income of roughly $135,000 to be able to comfortably afford rent. That's nearly double the average income for a New York City renter, Fee said.",
      "The average rent in New York City is $2,950, 59% higher than the national average, according to Zillow\u00a0data. The city is doing away with broker fees starting this summer, which could give renters a bit more wiggle room when it comes to their apartment search.",
      "The second-priciest city is Boston, where renters need to earn $127,000 a year to comfortably afford rent, according to Zillow.",
      "Renters in search of more affordable metro areas can look to cities like Buffalo, New York, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In those cities, renters need to earn less than half of what they would to live in New York and Boston \u2013 or around $55,000.",
      "Zillow's data drives home how much rents have risen in recent years. Since April 2020, monthly rent for a typical U.S. apartment has increased almost 30% to $1,858. At the same time, wage growth over that period has lagged, with median annual income rising 22.5% to roughly $82,000, according to the\u00a0Census Bureau.",
      "At the center of the problem is the nation's inadequate housing supply. Even with\u00a0hundreds of thousands of apartments being constructed each year, it's not enough to keep up with demand.",
      "\"We've seen so much pressure since the pandemic and competition for housing,\" Fee said. \"And the inventory just isn't there because, again, we're not building enough as a nation.\"",
      "Fee added that to increase the supply of affordable housing and overall inventory, Congress needs to take action by expanding programs like the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, which subsidizes affordable housing.",
      "\"Renters across the country are looking to Washington for relief, and Congress has yet to take any meaningful action to increase affordable housing supply,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Ticketmaster said it will also tell shoppers where they are in line when they log in to buy tickets to an event. It will also give real-time updates to customers whose wait times exceed 30 minutes, letting them know ticket price ranges, availability and whether new event dates have been added.",
      "Ticketmaster, which is owned by Beverly Hills, California-based concert promoter Live Nation, is the world's largest ticket seller, processing 500 million tickets each year in more than 30 countries. Around 70% of tickets for major concert venues in the U.S. are sold through Ticketmaster.",
      "Ticketmaster said Monday's changes will bring North America in line with the rest of the world, where the full ticket price was already displayed as soon as customers started shopping.",
      "Cracking down on bots",
      "The company also says it plans to step up its fight against\u00a0ticket bots, or automated software used by resellers to bulk-buy mass quantities of tickets. Complaints about these systems came to a head during the November 2022 presale to\u00a0Taylor Swift's Eras tour, when its site crashed during a presale event for Taylor Swift's upcoming stadium tour.",
      "The company at the time said its site was overwhelmed by both fans and attacks from bots, which were posing as consumers in order to scoop up tickets and sell them on secondary sites. Thousands of people lost tickets after waiting for hours in an online queue.",
      "\"We now block an average of 200 million bot attempts every day, stopping them from stealing tickets meant for real fans,\" Ticketmaster said in a statement. \"In 2024 alone, we blocked over 53 billion bot attacks, a more than 5x increase from 2019.\"",
      "Monopoly trial",
      "Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Ticketmaster and Live Nation, accusing them of running an illegal monopoly that drives up U.S. ticket prices and asking a court to break them up. That case is ongoing.",
      "President Donald Trump is also eyeing the industry. In March, he signed an executive order that he said will help curb ticket scalping and bring \"commonsense\" changes to the way live events are priced.",
      "Under the order, the FTC must ensure \"price transparency at all stages of the ticket-purchase process\" and take enforcement to prevent unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive conduct.",
      "\"Anyone who's bought a concert ticket in the last decade, maybe 20 years \u2014 no matter what your politics are \u2014 knows that it's a conundrum,\" said Kid Rock, who joined Mr. Trump in the Oval Office as Mr. Trump signed the order.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 May 2025 14:14:14 -0400",
    "summary": "The White House says the U.S. and China have agreed to suspend for 90 days most of the tariffs imposed against each other over the last couple months.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. and China have agreed to a temporary but significant easing of the tariffs imposed over the last couple months, the countries said in a joint statement shared by the White House, heralding significant success in trade negotiations that ramped up over the weekend.",
      "In the joint statement released early Monday morning, the two sides said they had agreed that ongoing \"discussions\u00a0have the potential to address the concerns of each side in their economic and trade relationship,\" and that \"moving forward in the spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect,\" both parties had committed to a 90-day suspension of most of the levies imposed since early April.",
      "\"We have reached an agreement on a 90-day pause,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, where he spent the weekend in meetings with Chinese counterparts. He said Washington and Beijing would reduce their reciprocal tariffs by 115 percentage points for three months to give the negotiations room to move forward.",
      "Bessent said the temporary reductions would effectively reduce the level of U.S. tariffs still in place on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China was reducing its levies on American imports to 10%.",
      "China also agreed to ease some non-tariff barriers. That could include resuming export of rare earths to U.S. customers, which are materials used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries, according to High Frequency Economics.",
      "At the White House, President Trump hailed the agreement while speaking to reporters before leaving for the Middle East.",
      "\"The biggest thing that we're discussing is the opening up China, and they've agreed to do that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But it's going to take a while to paper it.\"",
      "The White House's imposition of levies amounting to some 145% on all goods imported from China, and Beijing's retaliatory tariffs of 125% on American imports, had cast a long shadow over global financial markets as the world's two biggest economies spent the early spring appearing to entrench in a trade war.",
      "The high tariffs had virtually frozen trade between the U.S. and China, with major American ports reporting a drastic drop in traffic.",
      "\"The consensus from both delegations this weekend is neither side wants a decoupling,\" Bessent told reporters in Geneva on Monday. \"And what had occurred with these very high tariff ... was an embargo, the equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balanced trade. And I think that both sides are committed to achieving that.\"",
      "In another sign that the U.S. may be ready to relent on its protectionist trade policies, Mr. Trump on May 8 announced a pact with the United Kingdom under which the U.S. will lower tariffs on British cars from 27.5% to 10%, while also scrapping levies on steel and aluminum.",
      "Stock market boost",
      "Commodities and currency markets in Asia and beyond were buoyed significantly on the news of a breakthrough in the negotiations on Monday. Stock futures in the U.S. also soared, with the Dow gaining more than 1,000 points ahead of trade opening in New York on Monday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.2% and 4%, respectively.",
      "Speaking Sunday, Bessent said there had been \"substantial progress\" in the talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Geneva, while Greer teased that an agreement had been reached but offered no details.",
      "\"It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as far as maybe thought,\" Greer told reporters on Sunday.",
      "Despite the cooldown, some Wall Street analysts questioned whether the truce will last and if the sides are committed to forging a more permanent agreement to ease tensions.",
      "Bessent \"stated that neither the U.S. nor China wants decoupling. We are skeptical,\" Wei Yao, head of research Asia Pacific at Societe Generale Group. \"To us, the thinking on reducing reliance on China for the supply of critical material seems more permanent, even though the U.S. may not mind continuing to buy clothes, toys or even iPhones from China.\"",
      "UBS Global Wealth Management projects the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports will ultimately settle around 30% to 40%.",
      "Even with the contours of a U.S-China deal potentially in place, Americans today face an overall effective tariff rate of 17.8%, the highest since 1934, according to the nonpartisan Yale Budget Lab.",

    "summary": "President Trump's sudden and unpredictable tariffs have caused tremendous concerns among small business owners, whose livelihoods are now in jeopardy.",
    "story": [
      "Beth Benike is a mom, a veteran, and a small business owner \u2013 and she's sounding the alarm. \"I've been telling all of my friends and family that anything you want for Christmas, to get it right now, especially if you're buying for children. If you are buying any baby products at all, get them while they're here, because they're gonna be gone.\"",
      "After a decade serving in the Army, stationed in Bosnia, Kuwait, Iraq and beyond, Benike started Busy Baby, a Minnesota company that designs and sells placemats and utensils for babies and toddlers. All her products are made in China. And now, those products are subject to President Trump's 145% tax on Chinese imports.",
      "\"We have three months' worth of products sitting at the factory,\" Benike said. \"And now, in order to get it here, we need $230,000 on top of what we've already paid for the product, just to get it in the country.\"",
      "\"Can you afford that?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh God, no,\" Benike replied.",
      "\"So, what do you do?\"",
      "\"First, I sat on my kitchen floor and cried,\" Benike said. \"And when I was on the floor in the kitchen, my son came in to show me something or tell me something, and he saw me sitting there, crying. My eight-year-old son. \u2026 And he put his arms around me and just hugged me. And, like, I realized I'm not gonna let him see this. This is not what we're gonna be.\"",
      "The tariffs hit just after Benike struck a deal to sell Busy Baby products at Target and Walmart. To produce enough inventory, she took out a loan from the Small Business Administration. \"That loan is partially SBA-financed, and then partially leveraged against my house,\" Benike said. \"So, if I can't stay in business and pay those loans, I lose the house.\"",
      "Inside Benike's warehouse, this is what's left:",
      "Once this inventory is sold, Benike said, \"then we're out of product. Then we're sold out. We've got nothing more coming in.\"",
      "One of the retailers Benike supplies is Little Roo's, in Chaska, Minnesota. Owner Marissa Held-Nordling says she has seen shopper behavior change since tariffs were introduced. For the first time ever, she is allowing customers to stockpile baby registry gifts, like Benike's Busy Baby mats. That way, family and friends can still get what they need, often for baby showers months away.",
      "\"You can't just do a registry anymore, because the products aren't guaranteed that it's still going to be on the shelf,\" said Held-Nordling. \"So, at this point I'm allowing people to come in and fill a bin, and they can get their exact colors \u2026 and then I close the bin and I take this product off my website.\"",
      "While the U.S. and China begin trade talks, economists still expect most goods to get more expensive \u2013 or even go out of stock, from clothing to electronics to toys. Yale's Budget Lab says tariffs could add nearly $5,000 a year to families' household expenses.",

      "Trump says there are no tariff exceptions in his trade war, despite electronics exemptions",
      "Kyla Scanlon, an economic analyst and author of \"In This Economy? How Money & Markets Really Work,\" said, \"It's probably a smart time to take advantage of this weird, uncertain moment to make sure that you have what you need, just in case prices do get more expensive. If you don't need something right away, a lot of financial advisors would recommend that you do start padding your emergency fund, and putting some money to the side.\"",
      "I asked, \"Are these tariffs necessary to rebalance the global economy?\"",
      "\"I don't think this was necessary,\" Scanlon laughed. \"Targeted tariffs are okay. But when you do broad, blanket tariffs on everything, and when the rate is confusing, when small businesses don't know how to invest, they don't know what they should be spending money on \u2013 it's just not a good economic environment.\"",
      "The legality of the Trump administration sidestepping Congress to implement tariffs is being challenged in the courts. President Trump says he imposed these tariffs in part to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.",
      "Small business owner challenges Trump tariffs in court",
      "Small business owner challenges Trump tariffs in court",
      "When asked on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" if there were discussions about giving relief to small businesses, Trump replied, \"They're not going to need it. They're gonna make so much money, if you build your product here.\"",
      "But Benike says that's impossible \u2013 that manufacturing her products in the U.S. is too expensive: \"The cost of land is higher here. The cost of insurance, the building, electricity, employees. And these factories that are producing now in the U.S., the raw materials they're bringing in are being tariffed as well.\"",
      "It's an untenable situation, even for someone as successful as Benike. Just last week, she was recognized for her company's success \u2013 while she worried about its survival.",
      "\"I was in D.C. to receive my Small Business Person of the Year Award at the fanciest hotel in D.C., with my son in his adorable little suit and bow tie,\" she said. \"And I just sat there feeling defeated. Where I would've loved to have celebrated that, now I have to prove it.\"",
      "Still, she's not giving up. She's drawing inspiration from a phrase she picked up in the military: Improvise, adapt and overcome.",
      "\"So, Plan B is figuring out how to become a global brand,\" she said.",
      "\"And not sell in the United States?\" I asked.",
      "\"For now,\" Benike said, adding, \"It'll come back some day.\"",
      "\"You have faith?\"",
      "\"I do. I have faith. It'll come back some day. This can't possibly last forever.\"",

      "As a result, shipments of goods from China to the U.S. in April dropped 21% compared with the same period one year earlier, data released Friday from China's General Administration of Customs shows. Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by the same amount, according to the April data, demonstrating how Mr. Trump's tariffs are already upending trade patterns.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump said in a post on his social media site Truth Social that the levies on China could come down to 80%.\u00a0The lower rate \"seems right,\"\u00a0wrote the president, ahead of U.S.-China\u00a0trade negotiations set to kick off this weekend in Switzerland.",
      "While lower than the 145% tariffs currently in place, 80% levies would still make importing goods from China prohibitively expensive for many U.S.-based businesses. Many consumers, meanwhile, are unlikely to afford price hikes from steep tariffs at a time when they are already squeezed financially.",
      "Upending trade patterns",
      "Some business owners say they are skipping orders they would normally have already placed with Chinese factories, as they wait and see where tariff rates on China and other countries settle.",
      "Mr. Trump in April announced a bevy of country-specific tariffs, which he later placed on hold \u2014 with the exception of those on China \u2014 for\u00a090 days. A 10% tariff in place on all imports to the U.S. remains in effect. Businesses say the 10% baseline tax is a challenge, but far easier to absorb than duties over 100%.",
      "April's shakeup in the flow of goods around the world comes as many retailers rethink their supply chains, and some take steps to reduce their reliance on China, with steep levies in place.",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese imports from the U.S. dropped more than 13% compared with April 2024. Beijing could bring down its 125% retaliatory tariff on U.S. goods, if trade negotiations between the two countries progress this weekend.",
      "UBS analysts expect U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to settle at around 34%, \"as a more constructive tone and the start of high-level talks in Switzerland suggest both sides are open to deescalation and further negotiation,\" said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer of global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a research note.",
      "Capital Economics' China economist Zichun Huang added that U.S. tariffs inflict minimal harm to China, as exports to other countries in Asia offset the decline in shipments to the U.S.",

      "\"There's a growing concern that weakening soft data, like sentiment and confidence, will eventually show up in the hard data, like retail sales, GDP and employment,\" Bret Kenwell, an analyst with investment platform eToro USA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Wall Street is talking some comfort from the Trump administration moving this week to de-escalate its trade disputes. Mr. Trump on Friday floated a possible move to drop U.S.\u00a0tariffs on China to 80% from their current level of 145%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are set to meet Chinese officials in Switzerland on Saturday for a first round of trade talks.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday also announced the framework for a trade pact with the U.K., touting the deal as a \"breakthrough\" agreement that would open the British economy to American goods.",
      "Yet some market watchers are skeptical that the deal with Britain, which leaves in place a 10% U.S. tariff on British imports, will do much to ease global trade tensions \u2014 especially with far more challenging negotiations ahead with trading partners such as Canada, China and the European Union.",

    "story": [
      "Steep new U.S. tariffs on imports are rattling businesses large and small, with many companies planning to absorb the higher costs by hiking prices for customers. Not footwear company Keen.",
      "Although the midsize company, based in Portland, Oregon, operates in an industry that is highly exposed to tariffs, Keen tells customers that it will keep prices steady this year no matter how tariffs affect its costs. That's no idle pledge calculated to preserve market share \u2014 Keen has been steadily retooling the business for years to protect itself from sudden shifts in global trade and the vagaries of geopolitics.",
      "\"We have been preparing for this for over a decade. Early on, we saw the risks of being overdependent on any one country, so we made the decision to diversify our supply chain well beyond China,\" Chief Operating Officer Hari Perumal told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The 22-year-old company, with 650 U.S. employees and owned by design and brand management company Fuerst Group, has worked to reduce its dependence on Chinese manufacturing while expanding its U.S. presence and diversifying its supply chains.",
      "President Trump's tariffs are upending retailer supply chains, forcing them to devise workarounds. That can mean moving manufacturing to another foreign country with lower tariffs or investing in U.S.-based production. For small businesses, tariff-driven uncertainty\u00a0can mean shutting operations down altogether when the financials no longer add up.",
      "Shoe and clothing prices could soar",
      "Footwear companies are particularly vulnerable to the upheaval caused by President Trump's trade war, given their reliance on China, where 36%, or $9.8 billion's worth, of imported footwear sold in the U.S. is made, according to a TD Cowen analysis of international trade data.",
      "For that reason, tariffs are expected to hit footwear and apparel companies hard, and that impact will be felt by American consumers as well, according to Jason Judd, a global supply-chain expert and executive director of Cornell University's Global Labor Institute.",
      "In 2023, U.S. households spent an average of about $1,700 per year on footwear and apparel, Judd said. He expects that figure to surge 70% in the short term, to $2,800 per family, because of tariff-related price hikes. In the coming years, meanwhile, consumers are still likely to be paying more for footwear and clothing because of higher global tariffs.",
      "\"That pain will lessen as terms and sourcing patterns change, but the longer-term costs per family will still be around a $425 increase per year.\"",
      "The abrupt change in tariff policies is already rippling across the industry. German sportswear giant Adidas last month warned U.S. customers that \"cost increases due to higher tariffs will eventually cause price increases.\" And retailers across various industries, from apparel to food, have started passing some of the cost from higher import taxes to consumers in the form of\u00a0\"tariff surcharges.\"",
      "\"We saw the writing on the wall\"",
      "Today, Keen operates plants in Shepherdsville, Kentucky; the Dominican Republic; and Thailand, where it handles a third of the company's global production. It also contracts with manufacturing partners in Cambodia, India and Vietnam, all of which are subject to impending new U.S. levies. Cambodia faces a country-specific tariff rate of 49%, while Vietnam and India face levies of 47% and 27%, respectively.",
      "\"We do have 10% exposure in those countries, but the 10% tariff we're dealing with is significantly lower than what other companies are facing on products that would come out of China,\" Perumal told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Back in 2015, executives at Keen were already taking note of rising labor costs in China. Today, the company's broad supply chain helps it spread costs across the company, its manufacturing partners and their suppliers, he said. Keen, which is privately held, declined to share information on its annual revenues.",
      "\"We are making a conscious decision not to increase prices, but that's shared by our partners,\" he said. \"They share some of the costs with us, then they go to the company they buy materials from, and those tier-one suppliers share some of the costs as well.\"",

    "story": [
      "Cedar Rapids, Iowa \u2014 Pete Buttigieg, who served as transportation secretary under former President Joe Biden, appeared to acknowledge Tuesday that he believed Biden should not have run for a second White House term.",
      "When asked by reporters if the Democratic party would have been better off without Biden as the nominee, Buttigieg responded, \"Maybe, you know, right now, with the benefit of hindsight, I think most people would agree that is the case.\"",
      "Buttigieg, who won the 2020 Democratic Iowa caucus, made the remarks following a town hall in the Hawkeye state hosted by a progressive veterans PAC. Buttigieg served as Biden's transportation secretary from 2021 until he left office in January.",
      "Buttigieg addressed whether he saw signs that Biden was experiencing any kind of cognitive decline. Speculation about Biden's situation ramped up following his poor debate performance against President Trump in June, and the ensuing fallout ultimately led to Biden dropping out of the race.",
      "\"Every time I needed something from him from the West Wing I got it,\" Buttigieg said of Biden. \"And the time I worked closest with him in his last year was around the Baltimore bridge collapse. And I want to tell you is that the same president the world saw addressing that, was the president that I was involved with.\"",
      "This visit to Iowa comes amid a flurry of speculation that Buttigieg is considering a second presidential run in 2028. Buttigieg recently passed on a 2026 run for the U.S. Senate in Michigan, and has made a number of media appearances in recent weeks.",
      "\"Anyone can come to Iowa just before an election's coming up,\" Buttigieg joked with the audience shortly after taking the stage at the VoteVets event. \"I wanted to make sure I had a chance to talk with the people I got to know five or six years ago, and people I'm seeing for the very first time.\"",
      "Buttigieg played coy on whether he was assessing a potential presidential run, telling reporters that, \"Right now, I'm not running for anything. Part of what's exciting about an opportunity like this is to be campaigning for values and for ideas rather than a specific elected office.\"",
      "When asked by an audience member what can be done to combat some of the Trump administration's proposed cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs, Buttigieg encouraged them not to \"back down.\"",
      "\"There's this sense of inevitability, invincibility, right, that the president's trying to create,\" he said. \"But it's not true. Don't back down. They'll back down when he screws up badly enough, not as often as I'd like, but they change their mind all the time. They changed their mind on tariffs.\"",
      "Buttigieg's remarks echoed similar comments he's made in media appearances in recent weeks, especially in speaking about the future of the Democratic party, which he has encouraged to \"meet people where they are.\"",
      "Buttigieg said it is \"politically and substantively wrong\" for the party to suggest returning to a status quo when Democrats were last in power.",
      "\"I am not here to say we gotta make things back the way they were in 2023,\" Buttigieg said. \"The hard truth is, if our government, our politics, our society and our economy were working, we wouldn't be here. Pro-authoritarian populist movements, they don't just come out of nowhere.\"",
      "Buttigieg refused to weigh in on whether Iowa should be the Democrat's first primary contest in 2028. In 2023, the Democratic National Committee, with the support of Biden, controversially changed the calendar to make South Carolina the first state in Democratic primary schedule. Prior to that, the Iowa caucuses had led off the process since 1972.",
      "\"People like me are makers, not takers, on the rules like that,\" Buttigieg said. \"What I will say is Iowa showed me what can happen through a process where you have to be in backyards, doing a few town halls a day. It made it possible for me to emerge as a candidate, and it certainly made me better, not just as a candidate but as a public servant.\"",

      "U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin acknowledged that Piker was detained, but took issue with his account of what happened.",
      "McLaughlin said: \"This is nothing but lying for likes. Claims that his political beliefs triggered the inspection are baseless. Our officers are following the law, not agendas.\"",

      "Miller said he tells clients to go with the flow until they feel uncomfortable, at which point they can ask for a supervisor.",

      "But shuttering the agency was more difficult than anticipated, and many saw their dismissal date slide as their bosses worked to terminate them. In March, USAID leadership issued a memo pushing the end dates for the majority of employees to the summer and fall. Employees have continued to be on the USAID payroll since February.",
      "Last week, employees who spoke out publicly about their dismissal between late February and early March began receiving email communication that suggested interviews they conducted during this period had potentially violated the agency's code of conduct. The email, reviewed by CBS News, asked the employees to submit a statement and answer a series of questions by May 13.",
      "According to the email, \"failure to comply with these instructions and to provide a statement as requested would constitute misconduct,\" and their written statement will be \"used to determine whether misconduct occurred and what action, if any, is necessary to correct that behavior.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, beginning a three-nation visit to the region and the first international trip of his second administration. Saudi Arabia is the first stop on a four-day trip to the Middle East for Mr. Trump, and he was greeted on the tarmac at the airport in Riyadh by the kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "The president and the crown prince were set to hold private talks on a wide range of topics, from dismantling Iran's nuclear program to efforts to end the war in Gaza and to keep oil prices in check.",
      "Mr. Trump also visited Saudi Arabia before any other nation during his first term in the White House, bucking the tradition for U.S. presidents to make their first foreign trip to the United Kingdom.",
      "\"Last time I went to Saudi Arabia, they put up $450 million,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in March, while pledging to make the visit again should there be another investment in American companies. In a call shortly after Mr. Trump took office in January, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowed to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over the next four years.",
      "Saudi Arabia is of key diplomatic importance to the Trump White House, especially amid ongoing efforts to negotiate a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, and with the Israel-Hamas war still raging in Gaza. The Trump administration also held talks with Russia in the Saudi capital of Riyadh earlier this year on how to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "But the visit is also expected to focus on business. Mr. Trump spoke at an investment conference in Miami in February sponsored by Saudi government entities, as the Trump Organization has sought to expand its real estate empire in Saudi Arabia, and the president looks to strengthen ties with the Middle East partner.",
      "Mr. Trump has also attracted some high-profile business leaders to Riyadh for a U.S.-Saudi investment summit on Tuesday. The speakers will include Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Palantir's Alex Karp, Citigroup's Jane Fraser, BlackRock's Larry Fink, Franklin Templeton Investments's Jenny Johnson, Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi, BDT & MSD Partners' Dina Powell McCormick and Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman, according to multiple sources familiar with the event.",
      "Meanwhile, the White House has touted the trip's diplomatic opportunities.",
      "\"The president looks forward to embarking on his historic return to the Middle East, visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates next week, where he will focus on strengthening ties between our nations,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Friday. \"Eight years ago, President Trump's first trip was to this same region of the world, where he introduced his bold peace-through-strength foreign policy strategy.\"",
      "The Trump administration brokered a diplomatic breakthrough during his first term that normalized relations between Israel and a number of Arab states, known as the Abraham Accords. Eight years later, as the administration has made a goal of expanding the agreement, Leavitt said Mr. Trump is returning to the region to \"re-emphasize his continued vision for a proud, prosperous and successful Middle East, where the United States and Middle Eastern nations are in cooperative relationships, and where extremism is defeated in place of commerce and cultural exchanges.\"",
      "\"This trip ultimately highlights how we stand on the brink of the golden age for both America and the Middle East, united by a shared vision of stability, opportunity and mutual respect,\" Leavitt added.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to accompany the president in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the State Department said, where they will \"look to strengthen ties between the United States and Gulf partners.\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will also join the president on the Middle East trip, a pentagon spokesperson said. And Mr. Trump is expected to visit with U.S. military personnel at the U.S. airbase in Qatar, Leavitt said.",
      "Mr. Trump is not expected to visit Israel during the trip, in a change from his first term.",
      "Meanwhile, the royal family of Qatar is donating a jumbo jet for President Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane, sources told CBS News. The plane will be donated to the future Trump presidential library shortly before he leaves office.",

      "As federal judges endure a rise in threats, CBS News has learned that some jurists have faced strange, unnerving incidents in which an unknown person orders a pizza to their home address in an apparent attempt to menace them.",
      "The top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., has called the incidents \"pizza doxxing\" \u2014 a spin on \"doxxing,\" in which somebody's address or other personal information is maliciously made public, often as a form of intimidation.",
      "In about two dozen cases nationwide, judges have gotten unsolicited pizza deliveries with the recipient listed as Daniel Anderl, the late son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas, the New Jersey judge told CBS News. Anderl was killed at the family's New Jersey home in 2020 by a disgruntled gunman who was targeting Salas.",
      "Salas called the cases attempts at \"psychological warfare\" against judges.",
      "Salas says the perpetrators have not been identified. She plans to meet with officials at the U.S. Marshals Service on Thursday to talk about the threats.",
      "A U.S. Marshals Service official told CBS News the agency \u2014 which handles judicial security \u2014 is \"looking into all the unsolicited pizza deliveries to federal judges and taking appropriate steps to address the matter.\"",
      "During a news conference Tuesday, outgoing U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., Ed Martin said \"pizza doxxers\" are also a focus of the federal prosecutor's office in the nation's capital, a jurisdiction where a large number of federal judges reside.",
      "Former FBI agent Mike Clark, who leads the Society of Retired FBI Agents, told CBS News the incidents appear to be designed to send a threatening and menacing message to judges.",
      "\"To do this, is inviting tragedy and something terrible to happen. They're making a mockery of the justice system and they're playing a dangerous game,\" Clark said.",
      "Security analysts have previously warned \"pizza doxxing\" \u2014 or hoax deliveries \u2014 could also be a technique to lure a public official to the front door of his or her home, to confirm their address for a possible future attack.",
      "Threats against judges have been on the rise in recent years, part of a broader trend for public officials. The U.S. Marshals Service recorded more than 450 threats against federal judges in 2023, up more than 300 from 2019, with threats against prosecutors also growing at a rapid clip over the same period, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "In a separate interview with CBS News in March, Salas said, \"I worry for judicial officers who have to render tough decisions, who have to render decisions that may be unpopular to some individuals.\" She also cited \"the inflammatory rhetoric and language that's coming from both our leaders as well as people in positions of power that have large platforms.\"",
      "\"Those are dangerous combinations, because \u2026 we don't know what might set someone off,\" she said. \"I'm living proof. My son isn't here anymore.\"",

      "Mr. Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, announced multiple economic and defense agreements, an indication of Mr. Trump's intent to deepen U.S.-Saudi ties, despite long-held concerns from State Department reports and human rights groups about its restriction of civil liberties, political rights and women's rights. The Saudis hosted a dinner in the city of Dir'iyah in honor of Mr. Trump.",
      "Speaking at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, the president said it's a \"tremendous honor\" to be invited back to Saudi Arabia, where his first foreign trip took place in 2017, and called bin Salman a \"friend.\" U.S. intelligence agencies believed bin Salman ordered the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018, but the U.S. determined that he has immunity due to his role as Saudi prime minister.",
      "\"The U.S.-Saudi relationship has been a bedrock of security and prosperity,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday. \"Today, we reaffirmed this important bond, and we take the next steps to make our relationship closer, stronger and more powerful than ever before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also has personal business ties to Saudi Arabia. Last year, the Trump Organization announced plans for the development of a\u00a0Trump Tower in Jeddah, a major Saudi city along the Red Sea.

      "\"It's crucial for the wider world to know this great transformation has not come from western intervention or flying people in beautiful planes giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs, no,\" he said.",
      "\"The gleaming marbles of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called nation builders, neocons or liberal nonprofits like those who spent trillions and trillions of dollars failing to develop Kabul, Baghdad, so many other cities,\" he said. \"Instead, the birth of a modern Middle East has been brought by the people of the region themselves. ... In the end, the so-called nation builders wrecked far more nations than they built, and the interventionalists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves.\"",
      "\"In recent years, far too many American presidents have been afflicted with the notion that it's our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use U.S. policy to dispense justice for their sins,\" the president added.",
      "Specifically, the president and crown prince signed agreements for judicial cooperation between the Ministry of Justice in Saudi Arabia and the U.S. Department of Justice, coordination between the Pentagon and Saudi Ministry of Defense for modernization and development of the capabilities of the Saudi armed forces; and an international partnership program between the Saudi Ministry of Interior and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.",

      "Mr. Trump complimented the Crown Prince in remarks during their bilateral meeting, calling him \"wise beyond his years.\" The president also said that the Saudi prince is considering a purchase of $600 billion of military equipment but joked that it could be $1 trillion.",
      "The two leaders also participated in a business lunch with notable CEOs including Elon Musk, Larry Fink, and Stephen Schwarzman. Mr. Trump said the business leaders are expected to walk away from the visit \"with a lot of checks.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Three key House committees that have jurisdiction over the most contentious parts of a major budget package aimed at addressing President Trump's defense, energy and tax priorities are expected to continue working through the night Tuesday, as Republican leaders push to have the bill on the floor by next week.",
      "The Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and Agriculture committees are debating and voting on their proposals that include changes to Medicaid and food stamps to help pay for tax cuts. But major divisions among Republicans remain on several issues, including how to overhaul Medicaid and a tax deduction expiring in December.",
      "Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee, who were responsible for finding at least $880 billion in spending cuts, released the long-awaited details of their plan Sunday. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently calculated that achieving those savings would not be possible without cuts to Medicaid.",
      "Democrats have hammered Republicans on the issue, asserting that children and people with disabilities will lose their health insurance. Republicans accused Democrats of fear-mongering and have vowed to protect the benefits of eligible recipients, insisting they are targeting waste, fraud and abuse.",
      "\"With this bill, Republicans are essentially telling millions of Americans, 'Gotcha, no more health care for you,'\" said New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the committee.",
      "Protesters, some who wore shirts that read \"protect Medicaid,\" disrupted the hearing early on to voice their concern about cuts to the program. Capitol Police said it arrested dozens of people for protesting inside a congressional building, which is against the law.",
      "The changes to Medicaid laid out in the legislation include imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children.",
      "The committee did not lower the rate by which the federal government pays states for Medicaid, a point of contention between moderates and conservatives. In recent weeks, Republicans had considered moving more of the cost sharing to the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Forty states have adopted the Medicaid expansion, and under that provision, the federal government pays 90% of the costs for expansion enrollees while the states are responsible for 10%. The federal government's portion for those covered through traditional Medicaid can range from 50% to 83%.",
      "The exclusion is sure to rankle more conservative members who have demanded steep cuts to Medicaid spending, especially for those covered by the expansion. Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, expressed his disapproval on Monday, arguing the bill fails to offer any transformative changes to the program that provides health insurance for more than 70 million low-income adults, children and people with disabilities.",
      "\"We will need SIGNIFICANT additional changes to garner my support,\" Roy said in a lengthy post laying out his issues with the current package.",
      "At least 8.6 million people would lose health insurance and the deficit would shrink by at least $715 billion in the next decade under recommendations in the legislation, according to a preliminary analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released by Democrats on Sunday. Proposals unrelated to health care would reduce the deficit by at least $197 billion over 10 years, the analysis said.",
      "Ways and Means, which could propose $4.5 trillion in spending, unveiled its plan Monday afternoon that would raise the debt limit by $4 trillion and extend tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 a top priority of congressional Republicans.",
      "The bill includes several of Mr. Trump's campaign promises, including no tax on tips, overtime and car loan interest. The exemptions would expire at the end of 2028. The legislation also increases the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $2,500 for four years.",
      "Tax writers also proposed a $30,000 cap to the state and local tax deduction with an income cap of $400,000. Blue-state Republicans have been pushing for an increase to the $10,000 cap, which is set to expire at the end of the year. But last week, a group of New York Republicans called a $30,000 cap \"insulting,\" adding that the amount falls short of earning their support.",
      "House leaders have a self-imposed deadline of sending the package to the Senate by Memorial Day, leaving them little time to resolve the outstanding differences. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, can afford just three defections in a floor vote.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, expressed confidence that Republicans could reach an agreement on the state and local tax deduction.",
      "\"If we don't deliver on this, every single American \u2014 207 million taxpayers \u2014 will face a 22% tax increase,\" Smith said. \"So failure is not an option.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats on the committee derided Republicans' proposals, with Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the panel's top Democrat, dubbing it \"one big, beautiful tax cut for billionaires.\"",
      "The Agriculture Committee's portion increases the age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps, and shifts more of the costs to states. The bill updates the age requirement to 64, up from 54. Republicans also want to close a loophole for work requirement waivers that states could request for areas with unemployment rates over 10% or lack \"a sufficient number of jobs.\"",
      "The committee was tasked with finding at least $230 billion in cuts.",
      "\"The cut you are proposing to SNAP tonight would be the largest rollback of an anti-hunger program in our nation's history,\" said Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota, the committee's top Democrat.",
      "As of Tuesday afternoon, the Congressional Budget Office had not released estimates for the Ways and Means and Agriculture committees' proposals. It estimated that the Energy and Commerce Committee's recommendations would reduce deficits by more than $880 billion over 10 years.",
      "Mr. Trump put pressure on Republicans to unify behind what he calls the \"big, beautiful bill\" while on his way to the Middle East on Monday, writing that \"we have no alternative.\" Other portions of the package include funding for infrastructure and technology enhancements along the U.S.-Mexico border in addition to investments in Customs and Border Protection staffing.

      "The reinstatements mean that some NIOSH programs might soon be able to resume, after they were previously hobbled by the layoffs.",
      "For example, the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory had been forced to suspend new approvals of equipment like new N95 respirators and protective gear for firefighters after the initial round of cuts on April 1. Investigations of workplace health risks through NIOSH's Health Hazard Evaluation program were also upended by the layoffs, but staff working in those probes have now been reinstated.",
      "But many workers also remain effectively laid-off at the wide-ranging agency, which functions as the research and testing counterpart to the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration.",
      "In NIOSH's Spokane and Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, laid-off scientists and engineers were called back to work, but only for a few more weeks to wind down their laboratories and research before their layoff notices take effect. Those NIOSH employees have not received letters formally rescinding their layoffs, unlike some of their colleagues.",
      "Part of their work includes overseeing miner safety programs like the personal dust monitors, or PDM, required by the Department of Labor for coal miners. NIOSH is responsible for testing PDM's accuracy. The monitors are needed to reduce the risk of black lung disease.",
      "NIOSH had also been in the process of developing similar monitors for miners exposed to silica dust, before the layoffs gutted the teams overseeing that work.",

      "A coalition of 20 state Democratic attorneys general filed two federal lawsuits on Tuesday, claiming that the Trump administration is threatening to withhold billions of dollars in transportation and disaster-relief funds unless states agree to certain immigration enforcement actions.",
      "According to the complaints, both Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have threatened to cut off funding to states that refuse to comply with President Donald Trump's immigration agenda.",
      "While no federal funding is currently being withheld, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said during a press conference on Tuesday that the threat was \"imminent.\"",
      "\"President Donald Trump can't use these funds as a bargaining chip as his way of ensuring states abide by his preferred policies,\" Bonta added.",
      "Email messages seeking comment were sent Tuesday to the departments of Transportation and Homeland Security.",
      "Both lawsuits say that the Trump administration is violating the U.S. Constitution by trying to dictate federal spending when Congress has that power \u2014 not the executive branch.",
      "On April 24, states received letters from the Department of Transportation stating that they must cooperate on immigration efforts and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs or risk losing funds.",
      "New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin criticized the timing of Duffy's letter when Newark's airport struggles with radar outages and other issues.",
      "\"I wish the administration would stop playing politics with people's lives,\" Platkin said. \"I wish Secretary Duffy would do his damn job, which is to make sure planes land on time, not to direct immigration enforcement.\"",
      "Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul also criticized the administration, calling those funds, \"quite literally, lifesaving.\"",
      "\"This critical funding has nothing to do with immigration, and the administration's attempts to hold it hostage unless states agree to do the federal government's job of civil immigration enforcement is unconstitutional and outrageous,\" Raoul said. \"I am proud of the continued collaboration between state attorneys general and am committed to using all tools at our disposal to fight the Trump administration's ongoing attempts to play politics with Americans' lives.\"",
      "Meanwhile, on Feb. 24, states received letters from the Department of Homeland Security declaring that states that \"refuse to cooperate with, refuse to share information with, or even actively obstruct federal immigration enforcement reject these ideals and the history we share in common as Americans.\"",
      "\"If any government entity chooses to thumb its nose at the Department of Homeland Security's national security and public safety mission, it should not receive a single dollar of the Department's money unless Congress has specifically required it,\" Noem wrote in her letter.",
      "Attorneys general behind the lawsuits include the following states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont.",
      "\"Law enforcement agents across Minnesota work hard to protect and serve their communities, and we are truly grateful for all they do. Decisions about how police resources should be allocated to maintain public safety are made at the local level because every community has different safety needs,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said. \"It is both wrong and unlawful for the Trump Administration to demand Minnesota law enforcement step away from their patrols, investigations, and community-engagement work to instead enforce federal immigration law.\"",
      "\"These funds are meant to repair aging roads and bridges, strengthen public safety, and ensure law enforcement has the tools they need to act quickly in emergency situations. By clawing back this already-allocated funding, Donald Trump's White House is prioritizing political posturing over the safety and well-being of Americans,\" added Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.",
      "The cases are being spearheaded by California but were filed in federal court in Rhode Island, a detail that the attorneys general defended by saying they filed an \"any court that is going to be fair and objective and consider our factual presentation and legal analysis.\"",
      "The lawsuits are the latest legal actions that Democratic-led states have taken against Trump since he took office earlier this year. Bonta noted that California has filed more than 20 lawsuits against the administration, while Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said his state has launched more than a dozen.",
      "While the lawsuits have challenged policies on tariffs, federal employee firings to health care research, Trump's focus on immigration enforcement and the mass deportation of immigrants in the United States illegally have received the most attention.",

      "Ximena Arias Cristobal, who is in the country without authorization, was taken into ICE custody earlier this month after a May 5 traffic stop in Dalton, where she lives with her family. Local police cited her for making an improper turn and driving without a license before booking her into the Whitfield County Jail in Dalton, where she was picked up by ICE officers.",
      "But the Dalton Police Department and the city's prosecutor announced on Monday they had reviewed dashboard camera footage of the traffic stop and determined that the officer had stopped the wrong vehicle. Officials said the vehicle that made the improper turn was similar to the truck Arias Cristobal was driving.",

      "Federal officials have not disputed that Arias Cristobal and her father lack criminal records.",
      "\"[The] family will be able to return to Mexico together,\" McLaughlin said in her statement. \"Mr. Tovar had ample opportunity to seek a legal pathway to citizenship. He chose not to. We are not ignoring the rule of law.\"",
      "According to her family, Arias Cristobal came to the U.S. in 2010 and graduated from Dalton's high school last year. She did not qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program for other undocumented immigrant \"Dreamers\" who came to the U.S. as minors because she arrived after the policy's June 2007 cutoff date.",
      "During a press conference on Monday, Chris Crosser, the assistant Dalton police chief, expressed regret about his agency's mistake. But he said he could not opine on how ICE should treat Arias Cristobal's case going forward, given the new information. He said local officials notified her lawyers of the dismissed charges but did not alert ICE.",
      "\"It's a very regrettable place that we are right here, that we've ended up in this place with the way this unfolded and the way it turned out,\" Crosser said, adding that an internal review of the incident is ongoing.",
      "Arias Cristobal's lawyers said their client is likely to remain in ICE custody for now, even after the dismissal of the charges, since federal officials are holding her because she's in the U.S. without legal permission. They said she has a bond hearing scheduled for next week.",
      "Arias Cristobal's arrest is one of several high-profile cases of undocumented immigrants being arrested by ICE during the Trump administration, despite living in the country for many years and lacking criminal histories.",

    "summary": "Many of DOGE's claimed cuts appear to be misleading, and the potential for actual savings continues to be uncertain.",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has added a new batch of entries to what it calls its\u00a0 \"Wall of Receipts,\" touting purported savings in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Yet many of these claimed cuts appear to be misleading, and the potential for actual savings continues to be uncertain.",
      "According to the running tally on its website, DOGE claims it has saved American taxpayers a total of $170 billion. However, only $70.9 billion is itemized, and many of those entries continue to raise serious doubts about their accuracy.",
      "Some have expressed skepticism, including Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. Malkus, who has been tracking DOGE's work, said his review indicates the savings is more likely to be around $80 billion.",
      "\"[They are] over estimating contracts by a factor of two,\" Malkus said.",
      "Other costs and expenses associated with staffing reductions could end up costing the government even more than those purported savings.",
      "Since it was created by President Trump via an executive order on his first day in office, the Elon Musk-helmed DOGE started posting purported savings for cancellations to contracts, grants and leases. News organizations including CBS News have identified a multitude of mistakes including triple and even quadruple counting of contracts. Many of those have been corrected after being highlighted but DOGE's figure for total savings has not.",
      "On Monday, DOGE updated its \"Wall of Receipts\" to include at least 848 additional contracts. Those totaled $639 million, with claimed savings of $278.5 million. But 553 were noted as $0 savings.",
      "In this new release, CBS News has identified one major error involving a $38.7 million contract for wastewater monitoring for COVID. DOGE claimed $38 million in savings from canceling it. This is the second largest saving itemized in the most recent release. CBS News contacted the company, Verily Life Sciences, who disputed its cancellation and said that the contract was still active.",
      "A CDC spokesperson confirmed this and clarified that the contract was merely modified, not canceled. \"This was an expired scope of work that has been superseded by a new working contract,\" the spokesperson explained. The new contract, listed in government databases, is valued at $41 million and extends through August 6, 2026.",
      "\"It's very odd. It's disingenuous to say they saved all this money,\" Malkus told CBS News.",
      "A spokesperson for the White House and DOGE has not responded to questions from CBS News.",
      "DOGE is also now claiming savings in the tens of millions for canceling at least one federal contract\u2014just signed by the Trump administration.",
      "The largest new contract cancellation posted to the Wall of Receipts is for a $72 million administrative support contract recently awarded to Universal Strategic Advisors LLC to assist ICE with expanded immigration enforcement, part of the Trump administration's move to begin mass deportations. DOGE claimed $66 million in savings, yet the contract had only been awarded a few weeks earlier. A company representative confirmed it was \"terminated for convenience,\" with no explanation provided by the government. The representative also noted that ICE's operational needs for such services likely still exist, as the agency continues to expand. The Department of Homeland Security has not yet responded to a CBS News query.",
      "Claimed savings also include $5.6 million from cuts to a program monitoring youth tobacco use, $3.9 million from the cancellation of a national concussion surveillance system, and $1.9 million from terminating a National Firefighter Registry.",
      "According to Malkus \"They have this funny math definition of savings that doesn't accurately capture what the typical person would ever view as a savings amount.\"",
      "DOGE also appears to have deleted 96 contracts posted before May 4 totaling $124.7 million in purported savings.",
      "Despite these inconsistencies, DOGE maintains that the \"Wall of Receipts\" is a model of transparency.",
      "Elon Musk has repeatedly defended the platform \u2014 and DOGE's cost cutting regime \u2014 including citing a nearly $1 billion government survey that, he claimed, should have cost just $10,000. Requests to the White House for details on that claim have gone unanswered.",
      "Although the Trump administration insisted Musk was never formally the DOGE administrator, he was DOGE's public face. Musk recently announced that he'd be stepping back from DOGE to focus on Tesla and his other companies.",
      "Many of these contracts also fall under the \"termination for convenience\" rule that allows contractors to make claims to the federal government for expenses they've incurred like staffing expenses, office space and lost profits. Denials can be appealed to federal courts and may take years to be resolved.",
      "\"We know these termination settlements are going in, but is anyone paying attention? I just wonder who is keeping their eyes on that spending,\" Malkus says.",
      "Ultimately whether or any of these cuts add up to savings for taxpayers will be determined by Congress, when and if the Trump administration submits a rescission request, a process in which the President formally requests Congress take back funds allocated to specific programs.",
      "A CBS News analysis of government spending revealed that the federal government has spent $200 billion more in its first 100 days than last year\u2014 a trend that is projected to continue.",

    "story": [
      "Update: On May 12, a judge granted the Trump administration's request\u00a0to pause the lawsuit\u00a0brought by the ERISA Industry Committee while the administration reconsiders the recent mental health parity regulations, potentially rescinding or modifying them. The administration said it will not enforce the rules in the meantime.",
      "The Trump administration must soon make a decision that will affect millions of Americans' ability to access and afford mental health and addiction care.",
      "The administration is facing a May 12 deadline to declare if it will defend Biden-era regulations that aim to enforce mental health parity \u2014 the idea that insurers must cover mental illness and addiction treatment comparably to physical treatments for ailments such as cancer or high blood pressure.",
      "Although a federal parity law has been on the books since 2008, the regulations in question were issued last September. They represent the latest development in a nearly two-decade push by advocates, regulators, and lawmakers to ensure insurance plans cover mental health care equitably to physical health care.",
      "Within the dense 166-page final rule, two provisions have garnered particular attention: first, that insurers provide \"meaningful benefits\" \u2014 as defined by independent medical standards \u2014 for covered mental health conditions if they do so for physical conditions. For example, if insurers cover screening and insulin treatment for diabetes, then they can't cover screening alone for opioid addiction; they must also cover medications to treat opioid use disorder.",
      "Second, insurers must go beyond the written words of their policies to measure how they work in practice. For example, are patients having to seek out-of-network care more often for mental than physical care? If so, and it relates to an insurer's policies, then those policies must be adjusted.",
      "In January, a trade association representing about 100 large employers sued the federal government, claiming the regulations overstepped the administration's authority, would increase costs, and risked reducing the quality of care. The ERISA Industry Committee represents several Fortune 500 companies, such as PepsiCo and Comcast, which sponsor health insurance plans for their employees and would be directly affected by the new regulations.",
      "ERIC's lawsuit, filed days before President Trump's inauguration, puts the onus on the new administration to decide whether to defend the regulations. If it chooses not to, the rules could be scrapped.",
      "Mental health clinicians, patients, and advocates are urging the administration to fight back.",
      "\"What we're trying to do is make the spirit of parity a practical reality,\" said Patrick Kennedy, a Democratic former U.S. representative who sponsored the 2008 parity law in the House and co-founded the Kennedy Forum, which advocates on mental health issues. This is \"an existential issue for the country, public health, for every aspect of our society.\"",
      "A 2023 national survey found that more than 6 million adults with mental illness who wanted treatment in the past year were unable to receive it. Cost was one of the most common barriers.",
      "This lack of treatment harms people's physical health too, with research suggesting that undertreating depression can complicate chronic conditions, such as diabetes.",
      "Kennedy hopes that connection will prompt support from the Trump administration, which has made chronic disease a central focus of its \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda.",
      "\"You're never going to get MAHA if you don't integrate mental health,\" Kennedy said, mentioning the broad health movement embraced by his cousin HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "But James Gelfand, president and CEO of ERIC, said the regulations are a misguided attempt to solve the nation's mental health care crisis.",
      "People's difficulty accessing therapy or medication has less to do with insurance policy and more to do with a severe shortage of mental health care providers, he said, adding, \"No amount of penalties on employers\" or new parity regulations \"is going to change that dynamic until we get more of these providers.\"",
      "This point is at the heart of debate about parity issues. Is mental health care difficult to access because there are few providers, or are providers not accepting insurance because of low reimbursement rates? A recent study by the research institute RTI International suggests it has more to do with payment.",
      "The departments of Justice, Labor, and Health and Human Services declined to comment for this article. The Treasury Department, which is also involved in the lawsuit, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "\"They bank on you just giving up\"",
      "Psychiatric nurse practitioner Gabrielle Abelard employs about 40 clinicians in her therapy practice, which serves about 2,500 clients across Massachusetts each year.",
      "One of the programs she's most proud to offer is intensive in-home therapy for children with serious behavioral challenges, such as intergenerational trauma, aggressive outbursts, and self-harm. Two clinicians visit the child's home over months and work with the family, the child's doctors, and school staff.",
      "\"A big part of the work being done is helping to keep children in school, helping to keep them out of the hospital and even out of jail,\" Abelard said.",
      "But insurance barriers sometimes hinder the services.",
      "Abelard's staff has to obtain prior authorization from insurers before they can provide care. Then they have to reapply for authorization every two, three, or six months, depending on the insurer. When that reauthorization is delayed, Abelard faces a dilemma: continue seeing clients knowing insurers may not pay for those services or leave clients without care until the reauthorization comes through.",
      "Continuing services has cost her tens of thousands of dollars, she said, and months of bureaucratic hurdles to obtain back payments from insurers.",
      "\"They bank on you just giving up,\" she said.",
      "A goal of the landmark 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act was to decrease dilemmas such as Abelard's.",
      "But the bipartisan law primarily emphasized easy-to-measure treatment limits, saying insurers could not impose higher deductibles or copays for mental health care than they did for physical health care. What received less attention was how insurers should handle other limitations, such as prior authorization or fail-first requirements for patients to try certain therapies before they would be eligible for others.",
      "As a result, true parity remained elusive, said Deborah Steinberg, a senior health policy attorney at the nonprofit Legal Action Center.",
      "In 2020, Congress tried to address this through a new law, signed by Mr. Trump in his first term. The law required insurance plans to systematically analyze differences in certain treatment limitations for mental and physical health care and submit those analyses upon request to states and the federal governments.",
      "As the federal government reviewed some of those analyses, it discovered numerous parity violations. In a 2022 report, it detailed how some insurance plans covered nutritional counseling for diabetes, but not for anorexia or bulimia. Another plan required precertification for all outpatient mental health and addiction services but only for a select few outpatient medical and surgical services.",
      "The regulations issued in September aimed to provide insurers more guidance on the 2020 law and close loopholes that allowed such disparities, Steinberg said.",
      "\"Supply is the biggest problem\"",
      "One of the biggest changes in the new regulations was the focus on outcomes, such as how often patients go out of network for mental versus physical care.",
      "Steinberg called the provision \"a really important change.\" But Gelfand, president of the employer association suing to stop the regulations, said it ignores the complexity of mental health care.",
      "Many factors outside employers' and insurers' control affect how often a patient goes out of network, he said, including the availability of providers in the area, regional variations in clinical practices, and the patient's personal preference.",
      "Mental health clinicians know there's high demand for their services, so they have a lot of market power. That \"is creating the bad behavior from these providers,\" Gelfand said, such as refusing to accept insurance and not submitting out-of-network bills on clients' behalf.",
      "\"Supply is the biggest problem,\" Gelfand said.",
      "However, the RTI International study challenged that premise, with the authors noting that primary care physicians are in shorter supply than behavioral health providers yet have much lower out-of-network use.",
      "The authors point to insurance reimbursements as the culprit instead. The study found that insurance reimbursements for behavioral health visits are, on average, 22% lower than for medical or surgical office visits. The low pay creates a disincentive for psychologists and psychiatrists to join insurance networks.",
      "But the fix may not be as easy as raising reimbursement rates. Companies are already paying increasingly high premiums for employees' health insurance and many are concerned about sustaining these benefits.",
      "ERIC has championed other strategies, such as reforming medical education and residency programs to produce more mental health care providers, increasing telehealth services, and training primary care doctors to address basic mental health concerns. The organization often lobbies state and federal lawmakers, writes letters to regulatory agencies, and testifies before Congress on these issues.",
      "Narrowly focusing on insurance regulations could have unintended consequences, Gelfand said. Increased costs for health plans may get passed on to consumers. Or, in an attempt to keep costs down, insurers may narrow the size of their physical health care networks to match the mental health ones. In a worst-case scenario, employers could stop providing mental health benefits altogether.",
      "Advocates say that's unlikely, since many employees have come to expect this type of coverage, and employers recognize that providing mental health benefits can increase worker productivity and retention.",
      "Patrick Kennedy also pointed to the bigger picture around these issues: If people do not have insurance coverage for mental health care, they're more likely to end up in crisis at the hospital or in the criminal justice system, he said. Their children may be sent to foster care. Taxpayers finance those systems.",
      "\"We all end up picking up the tab for not enforcing parity,\" he said.",

Xinis gave the government to provide the privilege log until 3 p.m., saying that \"failure to file the privilege log or otherwise respond will be construed as an intentional refusal to comply with this Court's orders.\"",
      "The government filed their response at 3 p.m., but it was sealed to the public.",
      "The Justice Department had indicated last month that it would invoke certain privileges to protect information regarding Abrego Garcia's removal from the U.S., citing in a filing the attorney-client privilege, state secrets privilege and certain executive privileges.",
      "The government's response to the allegations of stonewalling and their invocation of privilege were filed under seal with the court.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys said there is \"little reason to believe\" that invoking the state secrets privilege is appropriate in this case.",
      "\"No military or intelligence operations are involved, and it defies reason to imagine that the United States' relationship with El Salvador would be endangered by any effort to seek the return of a wrongfully deported person who the Government admits never should have been removed to El Salvador in the first place,\" Abrego Garcia's attorneys wrote.",
      "Xinis has set a hearing for May 16 to hear further arguments about the government's privilege invocations, as well as to hear arguments from Abrego Garcia's attorneys on their desire for more fact-finding in the case.",
      "Xinis told a Justice Department attorney during a hearing last month that if the Trump administration does assert privileges, justifications must be provided for each claim, and she will make a determination as to whether they can stand.",
      "The Trump administration has invoked the state secrets privilege before, in a case involving the deportations of Venezuelan migrants to the Salvadoran prison, called the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, under war powers",
      "In Abrego Garcia's case, Xinis had ordered the Trump administration to turn over documents to his lawyers and allowed them to conduct depositions with certain administration officials. Some of the records were initially due last month, but Xinis agreed to push back her deadlines after the Trump administration filed information with the court under seal. One day earlier, Xinis had accused the administration of showing a \"willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys wrote that all depositions were completed by the end of last week, but said they are not satisfied with the answers they have received.",
      "President Trump and other top administration officials have repeatedly said it is up to El Salvador whether to release Abrego Garcia, who had been held at CECOT. As of April 21, he was being held at a lower-security facility in Santa Ana, according to a declaration from a State Department official.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who was born in El Salvador, entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 and has been living in Maryland since then. He was granted a withholding of removal, a legal status, in 2019 that prevented the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador because of a risk of persecution by local gangs.",
      "But Abrego Garcia was among the hundreds of migrants, mostly Venezuelans, sent by the Trump administration to CECOT in March.",
      "\"The Court should reject the Government's efforts to hide behind the state secrets privilege and compel all Defendants from DHS and DOJ to fully respond to written discovery and all deponents from those departments to fully answer deposition questions,\" the attorneys wrote to Judge Xinis, adding later that \"the state secrets privilege is not for hiding governmental blunders or malfeasance.\"",

      "\"I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech in Saudi Arabia. \"The sanctions were brutal and crippling, and served ... an important function, nevertheless, at the time, but now it's their time to shine.\"",
      "\"I say good luck, Syria. Show us something very special,\" the president said.",
      "Mr. Trump is also expected to greet new Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, according to the White House, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio is planning to meet with the Syrian foreign minister in Turkey later this week, Mr. Trump announced Tuesday. Mr. Trump will be the first U.S. president to meet with a Syrian leader since Bill Clinton met with Assad's father Hafez al-Assad.",
      "A former insurgent, Sharaa ascended to power last year as Bashar al-Assad's government rapidly crumbled in the span of several days \u2014 bringing an abrupt end to a more than decadelong civil war that devastated Syria. Sharaa previously led Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamist rebel group that fought the Assad regime and has its roots in the al-Qaeda-allied Nusra Front. Sharaa also participated in the insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq in the 2000s.",
      "Until last year, the U.S. had a $10 million bounty on Sharaa due to his leadership of HTS, which is designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "Despite the collapse of Assad's government, many of the intense U.S. sanctions placed on Syria during the last 13 years of Assad's reign \u2014 which were marked by civil war and severe human rights abuses \u2014 have remained in place. The Trump administration has been left to decide whether to normalize relations with a government in Syria that could hold back Iranian influence \u2014 even if its leader has his roots in extremist movements.",
      "The sudden detente between the U.S. and Syria, which have not had normal diplomatic relations in over a decade, was backed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Mr. Trump said. Saudi Arabia has begun building a relationship with Sharaa's government, a move that could be aimed at limiting the influence of Saudi Arabia's archrival Iran, which aided Assad in his fight against Sharaa and other rebels for years.",
      "Meanwhile, key U.S. ally Israel has been more wary of Sharaa, and has continued airstrikes against Syrian targets \u2014 angering Sharaa's government.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham expressed the need to exercise caution and go through the proper congressional channels in order to ease sanctions on Syria. Graham arrived in Turkey on Tuesday to meet with U.S. and Turkish officials about the situation in Syria.",
      "\"I am very inclined to support sanctions relief for Syria under the right conditions,\" Graham said in a statement. \"However, we must remember that the current leadership in Syria achieved its position through force of arms, not through the will of its people. I know the Trump administration has provided guidance to Syrian officials about conditions that need to be met before any sanctions can be relieved.\"",
      "Graham said he is \"certain that Congress would need to be informed of changes in conditions placed on Syria and how they have met those conditions before Congress can make an informed decision on whether or not it should approve the change in designation.\" He also said Israeli officials are \"extremely concerned\" about the \"state of play in Syria.\"",
      "\"Waiving congressionally passed sanctions is a complicated process,\" Graham said. \"While I would like to empower the new players in Syria, it has to be done in a coordinated fashion with our allies \u2014 especially our friends in Israel \u2014 so that numerous security concerns can be addressed.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for the first stop of his four-day trip to the Middle East. The trip is Mr. Trump's first of his second term and later this week, he will travel to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.",

    "story": [
      "CBS News got a rare look inside a new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u00a0detention center in Newark, New Jersey, where Newark\u00a0Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested\u00a0last week. Baraka was charged with trespassing and was taken into custody during his visit to the ICE detention center on Friday. He was later released and said he did not do anything wrong. Baraka said he was not at Delaney Hall to protest but to show support for members of a New Jersey congressional delegation\u00a0visiting the facility.",
      "Acting ICE director Todd Lyons gave CBS News its own guided tour this week of Delaney Hall \u2014 a two-story, 1,000-bed facility, now among the largest detention centers in the Northeast.",
      "ICE and the GEO Group, the facility's owner, reached a $1 billion, 15-year deal this year to open the detention center, expanding their holding capacity along the East Coast amid the\u00a0Trump administration's immigration crackdown.",
      "But while some ICE facilities nationwide are\u00a0reaching their limits, Delaney Hall has a number of empty beds. With 152 detainees, it is at just 15% capacity since opening its doors on May 1. ICE officials say 75% of those detained have criminal convictions or pending criminal convictions.",
      "\"Right now, the teams out here in New York and New Jersey are focused on the worst of the worst and getting those individuals off the street that have been let go by a lot of these sanctuary jurisdictions,\" Lyons told CBS News. \"I think as you see more cooperation with ICE, where we do arrest more criminal aliens in the street you'll see the population here rise.\"",
      "Footage from CBS News' tour of the building shows an outdoor recreational facility, bunk beds, single beds, medical exam rooms, a slot on the wall for \"detainee grievances,\" the cafeteria, kitchen and secure booths with computers and phones where officials say detainees can contact their lawyers or family members.",
      "\"They can have limited email access as well,\" Lyons said.",
      "When asked whether migrants detained in the Newark facility deserve\u00a0due process, which has emerged as a central issue amid the immigration crackdown, Lyons said he was proud of how the facility is being run.",
      "\"Illegal aliens that come into Delaney Hall, they do get due process. I am proud of the work that's done here because they are being treated in a safe and humane fashion,\" Lyons said.",
      "The Trump administration is \"actively looking at\" the possibility of suspending the writ of habeas corpus to handle people the administration says aren't in the country legally, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller\u00a0said Friday.",
      "Lyons was asked if he would be concerned if due process was taken away. ICE officials ended the interview before he could answer the question, later citing a security concern at the facility.",
      "Delaney Hall was operating as a halfway house for the past few years before ICE\u00a0announced in February\u00a0that it would be reestablished as a federal immigration processing and detention center \u2014 the first to open under President Trump's second term. It is located less than 10 miles outside of New York City and a little over five miles from\u00a0Newark Liberty International Airport.",
      "\"The location near an international airport streamlines logistics, and helps facilitate the timely processing of individuals in our custody as we pursue President Trump's mandate to arrest, detain and remove illegal aliens from our communities,\" former acting ICE Director Caleb Vitello said at the time.",
      "Baraka, who announced plans to run for governor in New Jersey, called his arrest a humiliation and questioned the oversight of the privately owned facility. Baraka alleges the GEO Group, which struck an agreement with ICE to open the facility as a detention center, did not obtain proper permits and blocked fire, electrical and plumbing inspections.",
      "\"I don't think people should be making profit off of prison, right, and I think there needs to be public oversight,\" Baraka told CBS News.",
      "In a\u00a0statement provided to CBS News New York, the GEO Group denied Baraka's allegations and said it had valid permits, adding the recent criticism is \"another unfortunate example of a politicized campaign by sanctuary city and open borders politicians in New Jersey to interfere with the federal government's efforts to arrest, detain, and deport dangerous criminal illegal aliens.\"",

      "\"In light of the deeply troubling news of a possible Qatari-funded Air Force One, and the reports that the attorney general personally signed off on this clearly unethical deal, I am announcing a hold on all DOJ political nominees until we get more answers,\" Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday morning.",
      "Mr. Trump is making his first international trip of his second term this week, where he arrived in Saudi Arabia Tuesday before visiting Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in the coming days. Meanwhile, an unprecedented offer by the royal family of Qatar to donate a jumbo jet for Mr. Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane has sent shockwaves through the political sphere back home.",
      "Schumer, a New York Democrat, called the possible gift \"so corrupt\" that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"would give a double take,\" while calling it a \"grave national security threat.\"",
      "The minority leader outlined a number of requests of the Justice Department, calling on its Foreign Agent Registration Act unit to disclose all activities by Qatari foreign agents inside the U.S. that could benefit Mr. Trump or his family's organization, while urging that the American people \"deserve to know the facts.\"",
      "Schumer asked who would install security measures on the jet, how the measures would be verified, what modifications would be needed to ensure its safety, along with who would pay for the installations and how much would they cost. He also asked what Qatar is being offered in return, while calling on the attorney general to testify before the House and Senate to explain why the gift does not violate any ethics law or the emoluments clause, which prohibits government officials from accepting compensation from a foreign state without the approval of Congress.",
      "\"Until the attorney general explains her blatantly inept decision, and we get answers to these questions, I will place a hold on all political nominees to the Department of Justice,\" Schumer said.",
      "The practical impact of the holds remains unclear. The holds would be expected to slow the nominations by requiring Senate Republicans to take each procedural vote rather than moving forward with the nominees under an expedited timeframe. And Justice Department nominees aren't voted on en bloc like military promotions, further delaying the process.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that the Qatari government had \"graciously offered to donate a plane to the Department of Defense,\" while noting that the details were still being worked out. And the president defended accepting the gift of the plane Monday, saying \"I could be a stupid person and say, oh no, we don't want a free plane.\" He added that it would \"go directly\" to his presidential library when he leaves office.",
      "But Democrats have vehemently denounced the offer, while a number of Republicans have called the ethics and national security implications of the potential gift into question.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who was asked whether Mr. Trump should reject the Qatari jet, told reporters Tuesday that he didn't know whether there had been an official offer yet. But he added that he thinks there are \"lots of issues associated with that offer,\" which he said should be further discussed.",

    "summary": "Gov. Gavin Newsom dramatically expanded California's Medicaid program, but after six years in office, the Democrat is forced to contemplate deep cuts.",
    "story": [
      "SACRAMENTO \u2014 Gov. Gavin Newsom didn't expect to be reckoning with another health care crisis.",
      "In March, as President Trump and congressional Republicans escalated a nationwide debate over whether to slash health care for poor and disabled Americans, the Democratic governor had to tell state lawmakers that California's health care costs had spiraled out of control due to major Medicaid initiatives he backed \u2014 including the nation's largest expansion of taxpayer-financed health care for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "His top officials at the state Department of Finance quietly disclosed to California lawmakers in a letter that the state had borrowed $3.4 billion to pay health insurers, doctors, and hospitals caring for patients enrolled in California's Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal. Facing rising health care costs amid a deepening state budget crisis, Newsom now must contemplate rolling back coverage and benefits.",
      "The second-term governor faces a tough political decision: renege on his promise to achieve universal health care and strip coverage from millions of immigrants who lack legal status or look elsewhere for budget cuts. With nearly 15 million low-income or disabled residents enrolled in Medi-Cal, California has more to lose on health care than any other state. Yet even as Newsom has condemned Mr. Trump's approach to tariffs and environmental policies, he has been tight-lipped on health policy.",
      "Complicating his political tightrope: Polling shows that providing health care coverage for immigrants without legal status has tepid support. And any resulting budget trouble could harm his political legacy should he run for president in 2028.",
      "\"We all know that the cuts are definitely coming,\" said Carlos Alarcon, a health and public benefits analyst with the California Immigrant Policy Center, which has helped spearhead a decadelong campaign in California to expand Medicaid to eligible immigrants without legal status. \"The governor should keep his commitment \u2014 we'll be very disappointed if we see cuts and rollbacks. When times get hard, it's always our marginalized and underserved communities that lose out.\"",
      "California allows any low-income adults to enroll in Medi-Cal if they earn 138% of the federal poverty level, or $21,597 a year or less, regardless of immigration status. But the costs have been dramatically higher than expected.",
      "Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown first expanded Medi-Cal to people age 19 and younger without legal status, but he expressed reluctance to go further because of potential costs. Newsom signed bills into law adding people age 20 and older. An estimated 1.6 million immigrants without legal status are now covered, and costs have soared to $9.5 billion per year, up from $6.4 billion estimated in November. The federal government chips in roughly $1.1 billion of that total for pregnancy and emergency care.",
      "\"We can expand out of the graciousness of our heart to everywhere and anywhere, but the moment these resources run out, now everybody loses. We're hitting that breaking point,\" said California Assembly member David Tangipa (R-Fresno). \"Either we get fiscally responsible, or there's not going to be services for anybody \u2014 and that includes the Californian and the undocumented immigrant.\"",
      "Democratic leaders responsible for approving the state budget declined interviews. In a statement, state Sen. Mar\u00eda Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles), who championed the expansion in the legislature, said, \"Rolling back this progress would be a harmful and shortsighted decision.\"",
      "Lawmakers are considering freezing enrollment for immigrants without legal status, imposing cost-sharing measures such as drug copays or premiums, or restricting benefits, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified to protect relationships at the state Capitol.",
      "However, it's unlikely Newsom will slash funding in his budget revision set for release on May 14. Instead, cuts would follow if congressional Republicans approve a budget deal with major reductions in federal spending on Medicaid.",
      "\"This is going to be very problematic for the governor. Budget cuts will disrupt the lives of millions of immigrants who just got health care, but the governor has got to do something, because this is not sustainable,\" said Mark Peterson, an expert on health care and national politics at UCLA. \"The prospect of cutting other places in order to support immigrants living in the country illegally would be a hard political sale; I don't see that happening.\"",
      "Should Newsom, along with the Democratic-controlled legislature, be forced to make cuts, he could argue he had no choice. Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans have threatened states like California with the latest U.S. House proposal cutting Medicaid funding by 10 percentage points for states that provide coverage for immigrants without legal status. For Newsom, political analysts say, Mr. Trump could make an easy scapegoat.",
      "\"He can blame Trump \u2014 there's only so much money to go around,\" said Mike Madrid, an anti-Trump Republican political analyst in California who specializes in Latino issues. \"It's making people look at the health care that they can't afford and ask, 'Why the hell are we giving it for free to people who are here illegally?'\"",
      "The exorbitant cost has come as somewhat of a surprise.",
      "In Newsom's first budget proposal as governor \u2014 in which he called for expanding Medi-Cal to young adults without legal status \u2014 his administration estimated it would cost roughly $2.4 billion annually to extend benefits to all eligible people regardless of status. But the latest figure reported to legislators was nearly four times as much.",
      "Newsom declined to respond to questions from KFF Health News, instead referencing previous comments that leave the door open to scaling back Medi-Cal. The governor noted \"sober\" discussions with lawmakers and said cutting Medi-Cal is \"an open-ended question\" that the president will heavily influence.",
      "\"What's the impact of Donald Trump on a lot of these things? What's the impact of federal vandalism to a lot of these programs?\" Newsom asked rhetorically in December, suggesting it's unclear whether he'll be able to sustain the expansion to immigrants without legal status in future years.",
      "Newsom expanded Medi-Cal in three phases, starting with immigrants ages 19 to 25, who became eligible in 2020, resisting pressure from health care advocates for one big, costly expansion. He argued doing it incrementally would ultimately save California money.",
      "\"It is the right thing morally and ethically,\" Newsom said in 2020. \"It is also the financially responsible thing to do.\"",
      "Record budget surpluses in recent years allowed Democrats to continue. Older adults ages 50 to 64 became eligible in 2022, and Newsom closed the gap the following year, approving coverage starting in 2024 for the biggest group, those ages 26 to 49.",
      "But the costs have grown tremendously while the budget picture has soured, according to a KFF analysis of the most recent 2023 records available from the state Department of Health Care Services, which administers Medi-Cal.",
      "Aside from children, it was more expensive to provide Medicaid coverage to immigrants without legal status than to legal residents. For instance, Medi-Cal paid L.A. Care, a major health insurer in Los Angeles, an average of $495.32 monthly to provide care for a childless adult without legal status and $266.77 for a legal resident without kids.",
      "Not only were immigrants without legal status more expensive, California footed most of the cost. The state paid roughly between 60% and 70% of health care costs for a childless adult immigrant covered by L.A. Care, and about 10% for a legal resident without kids. Those costs don't encapsulate the entire cost of providing care, which can vary depending on where Medi-Cal patients live, and grow higher when filling prescriptions, going to the dentist, or seeking mental health care.",
      "These payments also differ by insurer, but the trend holds across the state's Medi-Cal health insurance plans. Patients in most of the state can choose from more than one health plan.",
      "Children without legal status in many cases were cheaper to cover than children who were legal residents. Generally, kids are healthier and require less care.",
      "Mike Genest, who served as finance director under former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, argued that the state should have planned for the immense price tag.",
      "\"The idea that we'd be able to afford in the long run paying for health care for all these undocumented people \u2014 it's beyond unsustainable,\" Genest said.",
      "While costs are high now, the expansion of Medi-Cal will result in long-term savings to taxpayers and the health care system, said Anthony Wright, who previously lobbied for the expansion as the head of the nonprofit Health Access and is now fighting Medicaid cuts as the executive director of Families USA, based in Washington, D.C.",

Free alleges that during February's election, the DNC improperly combined two questions and tallied votes together. In doing so, Free argues, the DNC used procedures that gave male candidates an advantage over female candidates, violating the party's charter.",
      "During a more than two-hour meeting, committee members debated whether the election violated party rules. Representatives for Hogg and Kenyatta, a Pennsylvania state lawmaker, argued it's up to the DNC chair to interpret whether voting procedures are consistent with the rules.

      "President Trump on Monday called on drugmakers to lower their prices within the next month to be closer to those charged in other high-income countries, threatening to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they fail to do so.",
      "\"Starting today, the United States will no longer subsidize the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing, we're subsidizing others' health care, in countries where they pay a small fraction of what, for the same drug, that what we pay,\" the president told reporters Monday at the White House.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that \"some prescription drug and pharmaceutical drug prices will be reduced almost immediately by 50% to 80% to 90%,\" and \"Big Pharma will either abide by this principle voluntarily or we'll use the power of the federal government to ensure that we are paying the same price of other countries.\"",
      "The president said his move marks an expansion of the \"most favored nation\" idea from his first term, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services set steep price caps tied to the prices charged in other developed countries for how much it would pay for some prescription drugs.",
      "\"It's called most favored nation,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We are going to pay the lowest price there is in the world. We will get, whoever is paying the lowest price, that's the price that we're going to get.\"",
      "At the time, that proposal applied only to drugs given by providers in hospitals and clinics through Medicare Part B \u2014 not the broader swath of prescriptions that seniors fill at drug store pharmacies. Medicare said it would only pay hospitals and doctors for a price based on the lowest amount paid among developed countries.",
      "A\u00a0report\u00a0by the Trump administration during its first term found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries on covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",
      "That idea was blocked by the courts during Mr. Trump's first term, after the administration shortcutted \"rulemaking\" steps to try to rush to implement the proposal in its final days. The Biden administration later formally abandoned the proposal and sought instead to curb drug costs through the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program created by Congress.",
      "Under the new version of Mr. Trump's \"most favored nation\" proposal, the White House says it will seek to develop new rules to revive the price caps in Medicare, in addition to a new \"mechanism\" to allow Americans to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at this price.",
      "Drug manufacturers that \"fail to offer most-favored-nation pricing\" voluntarily will have the prices imposed on them through new rules, which the White House says it is directing the Department of Health and Human Services to propose.",
      "Over the next month, CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said the administration is planning to approach \"pharmaceutical companies to talk specifically about what we want the most favored nation price to be, based on the best data we have.\"",
      "\"We're looking forward to a thoughtful interaction with these corporate leaders, many of whom we've spoken to and in quite will agree, the system is not right the way it is,\" Oz said.",
      "It's not yet clear which drugs will be included in the president's push, although he mentioned the \"fat shot drug\" as potentially one of them.",
      "A CMS spokesperson was not able to immediately respond to a request for comment, asked about how the agency was determining which drugmakers to approach and what the pricing would be.",
      "White House officials said ahead of the announcement that they were looking for price reductions in drug costs across both federal and private health insurance, not just Medicare. No specific class of drugs is being targeted, they said, but they are planning to focus on drugs with the biggest disparity between U.S. and foreign prices.",
      "Americans pay significantly more than citizens of other countries do for many of the same pharmaceutical drugs. Experts have blamed it on a range of factors, including a complex web of insurers, middlemen and providers that underpin the U.S. health care system, unlike other countries, which set prices through government-run health care systems.",
      "Industry's response to order",
      "The drug industry has opposed \"most favored nation\" pricing as a \"deeply flawed proposal,\" calling it \"importing socialized medicine\" and claiming it could upend small and mid-size biotech companies in the U.S.",
      "\"Applying other countries' antiquated approach to how they value \u2014 and pay \u2014 for medicines will stall investment across America's biotech companies, risk access to vital treatments and cures for millions of American patients, and lead to fewer American jobs,\" John F. Crowley, president of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, said in a statement Monday.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry argued that Mr. Trump's 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \"upper hand\" in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S. The industry has long argued that forcing lower prices will hurt profits, and ultimately affect innovation and its efforts to develop new medicines.",
      "\"To lower costs for Americans, we need to address the real reasons U.S. prices are higher: foreign countries not paying their fair share and middlemen driving up prices for U.S. patients,\" Stephen J. Ubl, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement.",
      "Ubl said \"importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal\" for patients and workers. However, he praised the White House for ordering the U.S. Trade Representative to address \"freeloading on American-financed innovation.\"",
      "\"The administration is right to use trade negotiations to force foreign governments to pay their fair share for medicines. U.S. patients should not foot the bill for global innovation,\" Ubl said.",
      "A group representing pharmacy benefit manager companies \u2014 the \"middlemen\" that drugmakers blame for driving up prices \u2014 praised Mr. Trump \"for rightfully recognizing the price is the problem.\"",
      "Greg Lopes, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, did not address that Mr. Trump also pledged to \"cut out the middlemen\" as part of his new order, calling on HHS to create a way for Americans to buy medications directly from drugmakers at the most favored nation price.",
      "\"We should look at every avenue to get drug companies to lower list prices. Americans are getting ripped off paying the highest prescription drug prices of any nation, and that is why America's PBMs have repeatedly called on big drug companies to lower their prices,\" Lopes said in a statement.",

      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 The strange reproductive habits of a large, carnivorous New Zealand snail were once shrouded in mystery. Now, footage of the snail laying an egg from its neck has been captured for the first time, the country's conservation agency said Wednesday.",
      "What looks like a tiny hen's egg is seen emerging from an opening below the head of the Powelliphanta augusta snail, a threatened species endemic to New Zealand.",
      "The video was taken at a facility on the South Island's West Coast, where conservation rangers attempting to save the species from extinction have cared for a population of the snails in chilled containers for nearly two decades.",
      "The conditions in the containers mimic the alpine weather in their only former habitat - a remote mountain they were named for, on the West Coast of the South Island, that has been engulfed by mining.",
      "Lisa Flanagan from the Department of Conservation, who has worked with the creatures for 12 years, said the species still holds surprises.",
      "\"It's remarkable that in all the time we've spent caring for the snails, this is the first time we've seen one lay an egg,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Like other snails, Powelliphanta augusta are hermaphrodites, which explains how the creatures can reproduce when encased in a hard shell. The invertebrate uses a genital pore on the right side of its body, just below the head, to simultaneously exchange sperm with another snail, which is stored until each creates an egg.",
      "Each snail takes eight years to reach sexual maturity, after which it lays about five eggs a year. The egg can take more than a year to hatch.",
      "\"Some of our captive snails are between 25 and 30 years old,\" said Flanagan. \"They're polar opposites to the pest garden snail we introduced to New Zealand, which is like a weed, with thousands of offspring each year and a short life.\"",
      "The dozens of species and subspecies of Powelliphanta snails are only found in New Zealand, mostly in rugged forest and grassland settings where they're threatened by habitat loss.",
      "They're carnivores that slurp up earthworms like noodles and are some of the world's largest snails with oversized, distinctive shells in a range of rich earth colors and swirling patterns.",
      "The Powelliphanta augusta was the center of public uproar and legal proceedings in the early 2000s, when an energy company's plans to mine for coal threatened to destroy the snails' habitat.",
      "Some 4,000 were removed from the site and relocated, while 2,000 more were housed in chilled storage in the West Coast town of Hokitika to ensure the preservation of the species, which is slow to breed and doesn't adapt well to new habitats.",
      "In 2011, some 800 of the snails accidentally died in a Department of Conservation refrigerator with faulty temperature control.",

      "The Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus a half century ago is expected to plunge uncontrolled back to Earth within hours. The Aerospace Corporation's reentry prediction map\u00a0currently forecasts the object to fall through the atmosphere at 05:54 UTC on Saturday, or 1:54 am ET, but that forecast has fluctuated.",
      "It's too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according to space debris-tracking experts.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek, a lecturer at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph, if it remains intact.",
      "\"While not without risk, we should not be too worried,\" Langbroek said in an email.",
      "Given its orbit, the spacecraft could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, Langbroek wrote in a\u00a0blog post. That represents a vast area, including the United States, South America, Africa, Australia, and most of Europe and Asia south of the Arctic Circle. Still, most of the Earth is covered by water so the risk to humans remains low.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\"",

      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \"it'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\"",
      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn.

      "The study found that high-density regions close to major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled rocket reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern U.S. or around major cities in Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",

      "Gates first revealed his plan to give away virtually all of his wealth in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" last week, saying he will take an \"equity, value-driven approach\" to the distribution of funds. It will go toward several causes, with a focus on global health and education. His ultimate goal: save tens of millions of lives, especially those of women and children suffering from HIV, malaria and other deadly illnesses.",
      "Here are some highlights from his discussion about his $200 billion mission, as well as what he calls his \"last chapter\" in life \u2014 and more.",
      "\"It's wild that somebody can have as much money as I do\"",
      "Gates said he won't miss the money, but he does hope he'll live long enough to see some of the positive ways it has helped hard-hit communities.",
      "\"I hope I'm still alive when we finish the 20 years, but I will save a little bit to be able to buy hamburgers \u2014 as much as I need,\" Gates joked.",
      "Some might be thinking, Why now? To Gates, it's simple: You can get more done by spending more money. That's why the Microsoft co-founder said he's \"doubling down.\"",
      "\"And after that, there will be other very wealthy people who can understand what the problems are, what's still left over,\" Gates said.",
      "\"And, in a way, it's wild that somebody can have as much money as I do,\" he added.",
      "More children will die due to aid cuts by Trump administration, Gates says",
      "As the U.S. and other European countries cut foreign aid budgets, health experts have voiced concerns about the implications for global health. In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March, marking a significant drop since 1990. Gates expects deaths could rise again, and it's something he wants to address.",
      "\"I will say, despite the challenges we have right now, which are huge and surprising, I'm very optimistic about the progress we can make over the next 20 years,\" Gates said. \"The next five, there will be setbacks because of these cutbacks, but we will get \u2013 and so the number 5 million might go up for a bit, which shouldn't happen. It's terrible. But, over time, we will get that number down even below 3 million.\"",
      "Gates urges U.S. leaders to consider the difference that maintaining foreign aid \u2014 roughly 1% of last year's federal budget\u00a0\u2014 can make.",
      "\"For 1%, if you can save lives for 1,000 times less than we save lives here, and if that creates stability in those countries, so they're thriving countries that will participate in the global economy,\" Gates explained. \"And we don't have to intervene with our military or anything, and the strategic relationship with them, where they see that we have helped them advance, and that that money is why you will be able to see a future pandemic early and stop it from spreading like COVID did all the way to the United States.\"",
      "Gates hopes the U.S. will follow his lead in helping some of the world's poorest nations, and said he will always advocate for governments to help.",
      "\"We never ask for more than 1% to go to helping the poorest. And I think cutting \u2014 when you're well below that 1%, cutting that I think \u2013 doesn't reflect the values I think we should stand for,\" said Gates, adding that the U.S. shouldn't cut money for vaccines or HIV medicines.",
      "Some of these topics came up during a three-hour dinner\u00a0between Gates and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in December. Gates said they had a \"great discussion\" about polio and\u00a0 innovations in HIV prevention and working together to get an \"HIV cure sooner.\"",
      "\"Since then, some of the programs have been cut off,\" Gates said.",
      "On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to start the country's withdrawal from the World Health Organization. In March, the Trump administration revealed plans to shrink the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 a major overhaul that impacted thousands of employees. Part of his plans to slash federal spending also included the suspension of U.S. foreign aid assistance, essentially gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Last week, a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget said Mr. Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 also includes \"enormous cuts to foreign aid,\" focusing more on \"targeted\" foreign aid in situations when it's in the interest of the U.S.",
      "\"I'm hoping, both with the president or the Congress, to get them to restore some of those aid activities,\" said Gates, adding that the Gates Foundation can't replace U.S. assistance.",
      "In fiscal 2024, the U.S. federal government disbursed nearly $72 billion in foreign aid, with $14.4 billion toward humanitarian assistance, the Pew Research Center reports, citing ForeignAssistance.gov.",
      "Gates fears foreign aid cuts could lead to even more childhood deaths due to a lack of vaccines and HIV medicines that prevent mothers from infecting their babies.",
      "\"Instead of [deaths] going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "The \"last chapter\" of Gates' career",
      "Gates is marking many significant milestones this year \u2014 the Gates Foundation turning 25 years old, Microsoft turning 50 and Gates himself turning 70.",
      "\"I'm stunned that I'm 70, because, when I was young, and I thought, hey, those old people don't\u2026 they're not very up to date on what's changing, what's important. And so here I am,\" said Gates, admitting that his \"Microsoft days were very intense.\"",
      "These days, he's spending his spare time playing pickleball and tennis, and reading. He also travels regularly to Africa and India as part of his work with the Gates Foundation, overseeing some of the programs he's partnered with to improve health and development.",
      "\"I get to travel and see the impact. And I'm not working. In my 20s, all I did was work,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he doesn't \"feel like a 70-year-old,\" but he wishes he had \"even more time.\"",
      "Toward the end of a letter he posted online Thursday explaining his decision to give away virtually all his wealth, Gates said he's beginning the \"last chapter\" of his career.",
      "\"And I hope I'm lucky enough that during the 20 years that we spend all of these resources that I will be able to both help guide it somewhat and see the work and make sure that others are going to step in to pick up whatever doesn't get done during these next 20 years,\" he told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Part of Gates' motivation stems from the generosity of his good friend Warren Buffett, who has donated billions to the Gates Foundation over the past 19 years. Buffett, who is now 94 and announced this month he'll be\u00a0stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, made lifetime pledges two decades ago to five charities \u2014 including the Gates Foundation \u2014 that will continue until his death. At the time, it was the\u00a0largest philanthropic pledge in history.",
      "\"I should make sure that it's well spent. Warren Buffett's generosity, that's always \u2014 I have felt a huge responsibility to make sure his generosity is highly impactful. And now this is the last stage of all that,\" Gates added.",
      "What Gates hopes the world says about him in 100 years",
      "When asked what he hopes the world says about him 100 years from now, Gates said he has \"no interest\" in creating a lasting name for himself.",
      "\"If I cared about that, maybe I'd make the foundation a foundation that lasts forever. And other people choose to do that,\" Gates said. \"That's fine. I don't think that's the way to have the most impact. Most of the things I work on will no longer be problems.\"",
      "He hopes people a century from now will be puzzled by some of the diseases he's working to eradicate, like tuberculosis, measles and malaria.",
      "\"I think we will treat all children's lives as having value, because the world will be rich enough and the innovation of tools to let you do that will be so strong, you know, the childhood death number should be very small and not different between different countries,\" Gates said.",
      "AI is a \"very empowering tool\" for future generations",
      "Another tool that Gates believes could help: artificial intelligence.",
      "\"In a certain sense, it's going to be so novel that none of us are ready for it. But some of the aspects of it are incredibly positive,\" said Gates, who said he's seen firsthand how AI-powered teaching assistant Khanmigo, built by the nonprofit Khan Academy, is being used by math teachers in New Jersey.",
      "While AI can help foster curiosity and be a \"very empowering tool,\" Gates said kids will continue to forge their own paths based on their unique interests.",
      "\"Kids will choose what they're interested in. They don't all have to be AI scientists,\" he said.",
      "While some may voice concerns over AI being a motivation killer, Gates argues the opposite. It could give you more freedom and time to spend on things you're passionate about.",
      "\"Well, that's called the 'embarrassment of riches' problem, that you won't have to work the long hours that you work today. You won't have a shortage of doctors and huge waiting lists,\" said Gates, adding that he hopes AI will help support countries, like Africa, that are facing doctor shortages.",
      "\"Society will get to decide: how do you spend time? And how quickly that comes, you would get pretty broad disagreement, but, in general, that's where we're headed. And so \u2014 we will have more freedom. It's a lot better than things going backwards,\" he added.",

    "summary": "Bill Gates says $200 billion spent over the next 20 years will go toward causes to help save and improve lives around the world. He also criticized the Trump administration's cuts to aid, saying they could lead to more child deaths.",
    "story": [
      "Bill Gates wants to share all of his good fortune \u2014 literally.",
      "The billionaire businessman and philanthropist revealed exclusively to \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday that he will give away virtually all of his wealth over the next 20 years through the Gates Foundation. He says a total of $200 billion will go toward causes that will help save and improve lives around the world.",
      "\"By deciding to spend all this money in the next 20 years, we can get a lot more done,\" Gates said in an interview taped last week, days before he announced the initiative. He's confident the money will save \"tens of millions of lives.\"",
      "A change of plans",
      "It's a decision Gates did not take lightly, explaining in a letter posted online Thursday that he was inspired by a famous quote from Andrew Carnegie's 1889 essay \"The Gospel of Wealth,\" which argued \"the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\"",
      "Gates said his net worth, which is currently $108 billion, will drop 99% over the next two decades.",
      "\"People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them. There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people,\" Gates wrote.",
      "So, he changed his plans. The Gates Foundation, which was originally supposed to shutter decades after his and ex-wife Melinda French Gates' deaths, will now close in 2045.",
      "The Gates Foundation, which is marking its 25th anniversary this year, has already spent $100 billion to help cut the global childhood mortality rate by investing in medical innovations. Gates said he's seen firsthand how impactful the distribution of vaccines for illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia can be. That's why he's determined to \"double down.\"",
      "He has three main goals: stopping the deaths of mothers and children from preventable causes, eradicating deadly infectious diseases, and putting more countries on a path to prosperity \u2014 with a focus on improving education.",
      "Gates says more children could die due to Trump administration aid cuts",
      "But he's concerned progress could be stalled as the U.S. and European countries scale back on foreign aid and reduce humanitarian funding.",
      "In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March. Without substantial government assistance, Gates says that number will rise.",
      "\"So we should be going from 5 million children dying a year over the next five years to 4 million. And now with these cuts, if they're not reversed, we will go to over 6 million dying. So, instead of going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he's been in touch with President Trump and had a \"great discussion\" about some of his foundation's initiatives, including HIV prevention and polio, over dinner at Mar-a-Lago in December.",
      "\"Since then, some of the programs have been cut off,\" Gates said. \"And I'm hoping, both with the president or the Congress, to get them to restore some of those aid activities.\"",
      "On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to start the country's withdrawal from the World Health Organization. In March, the Trump administration revealed plans to shrink the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 a major overhaul that impacted thousands of employees. Part of his plans to slash federal spending also included the suspension of U.S. foreign aid assistance, essentially gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Last week, a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget said Mr. Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 also includes \"enormous cuts to foreign aid,\" focusing more on \"targeted\" foreign aid in situations when it's in the interest of the U.S.",
      "The Gates Foundation isn't large enough to replace U.S. foreign aid. In fiscal 2024 alone, the U.S. federal government disbursed nearly $72 billion in foreign aid, according to the Pew Research Center, which cited ForeignAssistance.gov. The U.S. federal government spent four times more on global health than the Gates foundation, Gates said.",
      "\"You always want more money going into these things where you're saving lives for a few thousand dollars. And I will be an advocate for that,\" said Gates, praising global health initiatives spearheaded by former President George W. Bush \u2014 like his Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief launched in 2003 \u2014 which he says should be maintained.",
      "\"The last stage\" of a long career",
      "Gates, who is turning 70 years old this fall, said this move marks the beginning of the \"last chapter\" in his career. But he certainly hopes he's around to see the impact it makes.",
      "\"Well, I wish I had even more time. But I have to say, 'OK, this is the last part of my life. And I'm a steward of these resources,'\" he told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I should make sure that it's well spent. And now this is the last stage of all that.\"",
      "When asked if he'll miss his billion-dollar fortune, Gates chuckled.",
      "\"No, I won't. I hope I'm still alive when we finish the 20 years, but I will save a little bit to be able to buy hamburgers as much as I need,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Pete Buttigieg made the comments following a town hall in the Hawkeye state.",
    "story": [
      "Cedar Rapids, Iowa \u2014 Pete Buttigieg, who served as transportation secretary under former President Joe Biden, appeared to acknowledge Tuesday that he believed Biden should not have run for a second White House term.",
      "When asked by reporters if the Democratic party would have been better off without Biden as the nominee, Buttigieg responded, \"Maybe, you know, right now, with the benefit of hindsight, I think most people would agree that is the case.\"",
      "Buttigieg, who won the 2020 Democratic Iowa caucus, made the remarks following a town hall in the Hawkeye state hosted by a progressive veterans PAC. Buttigieg served as Biden's transportation secretary from 2021 until he left office in January.",
      "Buttigieg addressed whether he saw signs that Biden was experiencing any kind of cognitive decline. Speculation about Biden's situation ramped up following his poor debate performance against President Trump in June, and the ensuing fallout ultimately led to Biden dropping out of the race.",
      "\"Every time I needed something from him from the West Wing I got it,\" Buttigieg said of Biden. \"And the time I worked closest with him in his last year was around the Baltimore bridge collapse. And I want to tell you is that the same president the world saw addressing that, was the president that I was involved with.\"",
      "This visit to Iowa comes amid a flurry of speculation that Buttigieg is considering a second presidential run in 2028. Buttigieg recently passed on a 2026 run for the U.S. Senate in Michigan, and has made a number of media appearances in recent weeks.",
      "\"Anyone can come to Iowa just before an election's coming up,\" Buttigieg joked with the audience shortly after taking the stage at the VoteVets event. \"I wanted to make sure I had a chance to talk with the people I got to know five or six years ago, and people I'm seeing for the very first time.\"",
      "Buttigieg played coy on whether he was assessing a potential presidential run, telling reporters that, \"Right now, I'm not running for anything. Part of what's exciting about an opportunity like this is to be campaigning for values and for ideas rather than a specific elected office.\"",
      "When asked by an audience member what can be done to combat some of the Trump administration's proposed cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs, Buttigieg encouraged them not to \"back down.\"",
      "\"There's this sense of inevitability, invincibility, right, that the president's trying to create,\" he said. \"But it's not true. Don't back down. They'll back down when he screws up badly enough, not as often as I'd like, but they change their mind all the time. They changed their mind on tariffs.\"",
      "Buttigieg's remarks echoed similar comments he's made in media appearances in recent weeks, especially in speaking about the future of the Democratic party, which he has encouraged to \"meet people where they are.\"",
      "Buttigieg said it is \"politically and substantively wrong\" for the party to suggest returning to a status quo when Democrats were last in power.",
      "\"I am not here to say we gotta make things back the way they were in 2023,\" Buttigieg said. \"The hard truth is, if our government, our politics, our society and our economy were working, we wouldn't be here. Pro-authoritarian populist movements, they don't just come out of nowhere.\"",
      "Buttigieg refused to weigh in on whether Iowa should be the Democrat's first primary contest in 2028. In 2023, the Democratic National Committee, with the support of Biden, controversially changed the calendar to make South Carolina the first state in Democratic primary schedule. Prior to that, the Iowa caucuses had led off the process since 1972.",
      "\"People like me are makers, not takers, on the rules like that,\" Buttigieg said. \"What I will say is Iowa showed me what can happen through a process where you have to be in backyards, doing a few town halls a day. It made it possible for me to emerge as a candidate, and it certainly made me better, not just as a candidate but as a public servant.\"",

    "summary": "Pete Rose and \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson are now both eligible for baseball's Hall of Fame after their careers were tarnished by sports gambling scandals.",
    "story": [
      "Pete Rose and \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson were reinstated by Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred on Tuesday, making both eligible for the sport's Hall of Fame after their careers were tarnished by sports gambling scandals.",
      "Manfred announced Tuesday that he was changing the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, saying bans would expire at death. Rose and Jackson were among 17 total players reinstated Tuesday.",
      "Rose's permanent ban was lifted eight months after his death and came a day before the Cincinnati Reds will honor baseball's career hits leader with Pete Rose Night.",
      "Also included in Tuesday's reinstatement were Arnold \"Chick\" Grandel, Eddie Cicotte, Oscar \"Happy\" Felsch, Fred McMullin, Charles \"Swede\" Risberg, George \"Buck\" Weaver and Claude \"Lefty\" Williams. They, along with Jackson, were part of the 1919 Chicago Black Sox scandal, in which they were accused of taking bribes from gambling concerns to intentionally lose the World Series that year. The scandal ultimately led to the appointment of the first baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who banned the implicated White Sox players.",
      "Jackson's level of complicity in the Black Sox scandal remains a point of contention. A previous effort to have Jackson reinstated in 2015 resulted in Manfred writing to the Shoeless Joe Jackson Museum, \"The results of this work demonstrate to me that it is not possible now, over 95 years since those events took place and were considered by Commissioner Landis, to be certain enough of the truth to overrule Commissioner Landis' determinations.\"",
      "Also reinstated were William Cox, Benny Kauff, Joe Gedeon, Gene Paulette, Lee Magee, Phil Douglas, Albert J. \"Cozy\" Dolan and Jimmy O'Connell.",
      "Under the Hall of Fame's current rules, the earliest Rose or Jackson could be inducted would be in 2028.",
      "Rose agreed to a permanent ban on Aug. 23, 1989, following an investigation commissioned by Major League Baseball concluded Rose repeatedly bet on the Reds as a player and manager of the team from 1985-87, a violation of a long-standing MLB rule.",
      "Rose first applied for reinstatement in September 1997, but then-Commissioner Bud Selig never ruled on the request. Manfred in 2015 rejected a petition for reinstatement, saying \"Rose has not presented credible evidence of a reconfigured life.\"",
      "Rose died Sept. 30 at age 83, and a new petition was filed Jan. 8 by Jeffrey Lenkov, a lawyer who represented Rose. Lenkov and Rose's daughter Fawn had met with Manfred on Dec. 17.",
      "Rose's supporters have included U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said he intends to pardon Rose posthumously. Manfred discussed Rose with Mr. Trump when the pair met in April, but he hasn't disclosed specifics of their conversation.",
      "In a letter to Lenkov, Manfred wrote, \"In my view, a determination must be made regarding how the phrase 'permanently ineligible' should be interpreted in light of the purposes and policies behind Rule 21, which are to: (1) protect the game from individuals who pose a risk to the integrity of the sport by prohibiting the participation of such individuals; and (2) create a deterrent effect that reduces the likelihood of future violations by others.",
      "\"In my view, once an individual has passed away, the purposes of Rule 21 have been served. Obviously, a person no longer with us cannot represent a threat to the integrity of the game. Moreover, it is hard to conceive of a penalty that has more deterrent effect than one that lasts a lifetime with no reprieve. Therefore, I have concluded that permanent ineligibility ends upon the passing of the disciplined individual, and Mr. Rose will be removed from the permanently ineligible list.\"",
      "A 17-time All-Star during a playing career from 1963-86, Rose holds record for hits (4,256), games (3,562), at-bats (14,053), plate appearances (15,890) and singles (3,215). He was the 1963 NL Rookie of the Year, 1973 MVP and 1975 World Series MVP. A three-time NL batting champion, he broke the prior hits record of 4,191 set by Ty Cobb from 1905-28.",
      "Cincinnati Reds owner Bob Castellini said Tuesday he was \"thankful\" for the decision to reinstate Rose.",
      "\"Pete is one of the greatest players in baseball history, and Reds Country will continue to celebrate him as we always have,\" Castellini wrote in a statement.",
      "The Philadelphia Phillies, of which Rose was a member for five seasons, said in a statement Tuesday that it supported the decision to have him reinstated, calling him \"one of the greatest players in the history of the game\" and noting his contribution to the franchise's first World Series title in 1980.",
      "Jackson, a .356 career hitter, died in 1951. He remains one of baseball's most recognizable names in part for his depiction by Ray Liotta in the 1989 movie Field of Dreams.",
      "Under a rule adopted by the Hall's board of directors in 1991, anyone on the permanently ineligible list can't be considered for election to the Hall. Jackson was twice considered on ballots by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, but received just 0.9% in 1936 and 1% of a nominating vote in 1940.",
      "Rose's reinstatement occurred too late for him to be considered for the BBWAA ballot. If not on the permanently banned list, Rose would have been eligible on the ballots each from 1992 through 2006. He was written in on 41 votes in 1992 and on 243 of 7,232 ballots (3.4%) over the 15 years, votes that were not counted.",
      "Hall of Fame Chairman of the Board Jane Forbes Clark said in a statement that players affected by Manfred's ruling Tuesday would be considered.",
      "\"The National Baseball Hall of Fame has always maintained that anyone removed from Baseball's permanently ineligible list will become eligible for Hall of Fame consideration,\" she said. \"Major League Baseball's decision to remove deceased individuals from the permanently ineligible list will allow for the Hall of Fame candidacy of such individuals to now be considered.\"",
      "Without the ban, both players are eligible for the Hall's Classic Baseball Era, which next meets to consider players in December 2027 and considers those whose greatest contributions to the sport were before 1980.",
      "A 10-person historical overview committee selects the eight ballot candidates with the approval of the Hall's board and the ballot is considered by 16 members at the winter meetings, with a 75% or higher vote needed. The committee members include Hall of Fame members, team executives and media/historians.",
      "While many argue Rose should be in the Hall based on his career numbers, voters tasked with selecting players for the Hall are also told to consider a player's \"integrity, sportsmanship, character and contribution to the game.\" This clause, Rose and Jackson's critics argue, should keep them out of the Hall of Fame.",
      "In addition to his gambling, Rose faced other off-the-field issues.",
      "Court documents that came to light as the result of a defamation lawsuit revealed Rose was alleged to have committed statutory rape in the 1970s. According to court documents, Rose acknowledged having sex with a person he claimed he believed was 16 years old \u2014then the age of consent in Ohio \u2014 at the time. However, court documents allege she was younger. Rose was married and had two children at the time.",
      "The defamation suit was filed by Rose against John Dowd, the investigator whose report about Rose's gambling got him banned from MLB. Dowd, during a radio appearance in 2015, also claimed that one of Rose's associates \"ran young girls\" to the player during spring training. Dowd repeatedly referred to Rose's interactions with those girls as \"statutory rape.\" Rose denied the claims.",
      "Rose also entered guilty pleas on April 20, 1990, to two counts of filing false tax returns, admitting he failed to report $354,968 during a four-year period. Rose was sentenced on July 19, 1990, by U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel in Cincinnati to five months in prison. He also was fined $50,000 and ordered to perform 1,000 hours of community service as a gym teacher's assistant with inner-city youths in Cincinnati as part of a one-year probation period. The first three months of the probation were to be spent at the halfway house. Rose repaid the Internal Revenue Service $366,042.",

    "story": [
      "Robert Benton, the Oscar-winning filmmaker who helped reset the rules in Hollywood as the co-creator of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" and later received mainstream validation as the writer-director of \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and \"Places in the Heart,\" has died at age 92.",
      "Benton's son, John Benton, said that he died Sunday at his home in Manhattan of \"natural causes.\"",
      "During a 40-year screen career, the Texas native received six Oscar nominations and won three times: for writing and directing \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and for writing \"Places in the Heart.\" He was widely appreciated by actors as attentive and trusting, and directed Oscar-winning performances by Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and Sally Field. Although severe dyslexia left him unable to read more than a few pages at a time as a child, he wrote and directed film adaptations of novels by Philip Roth, E.L. Doctorow and Richard Russo, among others.",
      "Benton was an art director for Esquire magazine in the early 1960s when a love for French New Wave movies and old gangster stories \u2014 and news that a friend got $25,000 for a Doris Day screenplay \u2014 inspired him and Esquire editor David Newman to draft a treatment about the lives of Depression-era robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, imagining them as prototypes for 1960s rebels.",
      "Their project took years to complete as Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard were among the directors who turned them down before Warren Beatty agreed to produce and star in the movie. \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" directed by Arthur Penn and starring Beatty and Faye Dunaway, overcame initial critical resistance in 1967 to the film's shocking violence and became one of the touchstones of 1960s culture and the start of a more open and creative era in Hollywood.",
      "The original story by Benton and Newman was even more daring: they had made Clyde Barrow bisexual and involved in a 3-way relationship with Bonnie and their male getaway driver. Beatty and Penn both resisted, and Barrow instead was portrayed as impotent, with an uncredited Robert Towne making numerous other changes to the script. \"I honestly don't know who the 'auteur' of 'Bonnie and Clyde' was,\" Benton later told Mark Harris, author of \"Pictures at a Revolution,\" a book about \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and four other movies from 1967.",
      "Over the following decade, none of Benton's films approached the impact of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" although he continued to have critical and commercial success. His writing credits included \"Superman\" and \"What's Up, Doc?\" He directed and co-wrote such well-reviewed works as \"Bad Company,\" a revisionist Western featuring Jeff Bridges, and \"The Late Show,\" a melancholy comedy for which his screenplay received an Oscar nomination.",
      "His career soared in 1979 with his adaptation of the Avery Corman novel \"Kramer vs. Kramer,\" about a self-absorbed advertising executive who becomes a loving parent to his young son after his wife walks out, only to have her return and ask for custody. Starring Hoffman and Streep, the movie was praised as a perceptive, emotional portrait of changing family roles and expectations and received five Academy Awards, including best picture. Hoffman, disenchanted at the time with the film business, would cite \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and Benson's direction for reviving his love for movie acting.",
      "Five years later, Benton was back in the Oscars race with a more personal film, \"Places in the Heart,\" in which he drew upon family stories and childhood memories for his 1930s-set drama starring Fields as a mother of two in Texas who fights to hold on to her land after her husband is killed.",
      "\"I think that when I saw it all strung together, I was surprised at what a romantic view I had of the past,\" Benton told The Associated Press in 1984, adding that the movie was in part a tribute to his mother, who had died shortly before the release of \"Kramer vs. Kramer.\"",
      "Benton was born in Waxahachie, Texas, outside of Dallas. He owed his early love for movies to his father, telephone company employee Ellery Douglass Benton, who, instead of asking about homework, would take his family to the picture shows. The elder Benton would also share memories of attending the funerals of outlaws Barrow and Parker, Texas natives who grew up in the Dallas area.",
      "Robert Benton studied at the University of Texas and Columbia University, then served in the U.S. Army from 1954 until 1956. While at Esquire, Benton helped start the magazine's long-standing Dubious Achievement Award and dated Gloria Steinem, then on staff at the humor magazine Help! He married artist Sallie Rendigs in 1964. They had one son.",
      "Between hits, Benton often endured long dry spells. His latter films included such disappointments as the thrillers \"Billy Bathgate,\" \"The Human Stain\" and \"Twilight.\" He had much more success with \"Nobody's Fool,\" a wry comedy released in 1994 and starring Paul Newman, in his last Oscar-nominated performance, as a small-town troublemaker in upstate New York. Benton, whose film was based on Russo's novel, was nominated for best adapted screenplay.",
      "\"Somebody asked me once when the Academy Award nominations came out and I'd been nominated, 'What's the great thing about the Academy Awards?'\" Benton told Venice magazine in 1998. \"I said, 'When you go to the awards and you see people, some of whom you've had bitter fights with, some of whom you're close friends with, some people you haven't seen in ten years, some people you just saw two days before \u2014 it's your family.' It's home. And home is what I've spent my life looking for.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump delivered remarks Tuesday at a U.S.-Saudi investment summit, as he marks his first international trip of his second term.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump delivered remarks Tuesday at a U.S.-Saudi investment summit as the White House announced a $600 billion investment from Saudi Arabia, including what it touted as the \"largest defense sales agreement in history.\"",
      "In Saudi Arabia, the president held up the country as an example for the Middle East, saying it's achieved a \"modern miracle the Arabian way,\" bashing efforts of \"western intervention\" and blasting former President Joe Biden.",
      "Mr. Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, announced multiple economic and defense agreements, an indication of Mr. Trump's intent to deepen U.S.-Saudi ties, despite long-held concerns from State Department reports and human rights groups about its restriction of civil liberties, political rights and women's rights. The Saudis hosted a dinner in the city of Dir'iyah in honor of Mr. Trump.",
      "Speaking at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, the president said it's a \"tremendous honor\" to be invited back to Saudi Arabia, where his first foreign trip took place in 2017, and called bin Salman a \"friend.\" U.S. intelligence agencies believed bin Salman ordered the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018, but the U.S. determined that he has immunity due to his role as Saudi prime minister.",
      "\"The U.S.-Saudi relationship has been a bedrock of security and prosperity,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday. \"Today, we reaffirmed this important bond, and we take the next steps to make our relationship closer, stronger and more powerful than ever before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also has personal business ties to Saudi Arabia. Last year, the Trump Organization announced plans for the development of a\u00a0Trump Tower in Jeddah, a major Saudi city along the Red Sea. Eric Trump, the president's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization,\u00a0told Reuters\u00a0that the Trump Organization also has plans for a Trump-branded property in Riyadh.",
      "Mr. Trump said Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital, \"is becoming not just a seat of government, but a major business, cultural and high-tech capital of the entire world.\"",
      "\"It's crucial for the wider world to know this great transformation has not come from western intervention or flying people in beautiful planes giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs, no,\" he said.",
      "\"The gleaming marbles of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called nation builders, neocons or liberal nonprofits like those who spent trillions and trillions of dollars failing to develop Kabul, Baghdad, so many other cities,\" he said. \"Instead, the birth of a modern Middle East has been brought by the people of the region themselves. ... In the end, the so-called nation builders wrecked far more nations than they built, and the interventionalists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves.\"",
      "\"In recent years, far too many American presidents have been afflicted with the notion that it's our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use U.S. policy to dispense justice for their sins,\" the president added.",
      "Specifically, the president and crown prince signed agreements for judicial cooperation between the Ministry of Justice in Saudi Arabia and the U.S. Department of Justice, coordination between the Pentagon and Saudi Ministry of Defense for modernization and development of the capabilities of the Saudi armed forces; and an international partnership program between the Saudi Ministry of Interior and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.",
      "The package of agreements includes \"extensive training and support to build the capacity of the Saudi armed forces, including enhancement of Saudi service academies and military medical services,\" according to the White House. It also includes billions of dollars in investments in U.S. data centers.",
      "Mr. Trump also said on Tuesday that he will move to normalize relations and lift sanctions on the new government in Syria to give the country \"a chance at peace.\"",
      "\"There is a new government that will hopefully succeed,\" Mr. Trump said of Syria. \"I say good luck, Syria. Show us something special.\"",
      "The president arrived in Saudi Arabia earlier Tuesday, the first stop on a four-day trip to the Middle East for Mr. Trump. The trip is his first of his second term. The president also visited Saudi Arabia before any other nation during his first term in the White House \u2014 bucking the tradition for presidents to make their first foreign trip to the United Kingdom, one of the United States' strongest allies.",
      "After Air Force One was escorted into landing by Saudi fighter jets, Mr. Trump was greeted on the tarmac at the airport in Riyadh by the kingdom's de facto ruler, the crown prince. After a coffee ceremony, Trump then went to the Royal Court, where he and bin Salman descended a lavender carpet as trumpets sounded to mark the president's arrival.",
      "Following the arrival ceremony, the president attended a delegation meeting and bilateral meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump complimented the Crown Prince in remarks during their bilateral meeting, calling him \"wise beyond his years.\" The president also said that the Saudi prince is considering a purchase of $600 billion of military equipment but joked that it could be $1 trillion.",
      "The two leaders also participated in a business lunch with notable CEOs including Elon Musk, Larry Fink, and Stephen Schwarzman. Mr. Trump said the business leaders are expected to walk away from the visit \"with a lot of checks.\"",
      "Saudi Arabia is of key diplomatic importance to the Trump White House, especially amid ongoing efforts to negotiate a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, and with the Israel-Hamas war still raging in Gaza. The president and the crown prince held private talks earlier Tuesday which were expected to span a wide range of topics, from Iran's nuclear program to the war in Gaza and keeping oil prices in check.",
      "But the visit also focused on business, as the president has looked to strengthen ties with the Middle East partner. And Joining Mr. Trump at the investment summit were expected to be some high-profile business leaders, including Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Palantir's Alex Karp, Citigroup's Jane Fraser, BlackRock's Larry Fink, Franklin Templeton Investments's Jenny Johnson, Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi, BDT & MSD Partners' Dina Powell McCormick and Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman, according to multiple sources familiar with the event.",
      "Later this week, Mr. Trump will travel to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Qatar has offered to donate a jumbo jet donated by the royal family of Qatar for Mr. Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane.",
      "Mr. Trump has defended accepting the gift of the plane, saying Monday \"I could be a stupid person and say, oh no, we don't want a free plane.\"",
      "Later Tuesday, at 2:51 a.m. the next day in Saudi Arabia, the president again posted on Truth Social about the Boeing 747 from Qatar.",
      "\"It is a gift from a Nation, Qatar, that we have successfully defended for many years. It will be used by our Government as a temporary Air Force One, until such time as our new Boeings, which are very late on delivery, arrive,\" he wrote.",

    "summary": "Letters reversing the layoffs arrived a day before House and Senate hearings with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. where he was expected to face questions about the layoffs.",
    "story": [
      "The head of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and a handful of teams at the agency had their layoff notices rescinded Tuesday, multiple officials say, and several worker safety programs that had been eliminated by layoffs last month are being restored.",
      "Letters reversing the layoffs arrived in the inboxes of some NIOSH staff a day ahead of House and Senate hearings Wednesday with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. where he was expected to face questions about the layoffs.",
      "Health officials and scientists being brought back to work include everyone in NIOSH's respiratory health division, division of safety research, division of compensation and analysis support and National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy has been working hard to ensure that the critical functions under NIOSH remain intact. The Trump Administration is committed to supporting coal miners and firefighters, and under the Secretary's leadership, NIOSH's essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations,\" HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email.",
      "A handful of NIOSH staff working in the agency's World Trade Center Health Program previously had their layoffs reversed, after a second round of cuts at the agency earlier this month.",
      "\"While we celebrate with those who received a rescission letter from HHS, I am mindful that others did not. I am hopeful that we can continue to make the case for reinstating everyone at NIOSH,\" the agency's now-reinstated director, Dr. John Howard, wrote in the email.",
      "The reinstatements mean that some NIOSH programs might soon be able to resume, after they were previously hobbled by the layoffs.",
      "For example, the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory had been forced to suspend new approvals of equipment like new N95 respirators and protective gear for firefighters after the initial round of cuts on April 1. Investigations of workplace health risks through NIOSH's Health Hazard Evaluation program were also upended by the layoffs, but staff working in those probes have now been reinstated.",
      "But many workers also remain effectively laid-off at the wide-ranging agency, which functions as the research and testing counterpart to the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration.",
      "In NIOSH's Spokane and Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, laid-off scientists and engineers were called back to work, but only for a few more weeks to wind down their laboratories and research before their layoff notices take effect. Those NIOSH employees have not received letters formally rescinding their layoffs, unlike some of their colleagues.",
      "Part of their work includes overseeing miner safety programs like the personal dust monitors, or PDM, required by the Department of Labor for coal miners. NIOSH is responsible for testing PDM's accuracy. The monitors are needed to reduce the risk of black lung disease.",
      "NIOSH had also been in the process of developing similar monitors for miners exposed to silica dust, before the layoffs gutted the teams overseeing that work.",
      "Other NIOSH teams like the Health Effects Laboratory Division were also not listed among the reinstatements.",
      "Other parts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which currently houses NIOSH, also remain off the job, despite calls from states and lawmakers for their reinstatements. HHS previously said it was planning on moving what remained of NIOSH into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "Among the CDC scientists still laid-off include the agency's laboratories for investigating STD and viral hepatitis, which upended work helping states investigate outbreaks. Staff in the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for a range of issues including lead poisoning and cruise ship outbreaks, also have not been reinstated.",
      "Other workers who have been promised by their supervisors that they would be reinstated elsewhere at HHS have also so far not received notices, like at the Food and Drug Administration's drug safety labs in Puerto Rico and Detroit.",
      "While their counterparts at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco were reinstated, multiple scientists in those labs said they had yet to receive formal written notices revoking their layoffs, weeks after they were told they would be reinstated.",

    "summary": "A federal grand jury has indicted a Wisconsin judge accused of helping a man evade immigration authorities.",
    "story": [
      "A federal grand jury on Tuesday indicted a Wisconsin judge accused of helping a man evade immigration authorities, allowing the case against her to continue.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's office in the Eastern District of Wisconsin confirmed the indictment to CBS News.",
      "The arrest of Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan escalated a clash between President Trump's administration and local authorities over the Republican's sweeping immigration crackdown. Democrats have accused the Trump administration of trying to make a national example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition to the crackdown.",
      "Prosecutors charged Dugan in April via a complaint with concealing an individual to prevent arrest and obstruction. In the federal criminal justice system, prosecutors can initiate charges against a defendant directly by filing a complaint or present evidence to a grand jury and let that body decide whether to issue charges.",
      "A grand jury still reviews charges brought by complaint to determine whether enough probable cause exists to continue the case as a check on prosecutors' power. If the grand jury determines there's probable cause, it issues a written statement of the charges known as an indictment. That's what happened in Dugan's case.",
      "Her case is similar to one brought during the first Trump administration against a Massachusetts judge, who was accused of helping a man sneak out a courthouse back door to evade a waiting immigration enforcement agent. That case was eventually dismissed.",
      "Prosecutors say Dugan escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back jury door on April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were in the courthouse seeking his arrest.",
      "According to court documents, Flores-Ruiz illegally reentered the U.S. after being deported in 2013. Online state court records show he was charged with three counts of misdemeanor domestic abuse in Milwaukee County in March. He was in Dugan's courtroom that morning of April 18 for a hearing.",
      "Court documents suggest Dugan was alerted to the agents' presence by her clerk, who was informed by an attorney that the agents appeared to be in the hallway. An affidavit says Dugan was visibly angry over the agents' arrival and called the situation \"absurd\" before leaving the bench and retreating to her chambers. She and another judge later approached members of the arrest team in the courthouse with what witnesses described as a \"confrontational, angry demeanor.\"",
      "After a back-and-forth with the agents over the warrant for Flores-Ruiz, Dugan demanded they speak with the chief judge and led them away from the courtroom, according to the affidavit.",
      "She then returned to the courtroom and was heard saying words to the effect of \"wait, come with me\" and ushered Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out through a back jury door typically used only by deputies, jurors, court staff and in-custody defendants, according to the affidavit. Flores-Ruiz was free on a signature bond in the abuse case at the time, according to online state court records.",
      "Federal agents ultimately captured him outside the courthouse after a foot chase.",
      "The state Supreme Court suspended Dugan from the bench in late April, saying the move was necessary to preserve public confidence in the judiciary. A reserve judge is filling in for her.",
      "Dugan has served as a judge in Milwaukee County Circuit Court since 2016, when she was elected with\u00a0about 65% of the vote. She was later reelected in 2022 after running unopposed.",
      "Dugan worked as a civil law attorney before joining the bench, according to her\u00a0LinkedIn page. Before that, Dugan\u00a0served as executive director\u00a0of Catholic Charities of Southeastern Wisconsin for three years, and worked as an attorney at the Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee and Legal Action of Wisconsin \u2014 two nonprofits that provide free civil legal representation.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 18:48:56 -0400",
    "summary": "The CPI report was cooler than expected, although inflation is still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in April\u00a0rose\u00a02.3% on an annual basis, rising less than economists had expected yet still reflecting price hikes that remain above the Federal Reserve's goal of bringing down inflation to a 2% rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.4% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "April's reading reflects the lowest level since February 2021, government data shows.",
      "On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%, lighter than the 0.3% pace forecast by economists.",
      "Housing costs were a major driver of inflation last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. And energy costs also ticked higher, despite lower gasoline prices, due to increases in natural gas and electricity costs.",
      "Grocery prices dropped slightly last month, declining 0.1% from March. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs dropped 12.7% to $5.12 in April, marking the first month-to-month decline in egg prices since October 2024.",
      "Still, egg prices remain near historic highs as a persistent outbreak of bird flu continues to wipe out flocks of egg-laying hens. The April figure is 79% higher than the same month a year earlier, when the price averaged $2.86 per dozen.",
      "What experts say",
      "Economists are looking for early signs that Mr. Trump's tariffs are trickling through to American households. Because tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. companies, which largely pass on the added costs to shoppers, they are at some point expected to boost consumer prices.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach on Mr. Trump's tariffs, which he said could boost inflation and blunt economic growth. But so far, the tariff impact hasn't shown up in economic data, which typically is backward-looking because it reflects activity from the previous month.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced tariffs, such as his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" levies, and then backed off from them. On April 9, he hit the pause button with a 90-day delay, scaling back the tariffs to a 10% rate.",
      "And on Monday, the Trump administration and China agreed to a temporary but significant easing of tariffs imposed over the last couple months, scaling back the import duties on Chinese-made goods from 145% to 30%.",
      "Meanwhile, some consumers and businesses rushed to order goods ahead of the tariffs' imposition, aiming to skirt the new import duties by front-loading their purchases. Because of this, the impact of the tariffs might not show up in economic data for another few months, economists say.",
      "\"[I]n reality, the data for April is likely to be largely unaffected by President Trump's announcements on Liberation Day,\" said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, in an email. \"This is because exemptions were granted for goods that had left exporting countries before 2 April, and because consumers and businesses rushed to front-run tariffs in February and March.\"",
      "He added, \"As such, both the Fed and global investors will still need to be a bit more patient before they can properly assess the impact of the trade uncertainty on consumer prices.\"",
      "What does the CPI report mean for your money",
      "Because of the tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S., inflation may not rise as much as earlier anticipated, noted EY's Daco, who said he's lowered his year-end CPI forecast by 0.4 percentage points to 3.2%.",
      "With inflation still expected to pick up later this year, albeit at a lower pace than earlier forecast, the Fed may decide to cut rates twice in 2025, rather than the three cuts Daco had earlier expected. He added that he believes the first rate cut will occur in September, rather than July.",
      "April's cooler-than-expected data may also give the Fed more breathing room to hold off\u00a0on cutting rates as it assesses the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies, said Carl Weinberg, chief economist with High Frequency Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"The Fed can stand still on rate hikes and cuts based on this data while it patiently waits to see the impact of erratic policy changes on prices in the months ahead, at least for now,\" Weinberg said.",
      "The result for consumers and businesses could be a longer wait for relief on borrowing costs, as the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate helps determine what banks, credit card companies and other lenders charge borrowers.",

      "United Airlines is adding some extra bells and whistles to its new Boeing fleet.",
      "The Chicago-based company announced that its Boeing 787-9 planes will offer a larger selection of premium seats as well as new suites, dubbed \"United Polaris Studio.\"",
      "Positioned at the front of the business class section, the Polaris Studio suites will include a host of luxury amenities for travelers who are willing to dish out more money for the premium experience. Among the offerings are skincare kits, flatbed seating with ottomans, champagne service, and exclusive dining options including \"curated food and drinks,\" according to the United website.",
      "Also included are wireless charging, Bluetooth connectivity and 27-inch screens. United Polaris Studio seats will also be 25% larger than standard United Polaris seats and come with privacy doors, the airline said.",
      "\"We're planning to fly this aircraft to Singapore, but there's 140 of these aircraft on order that are all going to come with this amazing suite on board,\" United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella told CBS News.",
      "United hasn't disclosed the cost of the enhanced seating.",
      "\"We've created a everything around it to make sure that we can deliver it reliably and we can deliver it for a price that I think consumers will be excited to pay,\" Nocella said.",
      "United posted its best quarterly\u00a0performance in five years earlier this year, raking in $13.2 billion in\u00a0first-quarter revenue.",
      "Standard United Polaris seats \u2014 the tier below the new studio suites \u2014 will also see some upgrades, including 19-inch screens and sliding doors.",
      "The Boeing 787-9 aircraft will have 99 premium seats total, the most of any in United's fleet and the highest percentage among U.S. carriers, according to the airline. That number includes seating in eight United Polaris Studio and 56 United Polaris business class suites.",
      "Despite the focus on offering a more luxurious travel experience, United also wants to enhance flights for passengers with more modest budgets.",
      "\"[W]e also know we need to pay attention to the rear of the aircraft, because the bulk of the passengers are flying in the main cabin, not in the Polaris cabin,\" Nocella said. \"And we've made efforts to make sure that that experience is going to get better, not worse.\"",
      "This nose-to-tail transformation comes as the luxury travel sector continues to expand. Demand for luxury tourism and hospitality is expected to grow faster than any other travel segment, according to a 2024 McKinsey & Company report.",
      "The first international flights planned for the new Boeing aircraft will take off from San Francisco and travel to Singapore and London in 2026.",
      "The airline industry has been under increased scrutiny in recent months after an\u00a0American Airlines flight collided\u00a0with an Army helicopter over the Potomac River in February, killing everyone aboard both planes.",
      "Newark Airport, which has\u00a0hundreds\u00a0of departures each day, has also made headlines in recent weeks after multiple\u00a0air traffic control outages disrupted travel. United Airlines limited flights\u00a0to and from the New Jersey airport amid the problems.",

      "On April 23, the digital currency got a boost when it announced that its top 220 holders as of May 12 would be invited to a dinner with the president. That helped raise the value of the meme coin by more than 40% from the announcement through May 12, partially reversing an 88% slump in the weeks prior.",
      "The top holders of the $TRUMP meme coin spent anywhere from as little as $53,500 to as much as $16.4 million to grab one of the dinner invites with Mr. Trump, Inca Digital's analysis found.",
      "As of the contest's end on May 12, the biggest holder of the digital currency was an account named Sun VIP, according to the analysis. While it's impossible to know the identity of any of the account owners due to the anonymity of digital wallets, many of the purchases were made through exchanges that don't accept U.S. customers, such as Bybit and Gate.io, Inca's research reveals.",
      "\"A ton of these users sent funds to international exchanges,\" noted Austin Ryan, director of marketing for Inca Digital, a firm that analyzes crypto data for risk issues like liquidity and front-running. \"The thought is that if they are interacting with those exchanges, they are not in the U.S.\"",
      "The dinner contest has raised concerns from government watchdogs and Democratic lawmakers about purchases of a Trump-branded asset being linked to access to the president. Also, because the $TRUMP coin is partly owned by an affiliate of the Trump Organization, the president's real estate organization, he and his family stand to benefit financially from purchases of the meme coin, critics add.",
      "The @TRUMP meme coin site hasn't disclosed the identities of the 220 top holders, who under the promotion are in line to dine with Mr. Trump. Tony Carrk, the executive director of watchdog group Accountable.US, expressed concern because those holders are \"shrouded by their anonymous crypto usernames.\"",
      "Neither the White House nor the Trump Organization immediately responded to requests for comment.",
      "The dinner will take place on May 22 at the Trump National Golf Club in Washington, D.C., according to the $TRUMP meme coin website. The top 25 holders will \"will enjoy a Private VIP Reception with President TRUMP\" as well as a \"Special VIP TOUR,\" the site adds.",
      "Eric Trump, one of Mr. Trump's sons, in January called the $TRUMP coin \"the hottest digital meme on earth.\"",
      "How Trump makes money from his meme coin",
      "Decentralization is foundational to cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, the world's most popular crypto, was born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as a digital currency meant to be uncontrolled by banks or governments.",
      "$TRUMP meme coins can be traded on a decentralized exchange, which is essentially a place where traders can swap goods without a middleman.",
      "Instead of matching buyers and sellers one by one, decentralized exchanges use something called a liquidity pool to ensure trades can happen easily and instantly. Liquidity pools are essentially an automated pot of funds that pair meme coins like $TRUMP with more popular types of crypto that can be easily traded.",
      "When the $TRUMP meme coin was first launched, its creators initially released 20% of the planned 1 billion total coins. Half of that 20% was put up for public sale while the other half was put into a liquidity pool. CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump Organization, and another company called Fight Fight Fight, receive \"trading revenue derived from trading activities\" of the Trump meme coins, according to its website.",

    "story": [
      "The gap between what Americans earn and how much they need to bring in to achieve a basic standard of living is growing, according to a new report.",
      "The analysis, from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP), looks beyond whether people can afford daily necessities like food and shelter to consider whether they have the means to pay for things like the technology tools necessary for work, higher education, and health and child care costs.",
      "In tracking costs associated with what the group calls a \"basket of American dream essentials,\" LISEP says its Minimal Quality of Life index provides a truer picture of how Americans are faring than standard economic data, such as the nation's gross domestic product and jobless rate.",
      "The findings? For the bottom 60% of U.S. households, a \"minimal quality of life\" is out of reach, according to the group, a research organization focused on improving lower earners' economic well-being.",
      "\"The middle class has been declining \u2014 we just haven't recognized it fully,\" LISEP Chairman Gene Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's really dangerous because it's the kind of thing that leads to social unrest, and it's not fair. The American dream is not that it's given to you \u2014 it's that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead and achieve the things in life that you want to achieve. It's not living in a tent, not having to steal.\"",
      "Peering beneath the surface",
      "By those standards, the lowest-earning Americans around the U.S. are falling well short, according to LISEP.\u00a0 These households, which in 2023 earned an average of $38,000 per year, would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index, which also includes professional clothing and basic leisure activities.",
      "\"Traditional headline economic indicators like GDP and unemployment tell us the economy is thriving, but they don't reflect the lived reality of most Americans,\" Ludwig said in a statement. \"Americans are working harder than ever, fueling our economic growth, but the benefits of that hard work are not being distributed in a way that supports upward mobility for too many middle- and low-income Americans.\"",
      "From 2021 to 2023, the cost of affording what amounts to a basic level of economic security doubled, according to LISEP's analysis. Housing and health care costs surged, while the amount of savings required to attend an in-state, public university soared 122%.",
      "Meanwhile, median earnings for the bottom 60% of income earners fell 4% over that span when adjusting for the cost of goods tracked by the group's index, according to LISEP. Income growth for these households has also lagged, rising 0.37% per year during the same period \u2014 less than half as much as for the top 40% of earners, the group found.",
      "The gap between how much low-income families earn and how much they need to afford a minimum cost of living is expected to keep widening, Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Unfortunately, it is growing because the items that go into the basket of goods and services that make the minimal quality of life are inflating at a higher rate than wages are inflating,\" he said.",

      "Both lawsuits say that the Trump administration is violating the U.S. Constitution by trying to dictate federal spending when Congress has that power \u2014 not the executive branch.",

      "New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin criticized the timing of Duffy's letter when Newark's airport struggles with radar outages and other issues.",
      "\"I wish the administration would stop playing politics with people's lives,\" Platkin said. \"I wish Secretary Duffy would do his damn job, which is to make sure planes land on time, not to direct immigration enforcement.\"",

      "\"This critical funding has nothing to do with immigration, and the administration's attempts to hold it hostage unless states agree to do the federal government's job of civil immigration enforcement is unconstitutional and outrageous,\" Raoul said. \"I am proud of the continued collaboration between state attorneys general and am committed to using all tools at our disposal to fight the Trump administration's ongoing attempts to play politics with Americans' lives.\"",
      "Meanwhile, on Feb. 24, states received letters from the Department of Homeland Security declaring that states that \"refuse to cooperate with, refuse to share information with, or even actively obstruct federal immigration enforcement reject these ideals and the history we share in common as Americans.\"",
      "\"If any government entity chooses to thumb its nose at the Department of Homeland Security's national security and public safety mission, it should not receive a single dollar of the Department's money unless Congress has specifically required it,\" Noem wrote in her letter.",
      "Attorneys general behind the lawsuits include the following states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont.",
      "\"Law enforcement agents across Minnesota work hard to protect and serve their communities, and we are truly grateful for all they do. Decisions about how police resources should be allocated to maintain public safety are made at the local level because every community has different safety needs,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said. \"It is both wrong and unlawful for the Trump Administration to demand Minnesota law enforcement step away from their patrols, investigations, and community-engagement work to instead enforce federal immigration law.\"",
      "\"These funds are meant to repair aging roads and bridges, strengthen public safety, and ensure law enforcement has the tools they need to act quickly in emergency situations. By clawing back this already-allocated funding, Donald Trump's White House is prioritizing political posturing over the safety and well-being of Americans,\" added Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.",
      "The cases are being spearheaded by California but were filed in federal court in Rhode Island, a detail that the attorneys general defended by saying they filed an \"any court that is going to be fair and objective and consider our factual presentation and legal analysis.\"",
      "The lawsuits are the latest legal actions that Democratic-led states have taken against Trump since he took office earlier this year. Bonta noted that California has filed more than 20 lawsuits against the administration, while Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said his state has launched more than a dozen.",
      "While the lawsuits have challenged policies on tariffs, federal employee firings to health care research, Trump's focus on immigration enforcement and the mass deportation of immigrants in the United States illegally have received the most attention.",

      "Ximena Arias Cristobal, who is in the country without authorization, was taken into ICE custody earlier this month after a May 5 traffic stop in Dalton, where she lives with her family. Local police cited her for making an improper turn and driving without a license before booking her into the Whitfield County Jail in Dalton, where she was picked up by ICE officers.",
      "But the Dalton Police Department and the city's prosecutor announced on Monday they had reviewed dashboard camera footage of the traffic stop and determined that the officer had stopped the wrong vehicle. Officials said the vehicle that made the improper turn was similar to the truck Arias Cristobal was driving.",

      "Federal officials have not disputed that Arias Cristobal and her father lack criminal records.",
      "\"[The] family will be able to return to Mexico together,\" McLaughlin said in her statement. \"Mr. Tovar had ample opportunity to seek a legal pathway to citizenship. He chose not to. We are not ignoring the rule of law.\"",
      "According to her family, Arias Cristobal came to the U.S. in 2010 and graduated from Dalton's high school last year. She did not qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program for other undocumented immigrant \"Dreamers\" who came to the U.S. as minors because she arrived after the policy's June 2007 cutoff date.",
      "During a press conference on Monday, Chris Crosser, the assistant Dalton police chief, expressed regret about his agency's mistake. But he said he could not opine on how ICE should treat Arias Cristobal's case going forward, given the new information. He said local officials notified her lawyers of the dismissed charges but did not alert ICE.",
      "\"It's a very regrettable place that we are right here, that we've ended up in this place with the way this unfolded and the way it turned out,\" Crosser said, adding that an internal review of the incident is ongoing.",
      "Arias Cristobal's lawyers said their client is likely to remain in ICE custody for now, even after the dismissal of the charges, since federal officials are holding her because she's in the U.S. without legal permission. They said she has a bond hearing scheduled for next week.",

The music mogul could receive a lifetime prison sentence if convicted on all of them.",
      "Ventura's testimony will likely last the rest of the week. Here are some key takeaways from it so far.",
      "Violence occurred \"frequently\"",
      "In her initial statements before the court, Ventura, now pregnant with her third child and married to personal trainer Alex Fine, recalled her and Combs' early interactions and how she started to see a different side of him over time. She said she met Combs when she was a newly signed singer at 19, and their burgeoning friendship became romantic two years later.",
      "She also described his alleged violence throughout their 10-year on-off relationship, recounting instances where he knocked her over, kicked and dragged her, and stomped on her head, causing black eyes and bruises on her body. When asked, Ventura said the abuse she endured happened \"frequently.\"",
      "Combs is seen attacking Ventura in video footage CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0last year, which shows him throwing her to the floor, kicking and dragging her in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel.",
      "\"Control was everything\"",

      "\"Control was everything \u2014 from the way that I looked, to what I was working on that day, who I was speaking to,\" she said. \"Control was an all-around thing to a certain point.\"",
      "Combs allegedly introduced Ventura to \"freak offs,\" drug-fueled events where he is accused of forcing women to perform sex acts with hired sex workers, which were a focus of the indictment outlining his alleged crimes.",
      "Ventura said Combs broached the idea of sexual encounters involving voyeurism during the first year of their relationship, and he would hire an escort or dancer with whom he would watch her engage while he directed them. The singer testified she felt confused and nervous, \"but I also loved him very much and wanted to make him happy.\"",
      "She testified she worried about making Combs angry because of how much control he had over her life and career, and the possibility that he could blackmail her by releasing images of the \"freak offs.\" Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Combs often recorded these performances with or without participants' consent.",
      "A shift in the relationship",
      "Ventura recalled Combs looking out for her when she first met him. They fell in love, she said, while spending time together in the studio or traveling elsewhere.",

But as her appearance, transportation, rent and overall lifestyle came under Combs' control, Ventura said her music career \u2014 and record deal \u2014 eventually took a backseat to the alleged \"freak offs,\" which left her feeling humiliated.",
      "She testified that despite recording hundreds of songs and nine albums while she was with Combs, the work was never released because \"freak offs\" became her job. They took up too much time and energy to leave room for other pursuits, Ventura said, adding that she would stay up for several days at a time to party, drink and have sex with strangers.",
      "The \"freak offs\" could last from 36 to 72 hours at a time, she said, with the longest continuing for four days. She recalled them happening almost weekly for years.",
      "Ventura felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by \"freak offs\"",
      "Ventura began to cry during her testimony when asked whether she wanted to participate in every \"freak off.\" She said she didn't and that she felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by them, but she also didn't want to disappoint Combs.",
      "Ventura told the court Combs dismissed her when she expressed how she felt about them, calling her predictable for not wanting to engage.",
      "Testifying at length about the \"freak offs,\" Ventura said Combs provided ecstasy and cocaine, which she took in order to stay awake during them.",

      "Fresh & Ready Foods is voluntarily recalling numerous products, after at least 10 people in the U.S. have been sickened in a listeria\u00a0outbreak\u00a0linked to its ready-to-eat food products, federal officials said.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Saturday that federal, state and local officials are investigating the outbreak linked to foods produced by the San Fernando, California-based food producer.",
      "The FDA says the 10 people who fell ill were in California and Nevada, and required hospitalization.",
      "This voluntary recall is being initiated due to possible contamination with listeria monocytogenes, an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems, according to the FDA.",
      "Healthy individuals may experience short-term symptoms including high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, the recall notice states. Pregnant women infected by the organism can experience miscarriages and stillbirths.",
      "Affected products",
      "The voluntary recall is limited to products with \"Use By\" dates from 4/22/2025 to 05/19/2025.

      "You can see the full list of products, including size, item numbers, packaging and used-by dates here.",
      "Listeria symptoms usually start within two weeks of eating contaminated food. Mild cases can include muscle aches, tiredness and vomiting and diarrhea, while more severe symptoms may include stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions.",
      "Federal officials said they started investigating the recent outbreak last year but didn't have enough evidence to identify a source of the infections. They said the investigation was reopened in April when FDA investigators found listeria in samples collected from Fresh & Ready Foods that matched the strain from the outbreak.",
      "Fresh & Ready Foods said in a news release that it took immediate corrective actions including removing equipment to address the issue.",
      "The FDA found that six of the 10 people who got sick had been hospitalized before becoming ill with listeria. The FDA found that items made by Fresh & Ready Foods had been served in at least three of the health care facilities where the patients had been previously treated.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the test samples from sick patients were collected from December 2023 to September 2024.",
      "Fresh & Ready voluntarily recalled several products, which can be identified by \"use by\" dates ranging from April 22 to May 19 of this year under the brand names Fresh & Ready Foods, City Point Market Fresh Food to Go and Fresh Take Crave Away.",

Mr. Trump will be the first U.S. president to meet with a Syrian leader since Bill Clinton met with Assad's father Hafez al-Assad.",
      "A former insurgent, Sharaa ascended to power last year as Bashar al-Assad's government rapidly crumbled in the span of several days \u2014 bringing an abrupt end to a more than decadelong civil war that devastated Syria. Sharaa previously led Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamist rebel group that fought the Assad regime and has its roots in the al-Qaeda-allied Nusra Front. Sharaa also participated in the insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq in the 2000s.",

The Trump administration has been left to decide whether to normalize relations with a government in Syria that could hold back Iranian influence \u2014 even if its leader has his roots in extremist movements.",
      "The sudden detente between the U.S. and Syria, which have not had normal diplomatic relations in over a decade, was backed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Mr. Trump said. Saudi Arabia has begun building a relationship with Sharaa's government, a move that could be aimed at limiting the influence of Saudi Arabia's archrival Iran, which aided Assad in his fight against Sharaa and other rebels for years.",

      "\"I am very inclined to support sanctions relief for Syria under the right conditions,\" Graham said in a statement. \"However, we must remember that the current leadership in Syria achieved its position through force of arms, not through the will of its people. I know the Trump administration has provided guidance to Syrian officials about conditions that need to be met before any sanctions can be relieved.\"",
      "Graham said he is \"certain that Congress would need to be informed of changes in conditions placed on Syria and how they have met those conditions before Congress can make an informed decision on whether or not it should approve the change in designation.\" He also said Israeli officials are \"extremely concerned\" about the \"state of play in Syria.\"",

    "summary": "Kim Kardashian took the witness stand at the Paris trial of 10 people who stand accused over a 2016 robbery in the French capital during which she was held at gunpoint.",
    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 Kim Kardashian\u00a0took the witness stand for four-and-a-half hours Tuesday in the trial over the 2016 armed robbery in which a masked gang made off with $10 million worth of her jewelry as she visited the French capital. Kardashian testified that one member of the gang pulled her to him while she was in just a bathrobe.",
      "\"I was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,\" Kardashian said. \"I absolutely did think I was going to die,\" she added.",
      "\"I thought about my sister, thought she would walk in and see me shot dead and have that memory in her forever,\" she told the court, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Kardashian testified the robbery happened at around 3 a.m. at her hotel. She was in bed about to fall asleep when she heard people stomping up the stairs and then entering her bedroom wearing police uniforms.",
      "Kardashian said that once they got inside her suite, the masked thieves pointed a gun at her.",
      "\"Then I heard one of the gentlemen forcefully say, 'Ring! Ring!' in English, with an accent, pointing,\" she told the court, according to Reuters, apparently referring to the $4 million diamond ring given to her by her then-husband Kanye West, now known as Ye. The couple\u00a0settled for divorce\u00a0in 2022.",
      "\"It was at the end of the bed, so he grabs my leg and pulls me toward him on the bed so the robe is opened and everything is exposed,\" Kardashian said. \"And that was the moment when I thought he would rape me. But he ended up tying me up and closed my legs.\"",
      "During Tuesday's testimony, Kardashian also responded directly to one of the defendants after she was read an apology letter in court.",
      "\"I forgive you,\" Kardashian told Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the man alleged to be the brains behind the robbery, after his lawyer read a letter to the court sent by his client to the celebrity a year after the robbery, in which he said he was sorry.",
      "At the central Paris courthouse where the trial is taking place, there was intense security and crowd control measures in place. The court opened early to allow journalists and members of the public access ahead of Kardashian's afternoon appearance.",
      "Flanked by four bodyguards, Kardashian entered the courthouse by the rear entrance. As she mounted the stone steps, she turned, took off her dark sunglasses and smiled at the gathered crowd of fans, curious passersby and press photographers.",
      "Dressed in black, with her hair up in a chignon, the celebrity was accompanied by her mother, Kris Jenner.",
      "The hearing was not broadcast publicly, as France rarely allows cameras in courtrooms. Some 400 reporters applied to attend the trial, but there were only 40 places allocated for media inside the courtroom. A side room was set up for 200 more journalists to watch a live transmission from inside the courtroom.",
      "After giving evidence all afternoon, Kardashian left the courthouse with her mother and bodyguards, without speaking to the crowds of fans and press waiting for her.",
      "Kardashian's lawyers said she was determined to testify in person about the night she was allegedly tied up and robbed at gunpoint while she was in Paris for Fashion Week. Ten people \u2014 nine men and a woman \u2014 face charges including robbery and kidnapping against the American media personality and the concierge of the residence where she was staying on the night of Oct. 2, 2016.",
      "Before the celebrity took the stand herself, her longtime friend-turned-stylist Simone Harouche told the court on Tuesday that she heard Kardashian begging for her life during the attack in the hotel suite they were sharing.",
      "\"'I have babies and I need to live!' That is what she kept on saying, 'Take everything. I need to live,'\" Harouche told the court. \"I was scared that she was raped or violated. I thought the worst.\"",
      "Prosecutors have told the court that when the gang, dressed as police officers, arrived at the luxury suites hotel known only as \"The No Address\" where Kardashian was staying, they demanded that the concierge, at gunpoint, guide them to \"the rapper's wife,\" a reference to her then-husband.",
      "In interviews and on her family's reality TV show, Kardashian has described being terrified during the intrusion, thinking she was going to be raped and killed.",
      "\"They dragged me out to the hallway on top of the stairs, that's when I saw the gun, like clear as day,\" she said on her show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" adding: \"It makes me so upset thinking about it.\"",
      "The robbers, some of whom escaped on bicycles, have been dubbed \"the Grandpa robbers\" as most of the suspects were in their 60s at the time of the heist.",
      "As they fled, they dropped a diamond and platinum cross that was found the next morning by a local resident. The rest of the haul has not been recovered.",
      "The DNA of two of the accused was found at the scene, and they have admitted taking part in the robbery. Khedache, now 69, is accused of masterminding the heist. Known as \"Old Omar,\" he reportedly told investigators he had no idea who Kardashian was, but had heard from a waiter friend about the amazing jewelry she wore when she was out dining in Paris.",
      "Khedache wrote to Kardashian in 2017, while he was in custody, to apologize. Her lawyers said he wrote after he heard her speak of how traumatic the experience had been.",
      "\"I want to reach out to you as a human being to tell you how much I regret my actions, how much I was moved and touched to see your tears,\" Khedache wrote. \"Of course, we cannot undo the past but I hope this letter will make you gradually forget the traumatism you experienced through my fault.\"",
      "Kardashian wept as she listened, then said: \"I appreciate the letter. I forgive you for what happened. That said, it doesn't change my trauma nor the fact that my life was changed forever.\"",
      "Khedache responded: \"Your forgiveness is like the sun lighting me up. Thank you.\"",
      "Yunice Abbas, the 71-year-old who has already admitted in court that he was the lookout, told Kardashian: \"I formally, sincerely apologize.\"",
      "In court on April 29, he expressed \"total regret\" for his part in the heist. He said he understood afterward that, \"when you steal a lady's purse, it can be traumatic\" for her.",
      "A police officer who testified for the prosecution told the court Kardashian appeared \"traumatized\" in the immediate aftermath of the robbery.",
      "Lawyers for some of the accused expressed concern as the trial opened last month that Kardashian's fame would distract from the essentials of the case.",
      "Chloe Arnoux, who represents Khedache, told reporters: \"He is, in fact, rather worried about seeing all you, journalists, because he is afraid that his case will not be treated the same way it would be if there were not such a famous person involved in it.\"",
      "Kardashian's lawyer Michael Rhodes said in April that the reality TV star and entrepreneur had \"tremendous appreciation and admiration for the French judicial system,\" and \"wishes for the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion in accordance with French law and with respect for all parties to the case.\"",

      "He is the longest-serving victim of a wrongful conviction in the U.K., attorney Sarah Myatt said outside court. His release came 38 years, seven months and 21 days after his arrest, a total of 14,113 days in custody, the BBC reported. About a year of that time was spent in custody on remand as he awaited trial.",
      "Sullivan, who watched the hearing by video from Wakefield prison in northern England, said in a statement that he was not resentful and was anxious to see his loved ones.",
      "\"As God is my witness, it is said the truth shall take you free,\" Myatt read from the statement. \"It is unfortunate that it does not give a timescale as we advance towards resolving the wrongs done to me. I am not angry, I am not bitter.\"",
      "Sullivan, 68, was convicted in 1987 of killing Diane Sindall in Bebington, near Liverpool in northwest England. He spent 38 years behind bars.",
      "Sindall, 21, a florist who was engaged to be married, was returning home from a part-time job at a pub on a Friday night in August 1986 when her van ran out of gas, police said. She was last seen walking along the road after midnight.",
      "Her body was found about 12 hours later in an alley. She had been sexually assaulted and badly beaten.",
      "Sexual fluid found on Sindall's body could not be scientifically analyzed until recently.",
      "The court heard technology had only very recently been developed to the point where the semen sample, recovered from Sindall's abdomen, could be tested for DNA, the BBC reported. A test in 2024 revealed it wasn't Sullivan, defense attorney Jason Pitter said.",
      "\"The prosecution case is that it was one person. It was one person who carried out a sexual assault on the victim,\" Pitter said. \"The evidence here is now that one person was not the defendant.\"",
      "Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson did not challenge the appeal and said that if the DNA evidence had been available at the time of the investigation it was inconceivable that Sullivan would have been prosecuted.",
      "Merseyside Police said it reopened the investigation as the appeal was underway and was \"committed to doing everything\" to find the killer.",
      "Detective Chief Superintendent Karen Jaundrill said more than 260 men have been screened and eliminated from the renewed investigation since 2023, the BBC reported.",
      "\"We have enlisted specialist skills and expertise from the National Crime Agency, and with their support we are proactively trying to identify the person the DNA profile belongs to, and extensive and painstaking inquiries are underway,\" she said.",
      "The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which examines possible wrongful convictions, had declined to refer Sullivan's case to the appeals court in 2008, and the court turned away his appeal in 2019.",
      "But the CCRC took up the case again when the new DNA evidence was available.",
      "\"In the light of that evidence, it is impossible to regard the appellant's conviction as safe,\" Justice Timothy Holroyde said.",
      "Sullivan's sister, Kim Smith, reflected outside the court on the toll the case had taken on two families.",
      "\"We lost Peter for 39 years and at the end of the day it's not just us,\" Smith said. \"Peter hasn't won and neither has the Sindall family. They've lost their daughter, they are not going to get her back. We've got Peter back and now we've got to try and build a life around him again.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariffs-china-trump-trade/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 10:17:09 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's what an agreement by the U.S. and China to suspend steep tariffs for 90 days means for consumers, businesses and the economy.",
    "story": [
      "A\u00a0tariff truce\u00a0between the U.S. and China announced on Monday will offer companies some relief, but also prolong the kind of economic uncertainty that makes it hard for businesses to plan for the future.",
      "Beginning May 14, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy. China will reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%.",
      "But clinching a long-term trade deal is likely to prove challenging, while the reduced 30% tariff rate could still lead to price hikes for consumers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It remains to be seen whether the U.S. and China can agree to a trade deal that keeps tariffs from rebounding in 90 days,\" analysts with Gavekal, an investment research firm, said in a report. \"So far, only the U.K. has reached an agreement with the U.S., and that doesn't tell us much.\"",
      "Is the 30% tariff permanent?",
      "No. Absent a formal trade deal, there's no guarantee that President Trump won't again raise tariffs on China once the truce expires after 90 days and that Beijing won't also retaliate. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the new baseline tariff a \"floor\" in an interview with Bloomberg Surveillance.",
      "\"This is just a 90-day pause that allows the two countries to work toward a deal,\" supply-chain expert Sina Golara, an assistant professor at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Is a 30% tariff on Chinese imports still high?",
      "Under the agreement, the U.S. will lower tariffs on Chinese goods from as much as 145% to 30%. Still, that represents a steep hike on the level of U.S. levies on China before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "\"If you look at where we were pre-'Liberation Day' or when Trump took office, this 'agreement' is just a baseline tariff increase to 30% across the board,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, referring to the phrase President Trump used in announcing a barrage of tariffs on April 2. \"While it's a walk-back from the prohibitive 145% tariffs, it still leaves us no closer to any concessions or renegotiations vis-\u00e0-vis China than we were.\"",
      "Tariff rates aren't the only potential sticking points as the countries continue to negotiate.",
      "\"The two countries have a lot of grievances in many dimensions, so it's not just tariff rates,\" Golara noted. \"It's where they strand on other trade barriers, the trade imbalance, and the U.S. accusing China of currency manipulation, so there's a lot to discuss. It makes sense for them to want to take more time.\"",
      "What does the U.S-China truce mean for economic growth?",
      "There's good news here: If both countries' reduced tariffs remain in place, consumer confidence is likely to improve and boost spending. That should help contain U.S. inflation and help support the job market, according to Oxford Economics associate economist Grace Zwemmer.",
      "The announcement also reduces the odds of the U.S. economy entering a recession this year, according to experts. Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet lowered his forecast for a recession to 35% from more than 50%.",
      "Will shipments from China start flowing again?",
      "Large and small businesses alike in the U.S. have warned that higher tariffs will raise consumer prices, while some companies have canceled orders from Chinese factories because of the high levies.",
      "\"It's very clear that Trump was staring down the barrel of a huge drop in imports from China across the busiest shipping season, as companies build inventory for Christmas and the holiday season,\" Groundwork Collaborative's Jacquez told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0 \"There were more announcements from companies about burning through their inventory and having to pass costs to customers, or having to cease importing from China.\"",
      "Freight shipments from China are expected to surge during the 90-day tariff pause, as companies bulk up their inventories to guard against the trade talks foundering and levies rising. \u00a0As a result, shipping rates will rise, and squeeze smaller businesses, whose margins are already thin.",
      "\"Right now, you'll see a huge rush in trying to get imports in from China in this 90-day period. That will strain shipping logistics just as it did in Covid, when everything opened back up,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Will consumer prices still rise?",
      "Businesses still face added costs with 30% tariffs in place, and they are likely to pass some of those expense onto consumers. But the price hikes could be less substantial depending on how companies handle tariffs, according to Georgia State University's Golara.",
      "\"If we have a mix of some companies handling tariffs well, we won't see broad-based inflation rise to a painful level. We might see pocketed effects in different and specific products and sectors,\" he said.",
      "Other experts agree the pause is good news for companies and consumers.",
      "\"The tariffs were so punishing that it was creating this incentive not to import anything from China,\" Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The announcement is also good news because it means supply is not going to be as restrained as it was.\"",
      "It doesn't mean the U.S. it completely out of the woods, though. \"It's still a significant increase in taxes for American consumers. We are still in a worse position than we were,\" de Rugy said.",
      "How are companies reacting?",
      "Businesses are still grappling with significant economic uncertainty, making it hard to plan for the future.",
      "\"If you're a small business and don't know what your inputs will cost next week or in 90 days, it's going to be extremely difficult to do business in this uncertain environment,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Kim Vaccarella, founder and CEO of Bogg, a U.S-based beach bag and accessories company that makes its products in China, has been scrambling to shift at least some of its manufacturing to Vietnam and Sri Lanka because of the Trump administration's stepped-up tariffs.",
      "\"We were looking at alternatives and set up viable sources in both countries, and we were working toward manufacturing there,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Then came The White House's announcement on Monday. With the U.S. earlier this year having raised its country-based tariffs on Vietnam and Sri Lanka to o46% and 44%, respectively, China may again be Vaccarella's best option.",
      "\"Now we are back to square one, because at 30% it's less expensive to manufacture in China,\" she said. \"If tariffs stay at 30% or go lower, it just looks like we spent a lot of money quickly trying to ramp up production somewhere else, because that would have been more acceptable under this current nightmare.\"",
      "A leading index of small business optimism has fallen every month this year, although it remains above its levels before the November presidential election.",
      "Vaccarella had warned customers that the price of her company's\u00a0bags could jump as early as July. \"But 30% we can work with,\" she said. \"There might have to be a small increase, but it won't be what it would have been at 145%.\"",

      "The pieces \u2014 spanning centuries of Egyptian civilization \u2014 were handed over following a three-year recovery effort by Egypt's consulate in New York, the New York District Attorney's Office and U.S. security agencies, the ministry said in a news release.",
      "The collection includes wooden and gilded sarcophagus lids dating back more than 5,500 years, parts of a temple believed to belong to Queen Hatshepsut and a Greco-Roman mummy portrait from Fayyoum \u2014 a southern city renowned for its distinctive Greco-Roman art.",
      "The trove also features intricately crafted jewelry from around 2,400 years ago, a granite foot fragment dating back to the Ramessid dynasty, during the peak of Egypt's power, as well as small ivory and stone figurines.",
      "A rare gold coin dating back over two millennia to the reign of Ptolemy I \u2014 one of Alexander the Great's generals and founder of ancient Egypt's last royal dynasty \u2014 is also part of the collection.",
      "The ministry released five images of the artifacts on social media.",

    "summary": "French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two women during the filming of Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) in Paris in 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu was convicted Tuesday of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in Paris in 2021 and handed an 18-month suspended sentence. The 76-year-old actor had denied the charges that he forcefully groped a set decorator and an assistant producer on the set of \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\").",
      "Depardieu was not in court for the verdict or sentencing on Tuesday, as he's currently filming in Portugal. His lawyer said he would appeal the verdict.",
      "Depardieu was accused by a set decorator, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, who said the actor grabbed and groped them during filming in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "\"I am deeply moved, I'm very happy with this decision,\" the assistant producer, identified in court only as Am\u00e9lie, said after Tuesday's decision was handed down. \"It is a victory for me, a step forward. Justice was served, I feel.\"",
      "Taking the stand in March for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses, but after the Depardieu published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court in March that Depardieu was diabetic and had undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse in March, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They said they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all.\"",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",
      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",

      "Manila, Philippines\u00a0\u2014 Despite his detention by the International Criminal Court, former Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte appeared to have been elected as mayor in his home city by a landslide, according to preliminary results on Tuesday. At least five candidates backed by his family were also among those leading the race for 12 Senate positions, in a stronger-than-expected showing in Monday's midterm elections. Pre-election surveys had indicated only two of them would emerge victorious.",
      "The results come as a boost for Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, ahead of an impeachment trial in the Senate in July over a raft of charges including alleged misuse of public funds and plotting to assassinate President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., his wife and the House speaker.",
      "Sara Duterte is considered a strong contender for the 2028 presidential race. But if convicted by the Senate, she will lose her job and be disqualified from holding public office forever. To be acquitted, she needs at least nine of the 24 senators to vote in her favor.",
      "The official election results will be known within a week. But the partial and unofficial count by election watchdog Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting showed Duterte garnering more than half a million votes in his stronghold Davao City, nearly eight times more than his closest rival.",
      "His youngest son, Sebastian, the incumbent mayor of Davao, is also leading the unofficial vote count in the race for Davao vice mayor. His eldest son, Paolo, who is seeking reelection as a member of the House of Representatives, and two grandsons in local races were also in the lead, in an indication of the family's continued influence.",
      "\"Duterte landslide in Davao!\" his youngest daughter Veronica posted on Facebook.",
      "Duterte, nicknamed \"the Punisher\" and \"Dirty Harry,\" served as Davao's mayor for two decades before becoming president. He has been in the custody of the International Criminal Court since March, awaiting trial for crimes against humanity over a brutal war on illegal drugs that left thousands of suspects dead during his 2016-2022 presidency. He was arrested at Manila's airport after arriving from Hong Kong, with police taking him into custody on orders of the ICC, which has been investigating mass killings that happened under his crackdown on illegal drugs.",
      "The impeachment and Rodrigo Duterte's arrest and transfer to the tribunal in The Hague came after Marcos and Sara Duterte's ties unraveled over political differences and their competing ambitions. Duterte supporters slammed Marcos' government for arresting and surrendering the former leader to a court whose jurisdiction his supporters dispute.",
      "Under Philippine law, candidates facing criminal charges, including those in detention, can run for office unless they have been convicted and have exhausted all appeals.",
      "Sara Duterte had told reporters after voting Monday that she was in talks with her father's lawyers on how he could take his oath as mayor despite being behind bars. She had said the vice mayor, widely expected to be Sebastian, would likely be the acting mayor.",

      "Hamas, a U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group, said Sunday evening that it would release Alexander without conditions in the hope of working toward a lasting ceasefire in Gaza and renewing the flow of vital humanitarian aid to the besieged Palestinian territory. On Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement, without identifying Alexander, that it had \"successfully facilitated the safe transfer of a hostage from Gaza to Israeli authorities.\"",

This would ensure long-term calm and stability, along with reconstruction and the lifting of the blockade.\"",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump called the move \"a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators - Qatar and Egypt - to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones.

      "Landau also cited attacks on South African farmers in recent years, saying the new arrivals have faced \"egregious and targeted threats.\" The South African government argues attacks in the country's rural farming communities are not racially targeted and are part of South Africa's broader crime problem.",

Notably, domains such as\u00a0technavix.cloud and\u00a0salorttactical.top have been highlighted as part of the malicious network distributing AMOS.

The second is that macOS provides a level of built-in security that keeps most attackers at bay. In reality, a single click can expose Keychain credentials, active browser sessions and cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "These are exactly the kinds of targets that attract credential-stuffing groups and profit-driven cybercriminals. Because the attack is triggered by the user, many network monitoring tools treat the traffic as normal, leaving security teams with little to investigate. In environments where Macs and Windows machines share identity systems, one compromised Mac can open access to single sign-on portals, cloud storage and even production codebases.",

      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of the MacReaper attack, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures.",
      "1) Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to copy commands or paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it's likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2) Don't click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many MacReaper attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company's official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4) Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5) Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you've interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don't recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6) Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from MacReaper or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "MacReaper makes it clear that the most durable exploits aren't zero-days but borrowed moments of trust, an authentic-looking CAPTCHA, a helpful-sounding fix, a clipboard that does what it's told. As Apple tightens the technical screws with Rapid Security Responses and notarization, expect adversaries to double down on such psychological levers. The counter-strategy is to hard-bake healthy skepticism into user behavior and to instrument Macs with the same telemetry layers enterprises already expect from Windows. Security, in other words, has finally become a platform-agnostic muscle, and complacency is the riskiest operating system of all.",

      "The Ability Hand offers an impressive variety of grip patterns, 32 in total, with 19 ready to use right now. Whether you need a strong power grip for lifting or a delicate pinch for picking up small items, this hand adapts easily. Customized grips are also available for those who want something tailored.",
      "Weighing just 1.08 pounds lighter than the average human hand, the Ability Hand is comfortable for all-day use. All five fingers flex and extend naturally, and the thumb can rotate both electrically and manually, allowing for a wide range of motions that feel intuitive and lifelike.",
      "Charging is simple with a USB-C port, taking about an hour to fully charge. The battery lasts 6 to 8 hours, depending on use. A neat bonus: you can even charge your phone directly from the Ability Hand. The hand is also compatible with most third-party control systems, including EMG pattern recognition and force-sensitive resistors, making it a flexible option for many users.",

      "5) Avoid clicking suspicious links and install strong antivirus software: Scammers impersonate banks with phishing emails/texts containing misspelled URLs (e.g., \"captial0ne.com\"), so always navigate directly to your bank\u2019s official website or app instead of clicking embedded links. Strong antivirus software helps protect your devices from fake apps, keyloggers and other threats.

      "6) Check your accounts regularly: Don\u2019t just glance at your balance. Review recent transactions at least once a week to catch any suspicious activity.",
      "7) Avoid public Wi-Fi for banking: Hackers exploit unsecured networks to launch man-in-the-middle attacks and spoof banking sites, so use a VPN to encrypt your connection if you must bank on public Wi-Fi.

These services automatically remove your data from broker databases, reducing the risk of social engineering attempts that could compromise your bank account.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "How the Z1 hybrid airship works",
      "The Z1 combines lighter-than-air buoyancy with advanced engineering innovations. Notably, the aircraft features a tri-lobe hull design, a hallmark of Lockheed Martin's earlier airship projects. This design includes a raised central lobe flanked by two side lobes, which enhances lift efficiency and stability. Its Air Cushion Landing System allows it to take off and land on virtually any flat surface, including sand, ice, water or uneven terrain, eliminating the need for traditional runways.",
      "The Z1 uses vectored thrust propulsion and advanced onboard systems for weather prediction and route planning, enabling it to travel more than 1,400 nautical miles at speeds of up to 60 knots. The hybrid lift system merges helium's natural buoyancy with vectored thrust from the engines, optimizing both efficiency and control. This innovative design reduces fuel consumption to just one-fifth of what a heavy-lift helicopter would use, making the Z1 especially suited for transporting goods to remote and difficult-to-access areas such as the Arctic or the Amazon rainforest.",

      "ZERO EMISSIONS HYDROGEN ELECTRIC JET DISRUPTS CONVENTIONAL FLIGHTS",
      "Why it matters",
      "The Z1 addresses two pressing challenges in modern transportation. First, it offers a practical solution for accessing remote regions where traditional cargo planes and helicopters face high costs and infrastructure limitations. Its ability to land without airstrips unlocks affordable transport options for industries like mining, disaster relief and medical supply delivery in isolated communities.",
      "Second, the Z1 contributes to the urgent global need to reduce carbon emissions. Transports such as cars, trucks, trains, ships and airplanes currently account for over 40% of worldwide carbon emissions, and the Z1's low fuel consumption and ability to overfly environmentally sensitive areas quietly present a scalable alternative for freight transport with minimized environmental impact.",

      "IS THIS 656-FOOT AIRYACHT THE LUXURY TRANSPORTATION OF THE FUTURE?",
      "The road ahead",
      "The recent $50 million order from Straightline Aviation demonstrates strong confidence in the Z1's commercial potential, with the first delivery expected by 2028. Arctic Airships has also placed orders for two airships, targeting operations in Alaska's challenging terrain.",
      "\"Our hybrid airships will transform cargo transport by providing an environmentally responsible solution while maintaining operational efficiency,\" said Dr. Bob Boyd, CEO of AT\u00b2 Aerospace. He went on to say,\u00a0\"Our aircraft not only optimizes cargo movement in challenging terrains but also aligns with the industry's increasing focus on environmental responsibility and cost efficiency.\"",

      "It might not be your phone, but your carrier\u2019s messaging support. Knowing the difference between SMS, MMS and RCS and how your carrier handles them can save you money, improve message delivery and ensure you\u2019re using the full potential of your messaging app.",
      "A person texting on their phone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Knowing the basics: SMS vs. MMS vs. RCS",
      "Before you can figure out which phone carrier fits your messaging needs, it helps to understand the differences between the three main types of mobile messaging \u2014 SMS, MMS and RCS. Each has its own capabilities, limitations and impact on your experience.",
      "Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals \u2014 plus instant access to my\u00a0free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up!",
      "SMS (Short Message Service) is the most basic form of text messaging and has been around since the early days of mobile phones. It allows users to send plain text messages with a strict character limit of 160 characters. SMS messages are sent over the cellular network, which means they work even if you don\u2019t have a data plan or access to Wi-Fi. This makes SMS one of the most reliable messaging options available, especially for simple communication. It works for all phones, even older models, which makes it universal.",
      "MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service)\u00a0builds upon SMS by allowing the transmission of multimedia content. With MMS, users can send images, videos, audio files and even GIFs. The character limit is significantly higher, typically up to 1,600 characters, although this can vary depending on the carrier. MMS messages also travel over the cellular network but require mobile data to send and receive. They do not require Wi-Fi, but because media files are larger, the reliability can vary. Some carriers compress MMS files or fail to send them if they exceed certain size limits, which means your carefully chosen vacation photo might arrive as a pixelated blur.",
      "RCS (Rich Communication Services) represents the next generation of mobile messaging. It is designed to upgrade the SMS and MMS experience by providing features that rival popular messaging apps like iMessage and WhatsApp. With RCS, users can send high-resolution photos and videos, audio clips, emoji, stickers and even read receipts and typing indicators. There is no character limit, and the service works over Wi-Fi or mobile data instead of over standard cellular channels.",
      "While RCS allows larger files, some messaging platforms or carriers may still apply soft limits or compress images/videos to ensure consistent performance. However, for RCS to work, both the sender and the recipient need to have RCS enabled on a supported messaging app and carrier. Google Messages is the most reliable app for accessing these RCS features, especially on Android devices. However, it should be noted that Apple devices do not support RCS natively because Apple relies on iMessage for similar functionality.",
      "HOW TO STOP SPAM TEXT MESSAGES ON YOUR PHONE",
      "Why it matters when choosing a wireless carrier",
      "Now that you know what SMS, MMS and RCS are, it\u2019s important to understand how your phone carrier influences your messaging experience. From hidden fees to message delivery issues, the provider you choose can make a big difference in how well these technologies work.",
      "Not all carriers treat these messaging types the same. While SMS is often free and unlimited on many plans, MMS messages may incur additional charges, especially on prepaid or international plans. RCS messages, on the other hand, use mobile data or Wi-Fi and typically do not incur per-message fees, making them a cost-effective option if supported.",
      "For example, carrier A might offer unlimited SMS but charge for every MMS sent. Carrier B might include MMS in the plan but cap the number of SMS messages. Carrier C could fully support RCS, letting users send messages over Wi-Fi for free. Choosing the right carrier based on how you communicate can help avoid surprise charges.",
      "While SMS and MMS are universally supported, RCS still depends on carrier infrastructure and the messaging app being used. Some carriers support RCS only through their proprietary apps, which may not be compatible with all devices. Others support \"universal RCS\", which works across multiple platforms but still requires the right app, most reliably\u00a0Google Messages.",
      "If you\u2019re hoping to use RCS features like high-resolution image sharing, read receipts and typing indicators, it\u2019s important to ensure your carrier not only supports RCS but also supports it universally across devices and apps. Otherwise, your message may silently fall back to SMS or MMS if the recipient\u2019s carrier or device does not support RCS.",

      "When you are abroad, reliable messaging becomes even more critical. SMS is the most dependable option and works almost everywhere, making it a safe choice for staying connected. MMS, on the other hand, can be inconsistent overseas due to differences in network standards and carrier agreements. RCS is even less predictable outside your home country, as it relies on mobile data or Wi-Fi and often does not function while roaming unless your carrier specifically enables it for international use.",

      "3. Keep your device and apps updated: Regularly\u00a0update your operating system and apps to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "4. Use end-to-end encrypted messaging apps: Consider using apps with end-to-end encryption for secure communication. This ensures that only you and the intended recipient can read the messages, keeping them safe from hackers or third-party interception. Popular options include Signal, WhatsApp and iMessage, which prioritize privacy and protect sensitive conversations from unauthorized access.",
      "5. Be mindful of public Wi-Fi and use a Virtual Private Network (VPN):\u00a0Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive communications, as it can be insecure and expose your data to potential eavesdropping or hacking. Consider using a VPN for secure browsing on public networks because it encrypts your internet traffic and masks your IP address, providing a safer experience even on unsecured networks. By using a VPN, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with public Wi-Fi and protect your personal data from unauthorized access. For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "6. Delete sensitive messages:\u00a0Regularly delete sensitive messages to minimize data exposure. This practice helps protect your privacy by ensuring that confidential information isn't stored indefinitely on your device or in the cloud, where it could potentially be accessed by unauthorized parties. Additionally, consider using messaging apps that offer features like automatic message deletion or self-destructing messages to further enhance your privacy",

      "The challenges of brain surgery today",
      "Brain surgery is incredibly complex. The tools surgeons use today are often rigid and can only move in straight lines. This limits where they can safely operate. Many tumors or problematic areas in the brain are simply too risky to reach because they lie near regions responsible for critical functions like movement or speech.",
      "In some cases, surgeons have no choice but to leave tumors untreated because the risk of damage is too high. On top of that, many drugs cannot even reach certain parts of the brain because of the blood-brain barrier, leaving patients with limited treatment options.",

      "TEEN GOES FROM 10 NIGHTLY SEIZURES TO ZERO WITH BRAIN IMPLANT",
      "How the microrobot works",
      "Robeaut\u00e9\u2019s microrobot is designed to overcome these challenges. It is incredibly small, about three millimeters long, roughly the size of a grain of rice, and it enters the brain through a tiny incision just a millimeter wide. Unlike traditional tools, this robot does not move in straight lines. Instead, it can follow curved paths, gently pushing aside brain tissue as it goes. It uses rotating silicone rings at its tip to carefully shift tissue without causing damage. This movement is inspired by how tiny insects walk on water, using adhesion forces that dominate at such small scales.",
      "Inside the robot, there is a small compartment that holds miniature surgical tools. For example, when performing a biopsy, the microrobot uses a flexible needle and tiny forceps to collect tissue samples. These samples can be stored inside the device or pulled back through a cable connected to the robot. Beyond biopsies, the robot can also implant electrodes for conditions like Parkinson\u2019s disease or deliver drugs directly to tumors. It even has sensors that send real-time information back to the surgeons, helping them monitor the procedure closely.",
      "What is really impressive is how the robot\u2019s path is planned. Using MRI scans combined with artificial intelligence, surgeons can map out safe routes that avoid sensitive brain areas. During surgery, they can adjust the robot\u2019s position in real time using ultrasound imaging mounted on the skull, achieving sub-millimeter precision.",

There were no major complications like bleeding, which suggests the device can safely navigate brain tissue. Robeaut\u00e9 plans to begin human clinical trials in 2026, focusing on microbiopsies of brain tumors. They also aim to expand into the U.S. market and seek FDA approval, with hopes of launching internationally by 2030.",

It could allow doctors to diagnose brain tumors earlier and treat them more effectively while reducing the risks associated with traditional surgery. Because it is minimally invasive, patients could experience faster recoveries and fewer side effects. Additionally, the ability to collect live data from inside the brain could accelerate research and drug development for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.",

It tackles one of the most difficult challenges in healthcare: how to safely access and treat the brain. While there are still hurdles to overcome, such as regulatory approvals and manufacturing at scale, this tiny device has the potential to turn previously \"inoperable\" brain tumors into treatable conditions. As one of the company\u2019s founders describes it, the microrobot acts like a \"brain gardener,\" delicately tending to damaged tissue from within.

      "The industrialization of credential theft",
      "In 2024, cybersecurity researchers at Fortinet observed a staggering surge in stolen login data being traded on the dark web. Over 1.7 billion credentials were harvested not from old breaches but through active infections on users\u2019 devices.",
      "At the heart of this epidemic is a class of malware called infostealers, which are programs designed specifically to extract sensitive information like usernames, passwords, browser cookies, email logins, crypto wallets and session tokens. Unlike large-scale data breaches that target centralized databases, infostealers operate on individual machines. They don\u2019t break into a company\u2019s servers; they compromise the end user, often without the victim ever noticing.",
      "These logs are then aggregated and sold by initial access brokers, intermediaries who sell compromised credentials and access tokens to other cybercriminal groups, including ransomware operators. The market has matured to the point where access to a corporate VPN, an admin dashboard or even a personal bank account can be purchased at scale, with verified functionality and region-specific pricing.",
      "Fortinet\u2019s 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report identified a 500% increase in credential logs from infostealer infections over the past year. Among the most widespread and dangerous infostealers identified in the report are RedLine, Vidar and Raccoon.",

      "How infostealers work",
      "Infostealers are typically distributed through phishing emails, malicious browser extensions, fake software installers or cracked applications. Once installed on a device, they scan browser databases, autofill records, saved passwords and local files for any credential-related data. Many also look for digital wallets, FTP credentials and cloud service logins.",
      "Crucially, many infostealers also exfiltrate session tokens and authentication cookies, meaning that even users who rely on multifactor authentication are not entirely safe. With a stolen session token, an attacker can bypass multifactor authentication entirely and assume control of the session without ever needing to log in manually.",
      "Once collected, the data is uploaded to a command and control server. From there, it's either used directly by attackers or bundled into logs and sold on forums. These logs can include everything from the victim\u2019s IP address and geolocation to their browser fingerprint and full credential list, giving attackers everything they need to carry out further exploitation or impersonation.",

      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are five effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Our No. 1 pick has a\u00a0built-in\u00a0Data Breach Scanner that lets you check if your information has been exposed in known breaches.\u00a0Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

They\u2019re evidence of an evolving, industrialized cybercrime economy built on the backs of unsuspecting users and quietly infected devices.

    "story": [
      "Looking Glass is transforming how we interact with 3D visuals.",
      "You can now gather around a screen and see digital objects come to life in true three dimensions; no headsets, no glasses, just your eyes and a shared experience with others.",
      "That\u2019s exactly what the new, 27-inch light-field display from Looking Glass offers.",
      "This innovative technology is transforming how we interact with 3D visuals, making immersive experiences more natural and accessible for businesses, educators and creators alike.",

      "27-inch light-field display (Looking Glass)",
      "How it works",
      "The\u00a0Looking Glass 27 uses light-field display technology, which projects multiple perspectives of an object simultaneously. This allows for \"Super Multi View\" experiences, where everyone around the screen can see a slightly different angle, just like in the real world. It\u2019s a step beyond traditional 3D displays, offering richer depth cues and a more natural viewing experience.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The display can showcase single images, 3D videos or interactive applications, and it\u2019s flexible enough to handle everything from quick model previews to fully interactive group experiences.",
      "27-inch light-field display (Looking Glass)",
      "WILL 3D TECH CHANGE SPORTS FOREVER?",
      "A breakthrough in group 3D experiences",
      "Shawn Frayne, Looking Glass\u2019 CEO and co-founder, describes this release as a \"breakthrough moment for 3D.\" The new 27-inch display is the company\u2019s most advanced yet, combining major hardware and software advances to cut costs and dramatically reduce the computing power needed to run complex 3D content.",
      "The display sits at just an inch thick but packs a punch with 5K resolution (5,120 x 2,880 pixels) at 60 Hz, delivering up to 16 inches of virtual depth and 8-bit color. The result? Real-time 3D visuals that look and feel like they\u2019re actually present in the room.",
      "But what really sets this display apart is its ability to create a shared 3D experience. Unlike traditional VR or AR setups that require each participant to wear a headset, the Looking Glass 27 can project up to 100 unique perspectives across a 53-degree viewing cone. This means a team can gather around a single screen and see the same digital object from different angles, just as they would with a real-world prototype or artifact.",

      "Looking Glass has made it easier than ever for developers and enterprises to build, test and deploy 3D applications. Content creation starts on a computer running Unity, but the finished product can be deployed on an iPad, which also powers the display and serves as its interface. This approach reduces system costs by about 35% compared to previous models and makes deployment far more flexible. The display also supports Blender, Unreal Engine, WebXR and Looking Glass\u2019 own Studio and Bridge tools, making it compatible with a wide range of 3D workflows.",
      "The display is designed for versatility. It can sit on a desk or be mounted on a wall, and it\u2019s available in both portrait and landscape configurations (though you\u2019ll need to pick one when ordering). The software ecosystem allows for quick creation of 3D apps using Unity templates, and content can be managed just like any other iOS application, streamlining updates and deployment.",

Imagine medical students exploring a virtual anatomy lesson together or design teams collaborating on a 3D prototype without the hassle of headsets. The display\u2019s ability to render depth, texture, translucency and lighting effects as they appear in real life makes it a powerful tool for any field that benefits from visualizing complex, spatial information.",

      "He was also fined a total of 29,040 euros (around $32,350), and the court requested that he be registered in the national sex offender database.",
      "The 76-year-old actor was convicted of having groped a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant during the filming of \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in 2021. The case was widely seen as a key post-#MeToo test of how French society and its film industry address allegations of sexual misconduct involving prominent figures.",
      "FRENCH ACTOR G\u00c9RARD DEPARDIEU CHARGED WITH ALLEGED RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT FROM 2018 CASE",
      "Depardieu, who has denied the accusations, didn't attend the hearing in Paris. Depardieu\u2019s lawyer said that his client would appeal the decision.",
      "\"It is the victory of two women, but it is the victory of all the women beyond this trial,\" said Carine Durrieu Diebolt, the set dresser's lawyer. \"Today we hope to see the end of impunity for an artist in the world of cinema. I think that with this decision we can no longer say that he is not a sexual abuser. And today, as the Cannes Film Festival opens, I\u2019d like the film world to spare a thought for G\u00e9rard Depardieu\u2019s victims.\"",

      "Accused by more than 20 women",
      "Depardieu\u2019s long and storied career \u2014 he told the court that he\u2019s made more than 250 films \u2014 has turned him into a French movie giant. He was Oscar-nominated in 1991 for his performance as the swordsman and poet Cyrano de Bergerac.",
      "In recent years, the actor has been accused publicly or in formal complaints of misconduct by more than 20 women, but so far only the sexual assault case has proceeded to court. Some other cases were dropped because of a lack of evidence or the statute of limitations.",
      "During the four-day trial in March, Depardieu rejected the accusations, saying he\u2019s \"not like that.\" He acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language on the film set and that he grabbed the set dresser's hips during an argument, but denied that his behavior was sexual.",
      "JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME HITS BACK AT 'GROTESQUE' SEX TRAFFICKING ALLEGATIONS",
      "The court, composed of a panel of three judges, concluded that Depardieu\u2019s explanations in court were \"unpersuasive\" and \"not credible\" and stressed both accusers' \"constant, reiterated and substantiated declarations.\"",
      "The court also said that both plaintiffs have been faced with an \"aggressive\" defense strategy \"based on comments meant to offend them.\" The judges therefore considered that Depardieu\u2019s lawyer's comments in court aggravated the harm to the accusers and justified higher fines.",
      "Depardieu\u2019s lawyer, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, regretted that the court \"considered that questioning the accusations is an additional assault ... which means that now the defense, even in this type of trial, is no longer accepted.\"",

      "The two accusers testified in court",
      "The set dresser described the alleged assault, saying the actor pincered her between his legs as she squeezed past him in a narrow corridor.",
      "She said he grabbed her hips, then started \"palpating\" her behind and \"in front, around.\" She ran her hands near her buttocks, hips and pubic area to show what she allegedly experienced. She said he then grabbed her chest.",
      "The woman also testified that Depardieu used an obscene expression to ask her to touch his penis and suggested he wanted to rape her. She told the court that the actor\u2019s calm and cooperative attitude during the trial bore no resemblance to his behavior at work.",
      "FRENCHMAN FOUND GUILTY IN HORRIFIC RAPE TRIAL THAT SHOCKED THE WORLD",
      "The other plaintiff, an assistant, said that Depardieu groped her buttocks and her breasts during three separate incidents on the film set.",

      "Before leaving for his trip, Trump reiterated his stance on Iran's nuclear goals while addressing reporters at the White House, where he said, \"You can't have a nuclear weapon, but I think that they are talking intelligently. We're in the midst of talking to them, and they're right now acting very intelligent. We want Iran to be wealthy and wonderful and happy and great, but they can't have \u2026 nuclear weapons. Very simple. So I think they understand that.\"",

      "An \"agreement was reached to move forward with the talks to continue working through technical elements,\" the U.S. official said. \"We are encouraged by today\u2019s outcome and look forward to our next meeting, which will happen in the near future.\"",

The Trump administration vehemently opposes a uranium enrichment program on Iranian soil.",
      "\"Iran is trying to save its enrichment operation at a lower level and also not accepting any pressure to halt its anti-Israel stance. Khamenei's speech [Saturday] highlighted that second point. But at this point, the main issue is dismantling Iran's uranium enrichment,\" Soghom told Fox News Digital.",
      "Khamenei also lashed out at Israel during his Saturday speech in Tehran, declaring about Israel\u2019s war campaign to root out Iran-backed Hamas terrorists from the Gaza Strip that \"The people of Gaza are not facing Israel alone\u2014they are facing America and Britain.\"",
      "Jason Brodsky, the policy director of United Against Nuclear Iran, told Fox News Digital that\u00a0\"The Iranians, like last round, sound more downcast than the U.S. side, describing talks as difficult.\"",
      "In 2018, President\u00a0Trump withdrew from former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), because the accord failed to prevent Tehran from building a nuclear weapons device, according to the first Trump administration.",

      "President Trump\u2019s\u00a0Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff recently stressed that\u00a0Iran cannot have an enrichment program during an interview with Breitbart News prior to Sunday\u2019s bargaining session.",
      "Witkoff said \"First of all, we\u2019re never doing a JCPOA deal where sanctions come off and there\u2019s no sunsetting of their obligations. That doesn\u2019t make sense. That was a mismatched procedure in JCPOA. We believe that they cannot have enrichment, they cannot have centrifuges, they cannot have anything that allows them to build a weapon. We believe in all of that. That was not JCPOA. JCPOA had sunset provisions that burned off the obligations and burned off the sanctions relief at inappropriate times. It\u2019s never going to happen in this deal.\"",
      "Brodsky said that \"All in all, both sides want to keep the process moving. The Iranians will usually say and do enough to earn another meeting as they stand to lose more by this process breaking down than the U.S. government. The negotiating process is as important to the Iranians as the agreement itself as the process offers insulation from the impact of sanctions\u2014with the rial strengthening since talks started\u2014and protection from a military strike.",
      "\"This is why Iran will want these negotiations to continue for as long as possible. They will try to wear out and exhaust U.S. negotiators into concessions, which the Trump administration should reject. As President Trump said in a different context, Tehran does not have the cards here.\"",

      "The hot-button issue of uranium enrichment has plagued talks with Iran over the last few decades. The Europeans faced intense criticism when they agreed\u2014independent of the U.S.\u2014to allow the Islamic Republic to enrich uranium during the nascent phase of atomic talks during the early years of this century.",
      "Brodsky said\u00a0\"The original sin of U.S. decision-making on Iran\u2019s nuclear program was when the Obama administration changed the U.S. position from zero enrichment to tolerating enrichment at 3.67%. That laid the groundwork for Iran to retain the capability to continue to use its nuclear program to extort the United States and ultimately build a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "The nuclear expert noted, \"That should end today, and recent comments from President Trump, Special Envoy Witkoff, and Secretary Rubio hopefully signal that this era is over. House and Senate Republicans were also very clear on this point over the last week. The Iranians say they want a durable deal. But a JCPOA 2.0\u2014tolerating enrichment at 3.67% and no dismantlement of nuclear facilities\u2014would not be one.",
      "\"The Iranians are engaged in all kinds of gimmicks to dress up a variation of the same concessions they offered to President Obama. That should be unacceptable to American negotiators.\"",

      "Lenard Fl\u00f6ren, a Germany-based art director at an advertising agency, said he quickly realized that trying to create his dream fitness app with one lengthy prompt would lead to a plethora of bugs that \u201cneither ChatGPT nor my clueless self had any chance of solving.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike every stereotypical, overconfident guy, I thought I could do it better [than the other apps on the market]. Which, obviously, I couldn\u2019t,\u201d said Fl\u00f6ren, 28, who had no prior coding experience. \u201cBut I had already seen posts of people building apps with AI, so I thought I\u2019d give it a try and see how far I could get.\u201d",
      "Fl\u00f6ren, who ended up creating the personalized workout tracking app he wanted, said he learned to break the process down into bits. It helped, he said, when he began using the AI model as a tool to teach himself how to code along the way.",
      "In recent months, vibe coders have proliferated in online communities, particularly on platforms like Reddit and Discord, where many like to share their projects and trade tips.",
      "For Fay Robinett, the 8-year-old daughter of Cloudflare executive Ricky Robinett,\u00a0building apps with AI has become a casual hobby outside of school. The first chatbot she built, coded using the AI tool Cursor, was one modeled after her own personality. Then, she made one that talks like Harry Potter. More recently, she used Anthropic\u2019s agentic Claude Code tool to build a theme park simulator.",
      "\u201cI also made an app that was like a list that helped me do all my morning stuff, like brush my teeth and go to the bathroom. And I got points when I checked them off,\u201d Robinett said. \u201cSo then if I got, like, 100 points, I could code with Daddy or something, and then if I got 1,000 points, I could go to Governors Island.\u201d",
      "Beyond sheer curiosity, a growing cohort of everyday people now also say they are trying to vibe-code their problems away.",
      "Rishab Jain, a neuroscience student at Harvard University, said he used Replit, an automated app developer that uses an AI agent to code users\u2019 requests, to build a smart rolodex to keep track of his network. He also created a program that translates ancient texts from his religion, Jainism, into English, so that diaspora practitioners who\u2019ve lost touch with the language can read them.",
      "\u201cI totally imagine small problems here or there where you would usually say, \u2018Hey, is there an app I can download for that? Oh, no, there\u2019s not.\u2019 Or maybe there is an app, but it costs $20 a month, something like that,\u201d Jain, 20, said. \u201cNow you can just make it and personalize it for you within maybe an hour. And I find that to be really fascinating.\u201d"

      "Pete Rose has officially been taken off MLB\u2019s permanently ineligible list, the league announced Tuesday. Baseball\u2019s all-time hits leader was banned in 1989 after an investigation revealed that the longtime Cincinnati Reds star had placed bets while playing for and managing the team.",
      "The decision makes Rose, who died at 83 last September, eligible to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement that permanent ineligibility \"ends upon the passing of the disciplined individual.\"",
      "\"To establish clarity for the administration of the Major League Rules, the decision in this matter shall apply to individuals in the past or future who are posthumously on the permanently ineligible list.\"",
      "There are 17 deceased individuals impacted by today\u2019s announcement. Eight of those were part of the Black Sox scandal, including \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson.",
      "The Baseball Hall of Fame issued a statement Tuesday.",
      "\"The National Baseball Hall of Fame has always maintained that anyone removed from Baseball\u2019s permanently ineligible list will become eligible for Hall of Fame consideration. Major League Baseball\u2019s decision to remove deceased individuals from the permanently ineligible list will allow for the Hall of Fame candidacy of such individuals to now be considered.",
      "\"The Historical Overview Committee will develop the ballot of eight names for the Classic Baseball Era Committee \u2014 which evaluates candidates who made their greatest impact on the game prior to 1980 \u2014 to vote on when it meets next in December 2027.\"",
      "In April, Manfred said he had met with President Donald Trump to discuss topics including how immigration policies could affect international players. Rose also was a point of discussion.",
      "\u201cI met with President Trump two weeks ago ... and one of the topics was Pete Rose, but I\u2019m not going beyond that,\u201d Manfred said at the time. \u201cHe\u2019s said what he said publicly. I\u2019m not going beyond that in terms of what the back and forth was.\u201d",
      "Trump said on Truth Social in March that he planned on \u201csigning a complete pardon of Pete Rose, who shouldn\u2019t have been gambling on baseball, but only bet on his team winning.",
      "\u201cHe never betted against himself, or the other team. He had the most hits, by far, in baseball history, and won more games than anyone in sports history.\u201d",
      "After denying he bet on baseball for more than a decade, Rose finally admitted it in an interview with ABC in 2007.",
      "\u201cI bet on baseball in 1987 and 1988,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was my mistake, not coming clean a lot earlier.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Wild chimpanzees have been observed self-medicating their wounds with plants, providing medical aid to other chimps and even removing others from snares left by human hunters, new research suggests.",
      "The behaviors \u2014 which are documented in a new study published in the journal Frontiers in Evolution and Ecology on Wednesday \u2014 provide new clues about the origin of medical care in humans.",
      "The study combines historical data and about eight months of new observations, including many captured on video and in photos. It provides added evidence that our closest living relatives will chew plants and apply makeshift poultices to wounds, clean other animals\u2019 wounds by licking them, and use leaves for a hygienic scrub after sex or defecation. Chimps were also seen pressing wounds and dabbing medicinal leaves to wounds.",
      "The results,\u00a0particularly as they provide evidence that chimpanzees who are not kin care for one another, add new fuel to the debate over whether humans are the only species capable of providing prosocial, or altruistic, care to others.",
      "\u201cOne of the things humans have clung onto is that we\u2019re this very special species, because we are capable of altruism and we\u2019re capable of empathy,\u201d said Elodie Freymann, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford and the first author of the study. \u201cAnimals are helping each other out. They\u2019re capable of identifying others in need and then addressing those specific needs.\u201d",
      "Chimpanzees and bonobos, another primate species, are the closest genetic relatives to humans. The study adds to a growing body of research that suggests the concept of health care could have evolved millions of years ago, before humans were a species.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s likely that our shared common ancestor also would have been capable of these care behaviors as well,\u201d Freymann said.",
      "A growing body of research suggests other animal species might self-medicate, with varying levels of sophistication. Elephants, for example, have been shown to consume leaves used for medicinal purposes by humans, and some researchers suggest the animals are addressing specific needs, like digestion.",
      "The volume of research into animal medication behaviors is increasing and outside researchers said this is important evidence that could open a window into our humanity's past.",
      "\u201cIn our ancestors, we have examples of health care in humans since Neanderthals or even before, but what\u2019s very interesting is that we still don\u2019t understand fully how these kind of exploratory behaviors evolved,\u201d said Alessandra Mascaro, a primatologist and doctoral candidate at Osnabr\u00fcck University in Germany, who was not involved in the paper. \"We are just scratching the surface.\"",
      "In 2022, Mascaro published a study showing that chimpanzees in Gabon applied insects to their wounds, and she hopes more observations will help determine how the animals developed that behavior.",
      "Studying chimpanzee medication behaviors is challenging work because the behaviors are relatively rare.",
      "In this study, Freymann spent two four-month periods in the Budongo Forest in Uganda, following wild chimpanzees familiar enough with human researchers that they\u2019ll ignore their presence. It can be physical and demanding to follow chimps.",
      "\u201cThere can be days where you\u2019re just sitting at the base of a tree while they eat for eight hours, and there can be days where you\u2019re hacking through vines and crossing rivers and stuck in clay pits \u2014\u00a0your day is completely determined by what the group feels like doing,\u201d said Freymann, who would take notes about what the chimps ate, if they were sick or injured and how the animals interacted.",
      "Freymann observed several instances of chimpanzee care behaviors during her field work. She also came across a historic logbook of observations kept at the research field site, which featured instances that didn\u2019t fit into previous research studies. She found patterns of medical care that dated back into the 1990s.",
      "\u201cWhen people pool their results and their observations, you can start seeing these amazing stories kind of come into view,\" she said.",
      "Between her own observations, the logbook and additional data sources, Freymann documented 41 cases of wound care in chimpanzees, including 34 incidents of self-care and seven of care for others, the study says. Four instances of care for others involved animals that were not closely related.",
      "\u201cThe findings show that some types of prosocial behavior towards nonkin may be more widespread than previously thought,\u201d said Isabelle Laumer, a primatologist and cognitive biologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cMore detailed investigation is needed.\u201d",
      "Mascaro, who researched the health behavior of chimps in Gabon, said the new research in Uganda showed that chimps in different geographies exhibited medical care behaviors, which bolsters confidence that the behavior is common across the geography of the species.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t know much about the chimpanzees on that side of Africa,\u201d Mascaro said.",
      "Self-medication has been documented in other primates. Laumer published a study last year showing an orangutan in Indonesia repeatedly chewing leaves and applying the material to a wound on its face to heal a wound received in a fight. The plant the orangutan used to medicate is not usually eaten by the species, but it is known to humans as a pain reliever.",
      "This line of research, broadly, suggests that primates are capable of finding and determining the medicinal value of plants.",
      "\u201cChimpanzees rely on the forest, not just for food, and not just for shelter, but really as a medicine cabinet,\u201d Freymann said, adding that it\u2019s important to preserve the forest resources primates depend upon.",
      "She added that humans likely learned from these creatures and evolved a sense for medicinal plants in the past. And she suggested that pharmaceutical companies could use these animals\u2019 knowledge to identify useful medical resources in the future.",
      "\u201cIf we want to hone in on these amazing medicinal resources, watching and learning from the animals is an incredibly effective way to do it if it\u2019s done ethically and responsibly,\u201d Freymann said."

      "The Democratic and Republican representatives asked the governor, the prison system and leaders in the state House and Senate for an independent and comprehensive review of the April 11 execution of Mikal Mahdi.",
      "They also want the\u00a0firing squad\u00a0removed from the methods of execution that an inmate can choose until an investigation is complete. Condemned prisoners in South Carolina can also choose lethal injection or the electric chair.",
      "Reps. Justin Bamberg and Neal Collins wrote in their letter that the request doesn\u2019t diminish\u00a0the crimes\u00a0Mahdi was convicted of, nor was it rooted in sympathy for the 42-year-old inmate. Mahdi was put to death for the 2004 shooting of an off-duty police officer during a robbery.",
      "\u201cThis independent investigation is to preserve the integrity of South Carolina\u2019s justice system and public confidence in our state\u2019s administration of executions under the rule of law,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Bamberg, a Democrat, and Collins, a Republican, are deskmates in the South Carolina House.",
      "Prison officials say the execution was conducted properly",
      "Prison officials said they thought the execution was properly conducted. House and Senate leaders did not respond. Republican Gov. Henry McMaster said he sees no need to investigate.",
      "\u201cThe governor has high confidence in the leadership of the Department of Corrections. He believes the sentence of death for Mr. Mahdi was properly and lawfully carried out,\u201d spokesman Brandon Charochak wrote in an email.",
      "Even without an investigation, what happened at\u00a0Mahdi\u2019s execution\u00a0may get hashed out in court soon. A possible execution date for Stephen Stanko, who has two death sentences for murders in Horry County and Georgetown County, could be set as soon as Friday. He would have to decide two weeks later how he wants to die.",
      "Mahdi had admitted he killed Orangeburg Public Safety officer James Myers in 2004, shooting him at least eight times before burning his body. Myers\u2019 wife found him in the couple\u2019s Calhoun County shed, which had been the backdrop to their wedding 15 months earlier.",
      "Just one autopsy photo",
      "The autopsy conducted after Mahdi\u2019s execution raised several questions that the lawmakers repeated in their letter.",
      "The only photo of Mahdi\u2019s body taken at his autopsy showed just two distinct wounds in his torso. A pathologist who reviewed the results for Mahdi\u2019s lawyers said that showed one of the three shots from the three prison employee volunteers on the firing squad missed.",
      "The pathologist who conducted the autopsy concluded that two bullets entered the body in the same place after consulting with an unnamed prison official who said that had happened before in training. Prison officials said all three guns fired and no bullets or fragments were found in the death chamber.",
      "\u201cBoth bullets traveling on the exact same trajectory both before and after hitting a target through the same exact entrance point is contrary to the law of physics,\u201d Bamberg and Collins wrote.",
      "Shots appeared to have hit low",
      "In the state\u2019s\u00a0first firing squad execution\u00a0of Brad Sigmon on March 7, three distinct wounds were found on his chest, and his heart was heavily damaged, according to his autopsy report.",
      "The shots barely hit one of the four chambers of Mahdi\u2019s heart and extensively damaged his liver and lungs. Where it likely takes someone 15 seconds to lose consciousness when the heart is directly hit, Mahdi likely was aware and in extreme pain for 30 seconds to a minute, said Dr. Jonathan Arden, the pathologist who reviewed the autopsy for the inmate\u2019s lawyers.",
      "Witnesses said Mahdi cried out as the shots were fired at his execution, groaned again some 45 seconds later and let out one last low moan just before he appeared to draw his final breath at 75 seconds.",
      "Little documentation at the autopsy",
      "Bamberg and Collins said Mahdi\u2019s autopsy itself was problematic.",
      "The official autopsy did not include X-rays to allow the results to be independently verified; only one photo was taken of Mahdi\u2019s body, and no close-ups of the wounds; and his clothing was not examined to determine where the target was placed and how it aligned with the damage the bullets caused to his shirt and his body.",
      "\u201cI think it is really stretching the truth to say that Mikal Mahdi had an autopsy. I think most pathologists would say that he had \u2018an external examination of the body,\u2019\u201d said Jonathan Groner, an expert in lethal injection and other capital punishments and a surgeon who teaches at Ohio State University.",
      "Sigmon\u2019s autopsy included X-rays, several photos and a cursory examination of his clothes",
      "Prison officials have used the same company, Professional Pathology Services, for all its execution autopsies, Corrections Department spokeswoman Chrysti Shain said.",
      "They provide no instructions or restrictions to the firm for any autopsy, she said.",
      "The pathologist who conducted the autopsy refused to answer questions from The Associated Press.",
      "Bamberg and Collins also want the state to allow at least one legislator to attend executions as witnesses.",
      "State law is specific about who can be in the small witness room: prison staff, two representatives for the inmate, three relatives of the victim, a law enforcement officer, the prosecutor where the crime took place, and three members of the media."

      "Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg took aim at the Trump administration in an Iowa town hall and discussed the Democratic Party's path forward \u2014 amid speculation about a potential Democratic presidential bid of his own in 2028.",
      "Buttigieg opened his remarks at the event, hosted in Cedar Rapids by the progressive group VoteVets Action Fund, by saying that progressives, conservatives, and libertarians should be able to unite around the an understanding that freedom \"means freedom from overbearing government.\"",
      "\"At a moment when the president of the United States thinks he could send you to another country, or shut down the broadcast license of a TV station, if he doesn\u2019t like what it has to say \u2014 that is not freedom,\" Buttigieg said.",
      "During a Q&A session with attendees, Buttigieg fielded questions on subjects including the Trump administration threatening to suspend habeas corpus, contending that lawmakers who have been silent figure they \"have more to fear from the president of the United States than the people of the United States.\u201d",
      "\"I am convinced that members of Congress and the president\u2019s party know that this is wrong,\" Buttigieg said, while urging audience members to grab lawmakers' attention in peaceful ways, as many Republicans shy away from holding town halls.",
      "Responding to a question about due process, Buttigieg criticized the Trump administration over its failure to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to a prison in El Salvador in March.",
      "\"One person, least of all, no one politician, gets to decide that you\u2019re a criminal,\" Buttigieg said.",
      "President Donald Trump has said he\u00a0\u201ccould\u201d arrange for Abrego Garcia\u2019s return\u00a0with a phone call, contrasting claims his administration has made in court that it cannot get him back.",
      "Buttigieg also offered some criticism to Democrats mounting a \"hang back\" approach to dealing with some of Trump's policies, when asked about the prospects for Democrats pushing back on the president and his allies.",
      "\"There\u2019s this theory out there that if we just kind of hang back, don\u2019t do much, then the people in charge today will screw it up, and then they\u2019ll get blamed for it and then we\u2019ll win,\" Buttigieg said. \"I disagree. First of all, while I agree that they will screw it up, I disagree that we should let them. And I also disagree that they will be blamed for it. They may not be good at governing but they are really good at allocating blame.\"",
      "Iowa bears significance for Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg won the most delegates in the Iowa caucuses in the 2020 Democratic presidential nominating contest, part of a rapid rise before he eventually dropped out of the race and endorsed Joe Biden. In 2021, he became the first openly gay person to be confirmed as a Cabinet secretary, in then-President Biden's administration.",
      "Buttigieg in March passed on a run for governor or the U.S. Senate\u00a0next year in Michigan, where he now lives with his family.",
      "A source familiar with Buttigieg\u2019s thinking previously told NBC News that foregoing a bid for Senate or governor poised Buttigieg to best position himself for a presidential campaign 2028.",
      "Buttigieg said during a Substack interview earlier on Tuesday that\u00a0\u201cany kind of decision process there is a long way off,\u201d when asked about a potential presidential bid. He also noted that in past decisions to run he's made a point\u00a0to \u201cassess the office and what it calls for,\u201d and \u201cassess what I bring to the table,\u201d before mounting a campaign."

      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 A California judge on Tuesday resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez, making the siblings eligible for parole in the shotgun killings of their parents more than three decades ago.",
      "The ruling from Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic came after months of delays, opposition from Los Angeles County's new top prosecutor and a series of witnesses who testified during a sometimes emotional hearing Tuesday that Erik, 54, and Lyle, 57, had changed for the better and are now \"different men,\" as a cousin, Anamaria Baralt, put it.",
      "The Menendez brothers have been serving sentences of life without the possibility of parole for the murder of Jos\u00e9 and Kitty Menendez on Aug. 20, 1989, at their Beverly Hills home.",
      "Jesic said they would be resentenced to 50 years to life, a prison term that will make them immediately eligible for parole. He said he did not believe they posed an \"unreasonable risk\" if released.",
      "A California parole board will decide if the men are suitable for release.",
      "The brothers began giving statements via videolink immediately after the judge's ruling, with Lyle saying he made no excuses for killing his parents and acknowledging that he made a \"mockery of the legal system\" after his arrest by seeking to have people perjure themselves on his behalf.",
      "\"Today, 35 years later, I am deeply ashamed of who I was,\" he said.",
      "Erik echoed those comments. His crimes were \"cruel and vicious,\" he said, adding that he is \"directly responsible for it all.\"",
      "Among those to speak on the brothers' behalf was a retired judge who described himself as \"very pro-law enforcement\" and said he'd never before testified for someone convicted of a crime.",
      "Another witness, a rapper who goes by \"X-Raided,\" said he met the siblings in prison and attributed his release under California's youthful offender law to them.",
      "\"I went to what I call Menendez University,\" he said, recalling how they helped him and other inmates learn to express remorse and gain insight into their crimes.",
      "During two trials between 1993 and 1996, the brothers testified that they killed their parents in self-defense after Lyle threatened to expose his father's alleged abuse of his brother.",
      "Prosecutors described the killings as cold-blooded and financially-motivated.",
      "The first trial ended with a hung jury. They were convicted of first-degree murder after the second.",
      "Prior to being voted out of office in November, former Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n cited the siblings\u2019 \u201cexceptional\u201d prison records and rehabilitation efforts and recommended that they be resentenced to 50 years to life in prison. The former prosecutor\u2019s efforts were backed by many of the victims\u2019 relatives and some celebrities.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s successor, Nathan Hochman, opposed their release, saying the brothers had not taken full responsibility for a series of \u201cunacknowledged\u201d lies that he said they told about the killings.",
      "\u201cOur position is not no or not never,\u201d Hochman said of their resentencing before Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s not yet. The Menendez brothers have failed to come clean with the full extent of their criminal conduct, their cover up, their lies and their deceit over the past 30 years.\u201d",
      "A lawyer for the brothers, Mark Geragos, accused the prosecutor of trying to \u201crelitigate\u201d the facts of the case and said the only issue before the judge was determining whether the defendants will commit a \u201csuperstrike,\u201d or a serious crime.",
      "\"On a day like today, redemption is possible,\u201d Geragos said after Jesic made his ruling. \"We\u2019re one huge step closer to bringing the boys home.\"",
      "The judge\u2019s ruling only makes the brothers eligible for parole. The state\u2019s parole board will still have to find them suitable for release, a process that is subject to review by California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "As part of a separate clemency request the brothers filed with Newsom, he ordered the board to conduct an evaluation to determine what danger the brothers may pose if released. Hochman said that evaluation, known as a comprehensive risk assessment, found that the brothers were at \u201cmoderate risk\u201d of violence.",
      "The parole board is expected to submit its clemency recommendation to the governor on June 13."

      "\u201cLauren Chan is rewriting fashion\u2019s narrative,\" MJ Day, the editor in chief of SI Swimsuit, said in a statement on social media. \"As a model, activist and entrepreneur, her why is about making people think of beauty in a way that\u2019s inclusive, genuine and empowering. As a writer, she challenges the industry\u2019s narrow standards, offering a new vision where all bodies and stories are celebrated.\"",
      "Chan wrote an essay for SI Swimsuit in 2023 about coming out as queer in her 30s, getting divorced and appearing in SI Swimsuit for the first time. In the essay, she said she realized she was a lesbian during the pandemic, when she was a successful plus-size model and fashion editor at Glamour magazine and was \u201cforced to pause and find non-career-related things to do\u201d for the first time in her adulthood.",

I spent my career representing women who look like me\u2014and I\u2019m ready for a chapter in which I get to celebrate us for who we are on the inside, too,\u201d Chan wrote at the time, adding that SI Swimsuit has helped move the needle on inclusivity by featuring plus-size, transgender and over-70 models on its cover.",
      "In her People interview, which was published Tuesday, Chan said her entire career has been \u201cbased on representation and inclusion.\" First, she said, she represented plus-size women as a model, fashion editor and founder of Henning, a plus-size clothing brand.",
      "\u201cThen once I started my journey with\u00a0Swimsuit,\u00a0it has become a lot about LGBTQ folks and the AAPI community, because I believe I\u2019m also the first Chinese person on the cover of Swimsuit,\" she continued. \"So although my career has taken different forms, the same North Star has been followed, and that is to represent people like me who have felt marginalized and left out to have them feel not just included but celebrated.\u201d",

      "\u201cOh, yeah!\u201d Biden said, according to book. \u201cHi, George!\u201d",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Former President Barack Obama was at the fundraiser too, and \"didn\u2019t know what to make of how his former running mate was acting. At one point, in a small group of a few dozen top donors, Biden began speaking \u2014 barely audibly \u2014 and trailed off incoherently. Obama had to jump in and preside,\" the book says. \"At other moments during photos, Obama would hop in and finish sentences for him. The former president decided that the fault lay with Biden\u2019s busy schedule.\"",
      "Clooney, a major Democratic fundraiser, called for the 81-year-old candidate to step aside after his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump in late June, after the fundraiser. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010,\u201d\u00a0Clooney wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\u201d",
      "The book said Clooney reached out to Obama to tell him that he was planning to write the op-ed, and that Obama told him it would only make Biden dig in his heels deeper.",
      "A spokesperson for Biden said, \u201cWe have not reviewed the book, and the authors did not fact-check the book with us, despite it being a common practice to do so. So we are not going to respond to every bit of this book they choose to release via select leaks in the reporters\u2019 efforts to make a profit.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe continue to await anything that shows\u00a0where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or where national security was threatened or where he was unable to do his job. In fact, the evidence points to the opposite \u2014 he was a very effective president,\u201d the spokesperson added.",
      "A separate Biden-Harris campaign official wouldn\u2019t comment on the specifics outlined in the book excerpts, but said: \u201cWe were always going to lose no matter what because of anti-incumbent headwinds.\u201d",
      "The book also said that despite their public pronouncements that Biden was fine mentally and physically, his team was concerned about his health \u2014 and discussed having him use a wheelchair if he were elected to a second term.",
      "It also says that White House physician Kevin O\u2019Connor often argued with Biden\u2019s aides to reduce his schedule.",
      "\u201cHe wasn\u2019t naive to the stresses of the presidency, and he privately expressed worry about the toll it was taking. He fought other Biden officials on scheduling to try to get Biden more rest,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cO\u2019Connor quipped that Biden\u2019s staff were trying to kill him, while O\u2019Connor was trying to keep him alive.\u201d"

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/proposed-medicaid-cuts-republicans-leave-patients-doctors-fearing-wors-rcna206597",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 23:07:39 GMT",
    "summary": "Republican legislation proposes changes to Medicaid including work requirements, co-pays and tougher eligibility requirements. Doctors and patients worry about the effects.",
    "story": [
      "Melannie Bachman, 39, of Charleston, South Carolina, is among the patients closely watching the sweeping Republican bill to overhaul Medicaid that\u2019s been brought to the House. She was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer \u2014 an aggressive and difficult-to-treat form of the disease \u2014 in 2021. She said she had to apply for Medicaid multiple times and wasn\u2019t approved until four months later, which meant she had to pay for multiple screenings while waiting.",
      "Bachman no longer qualifies for Medicaid because she's cancer-free. But she worries that the proposed revisions could make it harder for her or others in similar situations to get covered again, or even cause them to give up on the process altogether.",
      "Bachman is still within five years of her diagnosis, and her doctors tell her that it\u2019s essential for her to continue being monitored in case the cancer returns.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the hardest parts of this journey, besides fighting for your life,\u201d Bachman said of applying for Medicaid. \u201cThe application process, the figuring how and when to find coverage, being someone who had no coverage at all.\u201d",
      "As House Republicans on Tuesday haggled over parts of a bill that proposes deep cuts and new restrictions on Medicaid, patients and doctors who rely on the program said they\u2019re bracing for the worst,\u00a0including overwhelming red tape and administrative hurdles that could prevent many people from getting the care they need.",
      "The legislation, introduced Sunday by the Energy and Commerce Committee, proposes a slew of changes to the health program, such as work requirements, patient co-pays for doctor visits, tougher eligibility checks and citizenship verification. The panel began marking it up Tuesday and hopes to send it to the full House this week, with the goal of passing the entire bill by Memorial Day.",
      "The legislation could lead to 8.6 million people losing Medicaid coverage, according to a preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. More than 70 million people currently get health coverage through the program.",
      "The changes would make some people ineligible for coverage due to work requirements. Certain groups, such as the disabled, pregnant women and people who are in prison or rehabilitation centers, would be exempt.",
      "Others \u2014 particularly those covered under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion \u2014 could be forced to drop out as they face higher fees and additional paperwork to maintain their coverage.",
      "Republicans say they\u2019re fine with the new rules \u2014 including Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has publicly and repeatedly warned his party not to slash Medicaid benefits.",
      "\u201cBased on the work requirement, anti-fraud provisions \u2014 there\u2019s going to be coverage losses associated with that, which I\u2019m OK with,\u201d Hawley told NBC News. Republicans are proposing cutting spending to states that allow immigrants without proof of citizenship to be on Medicaid.",
      "\u201cBut for people who are otherwise qualified, who are able bodied and are working and need Medicaid because they cannot otherwise afford health insurance, I just am opposed to cutting these people\u2019s benefits,\u201d he said.",
      "Asked if he worries the red tape could end up removing rightful Medicaid recipients from coverage, Hawley downplayed the prospect saying his priority is \u201cjust no benefit cuts.\u201d",
      "The Medicaid provisions are expected to save the government over $715 billion over 10 years, which Republicans intend to use to pay for an extension of President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts before they expire at the end of this year.",
      "Democrats argue the added bureaucracy is a feature \u2014 not a bug \u2014 of the GOP plan.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the ranking member of the Finance Committee that oversees Medicaid, said Republicans want to throw people off the program by putting recipients through \u201cbureaucratic water torture\u201d that many won\u2019t be able to navigate.",
      "\u201cThis whole thicket of red tape bureaucracy is being deployed in order to keep people who are eligible from getting covered,\u201d Wyden said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019d be one thing if they had found a pattern of fraud and abuse, and they were trying to root it out. But what they\u2019re doing is they are targeting eligible people who are eligible for Medicaid now.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really a despicable thing,\u201d he said.",
      "The bill, as it stood before Tuesday\u2019s markup, did leave out some of the more controversial ideas Republican leaders had discussed \u2014 including limits on how much Medicaid can spend per person and making states pay more for expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion, for which the federal government currently pays 90%.",
      "Dr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician and\u202fassistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the proposed changes to eligibility, even the possibility of additional paperwork, will cause people to fall through the cracks and lose their coverage.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a doctor to realize that this is dangerous,\u201d Gaffney said. \u201cIf you\u2019re facing multiple medical problems, the last thing you need to do is try to get through a lot of red tape and jump through hoops and bureaucracy, and that\u2019s exactly what this legislation would do.\u201d",
      "People who want to work may not be able to because of health issues, lack of childcare or limited transportation options.",
      "When people lose coverage, they typically have no other options, Gaffney said. He noted that in the early 2000s, when Tennessee implemented reforms to rein in Medicaid costs, thousands of people lost coverage.",
      "\u201cMost people who lost Medicaid went uninsured,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is Medicaid covers some of the lowest-income folks in the nation, and when they lose coverage, they\u2019re probably not going to be able to afford it.\u201d",
      "Likewise, in Georgia, following the implementation of Medicaid work requirements in 2023, fewer people chose to enroll, said Robin Rudowitz, director of the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at KFF, a health policy research group.",
      "\u201cBasically reporting and having to document that you\u2019re working, or even if you\u2019re a group that might be exempt from the requirements, sometimes it\u2019s just hard to document that you might be in one of those groups,\u201d she said.",
      "Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said the new rules are part of a \u201ccruel\u201d and \u201ccraven\u201d plot.",
      "\u201cAny added bureaucracy will take people who are justifiably using these services and make it more difficult for them to get on, which will result in loss of coverage \u2014 again, for Americans who have sicknesses and illnesses,\u201d Booker said.",
      "Rudowitz said the bill proposes a provision that would require patient co-pays for people with incomes up to 130% to 138% of the federal poverty level\u2014 around $35,000 a year for a family of three. There\u2019s also a provision, she said, that would reduce the amount the federal government gives states if they provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.",
      "If the bill clears the House, it goes to the Senate, where some Republicans are eying changes.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who sits on the Finance Committee, said Republicans must take a close look at the new Medicaid rules and coverage impacts.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re going through now. A lot of that has to do with the semi-annual versus annual affirmation, that sort of stuff. We got a lot of mechanics to work out,\u201d said Tillis, who faces re-election next year in a purple state.",
      "Tillis also said he wants to review how many North Carolinians are among the 8.6 million projected to lose coverage. \u201cIf you look at that distribution across the country, it probably means sizable numbers in North Carolina,\u201d he said. \u201cThis false narrative that we\u2019re going to pick up that bill and pass it as proposed \u2014 we got a lot of work to do.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay \u2014 Former Uruguayan President\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Mujica, a onetime Marxist guerilla and flower farmer whose radical brand of democracy, plain-spoken philosophy and simple lifestyle fascinated people around the world, has died. He was 89.",
      "Uruguay\u2019s left-wing president, Yamand\u00fa Orsi, announced his death, which came four months after Mujica\u00a0decided to forgo further medical treatment\u00a0for esophageal cancer and enter hospice care at his three-room ranch house on the outskirts of Montevideo, Uruguay\u2019s capital.",
      "\u201cPresident, activist, guide and leader,\u201d Orsi wrote of his longtime political mentor on social media. \u201cWe will miss you greatly, dear old man. Thank you for everything you gave us and for your profound love for your people.\u201d",
      "Mujica had been under treatment for cancer of the esophagus since spring 2024,\u00a0when the affliction was diagnosed. His doctor reported that radiation had succeeded in eliminating much of the tumor, but Mujica\u2019s autoimmune disease complicated his recovery. In January, Mujica\u2019s doctor announced that the cancer in his esophagus had returned and spread to his liver.",
      "A colorful history and simple philosophy",
      "As leader of a violent leftist guerrilla group in the 1960s known as the Tupamaros, Mujica robbed banks, planted bombs and abducted businessmen and politicians on Montevideo\u2019s streets in hopes of provoking a popular uprising that would lead to a Cuban-style socialist Uruguay.",
      "A brutal counterinsurgency and ensuing right-wing military dictatorship that ruled Uruguay between 1973 and 1985 sent him to prison for nearly 15 years, 10 of which he spent in solitary confinement.",
      "During his\u00a02010-2015 presidency, Mujica, widely known as \u201cPepe,\u201d oversaw the transformation of his small South American nation into one of the world\u2019s healthiest and most socially liberal democracies. He earned admiration at home and cult status abroad for\u00a0legalizing marijuana\u00a0and same-sex marriage, enacting the region\u2019s first sweeping abortion rights law and establishing Uruguay as a leader in alternative energy.",
      "Through his remarkable political journey, Mujica captivated audiences with his humble tone, austere lifestyle and ideological earnestness.",
      "Shunning the pomp and circumstance of the presidency, he drove a beat-up 1987 Volkswagen Beetle, wore rumpled cardigan sweaters and leather sandals with black socks and lived in a tiny tin-roof house outside Montevideo, where for decades he tended to chrysanthemums for sale in local markets.",
      "\u201cThis is the tragedy of life, on the one hand it\u2019s beautiful, but it ends,\u201d Mujica\u00a0told The Associated Press from his farmhouse in an October 2023 interview. \u201cTherefore, paradise is here. As is hell.\u201d",
      "Tributes poured in from presidents, world leaders and ordinary people from around the world. The first to share remembrances were allied leaders who recalled not only Mujica\u2019s accomplishments but also his hallowed status as one of the last surviving lions of the now-receding Latin American left that peaked when he assumed office two decades ago.",
      "Colombian\u00a0President Gustavo Petro\u00a0praised Mujica as a \u201cgreat revolutionary.\u201d Bolivia\u2019s former socialist president, Evo Morales, said that he \u201cand all of Latin America\u201d are in mourning. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called Mujica \u201can example for Latin America and the entire world.\u201d",
      "From robbing banks to running Uruguay",
      "Mujica never attended university and didn\u2019t finish high school. But politics piqued his interest as early as adolescence, when the young flower farmer joined the progressive wing of the conservative National Party, one of the two main parties in Uruguay. His dramatic pivot to urban guerrilla warfare came in the 1960s, as leftist struggles swept the region in the wake of the Cuban Revolution.",
      "He and other student and labor radicals launched the Tupamaros National Liberation Movement, which quickly gained notoriety for its brazen Robin Hood-style exploits aimed at installing a revolutionary government.",
      "By 1970 the government cracked down, and the Tupamaros responded with violence, planting bombs in well-heeled districts and attacking casinos and other targets, ultimately killing more than 30 people.",
      "Mujica was shot six times in a firefight with police in a bar. He helped stage a legendary prison break and twice escaped custody. But in 1973 the military seized power, unleashing a reign of state terror upon the population that resulted in the forced disappearance of some 200 Uruguayans and the imprisonment of thousands.",
      "During his time in prison, he endured torture and long stretches in solitary confinement, often in a hole in the ground.",
      "After power returned to civilians in 1985, Mujica emerged from prison under an amnesty that covered the crimes of the dictators and their guerrilla opponents. He entered mainstream politics with the Broad Front, a coalition of radical leftists and more centrist social democrats.",
      "Elected to Parliament in 1995, he astonished parking attendants and the general public by arriving to work on a moped with ragged jeans and an unkempt beard.",
      "Rapidly rising through the party ranks, Mujica charmed the country with his low-key way of living and penchant for speaking his mind.",
      "In 2005 he was named Minister of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries. He held that post until 2008, when the Broad Front chose him as their presidential candidate. A year later, he was elected Uruguay\u2019s 40th president with 52% of the vote, capping an extraordinary political transformation.",
      "His wife,\u00a0Luc\u00eda Topolansky, a former co-revolutionary guerrilla member who was also imprisoned before becoming a prominent politician, bestowed the presidential sash on Mujica at his inauguration \u2014 as is custom for the senator who had received the most votes. They married in 2005 and had no children.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been with him for over 40 years, and I\u2019ll be with him until the end,\u201d she told a local radio station Sunday as Mujica\u2019s condition worsened.",
      "A folksy president who fascinated the world",
      "Pepe\u2019s bracingly modest and spontaneous style \u2014 delivering presidential announcements in sandals, distributing pamphlets in the streets against machismo culture, lunching in Montevideo bars \u2014 made him a populist folk hero and token of global fascination.",
      "\u201cThey made me look like a poor president, but they are the poor ones ... if you have to live in that government house with four floors just to have tea,\u201d he told the AP.",
      "As president, he presided over a period of comfortable economic growth, rising wages and falling poverty. In speeches, he pushed Uruguayans to reject consumerism and embrace their nation\u2019s tradition of simplicity.",
      "Under his watch, the small nation became known worldwide for the strength of its institutions and the civility of its politics \u2014 rare features most recently on display\u00a0during Uruguay\u2019s 2024 presidential vote\u00a0that vaulted\u00a0Orsi, Mujica\u2019s moderate prot\u00e9g\u00e9, to power\u00a0over the conservative incumbent.",
      "Mujica\u2019s greatest innovations came on social issues. During his tenure, Uruguay became the first country in South America to legalize abortion for the first trimester and the first in the world to legalize the production, distribution and sale of marijuana. His government also legalized same-sex marriage, burnishing Uruguay\u2019s progressive image in the predominantly Catholic region.",
      "Mujica\u2019s government also powered a green energy revolution in Uruguay. Today Uruguay is considered among the world\u2019s most environmentally friendly nations, generating 98% of its electricity from biomass, solar and wind energy.",
      "His tenure was also not without controversy. The opposition complained of rising crime and a\u00a0swollen fiscal deficit\u00a0on his watch that forced his successor to raise taxes.",
      "Some world leaders disapproved of his disdain for the established order. Conservative Uruguayans voiced outrage over his progressive policies.",
      "Still, Mujica ended his tenure with a 60% approval rating. Ineligible to seek re-election because of the constitution\u2019s ban on consecutive terms, he continued to wield considerable influence as an elected senator.",
      "Despite his stardom as regional trailblazer and global sage, his humility defined him until the end.",
      "\u201cThey ask you: \u2018How do you want to be remembered?\u2019 Vanity of vanities!\u201d he exclaimed in his interview with the AP. \u201cMemory is a historical thing. ... Years go by. Not even the dust remains.\u201d"

      "Casandra Ventura, the R&B singer and model whose explosive civil lawsuit set the stage for this federal trial, took the stand today. Ventura, visibly pregnant and soft-spoken, testified in wrenching and graphic terms about the alleged abuse during her 10-year on-and-off relationship with Diddy, who has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and racketeering charges.",
      "Ventura, who is expected to testify for days, told jurors about \u201cviolent arguments\u201d that escalated into ferocious attacks. \u201cHe would mash my head, knock me over, drag me, kick me,\u201d Ventura told the panel of eight men and four women. She characterized Diddy as a mercurial and sometimes \u201cscary\u201d figure who \u201ccontrolled a lot of my life.\u201d",
      "She described Diddy\u2019s constant demand for drug-fueled marathon sexual encounters known as \u201cfreak offs.\u201d She said that her \u201cstomach churned\u201d the first time he asked her to have sex with another man while he watched. In the years after, \u201cthe freak offs became a job, and there was no space to do anything else. \u2026 They would be 36, 48, 72 hours. The longest one was four days.\u201d",
      "The \u201cfreak offs\u201d left her feeling \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201chumiliated,\u201d she said, fighting back tears. She said she took drugs like ecstasy to create a \u201cbuffer\u201d so she could \u201cdisassociate.\u201d Diddy seemed to become another person altogether during the highly choreographed sex sessions. \u201cHis eyes would go black,\u201d she said. \u201cThe version I knew of him was no longer there.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what else you need to know:",
      "Teny Geragos, one of Diddy\u2019s lawyers, asked Judge Arun Subramanian to keep Ventura\u2019s husband, Alex Fine, out of the courtroom during her testimony because he could be called as a witness. Subramanian allowed Fine to stay until Ventura starts testifying about her allegation that Diddy raped her in 2018.In the courthouse\u2019s overflow viewing room, a woman expressed concern that Ventura was being asked to testify about the \u201cfreak offs\u201d while she was pregnant. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting,\u201d the woman said. She left the room after a U.S. marshal told her to conduct herself as she would in the actual courtroom.Daniel Phillip \u2014 a male escort who testified that he was paid to have sex with Ventura while Diddy directed, watched and masturbated \u2014 returned to the stand this morning for cross-examination by Xavier R. Donaldson, one of the defense lawyers. Phillip told jurors he witnessed Diddy physically assault Ventura.",

Donaldson, one of the defense lawyers. Phillip told jurors he witnessed Diddy physically assault Ventura.",
      "The view from inside",
      "The courtroom was gripped by Ventura\u2019s presence from the minute she walked in, wearing a form-fitting, long-sleeved brown dress that showed off her pregnancy. Diddy leaned back in his seat and watched her intently as she recounted years of alleged abuse at his hands in stark, explicit language. She frequently took deep breaths or dabbed her eyes with a tissue while answering questions. She wept as she talked about the emotional toll of trying to keep Diddy happy and avoid one of his rages.",
      "Diddy, for his part, arrived this morning in what appeared to be the same outfit he wore yesterday: a cream-colored sweater, white button-down shirt and slacks. Diddy\u2019s family \u2014 including his mother, Janice Combs \u2014 showed up in court again today. At one point, Diddy looked back at his relatives and made a heart symbol with his hands.",
      "Analysis: The key part of Ventura\u2019s testimony",
      "Ventura\u2019s testimony about \u201cfreak offs\u201d and Diddy\u2019s alleged sexual abuse was both dramatic and scandalous \u2014 but her testimony on other topics is likely more crucial for the government\u2019s case.",
      "Ventura also testified about the hiring of an escort and \u201cperforming\u201d at Diddy\u2019s direction. The escort testimony is key to the government\u2019s sex trafficking and interstate prostitution charges, and it\u2019s important for the racketeering charge too. In fact, a lot of Ventura\u2019s testimony is just devastating for Diddy \u2014 but it\u2019s not as critical to the elements of the alleged crimes as other testimony from other witnesses.",
      "For example, to prove that Diddy violated the Mann Act, the government can meet its burden by calling an unnamed escort to testify he was paid for sex, and that interstate travel was involved. The Mann Act charge requires interstate travel plus prostitution \u2014 and that\u2019s it. In that sense, Ventura may be the prosecution\u2019s star witness, but she is probably not the most essential for its case.",

      "The \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d alum\u2019s post was the first he had uploaded since Dec. 10. At the time, he promoted \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d arriving on Netflix and shared a video of him talking about why the adaptation was meaningful. He also included behind-the-scenes footage of the cast and crew making the movie on set.",
      "Since he shared that clip, Justin Baldoni has been involved in an ongoing legal dispute with Lively, his \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d co-star.",

In response to her claims, Justin Baldoni\u2019s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, sent a statement to TODAY.com referring to the accusations as \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "About a week later, on Dec. 31, Lively filed a federal lawsuit against the actor and his production company, Wayfarer Studios. In the lawsuit, she alleged that there was a \u201cretaliatory campaign Wayfarer launched against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns,\u201d her attorney said in a statement shared with NBC News. She also named producer Jamey Heath, crisis communications representative Melissa Nathan and publicist Jennifer Abel in the lawsuit.",

      "\u201cWhat I can say without going too into it is that this year has been full of the highest highs and the lowest lows of my life. I see so many women around afraid to speak, afraid to share their experiences. Fear is by design. It\u2019s what keeps us silent,\u201d Lively shared.",
      "She added, \u201cI acknowledge that many people don\u2019t have the opportunity to speak. I feel fortunate that I have been able to. It\u2019s the women who have had the ability to use their voice that have kept me strong and have helped me in my fight to make the world safer for women and girls. It\u2019s a pretty simple thing.\u201d",
      "In addition to attending Hollywood events, she has also remained active on Instagram, sharing multiple posts about \u201cAnother Simple Favor.\u201d",

      "The organizers of four of the United Kingdom\u2019s largest LGBTQ Pride marches have banded together to suspend political party participation in their annual events in support of the country\u2019s transgender community.",
      "\u201cAt a time when trans rights in the UK are under growing attack, our resolve has never been stronger: we will not allow progress to be undone,\u201d the statement issued Monday by Birmingham Pride, Brighton Pride, Manchester Pride and Pride in London said. \u201cWe will not stand by as the dignity, safety, and humanity of our trans siblings are debated, delayed, or denied.\u201d",
      "Political parties are often represented at Pride marches in the U.K. For example, the current prime minister, Keir Starmer, attended London Pride in 2022 when he was leader of the Labour Party. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a member of the Conservative Party, also attended Pride marches in a political capacity in 2010 and 2011.",
      "The joint decision to prohibit political party participation at these major Pride events follows a ruling last month by the U.K. Supreme Court to exclude transgender women from the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d in the Equality Act, a 2010 law that legally prohibits discrimination based on certain protected characteristics.",
      "The ruling stemmed from a legal dispute that began in 2018 when the Scottish Parliament passed a law seeking to increase the number of women on public sector boards. The law, to the dismay of some women's rights activists, included transgender women in its definition of women.",
      "Last month's court ruling, according to the four Pride groups, \u201cunderscores the urgent need for immediate action.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn this moment, we choose to stand firmer, louder, and prouder in demanding change that protects and uplifts trans lives,\u201d the statement said.",
      "In a statement shared on X, the LGBT+ Lib Dems, an arm of the Liberal Democrats party, said they are \u201csickened to our core\u201d by the blanket suspension on political parties. The group said the Liberal Democrats \u201chave been at the forefront of campaigning for LGBT+ rights\u201d and have earned the right to be present at Pride marches.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to a constructive dialogue with Pride organisers so we can come back bigger and better, while those parties who pander to bigotry and hatred can be left in the past, where they belong,\u201d the statement continued.",
      "In an email to NBC News, Albie Amankona, a spokesperson for LGBT+ Conservatives, called the decision \"disappointing.\"",
      "\"While we regret this decision, our members look forward\u00a0to attending in a personal capacity with pride in who we are and what we stand for,\" he said.",
      "The four Pride groups, in their joint statement, added that the rollback of trans rights in the U.K. is part of a \u201cdisturbing global trend,\u201d citing the banning of Pride events in Hungary and the proliferation of anti-trans legislation in the United States.",
      "So far this year, 575 anti-LGBTQ state bills have been proposed across the U.S., many of them targeting transgender rights, according to a tally by the American Civil Liberties Union. And on the federal level, the Trump administration has made trans issues a priority. In his first weeks in office, President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders targeting trans rights, including one stating the U.S. government would recognize only two unchangeable sexes and another barring trans people from military service."

      "\u201cNobody does drama like the one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church,\u201d said Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, shortly after emerging from the conclave that elected Pope Leo XIV on Thursday.",
      "The quick decision, made some 33 hours after the Sistine Chapel\u2019s doors closed and the cardinals went into sequestration, was a sign that they likely entered the conclave with enough unity around the decision to continue Francis\u2019 legacy that they did not have to spend days tussling over a new direction for the Vatican.",
      "In the weeks ahead of the conclave, Cardinal Joseph Tobin, archbishop of Newark, said in a joint press conference with five other American cardinals on Friday. \u201cWe listened to each other. What does the church need? What does the world need? What are we hoping for? What are we dreaming about?\u201d",
      "Leo, previously Cardinal Robert Prevost, a U.S. native with Peruvian citizenship and deep ties to Latin America, is described by the Vatican as the \u201csecond pope from the Americas,\u201d to Francis\u2019 first. He is known to have been close to the late pontiff, both in their daily dealings at the Vatican and ideologically.",
      "Like Francis, Leo is known for his concern for the poor and marginalized, and in his first Sunday blessing as pope, quoted Francis and called for ceasefires in Ukraine and Gaza, the subjects of Francis\u2019 final message to the world.",
      "The conclave is shrouded in secrecy, and many of the dealings that lead up to it remain in the shadows, but since the end of the conclave some cardinals have offered glimpses into what happened in the hours that led up to Leo\u2019s election.",
      "Once the Sistine Chapel\u2019s doors close, the cardinals swear an oath of \u201cabsolute and perpetual secrecy,\u201d as do all\u00a0Vatican\u00a0staff assisting them, including cooks, cleaners and drivers. Mobile phones are confiscated, an ancient reason for a digital detox that at least one cardinal, Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, appreciated for giving him \u201cmore time on my hands just to be prayerful, just to reflect, just to be still, rather than being constantly agitated,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "On the first evening, the cardinals cast their first-round votes, but black smoke billowed from the chimney, meaning no pope was chosen.",
      "The cardinals adjourned for the night to Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse were most of them were staying \u2014 and eating. Cardinal Wilton Gregory said that \u201ca lot of dialogue occurred at mealtime, coffee breaks, those moments when you can engage in smaller groups.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only method is the human method, to get to talk to another, the dialogue, to listen to one another,\u201d Cardinal Robert McElroy, archbishop of Washington, said about the conversations that eventually lead to the two-thirds majority required to elect a pope.",
      "The next morning, the cardinals returned to the Sistine Chapel and two more ballots were cast, but black smoke emerged once again.",
      "\u201cVoting is like watching a glacier move, but sometimes glaciers under stress move a lot faster,\u201d Tobin said.",
      "Despite wide speculation on papabili in the wake of Francis\u2019 death, once the conclave began, we don\u2019t know who the other front-runners were, or why they fell behind. But Dolan told CNN that Prevost\u2019s name had begun to emerge from relative obscurity even before the conclave began. And he continued to confer with his brother cardinals into the conclave.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that he stood up and made this overwhelmingly convincing speech that just wowed,\u201d said Gregory. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any particular intervention, but I do believe he engaged quite effectively in the smaller group conversations.\u201d",
      "And while conclaves in centuries past could stretch for weeks, Prevost\u2019s election began to take shape on the second day.",
      "Or as Gregory framed it: \u201cThere was a great movement on the second day, a great movement within the body that was there and there could be nothing other than the grace of God moving us toward this consensus.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I experience is that everything begins in politics and finishes mystic,\u201d added McElroy.",
      "Tobin recalled the moment after casting his vote. \u201cI walked back and I took a look at Bob, and because his name had been floating around, and he had his head in his hands,\u201d he said. \u201cI was praying for him, because I couldn\u2019t imagine what happens to a human being when you\u2019re facing something like that.\u201d",
      "During a press conference on Saturday, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, himself considered one of the leading candidates for pope, said he was seated next to Prevost.",
      "In the minutes after his election, when the new pope was gasping for air as the weight of his new role descended on him, Tagle said he asked him if he wanted a piece of candy. Prevost accepted and Tagle pulled one from a pocket beneath his cardinal\u2019s robe. \u201cThat\u2019s my first act of charity,\u201d he said he told Prevost jokingly, \u201cfor our new Holy Father.\u201d",
      "Soon after, Prevost emerged on the balcony of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica as Pope Leo XIV, proof of an efficient and successful conclave.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t our first rodeo,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this 268 times.\u201d"

    "summary": "Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel are \"worried about any deal\" President Trump might strike with Iran, one source told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0When President Donald Trump took office in January, he and Israeli Prime\u00a0Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were closely aligned on how to approach the most pressing issues in their relationship: the war in Gaza and aggression from Iran.",
      "Trump lifted a hold the Biden administration had put on sending large bombs to Israel. He encouraged Israeli military operations \u201cto finish the job\u201d against Hamas in Gaza. He agreed with Netanyahu on confronting Iran and its proxy groups in the region.",
      "But in recent weeks, the relationship between Trump and Netanyahu has become strained as the two leaders are increasingly at odds over a strategy for tackling these challenges now that Hamas has been significantly degraded and Iran weakened, according to two U.S. officials, two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions.",
      "Where Netanyahu sees an opportunity to finally take out Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, Trump sees an opportunity to remove the threat of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon by making a deal. As Israel hits Gaza with a new military offensive, Trump is pushing for a ceasefire and looking to implement his postwar plan for rebuilding the area into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d And after Trump halted the U.S. military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthi militant group, a shocked Netanyahu said Israel would then defend itself.",
      "The recent differences between the two leaders on key strategies and positions has put Trump\u2019s relationship with one of America\u2019s closest allies at a bit of a crossroads. How they navigate their disagreements going forward will shape the outcome of some of the core components of the president\u2019s foreign policy agenda.",
      "Twice in just this past week alone, Trump made public comments that rankled Netanyahu, the two U.S. officials, the\u00a0two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions said.",
      "Netanyahu\u00a0was particularly upset when Trump said Wednesday that\u00a0he had yet to decide\u00a0whether Iran would be allowed to enrich uranium under a new nuclear deal his administration is negotiating, the two U.S. officials said. A top adviser to Netanyahu, Ron Dermer, conveyed that message to Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, during a meeting at the White House on Thursday, according to\u00a0one of the\u00a0U.S. officials.",
      "For his part, Trump has been frustrated with Netanyahu\u2019s decision to begin a new military offensive in Gaza, which the president sees as at odds with his plan for rebuilding there, according to one of the U.S. officials and one of the people familiar with the tensions between the two leaders.",
      "Privately, Trump has said the new Israeli offensive in Gaza is a wasted effort because it will make it harder to rebuild, according to those two sources.",
      "The U.S. is currently pushing Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza, which Dermer was set to discuss with Witkoff during his White House visit this week, according to the Middle Eastern diplomats and a senior Trump administration official.",
      "But\u00a0Trump\u2019s approach to Iran has been the biggest point of contention for Netanyahu.",
      "The Israeli leader has been frustrated for weeks with Trump\u2019s refusal to support military strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities and his decision to instead\u00a0try to reach a deal aimed at blocking Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, according to the two U.S. officials, the\u00a0two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re worried about any deal,\u201d one of the U.S. officials said of the Israelis.",
      "Israel has made clear to the U.S. that it does not want Trump to cut a nuclear deal that leaves Iran with any uranium enrichment capabilities, the U.S. officials and Middle Eastern diplomats said. Trump has expressed an openness to Iran maintaining a civilian nuclear program.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t made that decision yet,\u201d Trump said Wednesday when asked if the U.S. position is that Iran can have a uranium enrichment program for civilian nuclear purposes.",
      "\u201cIsrael has had no better friend in its history than President Trump,\u201d\u00a0James Hewitt, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement responding to this story. \u201cWe continue to work closely with our ally Israel to ensure remaining hostages in Gaza are freed, Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon, and to strengthen regional security in the Middle East. As he has repeatedly stated in his first and second terms, the president is committed to ensuring Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "A third U.S. official said the president\u2019s team has communicated with Israeli officials regularly about the status of negotiations with Iran, providing updates and coordinating on elements of a potential deal.",
      "Netanyahu's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u2018Trump has his own agenda\u2019",
      "Netanyahu was\u00a0blindsided \u2014 and infuriated \u2014\u00a0this past week\u00a0by Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. was halting its military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen after the\u00a0Houthis\u00a0agreed to stop firing on U.S. ships in the Red Sea, according to\u00a0one of the U.S. officials and\u00a0the\u00a0two Middle East diplomats.",
      "The Houthis had just attacked Israel with a missile that hit close to Ben Gurion, Israel\u2019s main airport.",
      "When Netanyahu visited the White House last month, for the second time since Trump took office,\u00a0he hoped\u00a0the president\u00a0would pledge U.S. air support for a possible Israeli operation against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, according to the two Middle Eastern diplomats. The Israeli leader was taken aback when the president instead announced he would agree to direct talks with Tehran, the diplomats said.",
      "Netanyahu has privately said\u00a0he thinks\u00a0Trump\u2019s negotiations with Iran are a waste of time because Tehran will never hold up its end of any deal, according to the two U.S. officials. Israel has argued that Iran is so weakened by economic sanctions and the degradation of its proxies in the region that now is an ideal moment to take out its nuclear facilities, and it is concerned the window for doing so is closing while the U.S. negotiates, the officials said.",
      "Adding to that concern about timing,\u00a0Israeli military strikes\u00a0crippled Iranian strategic air defenses in October,\u00a0meaning manned aircraft conducting new strikes now\u00a0would not be as susceptible to being shot down. But the Iranians are rebuilding their air defenses.",
      "Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham said this week that the only acceptable Iran deal is one that completely stops Tehran from any uranium enrichment. They also urged Trump to submit any Iran nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification, which requires a two-thirds majority vote.",
      "Asked about Cotton and Graham\u2019s comments, a fourth U.S. official said Witkoff is in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with Graham about Iran negotiations and briefed Cotton on them this past week.",
      "The 2015 Iran nuclear deal reached by President Barack Obama was not ratified by the Senate, which allowed Trump to simply withdraw the U.S. from the agreement during his first term.",
      "\u201cI think what you\u2019re seeing is the Israelis recognizing that as much as they welcomed the election of President Trump and thought that would really give them a blank check to pursue whatever agenda they wanted, Trump has his own agenda,\u201d Frank Lowenstein,\u00a0a former Middle East envoy under the Obama administration,\u00a0said during a virtual briefing organized by J Street, an advocacy organization that describes itself as pro-Israel and pro-peace.",
      "Although Trump\u2019s diplomacy with Iran and the U.S. deal with the Houthis are \u201canathema\u201d to Netanyahu, the prime minister does not have the political leverage in Washington or Israel to enter into a direct confrontation with Trump, who is popular with\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s\u00a0base in Israel, said Ilan Goldenberg, who worked on Middle East policy\u00a0as a senior official during\u00a0the Biden and Obama administrations.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cwhole political strategy and survival strategy is based on holding his coalition and holding his political base together,\u201d Goldenberg said in the briefing organized by J Street. \u201cAnd those folks love Trump, so for him to go very publicly against Trump is something he really can\u2019t do.\u201d",
      "The strain\u00a0in\u00a0the relationship between\u00a0Trump and\u00a0Netanyahu comes as the president is set\u00a0to\u00a0travel to the Middle East next week, with stops\u00a0scheduled\u00a0in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Trump\u00a0is not currently scheduled\u00a0to visit Israel\u00a0on this trip, though he did during his first term.",
      "Witkoff also\u00a0planned to\u00a0attend another round of negotiations with Iran this weekend in Oman."

      "DABIQ, Syria \u2014 On the outskirts of a remote village in Syria, the hunt is on for the remains of American hostages murdered by ISIS more than a decade ago.",
      "The site, a dusty hill about a two hour\u2019s drive from the city of Aleppo, looks like an archeological dig, with dozens of investigators wielding shovels, ground-penetrating radar, pickaxes and paintbrushes for the delicate work of brushing away sand as they search for bones, clothing and any evidence that ISIS terrorists may have buried their victims here.",
      "It has taken years of intelligence work to reach this point, including satellite imagery analysis, debriefs with surviving ISIS hostages and jailhouse interviews with ISIS leaders. So far, the team is optimistic. They are finding human remains in shallow graves, and, critically, they are finding them where they were expected to be.",
      "The investigation is led by an intelligence and security company called the Soufan Group, founded by former FBI counterterrorism officer Ali Soufan. His team, mainly composed of former FBI and counterterrorism colleagues, has been working the case on behalf of the American victims\u2019 families. They work in coordination with, but are independent from, the FBI.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been working with the families for a long period of time, trying to figure out what happened to their loved ones. We had an opportunity to go to a location that has been off-limits,\u201d said Soufan."

    "story": [
      "MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay \u2014 Former Uruguayan President\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Mujica, a onetime Marxist guerilla and flower farmer whose radical brand of democracy, plain-spoken philosophy and simple lifestyle fascinated people around the world, has died. He was 89.",
      "Uruguay\u2019s left-wing president, Yamand\u00fa Orsi, announced his death, which came four months after Mujica\u00a0decided to forgo further medical treatment\u00a0for esophageal cancer and enter hospice care at his three-room ranch house on the outskirts of Montevideo, Uruguay\u2019s capital.",
      "\u201cPresident, activist, guide and leader,\u201d Orsi wrote of his longtime political mentor on social media. \u201cWe will miss you greatly, dear old man. Thank you for everything you gave us and for your profound love for your people.\u201d",
      "Mujica had been under treatment for cancer of the esophagus since spring 2024,\u00a0when the affliction was diagnosed. His doctor reported that radiation had succeeded in eliminating much of the tumor, but Mujica\u2019s autoimmune disease complicated his recovery. In January, Mujica\u2019s doctor announced that the cancer in his esophagus had returned and spread to his liver.",
      "A colorful history and simple philosophy",
      "As leader of a violent leftist guerrilla group in the 1960s known as the Tupamaros, Mujica robbed banks, planted bombs and abducted businessmen and politicians on Montevideo\u2019s streets in hopes of provoking a popular uprising that would lead to a Cuban-style socialist Uruguay.",
      "A brutal counterinsurgency and ensuing right-wing military dictatorship that ruled Uruguay between 1973 and 1985 sent him to prison for nearly 15 years, 10 of which he spent in solitary confinement.",
      "During his\u00a02010-2015 presidency, Mujica, widely known as \u201cPepe,\u201d oversaw the transformation of his small South American nation into one of the world\u2019s healthiest and most socially liberal democracies. He earned admiration at home and cult status abroad for\u00a0legalizing marijuana\u00a0and same-sex marriage, enacting the region\u2019s first sweeping abortion rights law and establishing Uruguay as a leader in alternative energy.",
      "Through his remarkable political journey, Mujica captivated audiences with his humble tone, austere lifestyle and ideological earnestness.",
      "Shunning the pomp and circumstance of the presidency, he drove a beat-up 1987 Volkswagen Beetle, wore rumpled cardigan sweaters and leather sandals with black socks and lived in a tiny tin-roof house outside Montevideo, where for decades he tended to chrysanthemums for sale in local markets.",
      "\u201cThis is the tragedy of life, on the one hand it\u2019s beautiful, but it ends,\u201d Mujica\u00a0told The Associated Press from his farmhouse in an October 2023 interview. \u201cTherefore, paradise is here. As is hell.\u201d",
      "Tributes poured in from presidents, world leaders and ordinary people from around the world. The first to share remembrances were allied leaders who recalled not only Mujica\u2019s accomplishments but also his hallowed status as one of the last surviving lions of the now-receding Latin American left that peaked when he assumed office two decades ago.",
      "Colombian\u00a0President Gustavo Petro\u00a0praised Mujica as a \u201cgreat revolutionary.\u201d Bolivia\u2019s former socialist president, Evo Morales, said that he \u201cand all of Latin America\u201d are in mourning. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called Mujica \u201can example for Latin America and the entire world.\u201d",
      "From robbing banks to running Uruguay",
      "Mujica never attended university and didn\u2019t finish high school. But politics piqued his interest as early as adolescence, when the young flower farmer joined the progressive wing of the conservative National Party, one of the two main parties in Uruguay. His dramatic pivot to urban guerrilla warfare came in the 1960s, as leftist struggles swept the region in the wake of the Cuban Revolution.",
      "He and other student and labor radicals launched the Tupamaros National Liberation Movement, which quickly gained notoriety for its brazen Robin Hood-style exploits aimed at installing a revolutionary government.",
      "By 1970 the government cracked down, and the Tupamaros responded with violence, planting bombs in well-heeled districts and attacking casinos and other targets, ultimately killing more than 30 people.",
      "Mujica was shot six times in a firefight with police in a bar. He helped stage a legendary prison break and twice escaped custody. But in 1973 the military seized power, unleashing a reign of state terror upon the population that resulted in the forced disappearance of some 200 Uruguayans and the imprisonment of thousands.",
      "During his time in prison, he endured torture and long stretches in solitary confinement, often in a hole in the ground.",
      "After power returned to civilians in 1985, Mujica emerged from prison under an amnesty that covered the crimes of the dictators and their guerrilla opponents. He entered mainstream politics with the Broad Front, a coalition of radical leftists and more centrist social democrats.",
      "Elected to Parliament in 1995, he astonished parking attendants and the general public by arriving to work on a moped with ragged jeans and an unkempt beard.",
      "Rapidly rising through the party ranks, Mujica charmed the country with his low-key way of living and penchant for speaking his mind.",
      "In 2005 he was named Minister of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries. He held that post until 2008, when the Broad Front chose him as their presidential candidate. A year later, he was elected Uruguay\u2019s 40th president with 52% of the vote, capping an extraordinary political transformation.",
      "His wife,\u00a0Luc\u00eda Topolansky, a former co-revolutionary guerrilla member who was also imprisoned before becoming a prominent politician, bestowed the presidential sash on Mujica at his inauguration \u2014 as is custom for the senator who had received the most votes. They married in 2005 and had no children.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been with him for over 40 years, and I\u2019ll be with him until the end,\u201d she told a local radio station Sunday as Mujica\u2019s condition worsened.",
      "A folksy president who fascinated the world",
      "Pepe\u2019s bracingly modest and spontaneous style \u2014 delivering presidential announcements in sandals, distributing pamphlets in the streets against machismo culture, lunching in Montevideo bars \u2014 made him a populist folk hero and token of global fascination.",
      "\u201cThey made me look like a poor president, but they are the poor ones ... if you have to live in that government house with four floors just to have tea,\u201d he told the AP.",
      "As president, he presided over a period of comfortable economic growth, rising wages and falling poverty. In speeches, he pushed Uruguayans to reject consumerism and embrace their nation\u2019s tradition of simplicity.",
      "Under his watch, the small nation became known worldwide for the strength of its institutions and the civility of its politics \u2014 rare features most recently on display\u00a0during Uruguay\u2019s 2024 presidential vote\u00a0that vaulted\u00a0Orsi, Mujica\u2019s moderate prot\u00e9g\u00e9, to power\u00a0over the conservative incumbent.",
      "Mujica\u2019s greatest innovations came on social issues. During his tenure, Uruguay became the first country in South America to legalize abortion for the first trimester and the first in the world to legalize the production, distribution and sale of marijuana. His government also legalized same-sex marriage, burnishing Uruguay\u2019s progressive image in the predominantly Catholic region.",
      "Mujica\u2019s government also powered a green energy revolution in Uruguay. Today Uruguay is considered among the world\u2019s most environmentally friendly nations, generating 98% of its electricity from biomass, solar and wind energy.",
      "His tenure was also not without controversy. The opposition complained of rising crime and a\u00a0swollen fiscal deficit\u00a0on his watch that forced his successor to raise taxes.",
      "Some world leaders disapproved of his disdain for the established order. Conservative Uruguayans voiced outrage over his progressive policies.",
      "Still, Mujica ended his tenure with a 60% approval rating. Ineligible to seek re-election because of the constitution\u2019s ban on consecutive terms, he continued to wield considerable influence as an elected senator.",
      "Despite his stardom as regional trailblazer and global sage, his humility defined him until the end.",
      "\u201cThey ask you: \u2018How do you want to be remembered?\u2019 Vanity of vanities!\u201d he exclaimed in his interview with the AP. \u201cMemory is a historical thing. ... Years go by. Not even the dust remains.\u201d"

      "Trump will meet with Syria's new president in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, an announcement confirmed by the White House shortly before the president began speaking.",
      "In his speech, Trump presented Middle Eastern leaders with a vision of a future steeped in prosperity, business deals and technological advances, which the president treated as an antidote to historic divisions.",
      "His rhetoric stood in contrast to the words of former President Joe Biden, who deemed the kingdom \u201ca pariah\u201d before taking office. Biden struggled to regain diplomatic footing with Saudi leaders during his presidency after confronting bin Salman about the 2018 death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government. During Trump's first term, he maintained friendly relations with the Saudis despite international outrage over Khashoggi's death, which U.S. intelligence officials have said bin Salman approved.",
      "Trump on Tuesday offered an image of rising regional powers steeped in homegrown economic self-development, while holding up his host as a model.",
      "\u201cI stood here envisioning a Middle East that would eradicate terrorism and extremism, rising as one of the world\u2019s proudest, most prosperous and successful regions,\u201d Trump declared to a gathering of the world\u2019s business elite and Saudi leaders at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum. The event, which was held at King Abdulaziz International Conference Center in Riyadh, included members of his Cabinet and adviser Elon Musk, as well as executives from Palantir, Uber, Google, Amazon and more.",
      "Addressing the crown prince directly, Trump asked, \u201cMohammed, do you sleep at night? Or are you up, restless, thinking, \u2018How do I make it even better?\u2019\u201d Earlier, the two leaders signed a landmark $600 billion investment agreement, marking a high point of the day\u2019s ceremonial events.",
      "As Trump offered heavy flattery to his host, he also took aim at his predecessors in Washington, jabbing at listless leaders whom he called \u201cthe ones that don\u2019t toss and turn,\u201d and \u201cthat will never take you to the promised land.\u201d",
      "He said too many American presidents found themselves afflicted by the notion \u201cthat it\u2019s our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use U.S. policy to dispense justice for their sins.\u201d He rejected the idea that U.S. policy should judge foreign leaders\u2019 morals, advocating instead for pragmatic cooperation to drive progress.",
      "And Trump swiped at destructive forces in the region, citing Iran\u2019s leadership as the most damaging of all, causing \u201cunthinkable suffering in Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and beyond\u201d \u2014 even as his administration seeks to strike a deal with Iranian leaders over their nuclear programs.",
      "Applause followed Trump's promise to withdraw sanctions on Syria. But in announcing his \u201cfervent wish\u201d that Saudi Arabia would \u201csoon be joining the Abraham Accords\" \u2014 the diplomatic agreements Trump's first administration made between Israel and several Arab nations \u2014 the president drew silence from the room.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll do it in your own time, and that\u2019s what I want and that\u2019s what you want,\u201d\u00a0he added.",
      "Saudi Arabia has been an elusive target of Washington\u2019s diplomatic ambitions to expand the accords, with Israel\u2019s war in Gaza looming over Biden\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to bring about the normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. The ongoing conflict with Hamas remains a sticking point for Saudi Arabia, which reaffirmed its support for a Palestinian state in recent months.",
      "Trump showcased his transactional approach to diplomacy even before departing Washington by defending a proposed gift from Qatar of a luxury airplane. He described it as a \u201ccontribution\u201d that the U.S. should accept, stating, \u201cI would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I mean, I could be a stupid person and say, \u2018No, we don\u2019t want a free, very expensive airplane.\u2019 But it was, I thought it was a great gesture.\u201d",
      "It was not just Trump seeking opportunities for deals on his royal tour of the Middle East. American business leaders are also looking to broker ties with wealthy Saudi Arabian investors. One conference attendee characterized the mood as a hub of excitement and positive engagement.",
      "This dynamic was on display during ceremonial events at the opulent Royal Court on Tuesday as the crown prince and Trump greeted, with handshakes and small talk, everyone from Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, and Sam Altman of OpenAI, to billionaire Blackrock co-founder Larry Fink and the leaders of bluechip companies like as Amazon and Coca Cola.",
      "The executives were in Riyadh to pitch deep-pocketed Saudi investors as the kingdom promises to spend on technology, infrastructure and more. Financed through sovereign wealth, the kingdom\u2019s Public Investment Fund offers a major kickstart for businesses expanding in the region. It was also an opportunity to engage with Trump directly as CEOs wrestle with the outcome of the president's sweeping tariffs.",

      "During an earlier meeting with MBS, Trump emphasized the opportunity for the long line of American business leaders to walk away with a lot of checks. \u201cI like visiting with you,\u201d Trump added. \u201cI really believe we like each other a lot.\u201d",
      "And he joked about how Saudi Arabia's promised investments weighed on the decision of which country to visit for his first multistate overseas trip. \u201c$600 billion, knowing you, will be a trillion dollars,\u201d he said, repeating his ask to the kingdom\u00a0to increase its investment in the U.S. by rounding up a promised $600 billion.",
      "Trump secured the $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the U.S., including a multibillion-dollar defense partnership, the White House said in a statement. As part of the arrangement, the White House said, the Saudi Arabian company DataVolt\u00a0plans to invest $20 billion\u00a0in artificial intelligence data centers and other technology, while companies like Google, Salesforce, Uber and Oracle will invest $80 billion in projects across both countries.

      "Two accusers",

      "The other plaintiff, an assistant, said that Depardieu groped her buttocks and her breasts during three separate incidents on the film set.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify by name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to be named. Neither women has done so in this case.",
      "Suspended sentence requested",
      "Paris\u2019 public prosecutor requested that Depardieu be found guilty and given an 18-month suspended prison sentence and a fine of 20,000 euros ($22,200). The prosecutor denounced the actor\u2019s \u201ctotal denial and failure to question himself.\u201d",

      "Depardieu has\u00a0been accused\u00a0publicly or in formal complaints of misconduct by more than 20 women, but so far only the sexual assault case has proceeded to court. Some other cases were dropped because of a lack of evidence or the statute of limitations.",

      "U.S. retailers typically place orders months in advance, giving factories in China enough lead time to manufacture the products and ship them to reach the U.S. ahead of major holidays. The two global superpowers\u2019 sudden doubling of tariffs in early April forced some businesses to halt production,\u00a0raising questions\u00a0about whether supply chains would be able to resume work in time to get products on the shelves for Christmas.",

      "The subsequent tit-for-tat trade spat saw duties skyrocketing over 100% on exports from both countries.",
      "While most of those tariffs have been paused for 90 days under the new deal the U.S. and China announced Monday, the previously imposed tariffs will remain in place.",
      "UBS estimates that the total weighted average U.S. tariff rate on Chinese products now stands around 43.5%, including pre-existing duties imposed in past years.",
      "For running shoes produced in China, the total tariff is now 47%, still well above the 17% level in January, said Tony Post, CEO and founder of Massachusetts-based Topo Athletic. He said his company received some cost reductions from its China factories and suppliers, but still had to raise prices slightly to offset the tariff impact.",
      "\u201cWhile this is good news, we\u2019re still hopeful the two countries can reach an acceptable permanent agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe remain committed to our Chinese suppliers and are relieved, at least for now, that we can continue to work together.\u201d",
      "U.S. retail giant\u00a0Walmart\u00a0declined to confirm the impact of the reduced tariffs on its orders from China.",
      "\u201cWe are encouraged by the progress made over the weekend and will have more to say during our earnings call later this week,\u201d the company said in a statement to CNBC. The U.S. retail giant is set to report quarterly results Thursday.",
      "China\u2019s exports to the U.S.\u00a0fell more than 20% in April\u00a0from a year ago, but overall Chinese exports to the world rose 8.1% during that time, official data showed last week.

      "BAMAKO, Mali \u2014 An attack by a jihadi group in northern Burkina Faso killed more than 100 people, mostly soldiers, an aid worker and local residents said Monday.",
      "The attack on several locations, including a military base and the long besieged strategic town of Djibo, occurred early Sunday, said an aid worker actively involved in dialogues in Burkina Faso\u2019s hard-hit communities. A student from the area said her father was among those killed.",
      "Both individuals spoke to The Associated Press on Monday on the condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisals.",
      "A jihadi group aligned with Al-Qaida known as Jama\u2019at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin, or JNIM, which is active in the Sahel region, claimed responsibility for Sunday\u2019s attack.",
      "Run by a military junta, the landlocked nation of 23 million has been among the worst hit by the security crisis in Africa\u2019s Sahel region, known as the global hot spot for violent extremism. About half of Burkina Faso is outside of government control as a result of the violence that contributed to two coups in 2022. Government security forces have also been accused of extrajudicial killings.",
      "The aid worker, as well as Charlie Werb, an independent analyst focusing on the Sahel, recounted how Sunday\u2019s attack began simultaneously in different locations at 6 a.m. local time on Sunday.",
      "\u201cJNIM fighters attacked eight localities simultaneously to disperse the Burkina Faso air force. The main attack occurred in Djibo, where JNIM fighters first took control of all the town\u2019s entry checkpoints before attacking the military camps, particularly the Special Anti-Terrorist Unit\u2019s camp,\u201d said the aid worker.",
      "Werb, who studied videos posted online, said the attackers spent several hours in the areas without air support from Burkina Faso\u2019s military, unlike similar attacks on Djibo in the past, when security forces have successfully repelled the extremists.",
      "The latest attack shows JNIM\u2019s escalating power and widening reach in Burkina Faso, said Wassim Nasr, a Sahel specialist and senior research fellow at the Soufan Center security think tank. \u201cThe fact that Djibo was targeted confirms the extent of JNIM\u2019s freedom of movement within Burkina Faso.\u201d",
      "Analysts have warned that the junta\u2019s strategy of military escalation, including the mass recruitment of civilians into poorly trained militias, has worsened inter-ethnic tensions."

    "summary": "A Russian spy ring plotted to trade blood diamonds for weapons in Africa and, supply drones to Russia\u2019s military, according to messages shown to a London court.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 A Russian spy ring plotted to trade blood diamonds for weapons in Africa and supply drones to Russia\u2019s military, according to messages shown to a London court that painted their fugitive leader as a wannabe James Bond.",
      "Jan Marsalek \u2014\u00a0who has been named as a key suspect in Germany\u2019s biggest postwar fraud case \u2014 is alleged to have led the team of six Bulgarians who were sentenced Monday at London\u2019s famous Old Bailey courthouse.",
      "When German payment company Wirecard collapsed in 2020, owing creditors almost $4 billion, Marsalek, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, went on the run and an international manhunt was launched for the Austrian national, who remains at large.",
      "Messages revealed in court made it clear he was in Moscow as he referred to meetings with the GRU and the FSB state security service, at their headquarters building known as the Lubyanka, and at a \u201cbonding exercise with the FSB guys at the shooting range.\u201d He even posed for a selfie in Russian military fatigues.",
      "Court documents also showed that, while he was on the run, he directed a ragtag group of amateur operatives: Orlin Roussev, 47; his second-in-command, Biser Dzhambazov, 44; and Ivan Stoyanov, a 33-year-old mixed martial arts fighter known as \u201cThe Rock.\u201d",
      "Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Vanya Gaberova, 30, described by prosecutors as \u201choneytrap\u201d agents, and competitive swimmer Tihomir Ivanov Ivanchev, 39, made up the rest of the ring that carried out activities that, British police said, put lives and national security at risk.",
      "The spies conducted surveillance for the Russians targeting journalists, diplomats and dissidents in Britain, Austria, Spain and Montenegro, and they were paid handsomely for their services, prosecutors said.",
      "Using law enforcement grade devices called \u201cIMSI grabbers,\u201d prosecutors said they targeted the Patch Barracks, a U.S. base in Stuttgart, Germany, where they believed Ukrainian soldiers were being trained to operate Patriot missile air defense batteries. This would have helped Russians to target them when they returned to Ukraine to operate the missile batteries, the court heard.",
      "However, following an investigation by Britain\u2019s MI5 spy service, they were arrested on Feb. 8, 2023, as they prepared to return to Germany with the devices hidden in a second-hand Chrysler.",
      "NBC News has contacted Russia\u2019s Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, known as GU, for comment.",
      "Prosecutors said the unit did not work directly for Russian intelligence and their members were motivated by financial gain. Investigators traced $225,000 but believe at least the same amount was paid in cryptocurrency, they said.",
      "In his sentencing, Judge Justice Hilliard said the large amounts of money paid to the six Bulgarian spies demonstrated the \u201cvalue\u201d of their covert activities to Russia.",
      "\u201cSome of the money would have covered their expenses, but not all,\u201d he said. \u201cThis enabled the defendants to live very comfortably. It must have been thought that what the defendants were doing was of value.\u201d",
      "However, prosecutors said that Roussev led the spy ring from a rundown guesthouse in Great Yarmouth, a seaside town on the east coast of England, where he stashed his huge collection of spy equipment, much of which he had adapted himself.",
      "Roussev pleaded guilty to spying for Russia in November and was sentenced to 10 years and eight months in prison. Dzhambazov was jailed for 10 years and two months and Stoyanov for seven years and seven months.",
      "Ivanova was found guilty in March along with Gaberova and Ivanchev. She was jailed for nine years and eight months. Gaberova and Ivanchev were sentenced to eight years each.",
      "As the sextet awaited sentencing, court documents revealed over 80,000 messages had been recovered from Roussev and Dzhambazov on the encrypted Telegram messaging app, following their arrest on Feb. 8, 2023.",
      "They shed light on the lifestyle of Marsalek in Moscow, revealing he partied with intelligence officers and naked girls, got cosmetic surgery to hide his identity and said he wanted to \u201coutperform James Bond.\u201d",
      "In a bid to show he was \u201cnot an anti-Western ideologue,\u201d Roussev\u2019s defense lawyers introduced messages with Marsalek which, they said, showed their client was \u201cfixing for money\u201d like \u201ceverything else Mr. Roussev does.\u201d",
      "The messages, which were not introduced by prosecutors as part of their Russian espionage allegations, showed the pair discussed a request to help evacuate U.S. and Afghan nationals from Afghanistan during the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from the country in August 2021.",
      "\u201cInteresting request from our (sort of) friends at the CIA,\u201d Marsalek said. \u201cThey urgently need aircraft to fly out contractors from Afghanistan,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know anyone who\u2019s a bit rogue and operates large-scale airplanes?\u201d",
      "The objective was \u201cto evacuate about 1,000 Afghan nationals\u201d and \u201c80 US citizens\u201d to Albania, in a deal he said was agreed between the Albanian and U.S. governments.",
      "Roussev said he would ask his father\u2019s pilot contacts in Africa and Marsalek replied: \u201cAmerica needs you, pax Americana rests on your broad and manly shoulders.\u201d",
      "Roussev later said the flight left Kabul shortly before an ISIS-K terrorist detonated a bomb outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul killing 170 people and 13 American service members.",
      "Defending Roussev in court, King\u2019s Counsel Mark Summers said the request had come via a private company.",
      "The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Prosecutor Alison Morgan said the pair were not acting on a humanitarian basis or at the direct request of the U.S. government.",
      "It remains unclear whether Roussev was successful in ensuring a flight.",
      "Roussev and Marsalek also discussed transporting diamonds in exchange for arms, the messages showed.",
      "In a June 2021 exchange, Marsalek asked whether African diamond sellers wanted guns in exchange or cash. \u201cThey usually buy guns, a lot of them,\u201d noting that he wasn\u2019t sure if rebel forces or the government would benefit from the deal. \u201cAllegedly only government, but who knows, this is Africa,\u201d he said.",
      "Three months earlier, Roussev messaged Marsalek to say he had been approached to supply 886,000 tons of wheat annually to the Cameroon government at a \u201cvery low price\u201d from Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.",
      "Describing it as a \u201cgood deal\u201d considering the volume, he said that weapons and Sputnik COVID vaccines would likely be part of the transaction.\u201d Guns and sputnik = no problem,\u201d Marsalek replied. \u201cCan pretty much organize anything they need except nukes,\u201d he added, with a laughing emoji. \u201cEven the nukes if they pay.\u201d",
      "Other messages offered glimpses of Marsalek\u2019s life in exile and his efforts to stay ahead of authorities, including facial reconstruction.",
      "In May 2021, he wrote: \u201cI\u2019m trying to improve my skills on a few fronts, languages is one of them. In my new role as an international fugitive, I must outperform James Bond.\u201d",
      "Four months later, in September of that year, Marsalek apologized for being out of touch, saying he was \u201cstuck between the mafia, half of Russia\u2019s ambassadors, the GRU, a dozen naked girls and some deep-state guys whose names no one knows who forced me to drink a bottle of gin.\u201d",
      "Months later, he told Roussev he had \u201canother cosmetic surgery, trying to look differently.\u201d",
      "\u201cSleep well, sleep is the best fix for this condition,\u201d Roussev replied."

    "summary": "The U.S. and China said they had agreed to a 90-day pause on most of the tariffs they have imposed on each other since last month.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 The United States and China announced a 90-day pause on most of their recent tariffs on each other, fueling hopes on Wall Street of a cooldown in the trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "The combined U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports will be cut to 30% from 145%, while China\u2019s levies on U.S. imports will fall to 10% from 125%, the countries said early Monday morning.",
      "Officials met in Geneva over the weekend for their first face-to-face talks since President Donald Trump's shock tariff rollout on April 2, when he imposed 84% duties on Chinese imports, adjusted them to to 125% soon afterward, and hiked them further to 145% a day later.",
      "The new 30% rate is the sum of the 20% duty Trump imposed early in his second term over alleged Chinese failures to curb fentanyl flows and the 10% universal tariff he has applied to nearly all foreign imports.",
      "Markets surged on news of the detente. The broad-based S&P 500 was trading 3.1% higher Monday afternoon, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added more than 1,100 points, a roughly 2.7% gain. The tech-focused Nasdaq surged 4.1%.",
      "European indexes posted modest gains Monday. Markets across Asia had upbeat sessions as well ahead of the news, anticipating some kind of trade agreement and also welcoming a ceasefire between India and Pakistan that largely seems to be holding. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index soared on news of the U.S.-China agreement, closing more than 3% higher.",
      "Yet some analysts have urged caution, noting that tariffs remain far higher than before Trump regained office. That suggests many consumer goods \u2014 from cars and groceries to fireworks \u2014 are set to see price hikes. Federal data is set to provide a fresh inflation snapshot on Tuesday morning.",
      "\u201cThe full set of U.S. tariffs would still be considerably higher and broader than expected by markets at the start of the year,\u201d Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note to clients Monday, noting that the 90-day countdown \u201cshould keep uncertainty high for both investors and businesses.\u201d",
      "The U.S.'s effective tariff rate would now be 17.8%, the highest since 1934, which Yale Budget Lab researchers estimated Monday would dent households' annual purchasing power by $2,800.",
      "The United States has a larger goods trade deficit with China than with any other country, and Trump has often accused it of \u201cripping off\u201d the U.S. through unfair trade practices. Unlike other U.S. trading partners, Beijing responded by imposing retaliatory tariffs and other countermeasures that escalated into a dizzying game of one-upmanship.",
      "The dueling import taxes were \u201cthe equivalent of an embargo,\u201d which neither side wanted, said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. \u201cWe do want trade, we want more balanced trade, and I think that both sides are committed to achieving that,\u201d he said.",
      "Bessent, who represented the U.S. in the talks with Beijing along with Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, rejected suggestions that negotiating right away would have been more productive than triggering a tariff spat that caused global financial turmoil, saying that a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d effort to rebalance trade would not have worked.",
      "The U.S. and China now have \u201ca mechanism to avoid the upward tariff pressure,\u201d Bessent told CNBC Monday. \u201cI would imagine that in the next few weeks we will be meeting again to get rolling on a more fulsome agreement,\u201d he added.",
      "Greer noted that separate discussions on fentanyl were \u201con a very positive track.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said the agreement was an  \u201cimportant step\u201d and \u201ccreates favorable conditions for further narrowing differences and deepening cooperation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is hoped that the U.S. will build on the foundation of this meeting, continue to work in the same direction with China\u201d and \u201ccompletely correct its unilateral tariff practices,\u201d a spokesperson said.",
      "Bessent emphasized that the U.S. does not want a broad-based \u201cdecoupling\u201d from China, preferring instead a \u201cstrategic decoupling, because we realized during Covid that efficient supply chains were not secure supply chains,\u201d he told MSNBC. \u201cSo with steel, with semiconductors, with medicines, with a couple of other strategic categories, we are going to have to become self-reliant again.\u201d",
      "Tariff impacts are already being felt across the United States, with  shipping volumes from China falling sharply since early April. Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk said Monday that the 90-day reprieve was \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d that it hoped could \u201ccreate the long-term predictability our customers need.\u201d",
      "The agreement is also good news for small and medium-sized businesses \u201con both sides of the Pacific,\u201d said Tianchen Xu, a Beijing-based economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a financial forecasting service. It should be \u201ca very big relief for struggling small Chinese exporters, some of which have already lost U.S. orders for weeks,\u201d while American buyers are gaining some breathing room over surging costs, he said in emailed comments.",
      "The agreement exceeded expectations and has \u201crekindled global hope,\u201d said Wang Wen, dean of the\u00a0Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. But Xu and Wang both cautioned that many difficult issues remain to be resolved.",
      "\u201cThis situation is a major test of the political wisdom and negotiation capability of the decision-makers in both China and the U.S.,\u201d Wang said.",
      "Ahead of the bilateral talks in Geneva, Trump had expressed willingness to slash tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 80%, saying that level \u201cseems right\u201d but leaving the decision to Bessent.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t get any higher,\u201d Trump told reporters late last week. \u201cIt\u2019s at 145, so we know it\u2019s coming down.\u201d"

      "\u201cAt the end of his remarks, he stood up and he went into the crowd,\u201d Holt said on NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d show. \u201cHe came down several aisles, and eventually came to me, and I asked him I think the question a lot of people have, \u2018What\u2019s the importance of having an American pope?\u2019 And he said to me, \u2018You tell me.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThen he went on to offer an anecdote he had heard that suggests that people are coming back to the church because there is an American pope,\u201d Holt said.",
      "Leo was born on the South Side of Chicago and raised in a suburb called Dolton.",
      "As for whether the pope is coming back to visit his hometown anytime soon, Holt said that seems unlikely. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.",

      "The NBC Nightly News anchor described the unexpected encounter a \u201chighlight-of-the-career type moment for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs he greeted my fellow reporters and me at a gathering of journalists, my first thoughts were that he\u2019s very much a man at ease, and a man who seems very comfortable in his own skin, a man with a self-deprecating sense of humor,\u201d Holt said.",
      "\u201cOften, when top leaders work what we call a rope line and shake hands with people, there\u2019s this pressure to greet as many people as possible and it can feel hurried,\u201d Holt said. \u201cBut he seemed very willing to engage.\u201d",
      "The pontiff spoke with Holt after he made an impassioned plea for peace and expressed solidarity with imprisoned journalists in his first news briefing since becoming pope. Leo called for \u201cthe precious gift of free speech and of the press\u201d to be protected.",
      "Leo, 69, was elected last week as the first pope from the United States.",
      "While the bulk of the\u00a0audience appeared to consist of the legion of journalists who descended on the Vatican from around the world to cover Leo\u2019s selection, Holt said there also appeared to be a few non-reporters in the crowd who brought along babies to be blessed, and that the new pope happily obliged.",
      "There was also somebody who brought over a baseball for Leo to sign. The pontiff\u2019s family says he grew up a fan of the Chicago White Sox."
