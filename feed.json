      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- Chilean authorities said Tuesday they turned six valuable watches stolen from Canadian actor Keanu Reeves \u2014 including an engraved Rolex worth at least $9,500 \u2014 over to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, months after recovering them in a police raid.",
      "The FBI will arrange for their return to Reeves, best known for his roles in action franchises like \u201c The Matrix \u201d and \u201c John Wick.\" Chilean prosecutors told reporters that Reeves had identified the watches as those stolen from his Los Angeles home during a string of high-profile burglaries in December 2023.",
      "The announcement was made as the Trump administration's Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, arrived in the South American country for meetings with Chilean officials about transnational crime, among other issues.",
      "Noem was also the victim of a robbery attributed to a Chilean national residing illegally in the U.S., when her purse was stolen last April at a Washington restaurant.",
      "Reeves' six watches are valued at a total of $125,000, said Marcelo Varas, a police officer from Chile's robbery investigation squad.",

      "In April, police in Chile announced the arrest of 23 citizens over the string of break-ins.",

      "Rahbani, also known as a political provocateur, died Saturday at age 69. The cause of death was not immediately known.",
      "His passing shocked much of the Arab world, which appreciated his satire, unapologetic political critique and avante-garde, jazz-inspired compositions that mirrored the chaos and contradictions of Lebanon throughout its civil war from 1975 until 1990. He also composed some of his mother's most famous songs.",
      "The Rahbani family was a cornerstone in Lebanon's golden era of music theater that today is steeped in idealism and nostalgia in a troubled country.",
      "Top Lebanese political officials and artists paid tribute after the death was announced. Rahbani, a leftist Greek Orthodox, often mocked Lebanon\u2019s sectarian divisions in his work.",
      "Hundreds of people holding roses and photos gathered by Khoury Hospital near Beirut's busy Hamra district, solemnly singing some of his most famous songs and applauding as a vehicle carrying his body left its garage.",

She had not been seen publicly since photos surfaced of her meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, who visited her residence in 2020 to award her France's highest medal of honor.",
      "In recent years, Rahbani also appeared less in the public eye, yet his influence never waned. Younger generations rediscovered his plays online and sampled his music in protest movements. He continued to compose and write, speaking often of his frustration with Lebanon\u2019s political stagnation and decaying public life.",
      "Rahbani is survived by his mother and his sister Reema and brother Hali.",

    "story": [
      "He won a following in the 1950s and \u201960s lampooning marriage, politics, racism.",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Tom Lehrer, the popular song satirist who lampooned marriage, politics, racism and the Cold War, then largely abandoned his music career to return to teaching math at Harvard and other universities, has died. He was 97.",
      "Longtime friend David Herder said Lehrer died Saturday at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He did not specify a cause of death.",
      "Lehrer had remained on the math faculty of the University of California at Santa Cruz well into his late 70s. In 2020, he even turned away from his own copyright, granting the public permission to use his lyrics in any format without any fee in return.",
      "A Harvard prodigy (he had earned a math degree from the institution at age 18), Lehrer soon turned his very sharp mind to old traditions and current events. His songs included \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,\" \"The Old Dope Peddler\" (set to a tune reminiscent of \"The Old Lamplighter\"), \"Be Prepared\" (in which he mocked the Boy Scouts) and \"The Vatican Rag,\" in which Lehrer, an atheist, poked at the rites and ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church. (Sample lyrics: \u201cGet down on your knees, fiddle with your rosaries. Bow your head with great respect, and genuflect, genuflect, genuflect.\u201d)",
      "Accompanying himself on piano, he performed the songs in a colorful style reminiscent of such musical heroes as Gilbert and Sullivan and Stephen Sondheim, the latter a lifelong friend. Lehrer was often likened to such contemporaries as Allen Sherman and Stan Freberg for his comic riffs on culture and politics and he was cited by Randy Newman and \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic among others as an influence.",
      "He mocked the forms of music he didn't like (modern folk songs, rock 'n' roll and modern jazz), laughed at the threat of nuclear annihilation and denounced discrimination.",
      "But he attacked in such an erudite, even polite, manner that almost no one objected.",
      "\"Tom Lehrer is the most brilliant song satirist ever recorded,\" musicologist Barry Hansen once said. Hansen co-produced the 2000 boxed set of Lehrer's songs, \"The Remains of Tom Lehrer,\" and had featured Lehrer's music for decades on his syndicated \"Dr. Demento\" radio show.",
      "Lehrer's body of work was actually quite small, amounting to about three dozen songs.",
      "\"When I got a funny idea for a song, I wrote it. And if I didn't, I didn't,\" Lehrer told The Associated Press in 2000 during a rare interview. \"I wasn't like a real writer who would sit down and put a piece of paper in the typewriter. And when I quit writing, I just quit. ... It wasn't like I had writer's block.\"",
      "He'd gotten into performing accidentally when he began to compose songs in the early 1950s to amuse his friends. Soon he was performing them at coffeehouses around Cambridge, while he remained at Harvard to teach and obtain a master's degree in math.",
      "He cut his first record in 1953, \"Songs by Tom Lehrer,\" which included \"I Wanna Go Back to Dixie,\" lampooning the attitudes of the Old South, and the \"Fight Fiercely, Harvard,\" suggesting how a prissy Harvard blueblood might sing a football fight song.",
      "After a two-year stint in the Army, Lehrer began to perform concerts of his material in venues around the world. In 1959, he released another LP called \"More of Tom Lehrer\" and a live recording called \"An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer,\" nominated for a Grammy for best comedy performance (musical) in 1960.",
      "But around the same time, he largely quit touring and returned to teaching math, though he did some writing and performing on the side.",
      "Lehrer said he was never comfortable appearing in public.",
      "\"I enjoyed it up to a point,\" he told The AP in 2000. \"But to me, going out and performing the concert every night when it was all available on record would be like a novelist going out and reading his novel every night.\"",

      "He began to teach part-time at Santa Cruz in the 1970s, mainly to escape the harsh New England winters.",
      "From time to time, he acknowledged, a student would enroll in one of his classes based on knowledge of his songs.",
      "\"But it's a real math class,\" he said at the time. \"I don't do any funny theorems. So those people go away pretty quickly.\"",

      "\u201cWho they came to see?\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 asks as she performs her 2023 single \u201cMy House\u201d during the Cowboy Carter tour. For many, the answer has been Blue Ivy.",
      "Blue Ivy Carter, the Grammy-winning artist\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, is more present than ever on stage, and fans are impressed by the growth from her first performance years ago to now.",
      "Isabella Kerr, 15, has admired Beyonc\u00e9 for years, but said she attended the Cowboy Carter tour specifically to experience Blue Ivy\u2019s moves in person.",
      "\u201cPeople are saying, \u201cOh, she\u2019s a mini Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d but no, I think she\u2019s the first Blue. Everything about her when she\u2019s on stage is electrifying,\u201d said Kerr.",
      "The Cowboy Carter tour concludes Saturday in Las Vegas. The tour\u2019s 30 previously stops have fans buzzing that Blue Ivy is well on her way to being a next generation powerhouse.",
      "Blue first graced the stage at 11 years old during her mother\u2019s 2023 Renaissance tour, appearing during the legacy-celebrating anthems \u201cMy Power\u201d and \u201cBlack Parade.\u201d Supporters anticipated her performance at each stop.",
      "She performed again during \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 Bowl,\u201d the NFL Christmas Day Halftime Show that was just nominated for four Emmy Awards. She danced alongside the icon as she performed songs from the \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d album for the first time.",
      "\u201cEven the difference between the Renaissance Tour and now, you can tell she\u2019s really grown in her confidence,\u201d said fan and artist Olivia Ellis. \u201cYou can tell she has a different vibe about her.\u201d",
      "On the Cowboy Carter tour, she can almost be mistaken for one of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s professional dancers. She is on stage for nearly every song and has a solo recreating her mother\u2019s choreography from her 2006 \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0-vu\u201d music video, a nod to the undeniable similarities between the two.",
      "Online videos of Blue display professionalism comparable to her mother\u2019s during the Cowboy Carter tour. During a rainy New Jersey stop, she brought out towels to dry her area of the stage before nailing her \u201cAmerica Has a Problem\u201d choreography.",
      "In another unexpected moment during a Chicago show, her earring got caught on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s hair. Blue remained calm, removed the jewelry and motioned to the singer that it was safe in her hand as they both seamlessly continued.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the family business,\u201d said Kinitra D. Brooks, an academic and author of \u201cThe Lemonade Reader,\u201d a collection that explores the nuances of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 visual album, \u201cLemonade.\u201d \u201cShe is literally studying under the best person doing it out there today. Why wouldn\u2019t she take advantage of that opportunity?\u201d",
      "In \u201cRenaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d fans were given a behind-the-scenes look at the decision-making process the first time Blue was allowed to perform. Beyonc\u00e9 expressed how nervous she was about her child being in front of thousands of people made her, revealing she initially said no.",
      "\u201cI did not think it was an appropriate place for an 11-year-old on a stadium stage,\u201d she said in the documentary. \u201cI made a deal with her, and I said, \u2018If you practice and you show your commitment, I\u2019ll let you do one show.\u2019\u201d Blue Ivy fulfilled her end of the deal, and a fan base was formed: the \u201cIvy League.\u201d",
      "Kerr says Blue\u2019s accomplishments inspire her to work harder to achieve her own dreams. \u201cShe worked to be on stage, and look at her now. If I work to what I want to be, I can be killing it like her.\u201d",
      "At last month's Cowboy Carter Paris stop, members of the Beyhive and Ivy League finally got what they had been asking for \u2014 Blue Ivy merchandise. Shirts with the teen\u2019s face and the phrase \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 Blue\u201d plastered on the front were available for purchase.",

      "\u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d is topping the domestic box office charts in its first weekend in theaters",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Marvel\u2019s first family has finally found box office gold. \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps,\u201d the first film about the superheroes made under the guidance of Kevin Feige and the Walt Disney Co., earned $118 million in its first weekend in 4,125 North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "That makes it the fourth biggest opening of the year, behind \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cSuperman,\u201d and the biggest Marvel opening since \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d grossed $211 million out of the gate last summer. Internationally, \u201cFantastic Four\u201d made $100 million from 52 territories, adding up to a $218 million worldwide debut. The numbers were within the range the studio was expecting.",
      "The film arrived in the wake of another big superhero reboot, James Gunn's \u201cSuperman,\u201d which opened three weekends ago and has already crossed $500 million globally. That film, from the other main player in comic book films, DC Studios, took second place with $24.9 million domestically.",
      "The box office success of \u201cFirst Steps\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d means \u201cthe whole notion of superhero fatigue, which has been talked about a lot, can I think be put to rest. I always say it\u2019s bad movie fatigue, not superhero fatigue,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore.",
      "\u201cFirst Steps\u201d is the latest attempt at bringing the superhuman family to the big screen, following lackluster performances for other versions. The film, based on the original Marvel comics, is set during the 1960s in a retro-futuristic world led by the Fantastic Four, a family of astronauts-turned-superhuman from exposure to cosmic rays during a space mission.",
      "The family is made up of Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), who can stretch his body to incredible lengths; Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), who can render herself invisible; Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn), who transforms into a fiery human torch; and Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), who possesses tremendous superhuman strength with his stone-like flesh.",
      "The movie takes place four years after the family gained powers, during which Reed\u2019s inventions have transformed technology, and Sue\u2019s diplomacy has led to global peace.",
      "Both audiences and critics responded positively to the film, which currently has an 88% on Rotten Tomatoes and promising exit poll responses from opening weekend ticket buyers. An estimated 46% of audiences chose to see it on premium screens, including IMAX and other large formats.",
      "The once towering Marvel is working to rebuild audience enthusiasm for its films and characters. Its two previous offerings this year did not reach the cosmic box office heights of \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\" which made over $1.3 billion, or those of the \u201cAvengers\u201d-era. But critically, the films have been on an upswing since the poorly reviewed \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u201d which ultimately grossed $415 million worldwide. \u201cThunderbolts,\" which jumpstarted the summer movie season, was better received critically but financially is capping out at just over $382 million globally.",
      "Like Deadpool and Wolverine, the Fantastic Four characters had been under the banner of 20th Century Fox for years. The studio produced two critically loathed, but decently profitable attempts in the mid-2000s with future Captain America Chris Evans as the Human Torch. In 2015, it tried again (unsuccessfully) with Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller. They got another chance after Disney's $71 billion acquisition of Fox\u2019s entertainment assets in 2019.",
      "The \u201cFantastic Four's\u201d opening weekend results were a little less than some rival studio projections, Dergarabedian said. Nonetheless, the film is expected to carry movie theater earnings well into August.",
      "Holdovers dominated the top 10, but one other newcomer managed to make the chart. The dark romantic comedy \u201cOh, Hi!\u201d earned $1.1 million from 866 screens.",
      "\u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d landed in third place in its fourth weekend with $13 million, followed by \u201cF1\u201d with $6.2 million. The Brad Pitt racing movie also passed $500 million globally. \u201cSmurfs\u201d rounded out the top five with $5.4 million in its second weekend.",

      "The film stars Jared Leto, Jeff Bridges, Greta Lee and Jodie Turner-Smith as the story brings the virtual environment of the Grid, complete with light cylces, into the real world.",
      "Disney showed off several minutes of footage, including a light cycle chase scene in the real world and another in the red-hued Grid. Propelling the onscreen action is a propulsive Nine Inch Nails soundtrack.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fun to see it on the big screen for the first time,\u201d said director Joachim R\u00f8nning.",
      "Disney turned the Hall H panel into a spectacle, with red lasers filling the room and characters in suits with red lights entering the massive hall.",

      "Leto spoke affectionately about the original saying: \u201cThis movie just grabbed a hold of me and took me to a place that I'd never been before. It kind of rattled my imagination and it kind of showed me what was possible in the world.\u201d",
      "He praised Bridges and Steven Lisberger, who created \u201cTron\u201d and directed the 1982 original. Lisberger attended Friday's panel and laid out his case for why the franchise remains relevant.",
      "\u201cMy feeling about \u2018Tron\u2019 is that the most important thing is we kick this technology around artistically before it kicks us around,\u201d Lisberger said.",
      "\u201cI am weary about hearing all the grim news about the future,\u201d he said, and the way he thinks it can be avoided is to \u201cinspire young people what can be done with this technology.\u201d",

      "Hundreds of figures from Hungary's music and cultural community also have signed a petition calling for Kneecap's performance to be cancelled.",

That sparked calls for the rappers\u2019 U.S. visas to be revoked and several Kneecap gigs have since been canceled as a result.",

      "Andre wrapped his tree-trunk arms around the champ and tried to wring the final breaths out of Hogan with a bear hug so tight that more than 90,000 fans in Detroit almost witnessed the final day of Hulkamania.",
      "But, wait!",
      "This was Hulk Hogan.",
      "Wrestling\u2019s biggest star had more late comebacks than fellow 1980s sports stars John Elway or Michael Jordan combined. Hogan had some gas left in the tank, some extra bite in those 24-inch pythons, and hammered away at Andre. One right hand, then another one, and another! Wrestling fans roared as they knew the bad news that was coming for Andre. Hogan fought back \u2014 much as he did against those 1980s baddies out of the Cold War or Iran \u2014 and finally body-slammed Andre the Giant. Hogan hit the hopes and delivered his famous leg drop on Andre\u2019s chest to get the three count.",

      "Why would he?",
      "Hogan had the hulking size, the charisma and catchphrases \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019cha gonna do when Hulkamania runs wild on you?\u201d \u2014 that led the industry out of gyms and regional arenas and into NFL stadiums, like that 1987 night when Hogan beat Andre at the Pontiac Silverdome in WrestleMania III.",
      "\u201cThere he is,\u201d announcer Gorilla Monsoon said, as Hogan played to the crowd, \u201cthe greatest professional athlete in the world today.\u201d",
      "Whether you break out an eye roll or crank up Hogan\u2019s \u201c Real American \u201d anthem to that statement depends, of course, on one\u2019s ability to suspend disbelief. There is no denying, though, just how real Hogan\u2019s impact was on professional wrestling and pop culture in the 1980s. He stood toe-to-toe with Rocky Balboa. He fought side-by-side with Mr. T. He hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and flexed on the cover of Sports Illustrated.",
      "\u201cHe did what he set out to do,\u201d WWE Hall of Famer Sgt. Slaughter said Friday by phone. \u201cHe became the most recognized, not only professional wrestler and sports entertainer in the world, he\u2019s probably top-five of anybody you\u2019d recognize when you saw him.\u201d",
      "WWE has long claimed the paid attendance of WrestleMania III was 93,173, a number some historians claim is as artificially inflated as the chemically-enhanced biceps of that era. What can\u2019t be disputed, when the two had their match in 1988, live on national television, more than 33 million fans tuned in to NBC, still far and away the record for largest viewing audience in American televised wrestling.",
      "Making money and moving merch. That was the real power of Hulkamania.",

      "Here are some of his best moments.",
      "Hogan wasn\u2019t some upstart when he returned to the WWF (now WWE) in late 1983. He tested the waters of Hulkamania in the old American Wrestling Association and made his famous appearance as Thunderlips in \u201cRocky III,\u201d when was beckoned back to WWE and became an instant contender to face the champion, the hated Iron Sheik. Hogan broke out of the dreaded camel clutch and pinned the Sheik to become the new champion on Jan. 23, 1984, at Madison Square Garden \u2014 the building paid tribute to Hogan on Thursday night \u2014 and set the course for Hulkamania.",

If the company said Andre the Giant had never been slammed, and had never been pinned over a 15-year undefeated streak, then it was believed to be true (neither were, of course).",
      "Yet, the faux hype set the stage for the match that changed wrestling forever.",
      "\u201cAndre the Giant was a momentum-shifting moment where he passed his torch,\u201d Hogan said in a 2009 interview with the AP. \u201cHe was like the icing on the cake. Once he blessed me, it was up to me to mold that business and carry it through.\u201d",
      "By 1996, Hogan\u2019s good-guy, beats-the-odds character had grown stale as he made the shift from WWE to Ted Turner\u2019s World Championship Wrestling. Hogan even started to get booed as wrestling fans clamored for a new direction, a new star on top.",

      "For weeks, two former WWE stars had \u201cinvaded\u201d WCW and claimed they were taking over the company. That led to a six-man tag-team match where the two outsiders, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, promised a third man to help with their cause. No one showed to help the two until the end, when Hogan walked out in his red-and-yellow attire, and stunned the crowd when he put the leg drop on Randy Savage. Hogan was third man. He ditched his traditional colors for black-and-white, sunglasses, dark facial hair and embraced the \u201cHollywood\u201d heel persona.",
      "Much as he did a decade earlier, Hogan led WCW to new heights and the company would defeat WWE in the TV ratings for 83 straight weeks in what would be known as the \u201cMonday Night Wars.\u201d Hogan lost as much as he won without his Hulkamania powers. He still moved the needle where it mattered most and made WCW must-see TV every Monday night.",
      "With WCW out of business and bought by McMahon, Hogan kept a low profile until he made a comeback with WWE in 2002. He returned with Hall and Nash as the NWO but at this point, WWE fans wanted their old Hulkster back.",
      "Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson was WWE\u2019s baby-faced crowd favorite when he met the villainous Hogan at WrestleMania in an \u201cIcon vs. Icon\u201d match in WrestleMania in 2002. One problem, the Toronto crowd decided to back Hogan.",
      "\u201cWhen we hit the ring, 70,000 loyal people didn\u2019t want to hate Hulk Hogan,\u201d Hogan said in 2009. \u201cEverybody kind of started to panic and I just said, \u2019Brother, stick with me and I\u2019ll get you through this.\u201d\u2019",
      "After the match, the cheers for Hogan called for a last-second change of plans, with his former NWO allies running down to attack him. The Rock helped Hogan fight off the NWO and the two men posed together to riotous cheers.",
      "\u201cAs I raised his hand and said he\u2019s the greatest wrestler in the world, they had to turn me back red and yellow immediately,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting, that was going to be the nail in my coffin. It turned out to be the fountain of youth for me.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- MrBeast's new CEO hit Wall Street Wednesday as YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson's media empire looks to develop long-term brand partnerships and, in turn, unlock more funding for its charitable content.",
      "Venture capitalist Jeff Housenbold took over MrBeast leadership last summer with a mandate to professionalize an ever-growing entertainment company. YouTube's most popular creator had reached record audience levels far outpacing its startup days, while vowing to reassess its internal culture amid multiple controversies. But, despite joining Nasdaq's closing bell ceremony on Wednesday, Housenbold said their strategic plan does not currently include a public offering \u2014 or any active funding rounds.",
      "\u201cDo I want to make banger content? Yeah. That\u2019s cool,\" Housenbold told The Associated Press. \"But what can we do with that banger content? Generate profits, make a sustainable business that gives us greater ability to impact people\u2019s lives around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re marching quickly to profitability, so we don\u2019t have to raise additional capital,\u201d he added.",
      "Instead, MrBeast is focused on securing multi-year exclusive advertising deals as opposed to single-video brand partnerships. With 416 million subscribers and legions of impressionable young fans, Housenbold argued that MrBeast is uniquely positioned to deliver more bang for companies' marketing bucks by pointing that \u201cfirehouse of attention\u201d at them.",
      "Along the way, Housenbold said he is encouraging Donaldson to tout the channel's charitable works \u2014 which often feature quantifiable stunts such as building wells, removing ocean plastic or covering cataract surgery costs. The company, in his view, \u201ccan do good while doing well.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe more people who like us \u2019cause we do good, the more people watch our videos,\" he said. \u201cThe more people watch our videos, the more we\u2019re able to drive in fees from our advertising partners... the more we can invest in more content to do more good in the world.\u201d",
      "New projects such as the Amazon Prime reality show and a James Patterson novel from HarperCollins aim to diversify the genders and ages of his audience. Housenbold said that base has historically consisted mostly of 8-to-25-year-olds and men.",
      "But Housenbold acknowledged missteps in last year's production of \u201cBeast Games,\" which prompted allegations of \u201cunsafe\u201d conditions from some contestants who said an unorganized set led to injuries, irregular food provision and lacking access to medication. While describing most of those reports as \u201cinaccurate,\u201d Housenbold said they were \u201cbetter prepared\u201d for the second season's recently wrapped shoot.",

The remastered version arrives Sept. 19 via Rhino Records' high-fidelity series and was sourced from the original analog master tapes. The album will also receive a CD and digital release for the first time, and the opening track, \u201cCrying in the Night,\u201d was available to stream Wednesday.",
      "Buckingham and Nicks were in their early to mid-20s during the making of their album. \u201cIt was a very natural thing, from the beginning,\u201d Nicks says in the re-release's liner notes, written by music journalist David Fricke.",

He claimed he was told five days after the group appeared at Radio City Music Hall that the band would tour without him. He says he would have been paid at least $12 million for his share of the proceeds. Later that year, Buckingham said they had settled the lawsuit.",

      "Cleo Laine, whose husky contralto was one of the most distinctive voices in jazz and who was regarded by many as Britain\u2019s greatest contribution to the quintessentially American music, has died",
      "LONDON -- Cleo Laine, whose husky contralto was one of the most distinctive voices in jazz and who was regarded by many as Britain's greatest contribution to the quintessentially American music, has died. She was 97.",
      "The Stables, a charity and venue Laine founded with her late jazz musician husband John Dankworth, said Friday it was \u201cgreatly saddened\u201d by the news that \u201cone of its founders and Life President, Dame Cleo Laine has passed away.\"",
      "Monica Ferguson, artistic director of The Stables, said Laine \"will be greatly missed, but her unique talent will always be remembered.\u201d",
      "Laine's career spanned the Atlantic and crossed genres: She sang the songs of Kurt Weill, Arnold Schoenberg and Robert Schumann; she acted on stage and on film, and even played God in a production of Benjamin Britten's \"Noye's Fludde.\"",
      "Laine's life and art were intimately bound up with band leader Dankworth, who gave her a job and her stage name in 1951, and married her seven years later. Both were still performing after their 80th birthdays. Dankworth died in 2010 at 82.",
      "In 1997, Laine became the first British jazz artist to be made a dame, the female equivalent of a knight.",
      "\"It is British jazz that should have received the accolade for its service to me,\" she said when the honor was announced. \"It has given me a wonderful life, a successful career and an opportunity to travel the globe doing what I love to do.\"",
      "Laine was born Clementina Dinah Campbell in 1927. Her father, Alexander Campbell, was a Jamaican who loved opera and earned money during the Depression as a street singer. Despite hard times, her British mother, Minnie, made sure that her daughter had piano, voice and dance lessons.",
      "She began performing at local events at age 3, and at age 12 she got a role as a movie extra in \"The Thief of Bagdad.\" Leaving school at 14, Laine went to work as a hairdresser and faced repeated rejection in her efforts to get a job as a singer.",
      "A decade later, in 1951, she tried out for the Johnny Dankworth Seven, and succeeded. \"Clementina Campbell\" was judged too long for a marquee, so she became Cleo Laine.",
      "\"John said that when he heard me, I didn't sound like anyone else who was singing at the time,\" Laine once said. \"I guess the reason I didn't get the other jobs is that they were looking for a singer who did sound like somebody else.\"",
      "Laine had a remarkable range, from tenor to contralto, and a sound often described as \"smoky.\"",
      "Dankworth, in an interview with the Irish Independent, recalled Laine's audition.",
      "\"They were all sitting there with stony faces, so I asked the Scottish trumpet player Jimmy Deuchar, who was looking very glum and was the hardest nut of all, whether he thought she had something. 'Something?' he said, 'She's got everything!'\"",
      "Offered 6 pounds a week, Laine demanded \u2014 and got \u2014 7 pounds.",
      "\"They used to call me 'Scruff', although I don't think I was scruffy. It was just that having come from the sticks, I didn't know how to put things together as well as the other singers of the day,\" she told the Irish Independent. \"And anyway, I didn't have the money, because they weren't paying me enough.\"",
      "Recognition came swiftly. Laine was runner-up in Melody Maker's \"girl singer\" category in 1952, and topped the list in 1956 and 1957.",
      "She married Dankworth \u2014 and quit his band \u2014 in 1958, a year after her divorce from her first husband, George Langridge. As Dankworth's band prospered, Laine began to feel underused.",

      "Her stage career began in 1958 when she was invited to join the cast of a West Indian play, \"Flesh to a Tiger,\" at the Royal Court Theatre, and was surprised to find herself in the lead role. She won a Moscow Arts Theatre Award for her performance.",

      "A reviewer for Variety in 2002 found her voice going strong: \"a dark, creamy voice, remarkable range and control from bottomless contralto to a sweet clear soprano. Her perfect pitch and phrasing is always framed with musical imagination and good taste.\"",
      "Perhaps Laine's most difficult performance of all was on Feb. 6, 2010, at a concert celebrating the 40th anniversary of the concert venue she and Dankworth had founded at their home, during which Laine and both of her children performed.",

      "A United Nations report highlights rising food insecurity in Africa, with over 1 billion people unable to afford a healthy diet in 2024",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Food insecurity is rising in many parts of Africa, with the number of people unable to afford a healthy diet surpassing 1 billion \u2014 some two-thirds of the continent's population \u2014 in 2024, according to a United Nations report published Monday.",
      "The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in Africa is more than double the global average of 28%, whereas figures from Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Oceania don\u2019t reach that mark, the report said.",
      "The annual report, produced by five U.N. agencies, analyzes trends in efforts to achieve the goal of zero hunger around the world by 2030. Those agencies include the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program.",
      "An estimated 8.2% of the global population may have faced hunger in 2024, down from 8.5% in 2023 and 8.7% in 2022, a positive trend that \u201ccontrasts with the steady rise in hunger in most subregions of Africa\u201d and in western Asia, or parts of the Middle East and South Asia, the report said.",
      "The prevalence of undernourishment, a key measure of progress, surpassed 20% in Africa and rose to 12.7% in western Asia, it said.",
      "The report is the latest to suggest that eliminating food insecurity universally remains a serious challenge. Africa remains the most vulnerable continent.",
      "According to the current projection, 512 million people in the world may be chronically undernourished in 2030, with nearly 60% of them to be found in Africa, the report said.",
      "\u201cWe must urgently reverse this trajectory,\u201d said M\u00e1ximo Torero, chief economist with the FAO.",
      "A major mark of distress is the number of Africans unable to afford a healthy diet. While the global figure fell from 2.76 billion in 2019 to 2.6 billion in 2024, the number increased in Africa from 864 million to just over 1 billion during the same period.",
      "That means the vast majority of Africans are unable to eat well on the continent of 1.5 billion people.",
      "The U.N. warned in a report in October that conflicts, economic instability and climate shocks \u2014 in addition to reduced funding for emergency food and agriculture assistance \u2014 were driving alarming levels of acute food insecurity in 22 \u201chunger hot spots.\u201d",

      "A former Ukrainian prisoner of war has embraced life with urgency since his release in April",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Since his release from a Russian prison in April, Stanislav Tarnavskyi has been in a hurry to build the life in Ukraine he dreamed about during three years of captivity.",
      "The 25-year-old has proposed to his girlfriend, bought an apartment and adopted a golden retriever. And that was just what he accomplished one week in July.",
      "But as busy as he is rekindling old relationships and creating new ones, Tarnavskyi cannot shake the trauma he and thousands of other Ukrainian soldiers experienced as prisoners of war. The U.N. says many endured beatings, starvation and humiliation at the hands of their captors \u2014 experiences that will leave lifelong scars.",
      "Tarnavskyi, who was captured during the battle for Mariupol in April of 2022, regularly has nightmares about the prisons where he was held.",
      "\u201cI see the officers who watched over us. I dream they want to harm me, catch me,\u201d he said. When he wakes up, his heart pounds, anxiety surges \u2014 until he realizes he is in the outskirts of Kyiv, where he was forced to move because Russia occupied his hometown of Berdiansk.",
      "As the three-year war drags on, Tarnavskyi is one of more than 5,000 former POWs back in Ukraine rehabilitating with the help of regular counseling. Regardless of any physical injuries that may require attention, psychologists say it is vital to monitor former POWs for years after their release; the cost of war, they say, echoes for generations.",
      "In a photography studio high above Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, sunlight floods the white walls. After a shoot that lasted several hours Tarnavskyi said the brightness was hurting his eyes, which are still sensitive from years spent in a dark cell.",
      "But his mood couldn't be dimmed. The girlfriend who waited for his return had just consented to his surprise proposal.",
      "\u201cI love you very much, I am very glad that you waited for me,\" Tarnavskyi said, holding a thick bouquet of pink roses and a ring. \"You have always been my support, and I hope you will remain so for the rest of my life. Will you marry me?\u201d",
      "Tarnavskyi said it was the thought of Tetiana Baieva \u2014 whom he met in 2021 \u2014 that helped stop him from taking his own life three times during captivity.",
      "Still, he finds it hard to talk with Baieva about his time in prison. He doesn't want to be pitied.",
      "Soon after he returned home, he was paranoid, feeling watched \u2014 a reaction to constant surveillance in prison. \u201cIf you stepped out of line, they\u2019d (Russians) come and beat you. I still get flashbacks when I see (surveillance) cameras. If I see one, I get nervous,\u201d he said.",
      "But with each passing week, he is feeling better, progress Tarnavskyi credits to the work he is doing with a psychologist.",
      "Any small stimulus \u2014 a smell, a breeze, a color \u2014 can trigger traumatic memories for POWs, says Kseniia Voznitsyna, the director of Ukraine's Lisova Polyana mental health center for veterans on the outskirts of Kyiv.",
      "Yet contrary to stereotypes, ex-POWs aren\u2019t more aggressive. \u201cThey tend to isolate themselves, avoid large gatherings, and struggle with trust,\u201d said Voznitsyna.",
      "\u201cThey say time heals \u2014 five or 10 years, maybe \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t,\" she added. \"It just feels less intense.\u201d",

Even in captivity, he sang quietly to himself, composing songs in his mind about love, home and war. Now he dreams of turning that passion into a career as an artist.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve become stronger now,\u201d Zalizko said. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of death, not afraid of losing an arm or a leg, not afraid of dying instantly. I fear nothing anymore.\u201d",

      "Michigan has become a leader in safe drinking water after the Flint crisis, but mobile home parks remain a rough spot",
      "After the Flint water crisis, Michigan became a national leader on safe drinking water, requiring the removal of lead pipes and the reduction of harmful \u201cforever chemicals\u201d years before the federal government acted.",
      "But the state has a blind spot when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people who live in its mobile home parks.",
      "Regulators say they have little power to enforce the rules in the state's estimated 100 or more unlicensed parks when owners fail to provide safe water. The problem is compounded by private equity firms that have been buying up parks over the past two decades and now control about 1 in every 6 parks in Michigan \u2014 among the highest rates in the country, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a group that advocates against such purchases.",
      "Officials say it can be a struggle to even contact those park owners, let alone get them to comply with regulations.",
      "\u201cWith private equity moving into this space, the goal these companies seem to have is to return the absolute highest return they can to investors even if that means providing inadequate service or engaging in exploitative practices, or unsafe practices for the residents,\u201d said state Sen. John Cherry, a Democrat who sponsored legislation to strengthen enforcement in the communities.",
      "But the state doesn't attempt to track unlicensed parks. And an industry spokesperson said Michigan officials \u2014 particularly law enforcement \u2014 have the power to do more if they choose.",
      "At North Morris Estates where Theo Gantos lives outside Flint, conditions got so bad that the state refused to renew the park\u2019s license to operate.",
      "Water often flowed weakly from the tap because the wells that service the park didn\u2019t produce enough, Gantos said. Sometimes the water was discolored. It could stain laundry and destroy appliances. He installed a multistage filter system just to be able to use it.",
      "Eventually, local law enforcement investigated. In March, the owner pleaded guilty to a criminal charge for operating without a license, agreeing to pay a fine and sell the park.",
      "That might not have happened if Gantos had not been so pugnacious. He spent years battling Homes of America, an affiliate of private equity group Alden Global Capital that local prosecutors said owns North Morris. That included filing a public records request for emails on officials\u2019 handling of problems at his park, pushing regulators to enforce rules and speaking out to media over what he calls blight conditions.",
      "\u201cThese guys, they don\u2019t care,\u201d Gantos said about complying with the rules.",
      "Representatives of North Morris and Homes of America, including an attorney who appeared for the park in legal proceedings, did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, called LARA, has the authority to inspect and investigate complaints at licensed mobile home parks. But it\u2019s typically fallen to law enforcement to pursue criminal charges against unlicensed parks.",
      "The North Morris conviction for operating without a license is likely the first such under the state\u2019s mobile home law that has been on the books since 1987, the county prosecutor said.",

      "John Lindley, president and CEO of the industry group Michigan Manufactured Housing Association, said the rarity of such cases is evidence that state and local law enforcement are choosing not to enforce the rules.",
      "\u201cThis whole notion that, \u2018There\u2019s nothing we can do about this.\u2019 Clearly there is, or that prosecution wouldn\u2019t have taken place,\u201d Lindley said. \u201cNot having the authority to go after communities that don\u2019t have a license is completely different from choosing not to go after those. And what we\u2019ve seen so far with both the state and local units of government is they\u2019ve elected not to.\u201d",
      "Mobile home parks without a license are \u201cessentially operating unregulated,\u201d Cherry said. One of the state\u2019s few options is to shut down a park, a rarely used last resort that can mean throwing people out of their homes.",
      "Mobile home parks have long been an important affordable housing option. But that affordability is fading.",
      "A study by Lending Tree, a lending marketplace, found new mobile home sale prices rose more than 50% nationally from 2018 to 2023 \u2014 new single-family home price averages, by contrast, rose 38% over that period.",
      "Last year, LARA supported legislation that would have given the department more power to penalize unlicensed parks, force parks to provide owner contact information and limit rent increases. That failed.",
      "This year, Democratic Sen. Jeff Irwin has proposed a narrower law that would give state drinking water officials more power to make sure water in all mobile home parks is drinkable. Right now, they only have direct authority over parks that provide their own water. But it\u2019s common for parks to take city water from a pipe connecting to the nearby town.",
      "That water is usually safe when it reaches the park, but if the park\u2019s water pipes crack or fail, water protections won\u2019t apply on the private property. That keeps officials from stepping in and forcing change except in limited situations when there\u2019s a public health threat. It can leave residents unsure where to turn when the owner refuses to fix problems.",
      "\u201cWe take those issues very seriously,\u201d said Eric Oswald, director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy\u2019s drinking water and environmental health division. He said they try to work with licensing officials to ensure water is safe, though \u201cthe problem is, I\u2019m not resourced for that.\u201d",
      "The Michigan Manufactured Housing Association opposed last year\u2019s legislation, arguing it would make mobile homes less affordable. The group says it supports extending water protections to within parks, as called for in this year\u2019s legislation. It passed the state Senate in late June and is now in the GOP-controlled House.",

      "The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV",
      "LONDON -- The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug aimed at preventing HIV, which scientists say could help end the virus' transmission.",
      "In a statement on Friday, the EU drug regulator said its evaluations of lenacapavir, sold as Yeytuo in Europe by Gilead Sciences, showed the drug is \u201chighly effective\u201d and \u201cconsidered to be of major public health interest.\u201d Once the regulator's guidance is accepted by the European Commission, the authorization is valid in all 27 EU member countries as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.",
      "Last year, studies suggested that lenacapavir, already used to treat people with HIV, was nearly 100% effective in stopping transmission in both women and men.",
      "Winnie Byanyima, executive director of the U.N. AIDS agency, has said the drug \u201ccould change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic\u201d if it is made available to everyone who needs it.",
      "In June, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized lenacapavir to prevent HIV. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization recommended countries offer the drug as an additional option to people at risk of the virus.",
      "Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly. Other medication aimed at preventing HIV include daily pills that people can take and another injectable drug called cabotegravir, which is given every two months. Lenacapavir\u2019s six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more visits to health clinics or stigma from taking daily pills.",
      "Critics have raised concerns, however, that lenacapavir may not be made widely enough available to stop global outbreaks of HIV. Drugmaker Gilead has said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates \u2014 mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.",

      "Millions of people living in mobile home parks don't enjoy the same drinking water protections that Americans are accustomed to",
      "The worst water Colt Smith has seen in 14 years with Utah\u2019s Division of Drinking Water was at a mobile home park, where residents had been drinking it for years before state officials discovered the contamination.",
      "The well water carried cancer-causing arsenic as much as 10 times the federal limit. Smith had to put the rural park under a do-not-drink order that lasted nearly 10 years.",
      "\u201cThe Health Department refers it to us like ... \u2018Why aren\u2019t you guys regulating it?\u2019 We had no idea it existed,\u201d he said.",
      "More than 50 years after the Safe Drinking Water Act was passed to ensure that Americans\u2019 water is free from harmful bacteria, lead and other dangerous substances, millions of people living in mobile home parks can\u2019t always count on those basic protections.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found that nearly 70% of mobile home parks running their own water systems violated safe drinking water rules in the past five years, a higher rate than utilities that supply water for cities and towns, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. And the problems are likely even bigger because the EPA database doesn\u2019t catch all parks.",
      "Even where parks get water from an outside source \u2014 such as a city \u2014 the clean water coming in can become contaminated if it passes through problematic infrastructure before reaching residents' taps. Because the EPA doesn\u2019t generally require this water to be tested and regulated, the problems may go unseen.",
      "Utah is one of the few states to step in with their own rules, according to an AP survey of state policies.",
      "\u201cIf you look back at the history of the Safe Drinking Water Act, like in the \u201970s when they were starting, it was, \u2018Well, as long as the source \u2026 is protected, then by the time it gets to the tap, it\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 And that\u2019s just not how it works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "In one Colorado mobile home park, raw sewage backed up into a bathtub. In a Michigan park, the taps often ran dry and the water resembled tea; in Iowa, it looked like coffee \u2014 scaring residents off drinking it and ruining laundry they could hardly afford to replace. In California, boxes of bottled water crowd a family's kitchen over fears of arsenic.",
      "Almost 17 million people in the U.S. live in mobile homes. Some are comfortable Sun Belt retirees. Many others have modest incomes and see mobile homes as a rare opportunity for home ownership.",
      "To understand how water in the parks can be so troubled, it\u2019s useful to remember that residents often own their homes but rent the land they sit on. Despite the name, it's difficult and expensive to move a mobile home. That means they\u2019re \u201chalfway homeowners,\u201d said Esther Sullivan, a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado in Denver who lived in several mobile home parks as she researched a book. Residents often put up with \u201creally egregious\u201d property maintenance by landlords because all their money is tied up in their home, she said.",
      "Pamela Maxey, 51, of Kalamazoo, Michigan, said she had forgotten what it was like to have reliable, clean water until she traveled to her state Capitol last year to advocate for better mobile home park protections and stayed in a hotel. By then, she had spent eight years in a park where sewage backed up into homes and the flow of tap water was sometimes weak or discolored.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I went into the bathroom to take a shower that I realized, \u2018I don\u2019t have to jump in here and squint my eyes closed the entire time and make sure water doesn\u2019t get in my mouth because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI went to brush my teeth, and I just turned the faucet on and I brushed my teeth from the water coming from the faucet. I haven\u2019t been able to do that for over a year.\u201d",
      "Victoria Silva, a premed student in Fort Collins, Colorado, estimates the water in Harmony Village Mobile Home Park where Silva lives went out or lost pressure 20 to 30 times over roughly three years there.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much water they need until the water is out for five minutes when they need to flush, when they need to rinse something off their hands, when they need to make some pasta,\u201d Silva said.",
      "The park's owner says a licensed professional ensures water is maintained and tested, and outages are minimized.",
      "The U.S. has some 50,000 water utilities, most serving small towns and rural areas. Many struggle to find expert staff and funding, and they violate clean water rules more often than the handful of large utilities that serve cities. But even among the hard-pressed small utilities, mobile home parks stand out.",
      "The AP analysis found that more than half these parks failed to perform a required test for at least one contaminant, or failed to properly report the results, in the past five years. And they are far more likely to be repeat offenders of safe drinking water rules overall.",
      "But that's only part of the story. The true rates of mobile home park violations aren\u2019t knowable because the EPA doesn\u2019t track them well. The agency\u2019s tap water violation database depends on information from states that often don\u2019t properly categorize mobile home parks.",
      "When Smith first searched Utah\u2019s database in response to an AP request for data from all 50 states, he found only four small water systems identified as belonging to mobile home parks. With some keyword searches, he identified 33 more.",
      "Other parks aren\u2019t in the databases at all and may be completely unregulated.",

      "The water in these other parks had been off their radar. At some, testing found high levels of cancer-causing arsenic in the water that had been provided to residents for years.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many unnoticed parks are out there. Most states aren\u2019t actively looking for them and say they find very few. In Colorado, after the state passed a new law to require water testing at all mobile home parks, officials uncovered 79 parks with their source of water unknown. That\u2019s about a tenth of the total parks in the state.",
      "Many parks are decades old with aging pipes that can cause chronic water problems, even if the water that supplies the park is clean when it enters the system.",
      "Jake Freeman, the engineering director at Central States Water Resources, a Missouri-based private utility company that specializes in taking over small water systems in 11 states, said substandard and poorly installed pipes are more common to see in mobile home parks.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s hard to find the piping in the mobile home parks because if there\u2019s any kind of obstruction, they just go around it,\u201d he said. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like spaghetti laying in the ground.\u201d",
      "After a major winter storm devastated Texas in 2021, Freeman said, the company found pipes at parks it had taken over that \u201cwere barely buried. Some of them weren\u2019t buried.\u201d",
      "When pipes break and leak, the pressure drops and contaminants can enter water lines. In addition, parks sometimes have stagnant water \u2014 where pipes dead-end or water sits unused \u2014 that increases the risk of bacterial growth.",
      "Rebecca Sadosky is public water supply chief in North Carolina, where mobile home communities make up close to 40% of all water systems. She said owners don\u2019t always realize when they buy a park that they could also be running a mini utility.",
      "\u201cI think they don\u2019t know that they\u2019re getting into the water business,\u201d she said.",
      "Utah is a rare state that enforces safe drinking water standards even within mobile home parks that get their water from another provider, according to AP\u2019s survey of states. A small number of other states like New Hampshire have taken some steps to address water safety in these parks, but in most states frustrated residents may have no one to turn to for help beyond the park owner.",
      "In Colorado, when Silva asked officials who enforces safe drinking water rules, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t get clear answers.\u201d",
      "Steve Via, director of federal regulations at the American Water Works Association utility group, argued against regulating mobile home parks that get their water from a municipality, saying that would further stretch an already taxed oversight system. And if those parks are regulated, what\u2019s to stop the rules from extending to the privately owned pipes in big apartment buildings \u2014 the line has to be drawn somewhere, he said.",
      "Via said residents of parks where an owner refuses to fix water problems have options, including going to their local health departments, suing or complaining publicly.",
      "Silva is among the advocates who fought for years to change Colorado\u2019s rules before they succeeded in passing a law in 2023 that requires water testing in every mobile home park. It gives health officials the ability to go beyond federal law to address taste, color and smell that can make people afraid to drink their water, even when it\u2019s not a health risk. The state is now a leader in protecting mobile home park tap water.",
      "Smith, the Utah environmental scientist, said stopping the contaminated water flowing into the mobile home park and connecting it to a safe supply felt like a career highlight.",
      "He said Utah's culture of making do with scarce water contributed to a willingness for stronger testing and regulations than the federal government requires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s sort of the communal nature of like, everybody should have access to clean water,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to transcend political ideologies; it seems to transcend religious ideologies.\u201d",

      "The U.S. was once among only a few developed countries with a rate that ensured each generation had enough children to replace itself \u2014 about 2.1 kids per woman. But it has been sliding in America for close to two decades as more women are waiting longer to have children or never taking that step at all.",
      "The new statistic is on par with fertility rates in western European countries, according to World Bank data.",
      "Alarmed by recent drops, the Trump administration has taken steps to increase falling birth rates, like issuing an executive order meant to expand access to and reduce costs of in vitro fertilization and backing the idea of \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d that might encourage more couples to have kids.",
      "But there's no reason to be alarmed, according to Leslie Root, a University of Colorado Boulder researcher focused on fertility and population policy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this as part of an ongoing process of fertility delay. We know that the U.S. population is still growing, and we still have a natural increase \u2014 more births than deaths,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the statistic for the total fertility rate with updated birth data for 2024.",

Signs promoting the event had already been erected all over the course before he arrived on Tuesday, and, on the highway leading in, temporary metal signs guided drivers onto the correct road.",

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is meeting Monday with Trump at a golf property owned by the president's family near Turnberry in southwestern Scotland \u2014 then later traveling to Abderdeen, on the country's northeast coast, where there's another Trump golf course and a third is opening soon.",
      "During his first term in 2019, Trump posted of his Turnberry property, \u201cVery proud of perhaps the greatest golf course anywhere in the world. Also, furthers U.K. relationship!\u201d Starmer is not a golfer, but toggling between Trump's Scottish courses shows the outsized influence the president puts on properties bearing his name \u2014 and on golf's ability to shape geopolitics.",
      "However, even as Trump may want to focus on showing off his golf properties, Starmer will try to center the conversation on more urgent global matters. He plans to urge Trump to press Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and attempt to end what Downing St. called \u201cthe unspeakable suffering and starvation\u201d in the territory, while pushing for a ceasefire in Israel\u2019s war with Hamas.",
      "Britain, along with France and Germany, has criticized Israel for \u201cwithholding essential humanitarian assistance\u201d as hunger spread in Gaza. Over the weekend, Starmer said Britain will take part in efforts led by Jordan to airdrop aid after Israel temporarily eased restrictions.",

      "The president added, \u201cIt makes you feel a little bad when you do that\" without what he considered proper acknowledgement.",
      "Starmer is under pressure from his Labour Party lawmakers to follow France in recognizing a Palestinian state, a move both Israel and the U.S. have condemned.

      "Also on Monday's agenda, according to Starmer\u2019s office, are efforts to promote a possible peace deal to end fighting in Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine \u2014 particularly efforts at forcing Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table in the next 50 days.",
      "Trump in the past sharply criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for also failing to express enough public gratitude toward U.S. support for his country, taking a similar tack he's now adopting when it comes to aid for Gaza.

      "Starmer and Trump are likely to find more common ground on trade issues.",
      "While China initially responded to Trump\u2019s tariff threats by retaliating with high import taxes of its own on U.S. goods, it has since begun negotiating to ease trade tensions. Starmer and his country have taken a far softer approach. He's gone out of his way to work with Trump, flattering the president repeatedly during a February visit to the White House, and teaming up to announce a joint trade framework on tariffs for some key products in May.",
      "Starmer and Trump then signed a trade agreement during the G7 summit in Canada that freed the U.K.'s aerospace sector from U.S. tariffs and used quotas to reduce them on auto-related industries from 25% to 10% while increasing the amount of U.S. beef it pledged to import.",
      "Discussions with Starmer follow a Trump meeting Sunday with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at his Turnberry course. They announced a trade framework that will put 15% tariffs on most goods from both countries, though many major details remain pending.",
      "The president has for months railed against yawning U.S. trade deficits around the globe and sees tariffs as a way to try and close them in a hurry. But the U.S. ran an $11.4 billion trade surplus with Britain last year, meaning it exported more to the U.K. than it imported. Census Bureau figures this year indicate that the surplus could grow.",
      "There are still lingering U.S.-Britain trade issues that need fine-tuning. The deal framework from May said British steel would enter the U.S. duty-free, but it continues to face a 25% levy.",
      "U.K. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said Monday that \u201cnegotiations have been going on on a daily basis\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s a few issues to push a little bit further today,\u201d though he downplayed expectations of a resolution.",
      "The leader of Scotland, meanwhile, said he will urge Trump to lift the current 10% tariff on Scotch whisky. First Minister John Swinney said the spirit\u2019s \u201cuniqueness\u201d justified an exemption.",
      "Even as some trade details linger and both leaders grapple with increasingly difficult choices in Gaza and Ukraine, however, Starmer's staying on Trump's good side appears to be working \u2014 at least so far.",
      "\u201cThe U.K. is very well-protected. You know why? Because I like them \u2014 that\u2019s their ultimate protection,\u201d Trump said during the G7.",

      "North Korea has shunned talks with South Korea and the U.S. since leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with President Donald Trump fell apart in 2019 due to wrangling over international sanctions. North Korea has since focused on building more powerful nuclear weapons targeting its rivals and declared a hostile \u201ctwo-state\u201d system on the Korean Peninsula to terminate relations with South Korea.",
      "Kim Yo Jong called Lee's steps \u201csincere efforts\u201d to develop ties, but said the new government still plots to \u201cstand in confrontation\u201d with North Korea. She mentioned the upcoming summertime South Korea-U.S. military drills, which North Korea views as an invasion rehearsal.",
      "Lee said it's important to restore trust between the Koreas as he met Unification Minister Chung Dong-young and asked about his thought on the latest North Korean statement.

      "The Federal Reserve is expected to leave its short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday for the fifth straight meeting, a move that will likely underscore the deep divide between how Chair Jerome Powell and President Donald Trump see the economy",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is expected to leave its short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday for the fifth straight meeting, a move that will likely underscore the deep divide between how Chair Jerome Powell and his chief critic, President Donald Trump, see the economy.",
      "The Fed itself, to be sure, is increasingly divided over its next steps, and many economists expect that two members of the Fed's governing board \u2014 both appointed by Trump \u2014 could dissent on Wednesday in favor of cutting rates. If so, that would be the first time two governors vote against the chair since 1993.",
      "Even so, the gap between the views of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee, chaired by Powell, and the White House is unusually large. In several areas, Trump's views sharply contrast with that of the Fed's leadership, setting up likely clashes for years to come, even after Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "For example, Trump says that because the U.S. economy is doing well, the Fed should cut rates, as if the U.S. is a blue-chip company that should pay less to borrow than a risky start-up.",
      "But Fed officials \u2014 and nearly all economists \u2014 see it the other way: A solid economy means rates should be relatively high, to prevent overheating and a burst of inflation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d argue that our interest rates are higher because our economy\u2019s doing fairly well, not in spite of it,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities.",
      "Trump argues that the Fed in general and Powell in particular are costing U.S. taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars in interest payments by not reducing borrowing costs. Yet Fed officials don't think it's their job to reduce rates the government pays on Treasury notes and bonds.",
      "Most economists worry that if they did, they would risk failing at one of the key jobs Congress gave them: fighting inflation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s using monetary policy to ease pressure on fiscal policymakers, and that way points to higher inflation and bigger problems down the road,\" said William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and former senior Fed staffer.",
      "If financial markets see that the Fed is focused on keeping borrowing costs low to help the government \u2014 rather than focusing on its congressionally-mandated goals of stable prices and maximum employment \u2014 Wall Street investors, worried about future inflation, will likely demand higher interest rates to hold Treasury bonds, economists say, pushing up borrowing costs across the economy.",
      "For his part, Trump says there is \u201cno inflation\u201d and so the Fed should reduce its short-term rate, currently at about 4.3%, which was ramped up in 2022 and 2023 to fight rising prices. The Fed\u2019s rate often \u2014 but not always \u2014 influences longer-term borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and credit cards.",
      "Inflation has fallen sharply and as a result Fed officials have signaled they will cut rates by as much as a half-percentage point this year. Yet it has picked up a bit in the last two months and many of those policymakers, including Powell, still want to make sure that tariffs aren't going to lift inflation much higher before they make a move.",
      "Inflation accelerated to 2.7% in June from 2.4% in May, the government said earlier this month, above the Fed's 2% target. Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose to 2.9% from 2.8%.",
      "Last week, Trump and several White House officials ramped up their attacks on Powell over rates. They also criticized the ballooning costs of the Fed's renovation of two of its buildings, raising questions over whether the president was looking to fire Powell for cause rather than policy differences.",

      "Some economists expect that the Fed will reduce its key rate by a quarter-point in September, rather than July, and say that the two-month delay will make little difference to the economy.",
      "Yet beyond just the timing of the first cut, there is still a huge gulf between what Trump wants and what the Fed will even consider doing: Fed officials in June penciled in just two reductions this year and one in 2026. They forecast that their key rate will still be 3.6% at the end of next year. Trump is pushing them to cut it to just 1%.",
      "\u201cThat's not going to happen with anything like the current people on the committee,\u201d English said.",
      "Wall Street investors also expect relatively few cuts: Two this year and two in 2026, according to futures pricing tracked by CME's Fedwatch.",
      "According to the Fed's projections, just two officials in June supported three cuts this year, likely Trump's appointments from his first term: governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund is upgrading the economic outlook for the United States and the world this year and next because President Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist trade policies have so far proven less damaging than expected.",
      "The IMF now forecasts 3% growth for the global economy this year. That is down from 3.3% in 2024 but an improvement on the 2.8% it had forecast for 2025 back in April. The 191-country lender, which works to promote growth, stabilize the world financial system and reduce poverty, expects world growth to come in at 3.1% next year, up a tick from the 3% it had forecast three months ago.",
      "Trump\u2019s decision on April 2 \u2013 \u201cLiberation Day,\u2019\u2019 the president called it -- to impose taxes of 10% or more on U.S. imports from most of the world\u2019s countries had been expected to be a bigger drag on global growth.",
      "But the damage was limited, the IMF said, partly because many U.S. importers scrambled to bring in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect and partly because Trump ended up suspending his biggest levies (including a 145% duty on Chinese goods).",
      "\u201cThis modest decline in trade tensions, however fragile, has contributed to the resilience of the global economy so far,\u201d IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said at a press conference Tuesday. \"This resilience is welcome, but it is also tenuous. While the trade shock could turn out to be less severe than initially feared, it is still sizeable, and evidence is mounting that it is hurting the global economy.''",
      "Tariffs raised $108 billion for the U.S. Treasury from October through June, nearly double the $55.6 billion they brought during the same period of the previous fiscal year.",
      "Global growth of around 3% is below pre-pandemic average and the world economy would be growing faster without Trump\u2019s trade wars.",
      "The IMF modestly upped its forecast for U.S. economic growth to 1.9% this year and 2% in 2026 when the big tax cuts Trump signed into law July 4 are expected to provide \u201ca near-term boost.\u2019\u2019",
      "The Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second biggest, is expected to grow 4.8% this year, a hefty upgrade from the 4% the IMF had forecast in April. China is getting a boost from lower-than-expected U.S. tariffs and from government spending.",
      "The 20 economies that share the euro currency are collectively expected to expand 1%, up from the 0.8% the IMF had forecast in April. But a big chunk of that growth is coming from a surge of pharmaceutical exports from Ireland, which were timed to beat Trump\u2019s expected tariffs on drugs.",

More such deals are expected before Friday when Trump will slap even higher tariffs on countries that don\u2019t agree make concessions.",
      "Trump\u2019s protectionism is buffeting global commerce. The IMF upgraded its forecast for growth in world trade, measured by volume, to 2.6% this year. That is up from the 1.7% it had predicted in April and reflects a surge in shipments as exporters tried to beat the tariff crunch. But eventually the higher U.S. levies are expected to take a toll. The IMF sees trade growing just 1.9% next year, down from the 2.5% it had forecast in April.",
      "Trump has also unsettled financial markets by openly and repeatedly criticizing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for the Fed's reluctance to cut American interest rates. Powell has said that the central bank must wait to better understands the impact of Trump's tariffs on inflation.",
      "That same message was delivered last week by the European Central Bank, which is also holding off on rate calls to measure the impact of Trump's tariffs.",

      "Chinese stock indexes, meanwhile, were mixed as top trade officials from the world\u2019s two largest economies headed into a second day of talks about tariffs. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng were meeting in Sweden\u2019s capital and working against an Aug. 12 deadline.

      "BRUSSELS -- France\u2019s prime minister described it as a \u201cdark day\u201d for the European Union, a \u201csubmission\u201d to U.S. tariff demands. Commentators said EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s handshake with President Donald Trump amounted to capitulation.",
      "The trouble is, Europe depends mightily on the United States, and not just for trade.",
      "Mirroring Trump, Von der Leyen gushed that the arrangement she endorsed over the weekend to set U.S. tariff levels on most European exports to 15%, which is 10% higher than currently, was \u201chuge.\u201d Her staff texted reporters insisting that the pact, which starts to enter force on Friday, is the \u201cbiggest trade deal ever.\u201d",

      "Morocco\u2019s argan forests are thinning under the strain of climate change, overharvesting and booming demand for luxury cosmetics",
      "SMIMOU, Morocco -- Argan oil runs through your fingers like liquid gold \u2014 hydrating, luscious, and restorative. Prized worldwide as a miracle cosmetic, it\u2019s more than that in Morocco. It\u2019s a lifeline for rural women and a byproduct of a forest slowly buckling under the weight of growing demand.",
      "To make it, women crouch over stone mills and grind down kernels. One kilogram \u2014 roughly two days of work \u2014 earns them around $3, enough for a modest foothold in an economy where opportunities are scarce. It also links them to generations past.",
      "\u201cWe were born and raised here. These traditions come from nature, what our parents and grandparents have taught us and what we\u2019ve inherited,\u201d cooperative worker Fatma Mnir said.",
      "Long a staple in local markets, argan oil today is in luxury hair and skin care products lining drugstore aisles worldwide. But its runaway popularity is threatening argan forests, with overharvesting piled on top of drought straining trees once seen as resilient in the harshest of conditions.",
      "Hafida El Hantati, owner of one of the cooperatives that harvests the fruit and presses it for oil, said the stakes go beyond the trees, threatening cherished traditions.",
      "\u201cWe must take care of this tree and protect it because if we lose it, we will lose everything that defines us and what we have now,\u201d she said at the Ajddigue cooperative outside the coastal town of Essaouira.",
      "For centuries, argan trees have supported life in the arid hills between the Atlantic Ocean and the Atlas Mountains, feeding people and animals, holding soil in place and helping keep the desert from spreading.",
      "The spiny trees can survive in areas with less than an inch of annual rain and heat up to 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit). They endure drought with roots that stretch as far as 115 feet (35 meters) underground. Goats climb trees, chomp their fruit, and eventually disperse seeds as part of the forest's regeneration cycle.",
      "Moroccans stir the oil into nut butters and drizzle it over tagines. Rich in vitamin E, it's lathered onto dry hair and skin to plump, moisturize and stave off damage. Some use it to calm eczema or heal chicken pox.",
      "But the forest has thinned. Trees bear fewer fruit, their branches gnarled from thirst. In many places, cultivated land has replaced them as fields of citrus and tomatoes, many grown for export, have expanded.",
      "Communities once managed forests collectively, setting rules for grazing and harvesting. Now the system is fraying, with theft routinely reported.",
      "But a forest that covered about 5,405 square miles (14,000 square kilometers) at the turn of the century has shrunk by 40%. Scientists warn that argan trees are not invincible.",
      "\u201cBecause argan trees acted as a green curtain protecting a large part of southern Morocco against the encroaching Sahara, their slow disappearance has become considered as an ecological disaster,\u201d said Zoubida Charrouf, a chemist who researches argan at Universit\u00e9 Mohammed V in Rabat.",
      "Shifting climate is a part of the problem. Fruit and flowers sprout earlier each year as rising temperatures push the seasons out of sync.",
      "Goats that help spread seeds can be destructive, too, especially if they feed on seedlings before they mature. Overgrazing has become worse as herders and fruit collectors fleeing drier regions encroach on plots long allocated to specific families.",
      "The forests also face threats from camels bred and raised by the region's wealthy. Camels stretch their necks into trees and chomp entire branches, leaving lasting damage, Charrouf said.",
      "Today, women peel, crack and press argan for oil at hundreds of cooperatives. Much makes its way through middlemen to be sold in products by companies and subsidiaries of L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Unilever, and Est\u00e9e Lauder.",
      "But workers say they earn little while watching profits flow elsewhere. Cooperatives say much of the pressure stems from climbing prices. A 1-liter bottle sells for 600 Moroccan dirhams ($60), up from 25 dirhams ($2.50) three decades ago. Products infused with argan sell for even more abroad. Cosmetics companies call argan the most expensive vegetal oil on the market.",
      "The coronavirus pandemic upended global demand and prices and many cooperatives closed. Cooperative leaders say new competitors have flooded the market just as drought has diminished how much oil can be squeezed from each fruit.",
      "Cooperatives were set up to provide women a base pay and share profits each month. But Union of Women\u2019s Argan Cooperatives President Jamila Id Bourrous said few make more than Morocco\u2019s minimum monthly wage.",

      "The idea is to expand forest cover and show that argan, if properly managed, can be a viable source of income. Officials hope it will ease pressure on the overharvested commons and convince others to reinvest in the land. The trees were expected to begin producing this year but haven't during a drought.",

      "But this summer, the 41-year-old hit a milestone that long felt out of reach: She became a millionaire.",
      "A surging number of everyday Americans now boast a seven-figure net worth once the domain of celebrities and CEOs. But as the ranks of millionaires grow fatter, the significance of the status is shifting alongside perceptions of what it takes to be truly rich.",
      "\u201cMillionaire used to sound like Rich Uncle Pennybags in a top hat,\u201d says Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors, a wealth management firm in El Segundo, California. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a backstage pass to palatial estates and caviar bumps. It\u2019s the new mass-affluent middleweight class, financially secure but two zeros short of private-jet territory.\u201d",
      "Inflation, ballooning home values and a decades-long push into stock markets by average investors have lifted millions into millionairehood. A June report from Swiss bank UBS found about one-tenth of American adults are members of the seven-digit club, with 1,000 freshly minted millionaires added daily last year.",
      "Thirty years ago, the IRS counted 1.6 million Americans with a net worth of $1 million or more. UBS \u2014 using data from the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund and central banks of countries around the globe \u2014 put the number at 23.8 million in the U.S. last year, a nearly 15-fold increase.",
      "The expanding ranks of millionaires come as the gulf between rich and poor widens. The richest 10% of Americans hold two-thirds of household wealth, according to the Federal Reserve, averaging $8.1 million each. The bottom 50% hold 3% of wealth, with an average of just $60,000 to their names.",
      "Federal Reserve data also shows there are differences by race. Asian people outpace white people in the U.S. in median wealth, while Black and Hispanic people trail in their net worth.",
      "Barley was working as a journalist when her newspaper ended its pension program and she got a lump-sum payout of about $5,000. A colleague convinced her to invest it in a retirement account, and ever since, she\u2019s stashed away whatever she could. The investments dipped at first during the Great Recession but eventually started growing. In time, she came to find catharsis in amassing savings, going home and checking her account balances when she had a tough day at work.",
      "Last month, after one such day, she realized the moment had come.",
      "\u201cDid you know that we\u2019re millionaires?\u201d she asked her husband.",
      "\u201cGood job, honey,\u201d Barley says he replied, unfazed.",
      "It brought no immediate change. Like many millionaires, much of her wealth is in long-term investments and her home, not easy-to-access cash. She still lives in her modest Orlando, Florida, house, socks away half her paycheck, fills the napkin holder with takeout napkins and lines trash cans with grocery bags.",
      "Still, Barley says it feels powerful to cross a threshold she never imagined reaching as a child.",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s not as glamorous as the ideas in your head,\u201d she says.",
      "All wealth is relative. To thousandaires, $1 million is the stuff of dreams. To billionaires, it's a rounding error. Either way, it takes twice as much cash today to match the buying power of 30 years ago.",

      "Now, Breck and his wife spend several months a year traveling. Despite being retired, they continue to grow their balance by sticking to a tight budget and keeping expenses to $1,500 a month when they\u2019re in the U.S and a few hundred dollars more when they travel.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. and Chinese officials are meeting in Stockholm to discuss trade tariffs.",
      "WASHINGTON -- When top U.S. and Chinese officials meet in Stockholm, they are almost certain to agree to at least leaving tariffs at the current levels while working toward a meeting between their presidents later this year for a more lasting trade deal between the world's two largest economies, analysts say.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are set to hold talks Monday for the third time this year \u2014 this round in the Swedish capital, nearly four months after President Donald Trump upset global trade with his sweeping tariff proposal, including an import tax that shot up to 145% on Chinese goods.",
      "\u201cWe have the confines of a deal with China,\u201d Trump said Friday before leaving for Scotland.",
      "Bessent told MSNBC on Wednesday that the two countries after talks in Geneva and London have reached a \u201cstatus quo,\u201d with the U.S. taxing imported goods from China at 30% and China responding with a 10% tariff, on top of tariffs prior to the start of Trump's second term.",
      "\u201cNow we can move on to discussing other matters in terms of bringing the economic relationship into balance,\u201d Bessent said. He was referring to the U.S. running a $295.5 billion trade deficit last year. The U.S. seeks an agreement that would enable it to export more to China and shift the Chinese economy more toward domestic consumer spending.",
      "The Chinese embassy in Washington said Beijing hopes \u201cthere will be more consensus and cooperation and less misperception\u201d coming out of the talks.",
      "With an eye on a possible leaders' summit, Stockholm could provide some answers as to the timeline and viability of that particular goal ahead of a possible meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "\u201cThe meeting will be important in starting to set the stage for a fall meeting between Trump and Xi,\u201d said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator and now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cBeijing will likely insist on detailed preparations before they agree to a leaders\u2019 meeting.\u201d",
      "In Stockholm, the two sides are likely to focus on commercial announcements to be made at a leaders\u2019 summit as well as agreements to address \u201cmajor irritants,\u201d such as China's industrial overcapacity and its lack of control over chemicals used to make fentanyl, also to be announced when Xi and Trump should meet, Cutler said.",
      "Sean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said Stockholm could be the first real opportunity for the two governments to address structural reform issues including market access in China for U.S. companies.",
      "What businesses will be seeking coming out of Stockholm would largely be \u201cthe atmosphere\u201d \u2014 how the two sides characterize the discussions. They will also look for clues about a possible leaders\u2019 summit because any real deal will hinge on the two presidents meeting each other, he said.",
      "In Stockholm, Beijing will likely demand the removal of the 20% fentanyl-related tariff that Trump imposed earlier this year, said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center.",
      "This round of the U.S.-China trade dispute began with fentanyl, when Trump in February imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, citing that China failed to curb the outflow of the chemicals used to make the drug. The following month, Trump added another 10% tax for the same reason. Beijing retaliated with extra duties on some U.S. goods, including coal, liquefied natural gas, and farm products such as beef, chicken, pork and soy.",
      "In Geneva, both sides climbed down from three-digit tariffs rolled out following Trump's \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in April, but the U.S. kept the 20% \u201cfentanyl\u201d tariffs, in addition to the 10% baseline rate \u2014 to which China responded by keeping the same 10% rate on U.S. products. These across-the-board duties were unchanged when the two sides met in London a month later to negotiate over non-tariff measures such as export controls on critical products.",
      "The Chinese government has long protested that American politicians blame China for the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. but argued the root problem lies with the U.S. itself. Washington says Beijing is not doing enough to regulate precursor chemicals that flow out of China into the hands of drug dealers.",
      "In July, China placed two fentanyl ingredients under enhanced control, a move seen as in response to U.S. pressure and signaling goodwill.",

      "China's industrial overcapacity is as much a headache for the United States as it is for the European Union. Even Beijing has acknowledged the problem but suggested it might be difficult to address.",

But China has found new markets for its goods and as the world\u2019s dominant manufacturer ran a global trade surplus approaching $1 trillion last year \u2014 somewhat larger than the size of the U.S. overall trade deficit in 2024. And China\u2019s emergence as a manufacturer of electric vehicles and other emerging technologies has suddenly made it more of a financial and geopolitical threat for those same industries based in the U.S., Europe, Japan and South Korea.",

Factories run 24 hours a day,\u201d Chinese Premier Li Qiang said on Thursday when hosting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Beijing. \u201cSome people think this will cause some new problems in the balance of supply and demand in world production.\u201d",

      "Bessent also said the Stockholm talks could address Chinese purchases of Russian and Iranian oil. However, Wildau of Teneo said China could demand some U.S. security concessions in exchange, such as a reduced U.S. military presence in East Asia and scaled-back diplomatic support for Taiwan and the Philippines. This would likely face political pushback in Washington.",
      "The Stockholm talks will be \u201cgeared towards building a trade agreement based around Chinese purchase commitments and pledges of investment in the U.S. in exchange for partial relief from U.S. tariffs and export controls,\u201d Wildau said.",

      "\u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cis probably the preferred outcome for China hawks in the Trump administration, who worry that an overeager Trump might offer too much to Xi.\u201d",

      "Retailers rushing to stock up before expected tariffs have boosted the Port of Savannah to its second-busiest year",
      "SAVANNAH, Ga. -- Retailers scrambling to stock up ahead of anticipated stiff tariffs on imports boosted the Port of Savannah, one of the top U.S. container ports, to its second-busiest year ever, Georgia officials said Tuesday.",
      "The Savannah port moved 5.7 million container units of imports and exports across its docks in the 2025 fiscal year that ended June 30, the Georgia Ports Authority reported. That's an increase of 8.6% over the prior fiscal year and just shy of the record 5.76 million container units Savannah handled in fiscal 2022.",
      "The growth was caused in part by a surge in cargo since President Donald Trump returned to office in January promising heavy tariffs on China and other U.S. trading partners. But double-digit increases Savannah saw during the spring months were followed by a sizable drop in June container volumes as Trump's on-again, off-again tactics continued to fuel uncertainty.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just going to be this very up-and-down time until things get settled,\" said Georgia Ports Authority CEO Griff Lynch, who praised Trump's trade deal with the European Union as a step toward restoring stability. \u201cI\u2019m sure all of it will come together. It\u2019s just a matter of timing.\u201d",
      "The Port of Savannah is the nation's No. 4 seaport for cargo shipped in containers, giant metal boxes used to transport goods ranging from consumer electronics to frozen chickens by ship, rail and truck.",

      "Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator and now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said that Trump's team would face challenges from \u201ca large and confident partner that is more than willing to retaliate against U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Rollover of tariff rates \u201cshould be the easy part,\u201d she said, warning that Beijing has learned lessons since the first Trump administration and \u201cwill not buy into a one-sided deal this time around.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeijing is more prepared and will insist on movement on U.S. tech export controls at a minimum \u2014 a difficult ask for Washington,\u201d she said, adding that many conversations will take place in the lead-up to any Xi-Trump summit.",
      "\u201cSuccess is far from guaranteed,\" Cutler said. \u201cThere are numerous trip wires that can throw a wrench in this preparatory process.\u201d",
      "The U.S.-China trade talks are the third this year, nearly four months after Trump upended global trade with his sweeping tariff proposals, including an import tax that shot up to 145% on Chinese goods. China retaliated with tariffs reaching 125% against U.S. goods, sending global financial markets into a temporary tailspin.",
      "The Stockholm meeting, following similar talks in Geneva and London, is set to extend a 90-day pause on those tariffs. During the hiatus, U.S. tariffs have been lowered to 30% on Chinese goods, and China set a 10% tariff on U.S. products.",
      "The Trump administration, which just completed a deal on tariffs with the European Union, wants to reduce a trade deficit of $904 billion overall last year, including a nearly $300 billion trade deficit with China.",
      "China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said last week that the \u201cconsultations\u201d would raise shared concerns through the principles of \u201cmutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.\u201d",
      "The talks with Beijing are part of a flurry of U.S. trade negotiations set off by Trump\u2019s arm-twisting \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs against dozens of countries. Since then, some talks have borne fruit in reaching deals. Others have not.",
      "Without an extension by Aug. 12, the tit-for-tat U.S.-China tariffs could snap back to the triple-digit levels seen before the 90-day pause reached in Geneva. Many other countries \u2014 including some developing ones that depend on exports to the U.S. \u2014 face a deadline of Friday, as the Trump administration has said that letters will go out beforehand with set rates.",

      "Clase, a three-time All-Star, becomes the second Guardians pitcher to be placed on leave in connection with a sports gambling probe. Luis Ortiz also is on non-disciplinary leave through Aug. 31.",
      "It was unclear if the cases were related. The Guardians said in a statement the organization \u201c(has) been informed that no additional players or club personnel are expected to be impacted.\u201d",
      "The 27-year-old Clase is 5-3 with 24 saves in 48 games this year, but he also has a career-high 3.23 ERA. The right-hander led the AL in saves each of the previous three years and was believed to be on the market ahead of this week's MLB trade deadline.",

      "Major League Baseball has been monitoring sports gambling more closely since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in May 2018 struck down a federal law that had barred betting on football, basketball, baseball and other sports in most states.",
      "MLB said in a statement that Clase \u2014 per an agreement with the players\u2019 association \u2014 had been placed on leave while the league \u201ccontinues its sports betting investigation.\u201d It declined further comment.",
      "A spokeswoman for the Major League Baseball Players Association declined comment Monday night.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump has opened a new golf course in Scotland, ending a five-day trip focused on promoting his family\u2019s luxury properties and playing golf",
      "BALMEDIE, Scotland -- U.S. President Donald Trump opened a new golf course bearing his name in Scotland on Tuesday, capping a five-day foreign trip designed to promote his family's luxury properties and play golf.",
      "\u201cLet's go. 1-2-3,\u201d Trump said before he used a golden pair of scissors to cut a red ribbon and fireworks popped to mark the ceremonial opening of the new Trump course in the village of Balmedie on Scotland's northern coast.",
      "\u201cThis has been an unbelievable development,\u201d Trump said beforehand. He thanked his son Eric for his work on the project, saying it was \u201ctruly a labor of love for him.\u201d Son Don Jr. also was present.",
      "Eric Trump said the course was a \u201cpassion project\u201d for his father.",
      "Immediately after the opening, Trump, Eric Trump and two professional golfers teed off on the first hole. Trump rarely allows the news media to watch his golf game, though video journalists and photographers often find him along the course wherever he plays. Trump planned to play 18 holes before he arrives back in Washington on Tuesday night.",
      "The overseas jaunt let Trump escape Washington\u2019s sweaty summer heat and humidity while questions about the case of Jeffrey Epstein followed him across the Atlantic Ocean. But it added to a lengthy list of ways the Republican president has used the White House to promote his brand.",
      "Billing itself as the \u201cGreatest 36 Holes in Golf,\u201d the Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, was designed by Eric Trump. The course is hosting a PGA Seniors Championship event later this week before it begins offering rounds to the public on Aug. 13. Signs promoting the event were seen all around the course on Tuesday, while temporary signage on the highway guided drivers onto the correct road.",
      "Golfers hitting the course at dawn as part of that event had to put their clubs through metal detectors as part of the security procedures for Trump's arrival.",
      "The day combined two things close to Trump's heart: golf and Scotland. His mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, was born on the Isle of Lewis and eventually went to New York. She died in 2000 at age 88.",
      "\u201cMy mother loved Scotland,\u201d Trump said Monday during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at another of his golf courses, Turnberry, on Scotland's southern coast. \u201cIt's different when your mother was born here.\u201d",
      "He appeared to be in such a good mood that he even praised the throng of journalist who had assembled to cover the event, saying there was no \u201cfake news\u201d on the course.",
      "\u201cI didn't use the word \u2018fake news\u2019 one time, not one time,\u201d Trump said.",

But the trip has featured a lot of golf, and the presidential visit is sure to raise the new course's profile.",

      "He lost the case and was eventually ordered to pay legal costs for bringing it \u2014 and the issue still enrages him. During the meeting with Starmer, Trump called windmills \u201cugly monsters\u201d and suggested they were part of \u201cthe most expensive form of energy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI restricted windmills in the United States because they also kill all your birds,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf you shoot a bald eagle in the United States, they put you in jail for five years. And windmills knock out hundreds of them. They don\u2019t do anything. Explain that.\u201d",

      "Trump golfed at Turnberry on Saturday, as protesters took to the streets, and on Sunday. He invited Starmer, who famously doesn\u2019t golf, aboard Air Force One so the prime minister could get a private tour of his Aberdeen properties before Tuesday\u2019s ceremonial opening.",
      "\u201cEven if you play badly, it\u2019s still good,\u201d Trump said of golfing on his course over the weekend. \u201cIf you had a bad day on the golf course, it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s better than other days.\u201d",

      "Eric Allen, known for his exceptional career as a cornerback, is being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame",
      "Among all of the impressive accomplishments that helped Eric Allen make it to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the fact that he maintained his elite level of play so he never had to move from cornerback in his 14 seasons stands out.",
      "From his first game as a rookie as part of Buddy Ryan's fierce defenses in Philadelphia in 1988 to his final game as a savvy veteran for the Oakland Raiders in 2001, Allen shut down opposing receivers as well as anybody.",
      "\u201cI take tremendous pride in that,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut to be able to be on the corner from day one to the last game of my career, being a starter and being an effective player, it means a lot. ... I\u2019m not a DB, I\u2019m a corner. I\u2019m not going to be all snobby. But it\u2019s different positions.\u201d",
      "And few played it as well as Allen and now he had gotten the ultimate recognition when he will be officially inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, on Saturday.",
      "\"I played against a lot of really good corners. I think Eric was one of the smartest I\u2019ve played against,\" said Rich Gannon, who played against Allen early in his career and was a teammate at the end with the Raiders when Allen and Charles Woodson would match up against Jerry Rice and Tim Brown in heated practice sessions.",
      "\u201cHe was really clever. He jumped certain routes, recognized certain things. He\u2019s one of those guys, if you\u2019re going to throw in his direction, you better see him. You just can\u2019t put your foot in the ground and think the receiver\u2019s got separation. He\u2019d bait you. He\u2019d act like he got beat or he was off. He had great recovery skill, good recovery speed. There just wasn\u2019t a lot of weakness in his game.\u201d",
      "Allen credits his preparation for his success that included six Pro Bowl berths, one All-Pro selection in 1989, two second-team selections and 54 interceptions.",
      "Allen grew up playing both ways and envisioned himself as being Marcus Allen, growing up in San Diego. Those running back skills paid dividends in the NFL with nine interceptions returned for touchdowns, including one in a playoff win for Philadelphia over New Orleans in the 1992 season and a league-leading four in the 1993 season alone.",
      "\"That always seemed like a requirement for the position, don\u2019t just intercept it but when you catch it, run. That\u2019s your opportunity to show your moves,\" he said. \u201cSo when you get the ball, it\u2019s your time to turn to Marcus Allen. It was a requirement. If you play the cornerback, if you catch the ball and you get to try and score.\u201d",
      "Allen\u2019s career started in Philadelphia in 1988 with his rookie season ending with a playoff loss in the famous \u201cFog Bowl\u201d game at Chicago. It ended with another famous playoff loss when the Raiders lost to New England in the \u201cTuck Rule\u201d game following the 2001 season.",

      "When coach Jon Gruden was traded away from Oakland a few weeks later, Allen decided it was time to retire and missed the Raiders run to the Super Bowl in 2002.",

      "The brain-eating amoeba enters the body when water is forced up the nose, like when someone jumps or dives in the water.",
      "It causes an infection that swells the brain and destroys tissue. Fewer than 10 cases are reported each year in the U.S., but almost all are fatal.",
      "Here are some things to know about the amoeba, its latest victim and other dangers on freshwater lakes:",
      "The amoeba's scientific name is Naegleria fowleri and it is most dangerous in very warm water, including in lakes and rivers in the southern part of the U.S. and other places with hot, sometimes dry summers like Pakistan and Australia.",
      "The amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerve in the nose. Once inside, it causes an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.",
      "Symptoms start as a fairly standard headache and nausea. By the time the pain becomes severe, it is almost always too late to save the infected person. Of the 167 cases reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the deaths happened within five days of getting sick, according to the CDC.",
      "Jaysen Carr went swimming at Lake Murray about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia over the July Fourth weekend.",
      "He got sick several days later and died on July 18.",
      "His father and mother had never heard of the amoeba before a doctor in tears told them what tests of his spinal fluid had found.",

      "Signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1970, NEPA requires federal agencies proposing actions such as building roads, bridges or energy projects to study how their project will affect the environment. Private companies are also frequently subject to NEPA standards when they apply for a permit from a federal agency.",
      "In recent years, the law has become increasingly important in requiring consideration of a project's possible contributions to climate change.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a really important function because otherwise we\u2019re just operating with blinders just to get the project done, without considering whether there are alternative solutions that might accomplish the same objective, but in a more environmentally friendly way,\" Park said.",
      "But business groups say NEPA routinely blocks important projects that often take five years or more to complete.",
      "\u201cOur broken permitting system has long been a national embarrassment,'' said Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Global Energy Institute. He called NEPA \u201ca blunt and haphazard tool\u201d that too often is used to block investment and economic development.",
      "The White House proposal comes as Congress is working on a permitting reform plan that would overhaul NEPA, addressing long-standing concerns from both parties that development projects -- including some for clean energy -- take too long to be approved.",
      "NEPA's strength \u2014 and usefulness \u2014 can depend on how it's interpreted by different administrations.",
      "Trump, a Republican, sought to weaken NEPA in his first term by limiting when environmental reviews are required and limiting the time for evaluation and public comment. Former Democratic President Joe Biden restored more rigorous reviews.",
      "In his second term, Trump has again targeted the law.",
      "An executive order that touched on environmental statutes has many agencies scrapping the requirement for a draft environmental impact statement.

Federal agencies still have to comply with other environmental laws, like the Endangered Species Act or Clean Air Act. NEPA has an often overlooked benefit of forcing coordination with those other laws, he said.",
      "A botanist by training, Mary O\u2019Brien was working with a small organization in Oregon in the 1980s to propose alternative techniques to successfully replant Douglas fir trees that had been clear-cut on federal lands. Aerially sprayed herbicides aimed at helping the conifers grow have not only been linked to health problems in humans but were also killing another species of tree, red alders, that were beneficial to the fir saplings, O\u2019Brien said.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service had maintained that the herbicides' impact on humans and red alders wasn\u2019t a problem. But under NEPA, a court required the agency to redo their analysis and they ultimately had to write a new environmental impact statement.",

      "The fishing boom follows the failure last year of the U.S., Russia, China and two dozen other governments to approve a new management plan that would have mandated spreading out the area in which krill can be caught and creating a California-sized reserve along the environmentally sensitive Antarctic Peninsula.",
      "In the first seven months of the 2024-25 season, krill fishing in Antarctica reached 518,568 tons, about 84% of the 620,000-ton limit that, once reached, will force the fishery to automatically close. In one hot spot, the catch through June 30 was nearly 60% higher than all of last year\u2019s haul, according to a report from the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, the international organization that manages the world's southernmost fishery.",
      "The report, which has not been publicly released and CCAMLR said contains confidential data, was shared with The AP by someone concerned about overfishing in Antarctica on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of the krill take is from an increasingly smaller area,\u201d said Capt. Peter Hammarstedt, campaign director for conservation group Sea Shepherd Global, which this year made its third voyage to Antarctica to document the fishery. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of a hunter saying that they\u2019re only killing 1% of the U.S.\u2019 deer population but leaving out that all of the deer were shot in Rhode Island.\u201d",
      "Krill is one of the most abundant marine species in the world, with an estimated biomass of 63 million metric tons. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill\u2019s Omega-3 rich oil \u2013 for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements \u2014 have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 industrial trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill \u2014 until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973.",
      "AP journalists traveled to the icy waters around Antarctica in 2023 and observed how factory ships trawl in close proximity to whales whose numbers are still recovering from a century of industrial culling that nearly drove them to extinction.",
      "Underscoring the competition between humans and whales, three humpback whales were found dead or seriously injured last year in the long, cylindrical nets deployed by the vessels to vacuum up the paper-clip sized crustacean.",
      "Officials have been negotiating for years a new management plan that would balance the growing market for krill with calls for greater protection of the Antarctic Peninsula, the continent's northernmost point and an area teeming with whales and, increasingly, tourists. Currently, less than 5% of the Southern Ocean is protected \u2014 well behind CCAMLR\u2019s target and a United Nations goal to preserve 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030.",
      "But a tentative deal fell apart at last year\u2019s CCAMLR meeting over a last minute proposal by the United Kingdom and Australia for an even lower catch limit than the one agreed to during talks, AP reported last year. China, objecting to the persistent Western demands, then withdrew its support for the marine reserve and refused to renew the existing management system.",
      "\u201cThe truth was it was the UK,\u201d Matts Johansen, chief executive of Norway's Aker BioMarine, the world's largest supplier of krill-based products, said at the United Nations Oceans conference in June. \u201cJust a couple days before the vote, the UK threw another suggestion and that's when the Chinese backed off.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office rejected that characterization and said the British government continues to push for a krill management strategy that better safeguards Antarctic marine species and vulnerable ecosystems.",
      "In the absence of a deal, restrictions adopted 15 years ago to spread out the catch limit expired, allowing the krill fleet to essentially fish anywhere at any time, including in smaller habitats preferred by whales and other animals such as penguins and seals.",

That\u2019s the equivalent of taking off the road 5 million cars every year.",

Activity in one popular fishing ground, denoted Sub-Area 48.1, appears to have more than doubled so far this season compared to the entire 2023-2024 season, according to the the U.S.-based group, which supports sustainable fishing.",
      "Javier Arata, the executive director the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies, whose members are responsible for 95% of the krill taken from Antarctica, said the catch limit that lapsed was always intended as an interim measure.",
      "His group supports the creation of marine protected areas in Antarctica. But it rejects waiting for a conservation deal to adopt \u201cready-to-go measures\u201d raising the quota, which he said can be much higher.",

      "Scientists in Mexico are testing innovative methods they hope can be employed to locate the overwhelming number of people missing due to cartel violence",
      "ZAPOPAN, Mexico -- First the scientists dress dead swine in clothes, then they dispose of the carcasses. Some they wrap in packing tape, others they chop up. They stuff the animals into plastic bags or wrap them in blankets. They cover them in lime or burn them. Some are buried alone, others in groups.",
      "Then they watch.",
      "The pigs are playing an unlikely role as proxies for humans in research to help find the staggering number of people who have gone missing in Mexico during decades of drug cartel violence.",
      "Families of the missing are usually left to look for their loved ones with little support from authorities. But now, government scientists are testing the newest satellite, geophysical and biological mapping techniques \u2014 along with the pigs \u2014 to offer clues that they hope could lead to the discovery of at least some of the bodies.",
      "The ranks of Mexico\u2019s missing exploded in the years following the launch of then-President Felipe Calder\u00f3n\u2019s war against drug cartels in 2006. A strategy that targeted the leaders of a handful of powerful cartels led to a splintering of organized crime and the multiplication of violence to control territory.",
      "With near complete impunity, owing to the complicity or inaction of the authorities, cartels found that making anyone they think is in their way disappear was better than leaving bodies in the street. Mexican administrations have sometimes been unwilling to recognize the problem and at other times are staggered by the scale of violence their justice system is unprepared to address.",
      "Mexico\u2019s disappeared could populate a small city. Official data in 2013 tallied 26,000 missing, but the count now surpasses 130,000 \u2014 more than any other Latin American nation. The United Nations has said there are indications that the disappearances are \u201cgeneralized or systematic.\u201d",
      "If the missing people are found \u2014 dead or alive \u2014 it is usually by their loved ones. Guided by information from witnesses, parents and siblings search for graves by walking through cartel territory, plunging a metal rod into the earth and sniffing for the scent of death.",
      "Around 6,000 clandestine graves have been found since 2007, and new discoveries are made all the time. Tens of thousands of remains have yet to be identified.",
      "Jalisco, which is home to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, has the largest number of people reported missing in Mexico: 15,500. In March, human bone fragments and hundreds of items of clothing were discovered at a cartel ranch in the state. Authorities denied it was the site of a mass grave.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Luis Silv\u00e1n, a coordinator of the mapping project and scientist at CentroGeo, a federal research institute focused on geospacial information, said Jalisco\u2019s disappeared are \u201cwhy we\u2019re here.\u201d",
      "The mapping project, launched in 2023, is a collaboration by Guadalajara University, Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University and the University of Oxford in England, alongside the Jalisco Search Commission, a state agency that organizes local searches with relatives.",
      "\u201cNo other country is pushing so strongly, so creatively\" to test and combine new techniques, said Derek Congram, a Canadian forensic anthropologist, whose expertise in geographic information systems inspired the Mexican project.",
      "Still, Congram warns, technology \u201cis not a panacea.\u201d",
      "\u201cNinety percent of searches are resolved with a good witness and digging,\u201d he said.",
      "Silv\u00e1n walks by a site where scientists buried 14 pigs about two years ago. He says they may not know how well the technology works, where and when it can be used, or under what conditions, for at least three years.",
      "\u201cFlowers came up because of the phosphorous at the surface, we didn\u2019t see that last year,\u201d he said as he took measurements at one of the gravesites. \u201cThe mothers who search say that that little yellow flower always blooms over the tombs and they use them as a guide.\u201d",

      "Pigs and humans are closely related, famously sharing about 98% of DNA. But for the mapping project, the physical similarities also matter. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, pigs resemble humans in size, fat distribution and the structure and thickness of skin.",
      "A big Colombian drone mounted with a hyperspectral camera flies over the pig burial site. Generally used by mining companies, the camera measures light reflected by substances in the soil, including nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and shows how they vary as the pigs decompose. The colorful image it produces offers clues of what to look for in the hunt for graves.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t pure science,\u201d Silv\u00e1n said. \u201cIt is science and action. Everything learned has to be applied immediately, rather than wait for it to mature, because there\u2019s urgency.\u201d",
      "Researchers also employ thermal drones, laser scanners and other gadgets to register anomalies, underground movements and electrical currents. One set of graves is encased behind a pane of transparent acrylic, providing a window for scientists to observe the pigs\u2019 decomposition in real time.",
      "The Jalisco commission compares and analyzes flies, beetles, plants and soil recovered from the human and pig graves.",
      "Each grave is a living \u201cmicro ecosystem,\u201d said Tunuari Ch\u00e1vez, the commission's director of context analysis.",
      "Triggered by the disappearance of 43 students in 2014, Silv\u00e1n and his colleagues started gathering information about ground-penetrating radar, electric resistivity and satellite imagery from around the world. They studied University of Tennessee research on human corpses buried at a \u201cbody farm.\u201d They looked at grave-mapping techniques used in the Balkans, Colombia and Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWhat good is science or technology if it doesn\u2019t solve problems?\u201d he said.",
      "They learned new applications of satellite analysis, then began their first experiments burying pigs and studying the substances criminals use to dispose of bodies. They found lime is easily detected, but hydrocarbons, hydrochloric acid and burned flesh are not.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s team worked to combine the science with what they knew about how the cartels operate. For example, they determined that disappearances in Jalisco commonly happened along cartel routes between Pacific ports, drug manufacturing facilities and the U.S. border, and that most of the missing are found in the same municipality where they disappeared.",
      "The experience of the families of the missing also informs the research.",
      "Some observed that graves are often found under trees whose roots grow vertically, so those digging the graves can remain in the shade. Mothers of missing loved ones invited by researchers to visit one of the pig burial sites were able to identify most of the unmarked graves by sight alone, because of the plants and soil placement, Silv\u00e1n said.",
      "\u201cThe knowledge flows in both directions,\u201d he said.",
      "Maribel Cede\u00f1o, who has been looking for her missing brother for four years, said she believes the drones and other technology will be helpful.",
      "\u201cI never imagined being in this situation, finding bodies, becoming such an expert,\u201d she said of her quest.",
      "H\u00e9ctor Flores has been searching for his son since 2021. He questions why so much time and effort has been invested in methods that have not led to concrete discoveries, when the families have proven track records with little official support.",
      "Although the research has not yet concluded, the Jalisco Search Commission is already using a thermal drone, a laser scanner and a multispectral camera to help families look for their missing relatives in some cases. But it is unclear whether authorities across Mexico will ever be willing to use, or able to afford, the high-tech aides.",
      "Congram, the forensic scientist, said researchers are aware of the limitations of technology, but that \u201cyou always have to try, fail, fail again and keep trying.\u201d",

      "People with experimental brain implants often turn to the treatment as a last resort, hoping to improve their health when everything else has failed",
      "Carol Seeger finally escaped her debilitating depression with an experimental treatment that placed electrodes in her brain and a pacemaker-like device in her chest. But when its batteries stopped working, insurance wouldn\u2019t pay to fix the problem and she sank back into a dangerous darkness.",
      "She worried for her life, asking herself: \u201cWhy am I putting myself through this?\u201d",
      "Seeger\u2019s predicament highlights a growing problem for hundreds of people with experimental neural implants, including those for depression, quadriplegia and other conditions. Although these patients take big risks to advance science, there's no guarantee that their devices will be maintained \u2014 particularly after they finish participating in clinical trials \u2014 and no mechanism requiring companies or insurers to do so.",
      "A research project led by Gabriel L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz, a Harvard University scientist, aimed to change that by creating partnerships between players in the burgeoning implant field to overcome barriers to device access and follow-up care.",
      "But the cancellation of hundreds of National Institutes of Health grants by the Trump administration this year left the project in limbo, dimming hope for Seeger and others like her who wonder what will happen to their health and progress.",
      "Unlike medications, implanted devices often require parts, maintenance, batteries and surgeries when changes are needed. Insurance typically covers such expenses for federally approved devices considered medically necessary, but not experimental ones.",
      "A procedure to replace a battery alone can cost more than $15,000 without insurance, L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz said.",
      "While companies stand to profit from research, \u201cthere\u2019s really nothing that helps ensure that device manufacturers have to provide any of these parts or cover any kind of maintenance,\u201d said L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz.",
      "Some companies also move on to newer versions of devices or abandon the research altogether, which can leave patients in an uncertain place.",
      "Medtronic, the company that made the deep brain stimulation, or DBS, technology Seeger used, said in a statement that every study is different and that the company puts patient safety first when considering care after studies end.",
      "People consider various possibilities when they join a clinical trial.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration requires the informed consent process to include a description of \u201creasonably foreseeable risks and discomforts to the participant,\u201d a spokesperson said. However, the FDA doesn\u2019t require trial plans to include procedures for long-term device follow-up and maintenance, although the spokesperson stated that the agency has requested those in the past.",
      "While some informed consent forms say devices will be removed at a study\u2019s end, L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz said removal is ethically problematic when a device is helping a patient. Plus, he said, some trial participants told him and his colleagues that they didn\u2019t remember everything discussed during the consent process, partly because they were so focused on getting better.",

      "Even if companies still make replacement parts for older devices, she added, \u201cavailability and accessibility are entirely different things,\u201d given most people can\u2019t afford continued care without insurance coverage.",
      "Seeger, whose device was implanted in 2012 at Emory, said she went without a working device for around four months when the insurance coverage her wife\u2019s job at Emory provided wouldn\u2019t pay for battery replacement surgery. Neither would Medicare, which generally only covers DBS for FDA-approved uses.",
      "With her research team at Emory advocating for her, Seeger ultimately got financial help from the hospital's indigent care program and paid a few thousand dollars out of pocket.",
      "She now has a rechargeable battery, and the device has been working well. But at any point, she said, that could change.",

      "Ellis said any delay in addressing the thorny issues around experimental brain devices hurts patients.",

      "Archaeologists in central Israel are excavating one of the world's oldest known burial sites, dating back 100,000 years",
      "SHOHAM, Israel -- Archaeologists believe they have found one of the oldest burial sites in the world at a cave in Israel, where the well-preserved remains of early humans dating back some 100,000 years were carefully arranged in pits.",
      "The findings at Tinshemet Cave in central Israel, published in an academic journal earlier this year, build on previous discoveries in northern Israel and add to a growing understanding of the origins of human burial.",
      "Of particular interest to archaeologists are objects found beside the remains that may have been used during ceremonies to honor the dead and could shed light on how our ancient ancestors thought about spirituality and the afterlife.",
      "\u201cThis is an amazing revolutionary innovation for our species,\" said Yossi Zaidner, one of the directors of the Tinshemet excavation and a professor of archaeology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \"It\u2019s actually the first time we are starting to use this behavior.\u201d",
      "Archaeologists working at Tinshemet since 2016 have discovered the remains of five early humans that date back to around 110,000 to 100,000 years ago, according to various technologies.",
      "The skeletons were discovered in pits and carefully arranged in a fetal position, which is known as a burial position, said Zaidner. Many were found with objects, such as basalt pebbles, animal remains or fragments of ochre, a reddish pigment made from iron-rich rocks.",
      "These objects, some sourced from hundreds of kilometers (miles) away, had no known practical use for daily life, so experts believe they were part of rituals meant to honor the dead.",
      "Tinshemet Cave is a dark slash in central Israel\u2019s rolling hills filled with squeaking fruit bats. Inside and around the cave is an unassuming stone mound which Zaidner calls \u201cone of the three or four most important sites for study of human evolution and behavior during the Paleolithic time.\u201d",
      "The Paleolithic era, also known as the Stone Age because of the onset of stone tools, lasted from as early as 3.3 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago. Tinshemet Cave is from the Middle Paleolithic era, roughly between 250,000 to 30,000 years ago.",
      "Some of the Tinshemet researchers' core findings were published in March in Nature Human Behavior. A key discovery were the remains of five early humans, including two full skeletons and three isolated skulls with other bones and teeth. Also of note were more than 500 differently sized fragments of red and orange ochre, a pigment created by heating iron-rich stones to a certain temperature \u2014 evidence that early humans had the means to create decorative objects.",
      "\u201cHere we see a really complex set of behaviors, not related to just food and surviving,\u201d Zaidner said.",
      "Using hand chisels and delicate, pen-sized pneumatic drills that resemble dental tools, archaeologists will need many more years to excavate the site. The field work, which started in 2016, is usually done over the summer months. This year, a dozen archaeology undergraduate and graduate students fanned out across the site, painstakingly documenting and removing each fragment of tool, object or bone.",
      "At the entrance to the cave, the skull of one of the early humans is slowly emerging from the rock sediment; it will be years before it is fully excavated.",

      "Tinshemet is exceptionally important to archaeologists because the local climate preserved the bones, tools, and ornaments in good condition, unlike many other parts of the world where these items were lost to time, said Christian Tryon, a professor at the University of Connecticut and a research associate at the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The skeletons and objects were so well preserved because of ash from frequent fires, likely for rituals. This large amount of ash mixed with rainfall and Israel's acidic limestone, creating optimal conditions for perseveration. One skeleton was in such good condition archaeologists could see how the fingers were interwoven, hands clasped beneath the head.",
      "Tryon said the Tinshemet findings are bolstering earlier discoveries from two similar burial sites dating back to the same period in northern Israel \u2014 Skhul Cave and Qafzeh Cave. Skhul Cave was excavated almost 100 years ago, and Qafzeh Cave mostly around 50 years ago, when archaeological practices were more haphazard.",
      "\u201cThere were so many uncertainties with those sites, but this is confirming it\u2019s a pattern we know, and they\u2019re really nailing down the dates,\u201d Tryon said.",
      "Tinshemet has helped archaeologists conclude that burial practices started to become more widespread during this time, representing a shift in how early humans treated their dead.",
      "Some archaeologists believe intentional burials started earlier. In South Africa, the Homo naledi species \u2013 an ancient cousin of Homo sapiens \u2013 may have been intentionally placing their dead in caves as early as 200,000 years ago. But many archaeologists said the findings are controversial and there is not enough evidence to support the claim of intentional burials.",
      "In ancient times, Israel was a bridge between Neanderthals from Europe and Homo sapiens from Africa. Archaeologists have identified other subgroups of early humans in the area, and believe the groups interacted and may have interbred.",
      "Experts have been studying the two full skeletons brought from Tinshemet for years, but it\u2019s still unclear if they were Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, a hybrid population or another group altogether.",
      "The mix of subgroups created opportunities for different groups of early humans to exchange knowledge or express identity, said Zaidner. It\u2019s around this time that archaeologists first see examples of early jewelry or body painting, which could be ways early humans started outwardly belonging to a certain group, drawing boundaries between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel Hershkovitz, a physical anthropologist at Tel Aviv University and the co-director of the Tinshemet site, said the concept of cemeteries in prehistoric life is important because it symbolizes \u201ca kind of a territory.\u201d",
      "He said that same kind of claim over land where ancestors are buried still echoes in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of claim you make to the neighbors, saying \u2019this is my territory, this part of the land belongs to my father and my forefather' and so on and so on.\u201d",

      "Tech companies looking to sell their artificial intelligence technology to the federal government must now contend with a new regulatory hurdle: proving their chatbots aren't \u201cwoke.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump's sweeping new plan to counter China in achieving \u201cglobal dominance\u201d in AI promises to cut regulations and cement American values into the AI tools increasingly used at work and home.",
      "But one of Trump\u2019s three AI executive orders signed Wednesday \u2014 the one \u201cpreventing woke AI in the federal government\u201d \u2014 marks the first time the U.S. government has explicitly tried to shape the ideological behavior of AI.",
      "Several leading providers of the AI language models targeted by the order \u2014 products like Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot \u2014 have so far been silent on Trump's anti-woke directive, which still faces a study period before it gets into official procurement rules.",
      "While the tech industry has largely welcomed Trump's broader AI plans, the anti-woke order forces the industry to leap into a culture war battle \u2014 or try their best to quietly avoid it.",
      "\u201cIt will have massive influence in the industry right now,\u201d especially as tech companies are already capitulating to other Trump administration directives, said civil rights advocate Alejandra Montoya-Boyer, senior director of The Leadership Conference\u2019s Center for Civil Rights and Technology.",
      "The move also pushes the tech industry to abandon years of work to combat the pervasive forms of racial and gender bias that studies and real-world examples have shown to be baked into AI systems.",
      "\u201cFirst off, there's no such thing as woke AI,\u201d Montoya-Boyer said. \u201cThere\u2019s AI technology that discriminates and then there\u2019s AI technology that actually works for all people.\u201d",
      "Molding the behaviors of AI large language models is challenging because of the way they\u2019re built and the inherent randomness of what they produce. They\u2019ve been trained on most of what\u2019s on the internet, reflecting the biases of all the people who\u2019ve posted commentary, edited a Wikipedia entry or shared images online.",
      "\u201cThis will be extremely difficult for tech companies to comply with,\u201d said former Biden administration official Jim Secreto, who was deputy chief of staff to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, an architect of many of President Joe Biden's AI industry initiatives. \u201cLarge language models reflect the data they\u2019re trained on, including all the contradictions and biases in human language.\u201d",
      "Tech workers also have a say in how they're designed, from the global workforce of annotators who check their responses to the Silicon Valley engineers who craft the instructions for how they interact with people.",
      "Trump's order targets those \u201ctop-down\u201d efforts at tech companies to incorporate what it calls the \u201cdestructive\u201d ideology of diversity, equity and inclusion into AI models, including \u201cconcepts like critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism.\u201d",
      "The directive has invited comparison to China's heavier-handed efforts to ensure that generative AI tools reflect the core values of the ruling Communist Party. Secreto said the order resembles China\u2019s playbook in \u201cusing the power of the state to stamp out what it sees as disfavored viewpoints.\"",
      "The method is different, with China relying on direct regulation by auditing AI models, approving them before they are deployed and requiring them to filter out banned content such as the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 1989.",
      "Trump's order doesn't call for any such filters, relying on tech companies to instead show that their technology is ideologically neutral by disclosing some of the internal policies that guide the chatbots.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is taking a softer but still coercive route by using federal contracts as leverage,\u201d Secreto said. \u201cThat creates strong pressure for companies to self-censor in order to stay in the government\u2019s good graces and keep the money flowing.\u201d",
      "The order's call for \u201ctruth-seeking\u201d AI echoes the language of the president's one-time ally and adviser Elon Musk, who has made it the mission of the Grok chatbot made by his company xAI.",

      "Teenagers are turning to AI for advice, guidance and conversation",
      "As artificial intelligence technology becomes part of daily life, adolescents are turning to chatbots for advice, guidance and conversation. The appeal is clear: Chatbots are patient, never judgmental, supportive and always available.",
      "That worries experts who say the booming AI industry is largely unregulated and that many parents have no idea about how their kids are using AI tools or the extent of personal information they are sharing with chatbots.",
      "New research shows more than 70% of American teenagers have used AI companions and more than half converse with them regularly. The study by Common Sense Media focused on \u201cAI companions,\u201d like Character. AI, Nomi and Replika, which it defines as \u201cdigital friends or characters you can text or talk with whenever you want,\u201d versus AI assistants or tools like ChatGPT, though it notes they can be used the same way.",
      "It\u2019s important that parents understand the technology. Experts suggest some things parents can do to help protect their kids:",
      "\u2014 Start a conversation, without judgment, says Michael Robb, head researcher at Common Sense Media. Approach your teen with curiosity and basic questions: \u201cHave you heard of AI companions?\u201d \u201cDo you use apps that talk to you like a friend?\u201d Listen and understand what appeals to your teen before being dismissive or saying you\u2019re worried about it.",
      "\u2014 Help teens recognize that AI companions are programmed to be agreeable and validating. Explain that\u2019s not how real relationships work and that real friends with their own points of view can help navigate difficult situations in ways that AI companions cannot.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that's really concerning is not only what's happening on screen but how much time it\u2019s taking kids away from relationships in real life,\u201d says Mitch Prinstein, chief of psychology at the American Psychological Association. \u201cWe need to teach kids that this is a form of entertainment. It's not real, and it's really important they distinguish it from reality and should not have it replace relationships in your actual life.\u201d",
      "The APA recently put out a health advisory on AI and adolescent well-being, and tips for parents.",
      "\u2014 Parents should watch for signs of unhealthy attachments.",
      "\u201cIf your teen is preferring AI interactions over real relationships or spending hours talking to AI companions, or showing that they are becoming emotionally distressed when separated from them \u2014 those are patterns that suggest AI companions might be replacing rather than complementing human connection,\u201d Robb says.",
      "\u2014 Parents can set rules about AI use, just like they do for screen time and social media. Have discussions about when and how AI tools can and cannot be used. Many AI companions are designed for adult use and can mimic romantic, intimate and role-playing scenarios.",

      "\u201cWe don\u2019t believe AI can do everything. Nishijinori is a massive, complicated industry and so it starts with figuring out where AI can help out,\u201d said Rekimoto, also a professor at the University of Tokyo.",

      "To Fukuoka, some of AI\u2019s ideas are interesting but simply off. The difference between AI and the human effort is that the former can come up with multiple suggestions in a matter of seconds.",

      "A federal judge says Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide must continue to be reimbursed for Medicaid funding",
      "A federal judge on Monday ruled Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide must continue to be reimbursed for Medicaid funding as the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider fights President Donald Trump\u2019s administration over efforts to defund the organization in his signature tax legislation.",
      "The new order replaces a previous edict handed down by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston last week. Talwani initially granted a preliminary injunction specifically blocking the government from cutting Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood members that didn\u2019t provide abortion care or didn\u2019t meet a threshold of at least $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in a given year.",
      "\u201cPatients are likely to suffer adverse health consequences where care is disrupted or unavailable,\u201d Talwani wrote in her Monday order. \u201cIn particular, restricting Members\u2019 ability to provide healthcare services threatens an increase in unintended pregnancies and attendant complications because of reduced access to effective contraceptives, and an increase in undiagnosed and untreated STIs.\u201d",
      "A provision in Trump\u2019s tax bill instructed the federal government to end Medicaid payments for one year to abortion providers that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023, even to those like Planned Parenthood that also offer medical services like contraception, pregnancy tests and STD testing.",
      "Although Planned Parenthood is not specifically named in the statute, which went into effect July 4, the organization\u2019s leaders say it was meant to affect their nearly 600 centers in 48 states. However, a major medical provider in Maine and likely others have also been hit.",
      "In her Monday order, Talwani said that the court was \u201cnot enjoining the federal government from regulating abortion and is not directing the federal government to fund elective abortions or any healthcare service not otherwise eligible for Medicaid coverage.\u201d Instead, Talwani said that her decision would block the federal government from excluding groups like Planned Parenthood from Medicaid reimbursements when they have demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success in their legal challenge.",
      "In its lawsuit, Planned Parenthood had argued that they would be at risk of closing nearly 200 clinics in 24 states if they are cut off from Medicaid funds. They estimated this would result in more than 1 million patients losing care.",

      "HONOLULU -- Honolulu is not alone in its effort to sue fossil fuel companies to hold them accountable for climate change harms, but the city's lawsuit is further along than similar litigation across the country. A hearing on Tuesday will indicate how these fights play out in court.",
      "In 2020, Hawaii's capital city sued major oil companies, including ExxonMobil, Shell and Chevron, arguing they knew for nearly half a century that fossil fuel products create greenhouse gas pollution that warms the planet and changes the climate. The companies have also profited from the consumption of oil, coal and natural gas while deceiving the public about the role of their products in causing a global climate crisis, the lawsuit says.",
      "Honolulu's lawsuit blames the companies for the sea level rise around the island of Oahu's world-famous coastline. It also warns that hurricanes, heatwaves and other extreme weather will be more frequent, along with ocean warming that will reduce fish stocks and kill coral reefs that tourists love to snorkel over.",
      "The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of damages. Attorneys and media representatives for most of the companies didn't immediately respond to emails and phone messages from The Associated Press seeking comment on the lawsuit.",

Honolulu's claims are based on allegations that have been publicly known for decades, the defense motion for summary judgment says.",
      "\u201cThe issue of climate change and how to tackle it has long been part of public discussion and ongoing scientific research and debate for many decades,\u201d a Shell spokesperson said in an email. \u201cThere is a vast public record of media articles, scientific journals and government reports for well over 50 years that make this clear. The suggestion that the plaintiffs were somehow unaware of climate change is simply not credible.\u201d",
      "While the case is still far from trial, it's much closer than some 30 similar lawsuits nationwide brought by other states, cities and counties. Lawyer arguments and the judge's questions on Tuesday will give a sense of how both sides will present their cases, said Michael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.",
      "\u201cThe first trial in any of these cases will be very significant,\" he said. \u201cIt will get a large amount of nationwide or even global attention because the oil companies have not yet had to take the stand and defend themselves in a trial.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- Lawyers are set to deliver closing arguments Tuesday in the trial of a Colorado dentist accused of killing his wife by gradually poisoning her.",
      "James Craig is charged with murder in the death of Angela Craig in suburban Denver in 2023. He is also accused of trying to fabricate evidence in the case to make it look like she killed herself and of asking a fellow jail inmate to kill the detective who led the investigation into his wife's death.",
      "Angela Craig, who had six children with James Craig, died in 2023 during her third trip to the hospital in a little over a week. Toxicology tests later determined the 43-year-old died of poisoning from cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, an ingredient found in over-the-counter eye drops.",
      "Police previously said James Craig purchased a variety of poisons before his wife's death and put some in the protein shakes he made for her. During the trial, prosecutors alleged that he also gave her a fatal dose of cyanide as she lay in her hospital bed on March 15, 2023, as doctors tried to figure out what was ailing her. She was declared brain dead soon afterward.",
      "James Craig didn't testify and his lawyers didn't present any witnesses \u2014 and it wasn't required. Instead, in opening statements and in their questioning of prosecution witnesses, Craig's lawyers seemed to suggest that Angela Craig may have taken her own life and faulted police for focusing solely on James Craig as a suspect.",
      "In notes that police found on James Craig's phone, the dentist said Angela Craig asked him to help kill her with poison when he sought a divorce after having affairs. In the document, which was labeled \u201ctimeline,\u201d Craig said he eventually agreed to purchase and prepare poisons for her to take but not administer them. Craig said that he put cyanide in some of the antibiotic capsules she had been taking and also prepared a syringe containing cyanide.",
      "According to that timeline, Craig wrote that just before she had to go to the hospital on March 15, 2023, she must have ingested a mixture containing tetrahydrozoline, the eye drop ingredient, because she became lethargic and weak. Then, he wrote, she took the antibiotic laced with cyanide that he prepared for her.",

Pray said his sister bent over and couldn't hold herself up after taking the medicine. He and his wife then took Angela Craig to the hospital.",
      "The lead investigator, Detective Bobbi Olson, testified that James Craig's timeline account differed from statements he had made to others about what happened, including accusing Angela Craig of setting him up to make it look like he had killed her.",
      "The defense introduced into evidence Angela Craig's journal in which she talked about struggles in their marriage in previous years and her husband's infidelity. In one entry she wrote, \u201cHe doesn't love me and I don't blame him.\u201d The journal ended in 2018 and did not include any mentions of suicide, Olson said.",
      "In opening statements, one of Craig's attorneys, Ashley Whitham, repeatedly described Angela Craig as \u201cbroken,\u201d partly by Craig\u2019s infidelity and her desire to stay married, since they were part of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",
      "Angela Craig's sister, Toni Kofoed, pushed back against that suggestion. She testified that her sister had a \u201cbroken heart\u201d because of the affairs, but not a \u201cbroken mind.\"",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Two weeks after Jaysen Carr spent the Fourth of July swimming and riding on a boat on one of South Carolina's most popular lakes, he was dead from an amoeba that lives in the warm water and entered his brain through his nose.",

      "They found out when a doctor, in tears, told them the diagnosis after what seemed like a fairly regular headache and nausea took a serious turn.",
      "Jaysen, 12, fought for a week before dying on July 18, making him one of about 160 people known to have died from the amoeba in the U.S. in the past 60 years.",
      "As they grieve their son, the boy's parents said they were stunned to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn't closed and no water testing was performed. If they hadn\u2019t spoken up, they wonder if anyone would have even known what happened.",
      "\u201cI can't believe we don't have our son. The result of him being a child was losing his life. That does not sit well. And I am terrified it will happen to someone else,\" Clarence Carr told The Associated Press as his wife sat beside him, hugging a stuffed tiger that had a recording of their middle child's heartbeat.",
      "Jaysen loved sports. He played football and baseball. He loved people, too. As soon as he met you, he was your friend, his father said. He was smart enough to have skipped a grade in school and to play several instruments in his middle school band in Columbia.",
      "\u201cHe either loved you or he just didn't know you,\u201d his father said. \u201cHe was the type of person who could go to a jump park and five minutes later say, \u2018This is my friend James.\u2019\u201d",

      "The amoeba was in his brain, already causing an infection and destroying brain tissue. It entered through his nose as water was forced deep into his nasal passages, possibly from one of the times Jaysen jumped into the water. It then traveled along his olfactory nerve into his brain.",

      "The trial of James Craig, a Colorado dentist accused of killing his wife Angela Craig by gradually poisoining her, is winding down",
      "DENVER -- DENVER (AP) \u2014 The trial of James Craig, a Colorado dentist accused of killing his wife Angela Craig by gradually poisoning her, is wrapping up. Lawyers are set to deliver closing arguments Tuesday before jurors begin deliberations.",
      "Jurors have heard from some of Angela Craig's relatives and also women James Craig had been having affairs with, all called by prosecutors. James Craig didn\u2019t testify and his lawyers didn\u2019t present any witnesses, which they\u2019re not required to.",
      "Angela Craig, 43, was a mother of six children who friends and family say was devoted to her family. She was the youngest of 10 siblings herself and a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Described as organized and dependable, she had taken over her mother\u2019s role as the genealogist for her birth family, an important role in their faith. Her older brother Mark Pray said she had been \u201chappy and positive\u201d since she was a child. But her sister Toni Kofoed testified that her sister had confided in her about struggles she was having in her marriage. However, pushing back against defense suggestions that her sister may have killed herself, Kofoed said her sister had a \u201cbroken heart\u201d but not a \u201cbroken mind.\u201d",
      "Angela Craig died in 2023 during her third trip to the hospital in a little over a week. Toxicology tests later determined she died of poisoning from cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, an ingredient found in over-the-counter eye drops. Early on, James Craig had purchased a variety of poisons before his wife's death and had put some in the protein shakes he made for her, according to police. During the trial, prosecutors alleged that he also gave her a dose of cyanide as she lay in her hospital bed on March 15, 2023, as doctors tried to figure out what was ailing her. She was declared brain dead soon afterward and never recovered.",
      "In a notes file later found on James Craig\u2019s phone by police, he said Angela Craig had asked him to help kill her with poison when he asked for a divorce after having affairs. In the document, which was labeled \u201ctimeline,\u201d Craig said that he had eventually agreed to purchase and prepare poisons for her to take, but not administer them. Craig said that he had put cyanide in some of the antibiotic capsules she had been taking and also prepared a syringe containing cyanide.",
      "According to his timeline, Craig wrote that just before she had to go to the hospital on March 15, 2023, she must have ingested a mixture containing the tetrahydrozoline, the eye drop ingredient, because she became lethargic and weak, before then taking the antibiotic laced with cyanide that he said he prepared for her. Mark Pray, who was visiting to help the Craig family because of his sister's mysterious illness, testified that he gave Angela Craig the capsules after being instructed to do so by James Craig, who was not at home. Pray said his sister bent over and couldn't hold herself up after taking the medicine. He and his wife then took her to the hospital.",

      "The defense argues that the evidence doesn't show that James Craig poisoned and killed his wife and have seemed to suggest that Angela Craig may have taken her own life. They introduced into evidence Angela Craig's journal in which she talks about the struggles in their marriage in previous years and her husband's infidelity. In one entry she wrote, \u201cHe doesn't love me and I don't blame him.\u201d The journal ended in 2018 and did not include any mentions of suicide, Olson said.",

A colleague convinced her to invest it in a retirement account, and ever since, she\u2019s stashed away whatever she could. The investments dipped at first during the Great Recession but eventually started growing.

      "He eventually put the knife down and Kolakowski said he jumped on the man, restraining him until police quickly arrived.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t hesitate at all,\u201d said Kolakowski, speaking from his home in nearby Kent City. Though he was wary of being stabbed himself, he said, \u201cI just kept going.\u201d",

      "The National Transportation Safety Board will hold three days of hearings on the fatal midair collision between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter",
      "WASHINGTON -- The National Transportation Safety Board will hold three days of hearings starting Wednesday on January's midair collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter over the nation's capital that killed 67 people.",
      "The goal: Pinpoint exactly what went wrong and what can be done to avoid similar midair crashes between passenger planes and military aircraft. The accident was the nation\u2019s deadliest plane crash since November 2001.",
      "The hearings in Washington will involve NTSB board members, investigators and witnesses. Panels will focus on military helicopter routes in the Washington area, collision avoidance technology and training for air traffic controllers at Ronald Reagan National Airport, among other subjects.",
      "NTSB officials have already said the FAA failed to recognize a concerning pattern after there were 85 near misses in Washington airspace in just three years. The FAA has since banned some helicopter routes to make sure helicopters and planes no longer share the same airspace, but there have still been additional near misses in recent months.",
      "Investigators have also said that the Army helicopter may have had inaccurate altitude readings, and the crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers.",
      "Meanwhile, federal officials have raised concerns over the nation's overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system. During January's mid-air crash above Washington, one controller was handing both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport.",
      "The hearings come at a time of heightened scrutiny of the safety of air travel amid the growing list of aircraft tragedies, mishaps and near misses in 2025. They include an Air India plane crash in June that killed at least 260 people as well as two unrelatedclose calls in the U.S. this month in which passenger jets took evasive action to avoid military planes.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the crash, the investigation so far and other notable aircraft incidents this year.",
      "American Airlines Flight 5342 from Wichita, Kansas, was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members as it approached to land on a clear night at Ronald Reagan National Airport. Nearby, the Army Black Hawk, with three soldiers on board, was practicing emergency evacuation routes that would be used to ferry out key government officials in an emergency.",
      "Investigators have said the helicopter crew was wearing night-vision goggles that would have limited their peripheral vision.",
      "A few minutes before the twin-engine jet was to land, air traffic controllers asked if it could use a shorter runway. The pilots agreed, and flight-tracking sites show the plane turned to adjust its approach. The FAA has since permanently banned that particular helicopter route when planes are using that runway.",
      "Shortly before the collision, a controller got an alert saying the plane and Black Hawk were converging and asked the helicopter if it had the jet in sight. The military pilot said yes and asked for \u201cvisual separation\u201d with the jet for a second time, allowing it to fly closer than if the pilots couldn\u2019t see the plane.",
      "Controllers approved the request roughly 20 seconds before the collision.",
      "The NTSB has said there were 85 dangerous close calls between planes and helicopters near Reagan National in the three years before the crash, and collision alarms had been ordering pilots to take evasive action at least once a month since 2011.",
      "NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters in February that the Black Hawk\u2019s cockpit recorder suggested an incomplete radio transmission may have left the crew unable to hear air traffic control tell them, just before the crash, to move behind the jet. She said the crew was unable to hear the words \u201cpass behind the\u201d because its microphone key was pressed.",
      "The radio altitude of the helicopter was 278 feet (85 meters) at the time, which would put it above its 200-foot (61-meter) limit for that location.",

      "Cockpit conversations a few minutes before the crash indicate that the crew may not have had accurate altitude readings, with the helicopter\u2019s pilot calling out that they were at 300 feet (91 meters) but the instructor pilot saying 400 feet (122 meters), Homendy said.",
      "That generation of Black Hawks typically has two types of altimeters: one relying on barometric pressure and the other on radio frequency signals bounced off the ground. Helicopter pilots typically rely on barometric readings while flying, but the helicopter\u2019s black box captures its radio altitude.",
      "Almost immediately after the crash, President Donald Trump faulted the helicopter for flying too high. He also blamed federal diversity and inclusion efforts, particularly regarding air traffic controllers. When pressed by reporters, the president could not back up those claims. A few days later, he blamed an \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system.",
      "January\u2019s crash prompted the Federal Aviation Administration in March to announce that helicopters would be permanently restricted from flying on the same route where the collision occurred.",
      "However, concerns over Washington\u2019s airspace have persisted. On May 1, military air traffic controllers lost contact with an Army helicopter for about 20 seconds as it neared the Pentagon on a flight that caused two commercial jets to abort their landings. After that incident, the Army paused all flights into and out of the Pentagon as it works with the FAA to address safety issues.",
      "The Army identified the Black Hawk crew as Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, 28, of Durham, North Carolina; Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O\u2019Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland. O\u2019Hara was the crew chief, and Eaves and Lobach were pilots.",
      "Among the jet\u2019s passengers were several members of the Skating Club of Boston who were returning from a development camp for elite junior skaters that followed the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita. A figure skating tribute event in Washington raised $1.2 million for the crash victims\u2019 families.",
      "Others included a group of hunters returning from a guided trip in Kansas; four members of a steamfitters\u2019 union in suburban Maryland; nine students and parents from schools in Fairfax County, Virginia; and two Chinese nationals.",

      "On Feb. 6 a small commuter aircraft went down off western Alaska, killing 10.",

      "July included at least three fatal plane crashes. Two student pilots died when their single-engine planes crashed in midair south of Steinbach, in the Canadian province of Manitoba. A small plane crashed shortly after taking off from London Southend Airport, killing four people. A North Carolina family of four, including two school-age children, died when their small plane crashed as they flew back from Florida.",

      "About 80 cows hoofed it to their new home, the Dairy Cattle Teaching and Research Center, a $75 million facility the East Lansing school says will allow agriculture, veterinary and other students to learn on a modern farm that\u2019s equipped to replicate the most high-tech operations in the world.",

      "The new complex is significantly larger than the existing dairy farm, which was constructed in the 1960s and was so limited in space and equipment that researchers have a backlog of up to two years on funded projects.",
      "The existing MSU Dairy Cattle Teaching and Research Center currently houses 250 dairy cattle and supports the research of faculty in the colleges of Agriculture and Natural Resources and Veterinary Medicine. The new facility features a 165,000-square-foot cattle barn that will expand research capacity by increasing herd size to 680. Those cows will arrive in batches in the coming weeks and months. The new space also includes modernized barns, feed centers, milking parlors and labs.",

      "Federal judges are weighing a request to require Alabama to submit its next congressional map for preclearance",
      "Federal judges on Tuesday sharply questioned lawyers on a request to make Alabama subject again to the preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act after courts ruled the state intentionally diluted the voting strength of Black residents.",
      "Black voters and civil rights organizations, who brought a lawsuit that gave Alabama a new congressional map, are asking a three-judge panel to require any new congressional plans drawn in the next seven years go through federal review. The Alabama attorney general and the U.S. Department of Justice oppose the request.",
      "The Voting Rights Act for decades required states with a history of discrimination \u2014 including many in the South \u2014 to get federal approval before changing the way they hold elections. But the requirement of preclearance effectively went away in 2013 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the provision determining which states are covered was outdated and unconstitutional.",
      "The request is seeking to trigger the \u201cbail-in\u201d provision of the Voting Rights Act. Alternatively, plaintiffs are asking the court to retain jurisdiction so any new plans can be addressed.",
      "Deuel Ross, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said Alabama demonstrated a pattern of resistance to drawing a congressional map that was fair to Black voters. He said the preclearance is needed to ensure Alabama doesn\u2019t \u201cbackslide\u201d the next time maps are drawn.",
      "\u201cThere is no question what happened in this case extraordinary,\u201d Ross told the panel.",
      "He pointed to the history of the case, including that lawmakers in 2023 \u201cintentionally defied\u201d a court order to draw a second majority-Black district or something close to it. Judges stepped in to select a new map for the state that was used in the 2024 elections.",
      "Alabama Solicitor General Edmund LaCour Jr. argued to the court that preclearance is an extraordinary remedy that is only appropriate after multiple violations.",
      "\u201cThat test is not satisfied here,\u201d LaCour told the panel.",

      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called for a rewrite of the endangerment finding in March as part of a series of environmental rollbacks announced at the same time in what Zeldin said was \"the greatest day of deregulation in American history.'' A total of 31 key environmental rules on topics from clean air to clean water and climate change would be rolled back or repealed under Zeldin's plan.",
      "He singled out the endangerment finding as \u201cthe Holy Grail of the climate change religion\u201d and said he was thrilled to end it \u201cas the EPA does its part to usher in the Golden Age of American success.''",
      "The EPA also called for rescinding limits on tailpipe emissions that were designed to encourage automakers to build and sell more electric vehicles. The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.",
      "Three former EPA leaders have criticized Zeldin, saying his March proposal would endanger the lives of millions of Americans and abandon the agency\u2019s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s an endangerment finding to be found anywhere, it should be found on this administration because what they\u2019re doing is so contrary to what the Environmental Protection Agency is about,\u201d Christine Todd Whitman, who led EPA under Republican President George W. Bush, said after Zeldin's plan was made public.",
      "The EPA proposal follows an executive order from Trump that directed the agency to submit a report \u201con the legality and continuing applicability\u201d of the endangerment finding.",
      "Conservatives and some congressional Republicans hailed the initial plan, calling it a way to undo economically damaging rules to regulate greenhouse gases.",
      "But environmental groups, legal experts and Democrats said any attempt to repeal or roll back the endangerment finding would be an uphill task with slim chance of success. The finding came two years after a 2007 Supreme Court ruling holding that the EPA has authority to regulate greenhouse gases as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.",

    "published": "Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:53:42 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer's love for the Great American Songbook goes far beyond standards written by Gershwin or Porter.",
    "story": [
      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

    "story": [
      "She may be Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, but you're just as likely to find her living in Paris as you might in London. \"My blood is English, but my culture is French,\" she said.",
      "There is a duality about her. She can be as heartwarming in English (\"Darkest Hour\") as she can be heartwrenching in French (\"I've Loved You So Long\"). Many of her foreign films have been showcased at the Cine Lumiere, a French art house in London. \"A little slice of Paris,\" she said.",
      "It's convenient, now that she's back in London, playing the deputy director of MI5 in the Apple TV+ series \"Slow Horses.\"",
      "A chilly, stiff upper-lip has often been a calling card for Thomas \u2013 too stiff, she admits, early on: \"I think it was Sydney Pollock \u2013 or it might have been Robert Redford, take your pick,\" she laughed. \"One of them said to me, 'You know, you have to be generous. Forget what you're trying to defend. Forget trying to hide. Be more generous.' And I'm not sure I really understood what he meant by that. He just planted a seed, and then I was able to kind of unzip a bit more.\"",
      "And she about to unzip even more, creatively digging into something intensely personal in her past. She said, \"When I was five, my father was killed, and my mother remarried. And tragically, he was killed five years later. And I know that a lot of the time when I was a younger woman, I had this feeling of something missing, this piece of my puzzle missing having grown up with only one parent.\"",
      "Both had been pilots in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm; both were lost in remarkably similar training accidents; and both left a hole that had her climbing out into her imagination. When she was a little girl she wrote and illustrated stories: \"A mommy and a daddy and two children, just doing ordinary things, like going away on holiday and things like that\" \u2013 a family experience she never knew.",
      "The memories of her dad were incomplete, fuzzy, like sketches she played out in her head. But those images became the seeds for what grew into a screenplay, and then came to life as the first movie she's ever directed: \"My Mother's Wedding.\"",
      "It garnered an all-star cast: Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller and Emily Beecham play Thomas' daughters who are each struggling in different ways  with the loss of a father or stepfather, just as their mother prepares to marry again.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"My Mother's Wedding\" click on the video player below:",
      "Thomas has already done movie weddings, of course, as in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\" Early on, she had a sarcastic confidence about her. She didn't have the most lines in that 1994 film, but in brevity she was brilliant:",
      "That demeanor might have been a surprise to those who knew her when she was bouncing around Royal Naval bases, a bit of a wallflower as a child, even into adulthood. \"I was excruciatingly shy,\" she said. \"I don't know when it changed, to be honest.\"",
      "She's hardly shy anymore, if her character in \"Fleabag\" is any indication. Perhaps it's fitting she was discovered by another admittedly shy success story, Prince. You'd think that would make her a pretty cool mom (she has three children with her first husband), but it turns out \u2026 not so much.",
      "\"I hadn't watched it with them, but as I was leaving my teenage children alone one evening, and they were having pizza and a friend 'round, I said, 'Watch \"Under the Cherry Moon,\" it's on the telly! Come on, it'll be fun!' And when I got back, they weren't actually very polite about it.\"",
      "She has more than made up for it, later starring opposite Robert Redford (\"The Horse Whisperer\"), Harrison Ford (\"Random Hearts\"), and Tom Cruise (\"Mission: Impossible\").",
      "\"I'm so proud to be in 'Mission: Impossible,' I cannot even get over it!\" she said. \"I'm in this thing, which is this enormous monster, and you know, these kids, they have no idea about 'Gosford Park.' They have no idea about 'Four Weddings,' but they've all seen 'Mission: Impossible'! And they have no idea I speak French or do all these other kind of slightly murkier films in France, you know?\"",
      "And then, of course, there was \"The English Patient,\" which earned her an Academy Award nomination for best actress. \"It's quite moving actually, when you see yourself at sort of 30 acting your socks off,\" she said.",
      "Another place she acted her socks off is at the Royal Court Theatre, where she won an Olivier Award for her performance in \"The Seagull,\" a role she later took to Broadway. \"New York audiences, when they are enjoying themselves, I mean it's electric \u2013 you can really, really feel it,\" she said.",
      "And London audiences? \"We are much more kind of passive, perhaps. Reserved. Of course we are!\" she laughed.",
      "But even while talking at the Royal Court, she found herself thinking about her film. As intimate as the stage may be, for her, \"My Mother's Wedding\" is more so. \"I love working on stage, as you can probably tell. I really, really love it. But the joy and satisfaction and exhaustion that comes from filmmaking when you are being a director, that is not far off. Pretty good. It's just extraordinary.\"",
      "At 65, and now a grandmother, she's working as hard as ever, not taking a lot of time to smell the roses per se, but she'll surely stop for someone who has a kind word or two: \"A lady came up to me the other day and said, 'I know you hate this, but I just wanted to say...' \u00a0and I said, 'I don't hate this at all!

    "story": [
      "Louise Nevelson's artwork looks right at home at the Whitney Museum of American Art, mingling with the skyscrapers of Manhattan. She found inspiration in the city as early as the 1920s, yet it would take the art world decades to recognize her and her iconic sculptures.",
      "\"She was given her first respective at the Whitney in 1967,\" said Maria Nevelson, the artist's granddaughter, who runs the Louise Nevelson Foundation. \"I was seven years old. And there was a line of people all the way around the block, up to the front door. I really did get chills. It was the first time I responded to artwork in general, and to my grandmother's artwork.\"",
      "Nearly six decades later, the Whitney is holding a new Nevelson exhibition, which is open until August 10.",
      "Asked what Louise was like as a grandmother, Maria laughed: \"Oh, she was intimidating and unconventional. What comes to mind first is her atmospheric dressing. Anything could have been pulled into this assemblage and this layering of rich brocades and silks.\"",
      "That fancy wardrobe didn't stop Nevelson from getting her hands dirty: \"She'd dumpster dive, she'd get into the garbage can, she'd pull out filthy pieces of wood, and we'd have to take 'em home,\" said Maria. \"I would say the streets of New York weren't paved with gold for her; it was paved with garbage. And she loved it!\"",
      "Nevelson's attraction to wood may have grown from her family tree \u2013 her family owned lumber yards in present-day Ukraine, where she was born in 1899. Louise was a young girl who spoke no English when her father decided to move the family to Rockland, Maine.",
      "\"It was a bustling seaport town,\" said Maria. \"They got off the train and, she said, rednecks threw mud at them. And she said, 'I knew I was a Jew, I knew I was different.' She was about five, six years old then. That's her greeting to America.\"",
      "Undaunted, Nevelson learned English, and at age nine, announced she was going to be a sculptor.",
      "\"She knew always what she wanted to be and do, and she pursued it fiercely,\" said Brooke Minto, executive director and CEO of the Columbus Museum of Art, where Nevelson's work is also currently on display. \"It was a decade's long journey, and she just kept at it.\"",
      "Nevelson would choose a monochromatic palette to unify her materials. Minto said, \"She really understood that she could create an all-over, immersive experience in her sculpture by pairing them down to a single color. It's this wonderful accumulation of very simple and humble objects into something that's quite monumental and immediately historical.\"",
      "According to Maria Nevelson, Louise did her best work when she was in her 70s and 80s, \"right up to when she passed away at 88.\"",
      "In 1979, Charles Osgood, of \"Sunday Morning,\" spoke to Louise when she was 79 years old and, arguably, at the height of her career. The artist remarked, \"You see, dear, if you are doing your creative work, you don't have age or time as such, and consequently you're not caught in it. So, you go on.\"",

      "\"The exhibit really tells the story of the Hollywood Ten,\" Louise Mirrer, president of the New York Historical Society, told CBS News, of a group of 10 Hollywood writers and directors. \"And the charge was for the Hollywood Ten, that they were making movies that espoused the Communist point of view.\"",
      "The Hollywood Ten refused to answer the committee's questions. They were held in contempt of Congress, each sentenced from anywhere between six months to a year in prison, and blacklisted by studio executives.",
      "\"I think it had an enormous effect,\" Anne Lessy, assistant curator of history exhibitions for the historical society, told CBS News of the impact of the blacklist. \"If you wanted to be a part of the film industry, you essentially forfeited your privacy and your right to your own political ideas and affiliations.\"",
      "Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, one of the Hollywood Ten, spent 10 months in prison. His daughter, Mitzi, was 5 years old at the time. Her drawings and letters to him are on display in the exhibit, as well as testimony from those who named suspected Communists.",
      "\"In an effort to save themselves, their careers and their reputations, many, you know, creatives felt compelled to name names, which is what the committee wanted,\" Lessy said.",
      "Even Walt Disney famously testified before the committee.",
      "\"Walt Disney very much objected to labor organizing that had taken place in his studios and blamed it on Communist infiltration,\" Lessy said. \"And then you also have Ronald Reagan, who at the time, was president of the Screen Actors Guild. While he didn't name names in public, he did to the committee's investigator. And he went on to very much endorse the anti-Communist crusade.\"",
      "The blacklist later expanded to include classically trained pianist Hazel Scott, the first Black entertainer to have a nationally syndicated TV show. But the show was canceled after she was named in an anti-Communist pamphlet.",
      "Once out of prison, Trumbo used pseudonyms to write the Academy Award-winning films \"The Brave One\" and \"Roman Holiday.\"",
      "\"So it took about four decades...for the Academy Awards to finally recognize Dalton Trumbo,\" Lessy said. \"And...that was seen as the beginning of eroding of the committee's power.\"",
      "The impact of the Red Scare also extended beyond Hollywood.",
      "\"A number of regular Americans got caught up in this anti-Communist fervor, members of labor unions, high school teachers,\" Lessy said. \"College professors also came under scrutiny. There was a well-known publication called Red Channels that would provide very detailed information on a wide range of creatives. And so even just your name appearing in one of these publications was enough to get you blacklisted.\"",
      "By the 1960s, as the Red Scare had faded, so too did the blacklist's power. And in 1975, the House Un-American Activities Committee was abolished.",
      "\"I think it [the Hollywood blacklist] raises important questions about how to protect a robust democracy,\" Lessy said. \"How do we protect our rights and freedoms, particularly freedom of speech...If you hold unpopular views, should you be punished? Should you lose your job? These are all questions we should be wrestling with.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission has cleared the way for Paramount Global to complete its merger with Skydance Media, announcing Thursday that it has approved the deal. The decision removes a final hurdle for the media and entertainment companies to close their transaction. Paramount is the parent company of CBS.",
      "\"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\" FCC Chair Brendan Carr said in a statement. \"It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\"",
      "He referenced Skydance's commitment to hire a CBS News ombudsman to review complaints of editorial bias for a period of at least two years. Skydance also affirmed that the company will not have DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Skydance has made written commitments to ensuring that the new company's array of news and entertainment programming will embody a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum and that CBS's reporting will be fair, unbiased, and fact-based,\" Carr said in the statement.",
      "Carr also noted the company's commitment to local news coverage and said Skydance \"will work closely with its affiliated broadcast stations to ensure a productive partnership that will strengthen its affiliates' ability to serve their local communities.\"",
      "The FCC's approval, which was necessary for the deal to move forward, caps a long-running corporate saga over the fate of Paramount, which owns Paramount+, the Paramount Pictures movie and television studios, the CBS television network and CBS News and Stations. Paramount also owns Nickelodeon, BET, MTV, Comedy Central and other media brands.",
      "The companies said in a statement Friday that the transaction is expected to close on Aug. 7.",
      "Paramount Global agreed to merge with David Ellison's Skydance Media in July 2024 after briefly halting negotiations the month before. The deal followed a long, turbulent sales process that drew interest from other major corporate players and investors, including Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr., media mogul Barry Diller, Sony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management, and Allen Media, the company controlled by former comedian Byron Allen.",
      "Paramount had said it expected to close the $8.4 billion merger in the first half of 2025. But the first half of the year came and went, and the merger remained under review by the FCC and its chair Brendan Carr, who had been appointed to the role earlier this year by President Trump.",
      "Late on July 1, Paramount announced it had settled a lawsuit with Mr. Trump over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris, a suit that Paramount told the court was without merit. The company agreed to pay $16 million \u2014 most of which would go to Mr. Trump's presidential library \u2014 and agreed to publish transcripts of future \"60 Minutes\" interviews with presidential candidates after those interviews air on the show. Mr. Trump has since said he expects Paramount's new owners to offer him about $20 million in advertising and PSAs. Paramount said in a statement it had no knowledge of any commitments to Mr. Trump outside of its $16 million settlement, and Skydance didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, issued a statement on Thursday dissenting from the decision to approve the merger.",
      "\"I cannot support this order approving this transaction in light of the payout and other troubling concessions Paramount made to settle a baseless lawsuit,\" she wrote. \"...In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom.\" Carr has said that Mr. Trump's lawsuit was not a factor in his agency's review of the deal.",
      "\"It is time for companies, journalists, and citizens alike to stand up and speak out, because unchecked and unquestioned power has no rightful place in America,\" Gomez said.",

Social media lit up with discussion of a possible reunion, seven years after Buckingham was fired from Fleetwood Mac.",

      "Nicks and Buckingham released \"Buckingham Nicks\" shortly before joining Fleetwood Mac in 1974.

    "story": [
      "The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will lift tariffs on imports of goods from EU countries to their highest level in decades and hurt the trading bloc's economic growth, according to some experts.",
      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028.",
      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",
      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits.",

      "The Trump administration's trade policy faces a critical test this week as a federal court weighs the legality of its sweeping tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Thursday in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President\u00a0Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer.",
      "The lawsuit challenges President Trump's claim that he has authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to issue tariffs, a process that normally requires congressional approval.",
      "A victory by the plaintiffs could deal a blow to Mr. Trump as he seeks to negotiate trade deals with U.S. economic partners. The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday\u00a0announced a pact, easing tension over a brewing trade war. But the White House has yet to reach deals with other major trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, South Korea and China.",
      "What both sides are arguing",
      "The plaintiffs in the V.O.S. case argue that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he bypassed congressional approval and invoked IEEPA as the legal\u00a0basis\u00a0for imposing his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on April 2. Mr. Trump also drew on IEEPA in deploying a separate set of\u00a0tariffs\u00a0in February against Canada, Mexico and China that he said was aimed at stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl.",
      "\"This case is about more than high tariffs,\" Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonpartisan think tank, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's about whether a president can stretch a vague statute beyond recognition to sidestep Congress.\"",
      "IEEPA, among other things, gives the president authority to regulate transactions with foreign countries during national emergencies. However, no U.S. president has ever invoked IEEPA as a justification for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It's limited to emergencies where there is an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 and the trade deficit is hardly an emergency. It's been with us for basically 50 years\" said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center, a nonpartisan public interest law representing the five businesses that have filed suit in the case.",
      "The White House has defended President Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs.",
      "\"The administration is legally and fairly using tariff powers that have been granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to level the playing field for American workers and safeguard our national security,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Why the case is important",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to eliminate trade imbalances with other countries, which he said constitutes an \"unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.\"",
      "But a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could have broader implications for trade policy, forcing Mr. Trump to seek congressional approval in imposing tariffs, Schwab said.",
      "\"If the court holds that the President's Liberation Day and fentanyl tariffs are unlawful, then he would not have authority to set those tariff rates, but still Congress could approve these deals \u2014 just like it did the NAFTA renegotiation in the first Trump term,\" Schwab said in an email.",
      "Presidents can draw on\u00a0other statutes, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to authorize the use of tariffs.",
      "How we got here",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade in May\u00a0struck down Mr. Trump's tariffs, with a three-judge panel ruling that the levies exceeded \"any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "At the time, the trade court said the 10% reciprocal tariffs are designed to deal with trade imbalances, which the judges said did not constitute an emergency under IEEPA. But a federal appeals court in May\u00a0blocked the trade court ruling\u00a0and reinstated the tariffs after the Trump administration appealed.",
      "After the trade court ruling in May, Desai\u00a0said\u00a0Mr. Trump would use \"all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "The case now heads to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., where lawyers from both parties will present their arguments. The court could issue a decision as early as August, Schwab told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That decision likely won't be the end of the road for the case, with Schwab expecting the losing party to appeal to the Supreme Court.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-trumps-job-handling-cbs-news-analysis/",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 12:51:09 -0400",
    "summary": "Most Americans under 30 approved at the start of President Trump's second term but are dissatisfied with the economy's direction.",
    "story": [
      "Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly\u00a0declined\u00a0\u2014 and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly?",
      "For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024: While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change.",
      "About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group.",
      "Which young voters have dropped off?",
      "Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent.",
      "There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March, while it was not until April\u00a0\u2014 and the downturn in the U.S. stock market \u2014 that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.)",
      "CBS News polling over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days.",
      "A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question.",
      "On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations:",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",

Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",
      "And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",

By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",
      "Looking back and ahead\u2026",
      "Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many at the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded. His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office.",
      "Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again.",
      "Estimating small subgroups in polls",
      "In order to more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date.",
      "Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly \u2014 for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 11:40:12 -0400",
    "summary": "Union Pacific is seeking to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Union Pacific wants to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S, and potentially trigger a final wave of rail mergers across the country.",
      "The proposed merger, announced Tuesday, would marry Union Pacific's vast rail network in the West with Norfolk's rails that snake across 22 Eastern states, and the District of Columbia.",
      "The nation was first linked by rail in 1869, when a golden railroad spike was driven in Utah to symbolize the connection of East and West Coasts. Yet no single entity has controlled that coast-to-coast passage.",
      "The railroads argue a merger would streamline deliveries of raw materials and goods nationwide by eliminating delays when shipments are handed off between railroads. The AP first reported the merger talks earlier this month a week before the railroads confirmed the discussions last week.",
      "Any deal would be closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators that have set a very high bar for railroad deals after previous consolidation in the industry led to massive backups and snarled traffic.",
      "Pressure on remaining railroads",
      "If the deal is approved, the two remaining major American railroads \u2014 BNSF and CSX \u2014 will face tremendous pressure to merge to create a second transcontinental railroad so they can compete. The continent's two other major railroads \u2014 Canadian National and CPKC \u2014 may also get involved. The Canadian rails span all of that nation and feed into America. CPKC rails stretch south into Mexico",
      "Some big shippers like chemical plants in the Gulf may be wary of the deal due to fears of a monopoly that could would wield immense influence over rates, but other major rail customers, like Amazon and UPS, may be in favor if it means packages will arrive more quickly and reliably. Those big companies, along with unions and communities across the country that the railroads cross, will have a chance to weigh before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.",
      "Consumers could benefit if the transcontinental rail does reduce shipping rates and delivery times. Union Pacific said that combined, the railroads would improve delivery times.",
      "There's speculation that this deal might win approval under the pro-business Trump administration, but the STB is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. The board is led by a Republican, and Trump will appoint a fifth member before this deal will be considered.",
      "Union Pacific is offering $20 billion cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal.",
      "Union Pacific's stock fell nearly 2% to $224.98 in premarket trading, while Norfolk Southern's stock dipped more than 3% to $277.40.",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who has championed a merger, said lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh will all reach their destinations more seamlessly.",
      "\"It builds upon President Abraham Lincoln's vision of a transcontinental railroad from nearly 165 years ago, and will usher in a new era of American innovation,\" Vena told investors Tuesday.",
      "From 30 to 6",
      "U.S. railroads have already undergone extensive consolidation. There were more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. Today, six major railroads handle the majority of shipments nationwide.",
      "Western rival BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has the war chest to pursue an acquisition of CSX, to the east, if it chooses. CEO Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348 billion cash and the consummate dealmaker may want to swing for the fences one last time before stepping down as planned at the end of the year.",
      "Buffett recently threw cold water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC, but he rarely uses investment bankers anyway. Buffett reached an agreement to buy the parts of the BNSF railroad he didn't already own for $26.3 billion after a private meeting with its CEO more than a decade ago.",
      "Yet there's widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial rail industry.",
      "That's largely due to the aftermath of a consolidation in the U.S nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. It merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups in the East.",
      "\"We're committed to making sure that doesn't happen in this case,\" said Norfolk CEO Mark George. He added that the railroads will spend the next two years planning for a smooth integration before this deal might get approved.",
      "Just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31 billion to create the CPKC railroad.",
      "There were compelling factors in that deal, however, that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America. The deal announced Tuesday would merge the nation's largest freight railroad, with the smallest.",
      "Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027. They predict that they would be able to eliminate $1 billion in costs annually, but Vena said that every union worker at both railroads should still have a job. The railroads also predict they would be able to boost revenue by at least $1.75 billion each year by winning more business from trucking companies and other railroads.",
      "On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern reported a $768 million second-quarter profit, or $3.41 per share, as volume grew 3%. That's up from $737 million, or $3.25 per share, a year ago, but the results were affected by insurance payments from its 2023 East Palestine derailment and restructuring costs.",
      "Without the one-time factors, Norfolk Southern made $3.29 per share, which was just below the $3.31 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-powell-trump-fomc-interest-rate-meeting-july-30/",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 11:08:59 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. Here's what the experts think will happen at this week's monetary policy meeting.",
    "story": [
      "During a\u00a0meeting last week between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president sought to underscore what he said is a \"very simple\" request: \"Interest rates have to come down.\"",
      "That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision on Wednesday. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has for months\u00a0derided Powell  over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a\u00a0building renovation\u00a0at the Fed could be grounds for firing.",
      "Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite.",
      "\"With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note.",
      "In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts\u00a0earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low.",
      "However, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 a key gauge for tracking inflation \u2014 in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher.",
      "Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know.",
      "When is the Fed making its rate cut decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook.",
      "Who makes decisions on interest rates?",
      "The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy.",
      "Lately, at least two members of the FOMC \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates.",
      "\"[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,\" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. \"From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink.\"",
      "Could the Fed cut rates on Wednesday?",
      "It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut.",
      "For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June\u00a0hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Wednesday to report that second-quarter GDP rose by 1.8%, below 2024's 2.8% rate.",
      "With economic clouds on the horizon, the Fed is expected to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note.",
      "Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation.",
      "\"Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump?",
      "Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about\u00a0replacing him as Fed chair, he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,\" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy.",
      "When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates?",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%.",
      "\"With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,\" Daco said. \"We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.\"",

Stellantis builds its Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brand vehicles in factories in Canada and Mexico, meaning they're subject to the new levies.",

He said as he met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during his visit to Scotland that the 50-day deadline he announced earlier this month would be reduced to less than two weeks, citing a lack of progress in negotiations.",

That would have meant a deal agreed by around the end of August.",

      "Mr. Trump said the tariff rate for the EU's 27 member countries would be 15% for most imports, including vehicles. The EU, meanwhile, agreed to purchase U.S. military hardware, $750 billion of American energy, and to increase its collective investment in the U.S. by $600 billion.",

      "\"We have a deal. We have a trade deal between the two largest economies in the world, and it's a big deal, it's a huge deal,\" she said. \"It will bring stability. It will bring predictability.\"",

      "Von der Leyen said the negotiations addressed the EU's trade surplus with the U.S., and the deal would be carried out in a way that would enable trade to continue while jobs on \"both sides of the Atlantic\" would be rebalanced.",
      "According to Mr. Trump, the deal also includes that all European Union countries will be \"opened up for U.S. goods\" at 0% and the bloc will invest $600 billion in the U.S. The EU will also purchase $750 billion of U.S. energy as part of the deal.",
      "\"They are going to agree to invest into the United States $600 billion more than they're investing already,\" Mr. Trump said. \"So they're investing a large amount of money. You know what that amount of money is--It's very substantial.\"",

      "Tea Dating Advice, an app for helping women vet their dates, is also a top app on the Google Play Store, where it's been downloaded more than 100,000 times.",
      "The app's maker says it offers a measure of security for users that traditional dating apps\u00a0don't. Tea doesn't match singles with potential dates; rather, it's a place for women to share information about men they've dated. Tea lets users run background checks on potential matches, check to see if they have criminal records or appear on sex offender databases, and more, all through the app.",
      "The app also ensures that users who sign up are women by requesting that they submit a selfie for verification. That's aimed at protecting users against so-called catfishing schemes, in which people create fake online personas, often as part of a scheme to defraud others.",
      "Tea declined to comment for this article.",

Tea has more than 1.6 million users, according to its website.",
      "\"What this app seems to be doing is centralizing all that into one very large community,\" Doug Zytko, an associate professor at the University of Michigan-Flint who researches human-computer interactions for safety, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Zytko, who has extensively studied dating app designs, said that safety \"has not been prioritized\" for most such tools in the market, which he said helps explain why Tea has struck a chord with women.",
      "\"The dating app safety features that exist are largely reactive in nature. They're not about keeping people safe, but are punitive actions one can take after something has occurred,\" he added.",
      "Zytko also acknowledged the concerns of some men, voiced on forums like Reddit, that Tea users could share false information about them.",
      "\"If inaccurate information about a man is being shared, that damages his dating prospects and social reputation,\" Zytko said. \"That's scary, but it's not a reason to discount the app.\"",
      "Another potential risk is one common to all social media platform, and digital information more broadly. Tea confirmed to CBS News that its app was hacked Friday morning, with bad actors accessing a data storage system containing information, including selfies, that members had uploaded prior to February 2024.",
      "Additionally, hackers accessed almost 60,000 images from posts, plus comments and direct messages, the company said.",
      "\"Tea has engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure its systems,\" the company said in a statement, noting that it is investigating the incident. \"At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected.\"",

      "The Federal Communications Commission has cleared the way for Paramount Global to complete its merger with Skydance Media, announcing Thursday that it has approved the deal. The decision removes a final hurdle for the media and entertainment companies to close their transaction. Paramount is the parent company of CBS.",
      "\"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\" FCC Chair Brendan Carr said in a statement. \"It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\"",
      "He referenced Skydance's commitment to hire a CBS News ombudsman to review complaints of editorial bias for a period of at least two years. Skydance also affirmed that the company will not have DEI initiatives.",

      "The FCC's approval, which was necessary for the deal to move forward, caps a long-running corporate saga over the fate of Paramount, which owns Paramount+, the Paramount Pictures movie and television studios, the CBS television network and CBS News and Stations. Paramount also owns Nickelodeon, BET, MTV, Comedy Central and other media brands.",
      "The companies said in a statement Friday that the transaction is expected to close on Aug. 7.",
      "Paramount Global agreed to merge with David Ellison's Skydance Media in July 2024 after briefly halting negotiations the month before. The deal followed a long, turbulent sales process that drew interest from other major corporate players and investors, including Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr., media mogul Barry Diller, Sony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management, and Allen Media, the company controlled by former comedian Byron Allen.",
      "Paramount had said it expected to close the $8.4 billion merger in the first half of 2025. But the first half of the year came and went, and the merger remained under review by the FCC and its chair Brendan Carr, who had been appointed to the role earlier this year by President Trump.",

The company agreed to pay $16 million \u2014 most of which would go to Mr. Trump's presidential library \u2014 and agreed to publish transcripts of future \"60 Minutes\" interviews with presidential candidates after those interviews air on the show. Mr. Trump has since said he expects Paramount's new owners to offer him about $20 million in advertising and PSAs. Paramount said in a statement it had no knowledge of any commitments to Mr. Trump outside of its $16 million settlement, and Skydance didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, issued a statement on Thursday dissenting from the decision to approve the merger.",
      "\"I cannot support this order approving this transaction in light of the payout and other troubling concessions Paramount made to settle a baseless lawsuit,\" she wrote. \"...In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom.\" Carr has said that Mr. Trump's lawsuit was not a factor in his agency's review of the deal.",

    "story": [
      "The new normal for U.S. tariffs on foreign goods starts at 15%. Even as President Trump seeks to forge new terms of trade\u00a0with Japan, the European Union and other global economic partners, he is raising the floor for tariffs to their highest level in decades.",
      "Speaking\u00a0at an AI summit on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"we'll have a straight, simple tariff of anywhere between 15% and 50%,\" conditioning the lower rate on countries opening their economies to the U.S.",
      "The White House has said sharply higher tariffs could take effect on dozens of countries as soon as Aug. 1 unless they ink new trade deals. The Trump administration has a separate negotiating timeline with China, which faces an Aug. 12 deadline for an agreement.",
      "As these new rules of international commerce take shape, companies across a range of industries are emphasizing that higher tariffs translate into higher operational costs \u2014 and higher prices for consumers.",
      "For example, Nestl\u00e9 on Thursday said it was considering hiking prices for candy bars and other products as tariffs threaten to eat into the food company's profit margins. The same day, Italian fashion brand Moncler said it has already hiked prices for its apparel to offset additional tariff-related costs. And General Electric said this week that proposed U.S. tariffs, should they take effect, would cost the company around $500 million in 2025, noting that it would move to offset those taxes through \"cost controls and pricing actions.\"",
      "Orange juice importer Johanna Foods has gone a step further, this week filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its proposed\u00a050% tariff on Brazil, which the New Jersey company said would seriously hurt its business and force it to hike product prices by up to 25%.",
      "The White House disputes that higher U.S. tariffs will drive up costs for businesses and consumers.",
      "\"The administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be borne by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Desai also pointed to a recent analysis by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that he said shows import prices falling this year.",
      "Price hikes not \"instantaneous\"",
      "Economists warn that consumers should brace for higher prices on a range of goods, from leather products and clothing to electronics and automobiles, later this year.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a research note. \"Now that the Trump administration is concluding deals that would see the tariff rate facing most trading partners settling at between 15% and 20%, with even higher rates levied on Chinese imports, we suspect retailers will be forced to finally raise the prices paid by consumers.\"",
      "Inflation in the early part of 2025 remained fairly contained. That's because many companies and consumers accelerated their purchases of imported goods to avoid the risk of paying more if, or when, steep new tariffs take effect.",
      "Meanwhile, in the short-term, sharply higher prices are unlikely across the board, according to trade experts.",
      "\"When you open up the hood of that, it's not going to be even across all categories of spending,\" Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's categories of spending where we import more that are going to be more sensitive to tariffs.\"",
      "But over the longer term, an increased baseline tariff, coupled wtih higher levies on individual countries, is projected to drive up U.S. prices by 2% over the next two years, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "\"This isn't an instantaneous, 'We wake up the next morning and the world is different,'\" Tedeschi added.",
      "But as the new U.S. tariff regime becomes embedded in global supply chains, some import-heavy product categories could see especially sharp price increases, he said. Specifically, foreign-made leather shoes and handbags, along with apparel, could see prices spike by at least 40%, while the cost of electronics could jump more than 20%, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",

      "The funding freeze had been challenged by several lawsuits as educators, members of Congress from both parties and others called for the administration to release money schools rely on for a wide range of programs. Congress had appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Mr. Trump.",

      "Last week, the department said it would release $1.3 billion of the money for after-school and summer programming. Without the money, school districts and nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of America had said they would have to close or scale back educational offerings this fall.",
      "The release of that money came days after 10 Republican senators sent a letter imploring the administration to allow frozen education money to be sent to states. Those senators had also called for the rest of the money to be distributed, including funds for adult education and teaching English as a second language.",
      "Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia was among the lawmakers calling for the release of the grants.",

The program helps kids keep their English and academic momentum over the summer.",
      "The district serves roughly 1,100 students who are non-native English speakers. Many of them are born in the U.S. to parents who came to the area seeking job opportunities, often in the restaurants and warehouses that have popped up in the past decades in the region northeast of Baltimore. During the school year, the soon-to-be-released federal money pays for tutors for kids learning English.",
      "On Thursday, more than 350 children filled the second floor of Bel Air High School for the second-to-last day of summer camp. Young learners crowded around an alphabet wheel, jostling with each other to push each letter button as they thought of foods starting with letters from A to Z.",

    "summary": "President Trump has threatened to impose a 30% tariff on imports from the European Union's 27 member countries if no trade deal is reached by Aug. 1.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on Friday there is a \"50/50 chance, maybe less than that\" of his administration striking a trade deal with the European Union ahead of a looming deadline next week.",
      "Mr. Trump, who made the comments before he left for a four-day visit to Scotland, comes ahead of the White House's Aug. 1 deadline for striking trade agreements with the EU and other nations. If the U.S. and EU fail to reach a deal, the president has threatened to impose a 30% tariff on imports from the trading bloc's 27 member countries.",
      "Dozens of other nations also face higher tariff rates starting Aug. 1, except for those that have already done a deal before the deadline.",
      "The U.S. has recently announced the outlines of trade deals with Japan,\u00a0China, Indonesia,\u00a0the Philippines,\u00a0and the\u00a0U.K., although many details remain\u00a0to be finalized.",
      "European officials suggested this week that they could be open to a 15% U.S. baseline tariff rate, while signaling that the EU is prepared to hit American exports with levies on more than $100 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Aug. 7 if the two sides fail to strike a deal.",
      "Trade experts say a U.S.-EU agreement could mirror the Trump administration's pact this week with Japan, which imposes a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, Japan has committed to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including for cars and certain farm products.",
      "Financial markets have remained sanguine this week about the threat of tariffs despite the White House's approaching deadline for trade deals, with leading U.S. indexes up modestly on Friday.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 23:35:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump visited the Federal Reserve's headquarters in Washington, keeping up the intense pressure he's been putting on Fed chair Jerome Powell.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a disagreement almost immediately as the two men set foot in the Fed's headquarters in Washington on Thursday to survey an\u00a0extensive renovation project\u00a0on two of the reserve's buildings.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump indicated that Powell's\u00a0handling of\u00a0the massive project and its cost overruns could be grounds for firing. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he doesn't think firing Powell is necessary.",
      "Mr. Trump and Powell appeared side by side on the construction site Thursday \u2014 both in hard hats \u2014 with the president insisting costs have increased further, reaching $3.1 billion. Powell shook his head and said he hadn't heard that figure from anyone at the Fed. Mr. Trump handed a document to Powell, who put on his glasses to review it.",
      "\"You just added in a third building is what that is \u2014 that's a third building,\" Powell said of the Federal Reserve's Martin building.",
      "\"Well, I know but it's a building that's being built,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"No \u2014 it was built five years ago. We finished Martin five years ago,\" Powell told the president.",
      "\"It's part of the overall work,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"It's not new,\" Powell reiterated.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Powell if he expects any further cost overruns. Powell said he does not. The project is expected to be completed in 2027.",
      "After a tour of the construction site, Mr. Trump called the project \"a very luxurious situation.\" But asked if the project's cost and overruns are a fireable offense for Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"Look, I would love to see it completed. I don't want to put that in this category. It's a very complex thing that could have been made simple.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he feels \"good\" about his relationship with Powell and they had a \"productive\" conversation Thursday, but reiterated that interest rates need to come down.",
      "\"I just want to see one thing happen, very simple \u2014 interest rates have to come down,\" he said.",
      "A reporter asked Mr. Trump why he doesn't fire Powell now, instead of replacing him when his term is up in 2026.",
      "\"To do that is a big move, I just don't think it's necessary,\" the president responded. \"And I believe he's going to do the right thing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Powell for months because the Fed has kept the short-term interest rate the Fed controls at 4.3% this year \u2014 after cutting it three times last year. Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Mr.\u00a0Trump's sweeping tariffs, which Powell says could push up inflation.",
      "Powell's caution has infuriated the president, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt.",
      "The Fed has been renovating its Washington headquarters and a neighboring building. With some of the construction occurring underground and as building materials have soared in price after inflation spiked in 2021 and 2022, the estimated cost has ballooned to about $2.5 billion from $1.9 billion.",
      "When asked last week if the costly rebuilding could be grounds to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"I think it is.\"",
      "\"When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it's really disgraceful,\" the president said.",
      "Firing Powell would threaten the Fed's independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors, and would almost certainly rattle financial markets.",
      "Mr. Trump has at various times referred to his handpicked Fed chair as a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule.\"",
      "The president asked a group of House Republicans in an Oval Office meeting\u00a0last week\u00a0if he should fire Powell, sources told CBS News. Mr. Trump told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he would, though he\u00a0confirmed\u00a0he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Renovations have been underway for years",
      "Plans for the Fed's renovation were first approved by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2017. The project then went through several local commissions for approval, at least one of which, the Commission for Fine Arts, included several Trump appointees. The commission\u00a0pushed for more marble\u00a0in the second of the two buildings the Fed is renovating, known as 1951 Constitution Avenue, specifically in a mostly glass extension that some of Trump's appointees derided as a \"glass box.\"",
      "The National Planning Commission, another local body, pushed the Fed to add marble to a rooftop addition.",
      "Fed staff also said tariffs and inflationary increases in building material costs also drove up costs. Mr. Trump in 2018 imposed a 25% duty on steel and 10% on aluminum. Steel prices are up about 60% since the plans were approved in June, while construction materials costs overall are up about 50%, according to government data.",
      "Fed staff also pointed to the complication of historic renovations \u2014 both buildings have significant preservation needs. Constructing a new building on an empty site would have been cheaper.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 14:48:17 -0400",
    "summary": "The Education Department has temporarily paused loan forgiveness for an income-based repayment plan. Here are the details.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who are enrolled in a popular repayment plan are now in limbo, with the Department of Education saying it has temporarily paused forgiveness for borrowers in its income-based repayment plan, or IBR.",
      "Such plans offer a double benefit for borrowers by lowering a person's monthly loan repayment to reflect their income, while also promising to provide forgiveness after a number of years. Specifically, the government can cancel the balance of student loan after people have made payments for at least 20 years.",
      "About 40% of the roughly 33 million people repaying student loans were enrolled in one of the Education Department's four such repayment plans at the end of 2024, according to data from the National Student Loan Data System and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "But three of those programs had previously been halted by a court ruling, while forgiveness for the roughly 2 million people enrolled in the fourth \u2014 IBR \u2014 is now also paused.",
      "On Tuesday, Education Department deputy press secretary Ellen Keast told CBS MoneyWatch that the agency \"has temporarily paused discharges for IBR borrowers in order to comply with ongoing court injunctions regarding the Biden Administration's illegal attempts at student loan forgiveness.\"",
      "The court injunctions stem from 2024\u00a0lawsuits related to the Biden administration's flagship student loan repayment plan, called the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. That initiative, created to fix long-standing issues with the Education Department's previous income-based plans, proved popular with borrowers, with almost 8 million enrollees at the end of 2024, National Student Loan Data System data shows.",
      "Because the SAVE plan could count toward loan discharges in the IBR program, the Education Department is now temporarily halting forgiveness for enrollees in that plan. The Education Department said the loan discharges will resume at some point, but didn't provide a timeframe for when that might occur.",
      "What income-driven repayment plans are legally blocked?",
      "Student loan forgiveness under three of the federal government's income-driven plans \u2014 SAVE; Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR); and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) \u2014 is currently paused after a court ruled last summer that Congress exceeded its authority in approving those plans.",
      "The legal action last year called into question whether student loan forgiveness was authorized under the federal statute that governs those plans. But the IBR plan was created under a different authority.",
      "When will the Education Department start forgiving loans again?",
      "The Education Department didn't specify a timeframe in its statement to CBS MoneyWatch. It noted that the SAVE plan allowed forbearances \u2014 when loan payments are temporarily halted or reduced \u2014 to be counted toward loan forgiveness, but that the rule was halted by the court ruling.",
      "Because of the injunction, the Education Department said it needs to recalculate how many payments made by borrowers should contribute toward repayment.",
      "\"Legal IBR discharges will resume as soon as the Department is able to establish the correct payment count,\" said Keast of the Education Department.",
      "Should a borrower continue making IBR payments for now?",
      "Yes. Borrowers in the federal IBR plan are eligible to have their student loans canceled after making payments for at least 20 years. However, some people eligible for such forgiveness have yet to see their loans canceled. They should continue making those payments, and the Education Department will eventually refund them, according to the agency.",
      "\"For any borrower that makes a payment after the date of borrower eligibility, the Department will refund overpayments when the discharges resume,\" Keast said.",
      "Borrowers can also request forbearance from their loan servicer. In that case, interest would continue to accrue on any remaining balance.",

A deposition was scheduled for Aug. 11 at a federal prison in Tallahassee, where Maxwell is serving her sentence.",
      "However, in a letter Tuesday addressed to House Oversight chairman Rep. James Comer, Maxwell's attorney David Markus said she is willing to sit before the committee but only after certain legal appeals are finalized or his client is granted clemency or a pardon by President Trump.",
      "\"Public reports \u2014 including your own statements \u2014 indicate that the Committee intends to question Ms. Maxwell in prison and without a grant of immunity. Those are non-starters. Ms. Maxwell cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity,\" Markus wrote.",
      "Markus wrote that any questions to Maxwell would have to be given to her in advance to \"ensure accuracy and fairness,\" and that conducting the deposition in prison would create \"security risks and undermines the integrity of the process.\"",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.",
      "Markus wrote that because Maxwell's ongoing appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction and other legal issues are currently pending, \"any testimony she provides now could compromise her constitutional rights, prejudice her legal claims, and potentially taint a future jury pool.\"",
      "However, Markus wrote, if President Trump were to pardon Maxwell or commute her sentence, \"she would be willing\u2014and eager\u2014to testify openly and honestly, in public, before Congress in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "If those conditions are not agreed to, Markus wrote, Maxwell \"will have no choice but to invoke her Fifth Amendment rights.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee said in a statement that the committee will respond to Markus' letter \"soon,\" but said it \"will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony.\"",
      "In a letter to Maxwell informing her of the subpoena, Comer wrote that the committee is seeking Maxwell's testimony \"to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.",
      "Todd Blanche, the second highest-ranking Justice Department official, met with Maxwell in Tallahassee on July 24 and 25\u00a0 to discuss Epstein.",
      "After the questioning had ended, Markus declined to comment \"on the substance\" of the meeting, but told reporters outside the office that \"there were a lot of questions and we went all day.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 15:31:54 -0400",
    "summary": "The EPA has decided to revoke a key scientific finding it published 16 years ago that six greenhouse gases are a threat to public health.",
    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency has decided to revoke a key scientific finding it published 16 years ago that six greenhouse gases are a threat to public health and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act.",
      "Known as the \"endangerment finding,\" it is the 2009 scientific basis for which the EPA has regulated greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, as well as other sources of climate pollution, but Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on a conservative podcast Tuesday that the agency is revoking the finding, calling it, \"the largest deregulatory action in the history of America.\"",
      "Since it was signed by then-Administrator Lisa Jackson in 2009, the finding has been used by the EPA to regulate sources of climate change-causing pollution from cars, power plants and other sources of transportation like planes, as well as oil and gas operations.",
      "But Tuesday, the EPA issued a press release saying if the draft to revoke the finding is finalized, it would \"repeal all resulting greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, thereby reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family while decreasing the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver.\"",
      "During his appearance on the \"Ruthless Podcast,\" Zeldin criticized the endangerment finding, saying it put too many regulatory restrictions on transportation and stationary sources of greenhouse gas pollution.",
      "\"There are people, who in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,\" he said.",
      "Zeldin also said regulating climate pollution costs Americans too much money. If the proposed finding is finalized, it \"is expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards,\" according to the EPA press release.",
      "But the EPA's own regulatory impact report says limiting emissions for cars and trucks is expected to generate more than $2.1 trillion in net benefits over the next 30 years, including $820 billion in fuel savings and $1.8 trillion in public health and climate benefits.",
      "Repealing the finding comes at a time when climate change impacts appear to be reaching new heights as 2024 was the hottest year on record, and natural disasters are growing more intense, destructive and deadly. Since 2010, there have been 246 billion-dollar disasters striking every U.S. state, causing more than $1.7 trillion in damages, and killing more than 7,700 people, according to archived data from NOAA.",
      "\"For the EPA to repeal the 2009 finding borders on criminal negligence,\" said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, in a statement. \"The science was clear in 2009 and has become much stronger and clearer since: climate disruption is a large and growing problem; it is caused primarily from our use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide and methane; and it is a deadly problem.\"",
      "Legality of the endangerment finding",
      "In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollution that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, but it tasked the EPA with making a scientific finding about whether the gases harm public health.",
      "Two years later, the EPA published the endangerment finding, relying on extensive scientific evidence and public input to definitively state that greenhouse gases, which cause climate change, threaten health and the welfare of current and future generations.",
      "\"I think it's the most impactful thing I worked on in my career,\" said a former EPA employee who was a key author on the 2009 endangerment finding and requested anonymity because of current contractual obligations with the federal government.",
      "\"This body of scientific evidence met the endangerment test of the Clean Air Act,\" he told CBS News. \"It has stood the test of time and the science has only gotten stronger.\"",
      "The EPA's new proposal aims to question the agency's ability to set standards for car emissions, according to the press release. The full draft of the rule is not yet accessible on the EPA website or federal register to review.",
      "The release also said the EPA will \"update scientific data and challenge the assumptions\" of the 2009 finding with an upcoming study from the Department of Energy's 2025 Climate Work Group, which is not yet available.",
      "Plenty of conservative groups and attorneys general have tested the legality of the finding and were pleased with Tuesday's announcement.",
      "\"Over the last four years, conservative state attorneys general were the last line of defense in fighting back against the Biden administration's federal overreach and green new scam agenda,\" said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in a statement.",
      "The finding has previously been challenged in court, most recently in 2023, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit upheld the finding and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.",
      "The EPA highlighted subsequent Supreme Court rulings since the finding was signed in 2009 and said, in its press release, those cases \"have significantly clarified the scope of EPA's authority under the CAA,\" indicating the agency may be open to testing whether today's court has an appetite to revisit and overturn the 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act by the EPA.",
      "\"The administration's move to jettison these standards flies in the face of the Supreme Court's landmark decision directing the EPA to follow the science,\" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. \"If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court.\"",
      "Impacts of the endangerment finding",
      "Since it was signed in 2009, the most crucial impacts of regulating greenhouse gasses have been to the U.S. transportation sector, which if it were its own country, would be the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, according to the European Commission and data from the EPA.",
      "New passenger vehicles today emit 24% less climate pollution than they did in 2011, the year before the first tailpipe regulations went into effect, according to the EPA's own estimates. The EPA tightened the tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks in 2024, which was expected to cut 7.2 billion tons of climate pollution by 2055 and save $13 billion in annual health benefits.",
      "But according to the EPA's press release, if the proposed draft is finalized it will, \"undo the underpinning of $1 trillion in costly regulations (and) save more than $54 billion annually,\" although no regulatory analysis has been provided to confirm those numbers.",
      "In addition to removing regulations on cars, the EPA has already jettisoned similar rules to limit emissions for power plants, has encouraged the development of fossil fuel-based energy and has promised to rollback dozens of additional environmental regulations that hamper the development of American energy and manufacturing.",
      "\"Trump's EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution. Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs,\" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, in a statement.",

      "President Trump on Tuesday set a 10-day deadline for Russia to reach a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine, or else it risks secondary sanctions, which would mean the Kremlin would have to make a deal with Ukraine by Friday, Aug. 8.",
      "The president, who said in Scotland on Monday that he was shortening his original 50-day deadline for Russia to make peace with Ukraine, spoke to reporters about the revised deadline Tuesday aboard Air Force One\u00a0as he returned to the U.S. Mr. Trump has been in Scotland for the last five days to negotiate trade deals with European leaders and visit his two golf resorts there.",
      "\"Ten days from today. Okay?\" he said on the plane.",
      "\"And then you know, we're going to put on tariffs and stuff, and I don't know if it's going to affect Russia, because he wants to obviously probably keep the war going,\" the president added, seemingly speaking about Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"But we're going to put on tariffs and the various things that you put on. It may or may not affect them, but it could.\"",
      "The U.S. and Ukraine have been pushing for an immediate ceasefire in order to negotiate a lasting peace deal. Earlier in July, Mr. Trump said if Russia doesn't agree to a ceasefire within a 50-day window, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that do business with Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration with Putin, questioning whether the Russian leader really wants to end the war with Ukraine. Mr. Trump has described thinking he'd had a good phone call with the Russian leader, only to find that the next day, more Ukrainians were being killed by Russia.",
      "\"I always hang up, [and] say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call,'\" Mr. Trump said earlier in July. \"And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city, and I say, 'That's strange.' And after that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything.\"",
      "It's a change from earlier this year, when Mr. Trump said he thought Putin \"wants peace.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump said he was \"very disappointed\" in Putin over Moscow's continued bombing of Ukraine, narrowing Russia's timeframe for a deal from 50 days to 10 or 12.",

    "story": [
      "The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will lift tariffs on imports of goods from EU countries to their highest level in decades and hurt the trading bloc's economic growth, according to some experts.",
      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028.",
      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",
      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits.",
      "\"Going forward, we are going to start to see these impacts either through lower profitability for corporations and higher costs for consumers, and most likely a combination of the two,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's recent trade deals with the EU, Japan, U.K. and several other Asian countries, the U.S. still faces a self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline to reach agreements with Canada, Mexico, Korean other key trading partners.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-trumps-job-handling-cbs-news-analysis/",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 12:51:09 -0400",
    "summary": "Most Americans under 30 approved at the start of President Trump's second term but are dissatisfied with the economy's direction.",
    "story": [
      "Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly\u00a0declined\u00a0\u2014 and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly?",
      "For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024: While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change.",
      "About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group.",
      "Which young voters have dropped off?",
      "Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent.",
      "There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March, while it was not until April\u00a0\u2014 and the downturn in the U.S. stock market \u2014 that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.)",
      "CBS News polling over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days.",
      "A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question.",
      "On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations:",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",

      "And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",

By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",
      "Looking back and ahead\u2026",
      "Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many at the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded. His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office.",
      "Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again.",
      "Estimating small subgroups in polls",
      "In order to more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date.",
      "Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly \u2014 for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender.",
      "Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups.",
      "The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased.",

    "summary": "President Trump has pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. Here's what the experts think will happen at this week's monetary policy meeting.",
    "story": [
      "During a\u00a0meeting last week between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president sought to underscore what he said is a \"very simple\" request: \"Interest rates have to come down.\"",
      "That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision on Wednesday. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has for months\u00a0derided Powell  over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a\u00a0building renovation\u00a0at the Fed could be grounds for firing.",
      "Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite.",
      "\"With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note.",
      "In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts\u00a0earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low.",
      "However, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 a key gauge for tracking inflation \u2014 in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher.",
      "Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know.",
      "When is the Fed making its rate cut decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook.",
      "Who makes decisions on interest rates?",
      "The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy.",
      "Lately, at least two members of the FOMC \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates.",
      "\"[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,\" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. \"From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink.\"",
      "Could the Fed cut rates on Wednesday?",
      "It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut.",
      "For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June\u00a0hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Wednesday to report that second-quarter GDP rose by 1.8%, below 2024's 2.8% rate.",
      "With economic clouds on the horizon, the Fed is expected to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note.",
      "Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation.",
      "\"Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump?",
      "Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about\u00a0replacing him as Fed chair, he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,\" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy.",
      "When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates?",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%.",
      "\"With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,\" Daco said. \"We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.\"",

    "story": [
      "The American Medical Association is expressing \"deep concern\" after a\u00a0report\u00a0that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy may be planning to remove all members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.",
      "The task force, also known as the USPSTF, is a panel of independent medical experts whose recommendations help guide insurance companies and doctors' decisions about a range of preventive health measures, like cancer and diabetes screenings as well as HIV and cholesterol drugs.",
      "In a letter posted on Sunday, the AMA \u2014 the largest association of physicians in the U.S. \u2014 addressed Kennedy over a report published Friday in The Wall Street Journal. The WSJ story cited sources familiar with the matter as saying Kennedy plans to dismiss the task force members because he views them as too \"woke.\"",
      "\"USPSTF plays a critical, non-partisan role in guiding physicians' efforts to prevent disease and improve the health of patients by helping to ensure access to evidence-based clinical preventive services,\" the AMA's letter said. \"As such, we urge you to retain the previously appointed members of the USPSTF and commit to the long-standing process of regular meetings to ensure their important work can continue without interruption.\"",
      "Doctors also have expressed concerns about the potential changes.",
      "Infectious disease physician Dr. Shelley Kon shared she's \"deeply alarmed\" at the reported plans.",
      "\"The current members are volunteer experts in their field, vetted for conflicts of interest. As a physician, I rely on their expertise and recommendations when discussing preventive care with my patients in the clinic,\" Kon said in an emailed statement, adding she's especially concerned about the potential impact to safe and effective medication to prevent HIV.",
      "\"We have to insist that our guidelines are based on science, evidence-based medicine, and shared decision-making \u2014 not politics. Our nation's health depends on it,\" she said.",
      "Dr. Thomas Lew, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine and attending physician of hospital medicine at Stanford Health Care Tri-Valley, had similar concerns about preventative care.",
      "\"This will greatly damage all the work we've done in preventative care, making people sicker, and driving up costs and premiums,\" he said. \"To put it mildly, this is extremely concerning \u2014 and doing the opposite of making America healthy.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News Friday, an HHS spokesperson said, \"No final decision has been made on how the USPSTF can better support HHS' mandate to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "The task force was created more than 40 years ago, but its work took on added significance after passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. The law requires health insurers and group health plans to provide preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "In June, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the structure of the task force, but ruled that its members are \"inferior officers\" that can be \"removable at will\" by the HHS secretary. As the case played out, nonprofit organizations warned the Supreme Court that eliminating cost-sharing for services like breast cancer screenings or HIV-prevention medications would dissuade patients from seeking medical care.",
      "Last month, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practice, also known as ACIP, a separate government panel of that makes vaccine recommendations. He later named eight new advisers, including several allies he has worked with closely over the years and some members with a history as vaccine critics.",
      "Kennedy has also shared big plans to shake up medical journals in the country. The health secretary told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook he wants to create new journals and even stop the publication of NIH-funded research in traditional journals.",
      "\"We need to replicate studies, we need to publish raw data. We need to get away from the traditional journals, which are controlled by the pharmaceutical industry, and create our own journals, which we're going to do,\" Kennedy said.",
      "In response to Kennedy's claim that the pharmaceutical industry controls traditional journals, Dr. Eric Rubin, editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, told LaPook, \"that's incorrect.\"",

      "President Trump opened a new golf course bearing his name in Scotland on Tuesday, capping a five-day foreign trip designed around promoting his family's luxury properties and playing golf, and agreeing on a major trade deal framework with the EU.",
      "\"Let's go. 1-2-3,\" Mr. Trump said before he cut the red ribbon.",
      "Mr. Trump and his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., were also set to play the first-ever round at the new Trump course in the village of Balmedie, on the northern coast of Scotland.",
      "\"This has been an unbelievable development,\" the president said before the ceremonial opening. He thanked his son Eric for his work on the project, saying it was \"truly a labor of love for him.\"",
      "The overseas jaunt enabled Mr. Trump to escape Washington's sweaty summer humidity and the still-raging scandal over the case of Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "It was mostly built around golf \u2014 and walking the new course before it officially begins offering rounds to the public on Aug. 13, adding to a lengthy list of ways the president has used the White House to promote his brand.",
      "Billing itself the \"Greatest 36 Holes in Golf,\" the Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, was designed by Eric Trump. The course is hosting a PGA Seniors Championship event later this week, after Mr. Trump leaves. Signs promoting the event had already been erected all over the course before he arrived on Tuesday and, on the highway leading in, temporary metal signs guided drivers onto the correct road.",
      "Golfers hitting the course at dawn as part of that event had to put their clubs through metal detectors erected as part of the security sweeps ahead of his arrival. Several dozen people, some dressed for golf, including wearing cleats, had filled the sand trap near the tee box to watch the ribbon-cutting ceremony shortly before it was scheduled to start. Another group of people was watching from the other side in tall grass growing on sand dunes flanking the first hole.",
      "Also from Scotland's north is the president's late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born on the Isle of Lewis, immigrated to New York and died in 2000 at age 88.",
      "\"My mother loved Scotland,\" Mr. Trump said during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday at another one of his golf courses, Turnberry, on Scotland's southern coast. \"It's different when your mother was born here.\"",
      "Mr. Trump used his trip to meet with Starmer and reach a trade framework for tariffs between the U.S. and the European Union's 27 member countries\u00a0\u2014 though scores of key details remain to be hammered out. But the trip has featured a lot of golf, and having the president visit is sure to raise the new course's profile.",
      "Mr. Trump's assets are in a trust, and his sons are running the family business while he's in the White House. Any business generated at the course will ultimately enrich the president when he leaves office though.",
      "A press release says the new course features the world's largest natural bunker, dunes and greens overlooking the sea, with a \"focus on environmental sensitivity.\"",
      "Visible from various parts of the new course were towering windmills lining the coast \u2014 some with blades that showed visible dots of rust. They are part of a nearby windfarm that Mr. Trump sued to block construction of in 2013.",
      "He lost that case and was eventually ordered to pay legal costs for bringing it \u2014 and the issue still enrages him. During the meeting with Starmer, Mr. Trump called windmills \"ugly monsters\" and suggested they were part of \"the most expensive form of energy.\"",
      "\"I restricted windmills in the United States because they also kill all your birds,\" the president said. \"If you shoot a bald eagle in the United States, they put you in jail for five years. And windmills knock out hundreds of them. They don't do anything. Explain that.\"",
      "Starmer said in the U.K., \"we believe in a mix\" of energy, including oil and gas and renewables.",
      "The new golf course is the third owned by the Trump Organization in Scotland. Mr. Trump bought Turnberry in 2014 and owns another course near Aberdeen that opened in 2012.",
      "Mr. Trump golfed at Turnberry on Saturday, as protesters took to the streets, and on Sunday. He invited Starmer, who famously doesn't golf, aboard Air Force One so the prime minister could get a private tour of his Aberdeen properties before Tuesday's ceremonial opening.",
      "\"Even if you play badly, it's still good,\" Mr. Trump said of golfing on his course over the weekend. \"If you had a bad day on the golf course, it's OK. It's better than other days.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday told federal workers they can talk about religion at work, including by trying to \"persuade others of the correctness of their own religious views.\"",
      "In a memo to the heads of federal agencies, the Office of Personnel Management \u2014 the government's human resources arm \u2014 said public employees have the right to religious expression in the workplace, citing civil rights law and the First Amendment. That includes the right to discuss religion, engage in \"communal religious expressions\" and display items such as bibles, crucifixes and mezuzahs on their desks, the memo states.",
      "\"During a break, an employee may engage another in polite discussion of why his faith is correct and why the non-adherent should re-think his religious beliefs,\" it states. \"However, if the non-adherent requests such attempts to stop, the employee should honor the request.\"",
      "The five-page memo listed out other examples of religious expression that federal workers shouldn't be punished for. OPM said in its memo that employees can invite co-workers who belong to other religions to their church or put up invitations to Easter services on communal bulletin boards; staff can display religious posters, Veterans Affairs doctors can pray over their patients, and park rangers for the National Park Service can join their tour groups in prayer.",
      "According to the memo, agencies can still broadly limit staffers' speech \u2014 for example, they can \"require that employees perform official work while on duty,\" and they can ban employees from putting up posters of any kind, both religious and non-religious. It also said attempts to persuade co-workers about religion can't be \"harassing in nature.\"",
      "Still, staff \"must be allowed to engage in private religious expression in work areas to the same extent that they may engage in nonreligious private expression,\" the office said.",
      "The policy isn't entirely new. In 1997, the Clinton administration said federal employees can \"discuss their religious views with one another\" and \"may even attempt to persuade fellow employees of the correctness of their religious views\" \u2014 but they \"must refrain from such expression when a fellow employee asks that it stop.\"",
      "For years, the Department of Labor's online religious discrimination guidelines have said staffers \"who seek to proselytize in the workplace should cease doing so with respect to any individual who indicates that the communications are unwelcome.\"",
      "\"Federal employees should never have to choose between their faith and their career,\" OPM Director Scott Kupor said Monday in a statement. \"This guidance ensures the federal workplace is not just compliant with the law but welcoming to Americans of all faiths.\"",
      "Monday's memo comes amid a broader push by the Trump administration to let federal workers express religious beliefs. Earlier this month, OPM said federal agencies should \"adopt a generous approach\" when staffers ask for permission to work from home or change their schedules for religious reasons, citing a 2023 Supreme Court case in which a mail carrier requested Sundays off for religious reasons.",
      "In early February, shortly after returning to office, President Trump signed an executive order accusing the Biden administration of pervasive \"anti-Christian weaponization of government.\" The order set up a task force to look into alleged anti-Christian bias. Months later, the State Department encouraged staff to report any allegations of bias.",
      "The moves have drawn pushback. The Freedom From Religion Foundation called Monday's memo \"outrageous and unconstitutional,\" arguing the guidance \"purports to protect religious expression in the federal workplace but encourages outright proselytizing.\"",
      "\"These shocking changes essentially permit workplace evangelizing, but worse still, allow supervisors to evangelize underlings and federal workers to proselytize the public they serve,\" the group's co-president, Annie Laurie Gaylor, said in a statement.",

      "Mizelle also cites Boasberg's handling of a case involving alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua who were flown to a Salvadoran prison earlier this year. Boasberg ordered the planes to turn around on March 15, after the Trump administration removed the men under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg subsequently held hearings in the case in which he has lambasted the conduct of Justice Department attorneys and questioned whether the Trump administration is acting in good faith to guarantee due process for those it has removed from the U.S. or intends to remove.",

      "Bondi wrote in a post on X that the judge's remarks \"have undermined the integrity of the judiciary, and we will not stand for that.\"",
      "The complaint was addressed to the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Sri Srinivasan.

    "summary": "Trump says he's \"very disappointed\" with Vladimir Putin, and he's shortening the deadline for the Russian leader to agree a ceasefire with Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Monday a significant tightening of his deadline for Russia's Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine. He said as he met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during his visit to Scotland that the 50-day deadline he announced earlier this month would be reduced to less than two weeks, citing a lack of progress in negotiations.",
      "Mr. Trump said as he headed in for his meeting with Starmer that he was \"very disappointed\" in Russia's leader over the ongoing bombing of Ukrainian cities, and that the deadline he gave Russia a couple weeks ago to agree to a truce would be reduced.",
      "Mr. Trump said earlier this month that if Russia failed to agree to a ceasefire within the 50-day timeframe, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that continue to do business with Russia. That would have meant a deal agreed by around the end of August.",
      "But Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday, as he sat down with Starmer, that he was \"going to make a new deadline of about 10 or 12 days from today.\"",
      "\"There's no reason in waiting,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We just don't see any progress being made.\"",
      "\"I've spoken to President Putin a lot, I've gotten along with him very well,\" Mr. Trump said earlier, before sitting down with Starmer.",
      "But he lamented that the Russian leader, \"goes out and starts launching rockets into some city, like Kyiv, and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever, you have bodies lying all over the street.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was \"very disappointed in Putin,\" adding: \"I'm going to reduce that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number, because I think I already know the answer what's going to happen.\"",
      "Russia rejected the deadline when the White House first announced it, calling it \"unacceptable.\"",
      "\"I'm not so interested in talking anymore,\" Mr. Trump said of Putin, explaining that he and Putin will have a nice conversation, and then the following day, the Russians killed more Ukrainians.",
      "Seated alongside Starmer, Mr. Trump also addressed the situation in Gaza, saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid.",
      "\"Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved.\"",
      "While ostensibly a private trip, marked by multiple rounds of golf on his own luxury courses in Scotland, Mr. Trump has also done business \u2013 including nailing down a long-sought-after\u00a0U.S.-European Union trade agreement.",
      "After meeting for just over one hour with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday, Mr. Trump emerged to say, \"We have good news. We've reached a deal.\"",
      "When considered as a combined economy, the EU bloc is the second largest in the world behind the U.S. Including goods and services, U.S.-EU trade is worth about $2 trillion per year.",
      "\"I think it's great that we made a deal today, instead of playing games,\" Mr. Trump said of the framework trade agreement. \"I think it's the biggest deal ever made.\"",
      "\"It's a big deal, it's a huge deal,\" agreed Von der Leyen. \"It will bring stability. It will bring predictability.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with Starmer is also touching on trade, though the U.S. and the U.K. already\u00a0agreed on a framework trade deal\u00a0last month. Starmer has made it clear he wants to keep pushing Mr. Trump to further ease tariffs on British steel and other imports as the details of the agreement are hashed out.",
      "Mr. Trump said his meeting with Starmer would provide a chance to celebrate the U.S.-U.K. agreement, along with the new EU deal.",
      "Most EU member nations' governments voiced support for that agreement on Monday, though some of them unenthusiastically \u2013 and the French Prime Minister even took a jab at the bloc, accusing it of \"submission\" to Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump said the tariff rate for the EU's 27 member countries would be 15% for most imports, including vehicles. The EU, meanwhile, agreed to purchase U.S. military hardware, $750 billion of American energy, and to increase its collective investment in the U.S. by $600 billion.",
      "There was good news for U.S. companies that sell products into the EU market, too, as Mr. Trump announced that all 27 EU nations \"will be opened up to trade with the United States at zero tariff.\"",
      "The agreement was made at Mr. Trump's luxury golf resort in Turnberry, on the Scottish coast, where the president spent the weekend teeing off.",
      "The deal avoids a trans-Atlantic trade war that could have unfolded on Friday, when Mr. Trump had threatened to impose a blanket 30% tariff on all goods imported from the EU, which had vowed to retaliate.",
      "That deadline remains in place for countries that have yet to make a deal with the U.S., including Mexico, Canada, and most consequentially, China. On Monday, Mr. Trump said tariffs for countries that don't reach a deal with the U.S. will be \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range,\" which differs from the 15% to 50% range he floated last week.",
      "Trade talks between Beijing and Washington were taking place Monday in Stockholm, and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in interviews over the weekend that the Aug. 1 deadline for deals to be reached wasn't flexible.",
      "\"No extensions, no more grace periods. August 1, the tariffs are set. They'll go into place. Customs will start collecting the money, and off we go,\" Lutnick said.",

Alford was principal deputy assistant attorney general and Rinner served as a deputy assistant attorney general and head of merger enforcement. Both officials served in the antitrust division during President Trump's first term.",
      "It was unclear why they were fired, but sources said insubordination was cited in the dismissals. The two officials had been placed on administrative leave last week.",
      "Justice Department spokespeople did not immediately comment. CBS News has reached out to Alford and Rinner for comment.",
      "Earlier this month, internal friction within the Justice Department's antitrust team led to private conversations in the Trump administration about whether to push out some staff or to work to smooth out the issues, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation.",

    "summary": "Man facing drug and gun charges seeks dismissal of indictment on grounds that Habba was unlawfully named acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's attempt to keep Alina Habba, his former personal lawyer, as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor has prompted a legal challenge, as a man facing drug and gun charges has alleged that she holds the office unlawfully.",
      "A lawyer for the man, Julien Giraud Jr., asked a federal judge Sunday to toss the indictment or bar Habba or any assistants acting under her authority from exercising prosecutorial powers in the case. He argues that Habba's appointment Thursday to serve as the acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey violates the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, and said that a district court's decision appointing her then-deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to temporarily fill the role as the state's top prosecutor is legally controlling.",
      "Giraud is \"facing an imminent criminal trial proceeding under questionable legal authority,\" under Habba, his attorney Thomas Mirigliano wrote in the motion. Mirigliano argued that Habba's reappointment after her nomination to become New Jersey's U.S. attorney is also unconstitutional. Politico first reported the request stemming from Habba's position.",
      "\"By circumventing the constitutionally mandated appointment procedures, and encroaching upon judicial powers explicitly granted by statute, the executive branch has exceeded its lawful authority,\" he wrote, adding that allowing the prosecution of his client to proceed under the current landscape \"would endorse an unconstitutional executive usurpation of judicial authority.\"",
      "The filing from Giraud is the latest twist in Habba's tenure as U.S. attorney for New Jersey, which came to a head last week as she neared the end of her limited term serving temporarily in the role.",
      "Federal law restricted Habba's time in the post to 120 days, unless the federal district court in the state extended her tenure or she won Senate confirmation. But New Jersey's two senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, opposed her nomination, making it highly unlikely it would advance through the upper chamber.",
      "Last week, judges on the district court in New Jersey invoked a rarely used authority when they declined to keep Habba in her role of interim U.S. attorney as her 120-day term was set to expire. In her place, the judges selected the No. 2 in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office, Desiree Leigh Grace, to serve as U.S. attorney for the state until another candidate for the job was nominated by Mr. Trump and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "But after the district court's decision, Attorney General Pam Bondi fired Grace, a career prosecutor in the office. Grace said she intended to still serve in the role, sparking confusion over who was leading the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Garden State.",
      "The White House then pulled Habba's nomination to serve as the top prosecutor, a Justice Department official said, as part of a multi-part scheme to keep her temporarily in charge of the office. Following the withdrawal and firing, Habba was appointed first assistant U.S. attorney, Grace's job before her removal, which cleared the way for her to temporarily fill the spot of U.S. attorney in New Jersey under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.",
      "The vacancies law limits Habba's time in the position to 210 days from when the vacancy occurred.",
      "Because New Jersey federal judges have a conflict of interest in the Giraud's case due to the order to remove Habba and appoint Grace, Mirigliano's motion has been assigned to Pennsylvania Judge Matthew Brann, who was appointed to the federal district court by President Barack Obama in 2012.",
      "Grace has not indicated whether or not she would challenge Habba's control of the office and seek to enforce the judges' order authorizing her appointment.",

    "story": [
      "When FBI agents arrived outside William Spearman's home in the quiet suburb of Madison, Alabama, in November 2022, they were prepared for danger.",
      "Their search warrant was so important to the bureau that it was approved by the FBI director himself. When the agents breached Spearman's door with tactical explosives, Spearman fought back, tussling with the agents as three of his handguns remained barely out of reach.\tThe FBI managed to handcuff and arrest Spearman, a high-value arrest, in what a top Justice Department official called \"one of the most successful\" prosecutions of its kind.",
      "Spearman went by the nickname \"Boss\" and was labeled by the Justice Department as \"one of the most significant\" purveyors of child sex abuse material in the world. His arrest in 2022, his guilty plea a year later and his eventual life sentence were part of an unprecedented takedown of a prodigious child abuse network.",
      "Spearman is one of at least 18 people convicted so far of leading and utilizing the dark web to share hundreds of thousands of unlawful sexually exploitative images of children.\tThe Justice Department calls the investigation and prosecutions Operation Grayskull; it helped secure those arrests and shutter four heavily trafficked dark web sites where violent and horrific images of child sexual abuse were traded and housed.",
      "The Operation Grayskull investigation launched in 2020, when law enforcement agents noticed a spike in traffic to a dark web site suspected of hosting child abuse material. The dark web child abuse sites eventually attracted more than 120,000 members, millions of files and at least 100,000 visits in a single day, according to an FBI official who spoke with CBS News.",
      "\"Even for prosecutors, it is difficult to understand how pervasive this is,\" said Matthew Galeotti, head of the Justice Department Criminal Division.",
      "\"Because it happens on the dark web, people aren't aware of it. It's extremely troubling,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Spearman's case has parallels to many of the others unearthed by Operation Grayskull. Spearman was accused of helping lead a dark web site with thousands of users and members.\tA sentencing memo submitted to the court said it was \"no wonder\" that he had tried to resist the FBI, rather than surrendering.",
      "\"The devices at his desk contained massive quantities of evidence proving that he was the lead administrator of Website A,\" the memo said. \"Unsurprisingly, the defendant's devices also contained an enormous collection of images and videos depicting the rape and abuse of children.\"",
      "Selwyn Rosenstein was sentenced to 28 years in prison in 2022, for\u00a0 operating a dark website for unlawful exploitative images. Prosecutors said the platform \"was not simply a website; it was a large, active community of pedophiles and (abuse material) enthusiasts. And it existed in part because of the Defendant's criminal acts.\"",
      "Rosenstein possessed such a large quantity of abusive images, he needed to store some on a server he used to run his business, according to the Justice Department.",
      "Speaking from a second floor conference room at Justice Department headquarters in Washington last week, Galeotti told CBS News the members of these dark web child abuse sites often \"earn\" membership by paying a fee, \"helping moderate the site\" or contributing child abuse images or material.",
      "Galeotti said, \"We luckily have very sophisticated prosecutors and agents who work specifically on this kind of thing. These are people who have a more of a technical understanding.\"",
      "\"The defendants in this case, as sadistic as they may be, are somewhat sophisticated,\" and make use of encryption, he added.",
      "Operation Grayskull also secured the conviction of Matthew Garrell of Raleigh, North Carolina, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for operating on a dark web site for abuse material.",
      "\"Garrell engaged in an extremely complex and technologically sophisticated conspiracy that far exceeds the typical child-exploitation offenses,\" prosecutors said.",
      "They argued in a court filing that Garrell possessed a predator's \"handbook,\" with \"detailed instructions\" for grooming children for future abuse.",
      "The takedown of dark web leaders and users also included the convictions of men from Virginia, Maryland, Indiana, Texas, Washington, Arkansas, Michigan and Oklahoma.",
      "\"They were part of an online community of hundreds of thousands of people, with leadership roles rules and a common dedicated purpose\" said Chris Delzotto, an acting FBI deputy assistant director. Delzotto told CBS News, \"Few people would have envisioned how (child abuse materials) would permeate the internet, the way it has today.\"",
      "The federal investigation which uncovered and shuttered the first dark web site, also led to the closure of three others. Abbigail Beccaccio, an FBI unit chief, told CBS News. \"The leadership team that operated one of the sites also operated several of the others.\"",
      "The Justice Department is touting the shutdown of those sites as a victory to help deter future abuse or production of unlawful images. \"This is one of the most successful of all time,\" Galeotti said. \"We dismantled four websites that have not regenerated.\"",

      "Asked about a tariff rate \"for the world,\" as Mr. Trump put it, the president responded, \"I would say it'll be somewhere in the 15 to 20% range.\" The U.S. president made the remarks seated alongside U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland, as Mr. Trump visits his golf courses there and meets with European leaders.",
      "The U.S. and U.K. have already reached a trade agreement, and over the weekend, after meeting with European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the two leaders announced a trade deal between the U.S. and the EU.",
      "A Trump administration deadline of Aug. 1 for other countries to reach trade deals with the U.S. is rapidly approaching. Without an individual deal, Mr. Trump says most countries' products will see a flat tariff rate.",
      "\"I just want to be nice. I would say in the range of 15 to 20%,\" Mr. Trump said Monday, adding, \"probably one of those two numbers.\"",
      "But as recently as Wednesday, Mr. Trump floated a higher range, between 15% and 50%. Mr. Trump, who in April said the U.S. had 200 trade deals with other nations, has since said there are too many countries for individual trade deals with all of them and the U.S. will have \"simple\" tariffs for \"most\" countries.",
      "\"We have over 200 countries, people don't realize, that's a lot of, that's a lot of deals ... that would be too much for anybody,\" the president said Wednesday.",
      "Tariffs are paid for by the importing business to the U.S. government, and are not directly paid by a foreign company's government or company. Companies may pass along those higher expenses to U.S. consumers.",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Jul 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Justice Department seeks to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement, which requires U.S. immigration officials to hold migrant children in facilities that are safe and sanitary, among other protections.",
    "story": [
      "A child developed a rash after he was prevented from changing his underwear for four days. A little boy, bored and overcome with despair, began hitting himself in the head. A child with autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was forced to go without his medication, despite his mother's pleas.",
      "\"I heard one officer say about us 'they smell like sh--,'\" one detained person recounted in a federal court filing. \"And another officer responded, 'They are sh--.'\"",
      "Attorneys for immigrant children collected these stories, and more, from youth and families detained in what they called \"prison-like\" settings across the U.S. from March through June, even as the Trump administration has requested a federal district court judge terminate existing protections that mandate basic rights and services \u2014 including safe and sanitary conditions \u2014 for children held by the government.",
      "The administration argues that the protections mandated under what is known as the Flores Settlement Agreement encourage immigration and interfere with its ability to establish immigration policy. U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee, who is in California, is expected to issue a ruling on the request after an Aug. 8 hearing.",
      "With the Flores agreement in place, children are being held in \"unsafe and unsanitary\" U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities such as tents, airports, and offices for up to several weeks despite the agency's written policy saying people generally should not be held in its custody longer than 72 hours, according to the June court filing from immigrants' attorneys. In addition to opposing the U.S. Department of Justice's May request to terminate the Flores consent decree, the attorneys demanded more monitoring for children in immigration detention.",
      "\"The biggest fear is that without Flores, we will lose a crucial line of transparency and accountability,\" said Sergio Perez, executive director of the California-based Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law. \"Then you have a perfect storm for the abuse of individuals, the violation of their rights, and the kind of treatment that this country doesn't stand for.\"",
      "The Flores agreement has set minimum standards and oversight for detained immigrant children since 1997, when it brought an end to a decade-long lawsuit filed on behalf of unaccompanied immigrant minors who had been subjected to poor treatment in unsafe and unsanitary conditions without access to medical care. It is named for Jenny Lisette Flores, a 15-year-old from El Salvador who was taken into U.S. custody in the mid-1980s, subjected to strip searches, and housed alongside unrelated men.",
      "The agreement established national standards for the protection of immigrant children detained by federal authorities, with requirements for safe and sanitary detention facilities, access to clean water, appropriate food, clothing, bedding, recreational and educational opportunities, sanitation, plus appropriate medical and mental health care. Children in immigrant detention range from infants to teens.",
      "In 2015, Gee ruled that the agreement includes children accompanied by adults.",
      "The Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, which includes both the Customs and Border Protection agency and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to answer questions about the administration's intent to end the Flores agreement or about the conditions in which kids are detained. In a May court filing, government attorneys argued, among other points, that the agreement improperly directs immigration decisions to the courts, not the White House. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi also has said that the Flores agreement has \"incentivized illegal immigration,\" and that Congress and federal agencies have resolved the problems Flores was designed to fix.",
      "ICE detention facilities have the \"highest standards,\" Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in an email to KFF Health News. \"They are safe, clean, and hold illegal aliens who are awaiting final removal proceedings.\"",
      "Immigration lawyers and researchers have pushed back on the idea that the Flores agreement encourages migration, arguing that the conditions in people's homelands are driving them to move.",
      "President Trump is not the first president to seek to modify, or end, the agreement.",
      "In 2016, President Barack Obama's administration unsuccessfully sought to exempt accompanied minors from the Flores agreement, arguing that an influx of immigrants from Central America had overwhelmed the system.",
      "In 2019, following a policy that caused family separation, the first Trump administration announced it would replace Flores with new regulations to expand family detention and eliminate detention time limits. The courts rejected that plan, too.",
      "In 2024, President Joe Biden's administration successfully requested to remove the Department of Health and Human Services from the agreement after the Office of Refugee Resettlement incorporated some Flores standards into agency regulations.",
      "Allegations of unsafe conditions under the agreement also predate this latest immigration crackdown under Mr. Trump. One court filing from 2019 said that attorneys visiting two Texas detention centers found at least 250 infants, children, and teens, some of whom had been held at the facility for nearly a month. \"Children were filthy and wearing clothes covered in bodily fluids, including urine,\" the filing said.",
      "Seven children are known to have died while in federal custody from 2018 to 2019, according to media reports.",
      "And in 2023, 8-year-old Anadith Danay Reyes Alvarez became sick and died while in Customs and Border Protection custody in Texas for nine days. Her parents had turned over medical records detailing the girl's medical history, including diagnoses of sickle cell disease and congenital heart disease, upon their detention. Yet her mother's repeated pleas for emergency medical care were ignored.",
      "Her family filed a wrongful death claim in May.",
      "Advocates attributed the deaths partly to prolonged detention in increasingly crowded facilities and delayed medical care. Officials have said they increased\u00a0medical services and acknowledged failures in the wake of the deaths.",
      "But with the Trump administration's unprecedented push to detain and deport migrants \u2014 including families \u2014 the threat to the health of children caught up in those sweeps is alarming child advocates.",
      "\"Very rarely do you have spikes in populations of detained folk that you don't see a drastic decrease in the quality of their medical care,\" said Daniel Hatoum, a senior supervising attorney at the Texas Civil Rights Project, one of the groups that filed the wrongful death claim for Anadith's family.",
      "Recent reports from court-appointed monitors cite continued lack of access to appropriate medical care; temperature extremes; few outside recreational opportunities; lack of appropriate food and clothing; and an inability to dim lights to sleep.",
      "Terminating the Flores agreement would remove all outside oversight of immigration detention facilities by court-ordered monitors and attorneys. The public would have to depend on the government for transparency about the conditions in which children are held.",
      "\"Our system requires that there be some oversight for government, not just the Department of Homeland Security, but in general,\" Hatoum said. \"We know that. So, I do not believe that DHS could police itself.\"",
      "In the months after Mr. Trump took office and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency began cuts, the administration shuttered DHS' Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which were intended to add a layer of oversight. After a lawsuit, the Trump administration reversed action and noted the offices would remain open, but it is unclear how those offices have been affected by shifts in policy and cuts in staffing.",
      "Leecia Welch, an attorney with the legal advocacy group Children's Rights, said the Flores agreement itself, or efforts to hold the government responsible for abiding by its requirements, are not rooted in partisan politics. She said she raised concerns about conditions during Biden's administration, too.",
      "\"These are not political issues for me,\" Welch said. \"How does our country want to treat children? That's it. It's very simple. I'm not going to take it easy on any administration where children are being harmed in their care.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to French Foreign Minister Jean\u2011No\u00ebl\u202fBarrot, who joins us this morning from Paris. Welcome to \"Face The Nation.\" I want to begin on what is happening in Gaza with those horrific images that we are seeing of starvation overnight, Israel has begun air drops. We know Jordan, other states are looking to organize more aid. Are you exploring any further avenues to bring aid into Gaza?",
      "FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN-NO\u00cbL BARROT: What's happening in Gaza right now is appalling. Gaza is- is- is now in the brink of a full catastrophe, and we've been working out, over the months, to try and relief the sufferings of the Palestinian people. We actually have 52 tons of humanitarian help stuck in El-Arish in Egypt, a few kilometers away from Gaza. So we're exploring all options to seize the opportunity offered by the Israeli government by opening the skies of Gaza, but we call for immediate, unhindered, and massive access by all means of humanitarian help to those who need it most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Has Israel responded to your calls?",
      "BARROT: We have, with the European Union, started tough discussions with the Israeli government, who have made first commitments that have not been fulfilled yet. In the next few days, the European Commission will make clear what our expectations are. We expect the Israeli government to stop the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that has caused bloodbath in humanitarian help distribution lines in Gaza. We expect them to pay the 2 billion euros they owe to the Palestinian Authority and to lift the financial blockage that is now preventing the Palestinian Authority to implement its most basic missions. We also expect the Israeli government to bring to a stop its latest settlement projects, the E1 projects with 3,400 housing units that might split the West Bank in two pieces and prevent the emergence of a political, a two state solution. But what we call for is, of course, the immediate cease-fire, the liberation of whole hostages of Hamas, that needs to be disarmed. And the entry, the massive entry, of humanitarian help in Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are headed to New York, to the United Nations, to help lead a summit to talk about a two state solution. Your president announced France will formally recognize the state of Palestine at the UN in September. More than 100 countries recognize Palestine, but France is the first western UN Security Council member to do so, and the United States opposes what you are saying. Secretary of State Rubio called it \"reckless.\" He says it serves Hamas propaganda, sets back peace, and considers it \"a slap in the face to the victims of October 7.\" In your government's view, why is he wrong?",
      "BARROT: So the reason why President Macron made this decision is that it was absolutely necessary to restart a political process, the two state solution process that was- that is today threatened, more threatened that it- it has ever been. And the conference that will take place in New York tomorrow and Tuesday is a very significant milestone, because by- by- by recognizing, or announcing the recognition of Palestine, France has been able, alongside Saudi Arabia, that has- that will be co chairing this conference with us, to collect very significant historic commitments by all stakeholders, including the Palestinian Authority president and Arab countries, in favor of the two state solution, and guarantee security guarantees for Israel. The two state solution is very simple, and I think everyone can understand what we mean by that. The only way to bring peace and stability back in this region is to have two state, the state of Israel and the state of Palestine, living side by side in peace and in security. This perspective is now threatened, and it's why the- the dynamic that we have initiated was so important, and this is why the conference that will take place in New York is such an important milestone. All these efforts are very, very complementary to the efforts that the U.S. have done in the region since the first term of President Trump. We share the short-term objective: immediate cease-fire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas that needs to be disarmed. We share the long term objective: peace and stability in the region. And what we're doing, by bringing the Palestinian Authority leader to recognize seventh of October as a terrorist attack, by calling the Hamas- the disarm- for the disarmament of Hamas and the liberation of hostages, by committing to deep reform of the Palestinian Authority, and by committing to elections within one year, by bringing the Arab countries for the first time to condemn Hamas and call for its disarmament, we are creating, or recreating, the conditions for this political solution that, again, is the only path forward, and we are paving the way. We're paving the way for the future Abraham Accords that the U.S. administration might lead. So I see our effort as very complementary to the U.S. administration's effort, rather than substitutes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, the president of the United States dismissed what President Macron said, the U.S. Ambassador mocked it. Do you believe that your plans can succeed without U.S. support?",
      "BARROT: Again, our efforts are very complementary . We share the short term objective, cease-fire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas, and the long term objective, peace and stability in the region. In fact, we will welcome any further efforts led by the U.S. to implement the Abraham Accord logics. And what we're doing now with this very significant conference that will take place in New York will pave the way for such accords. But in the meantime, until the U.S. administration provides, through the Abraham Accord logics, a political horizon for this crisis, we need to act in order to facilitate the- or create an off ramp for the catastrophe ongoing in Gaza. Now the terms, we will welcome and support future Abraham Accords, but in the meantime, inaction is not an option.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you briefly about an incident that has gained a lot of attention this past week involving some young French citizens who were removed from a flight from Spain. The airline claims they were kicked off for being disruptive. The Israeli government came out though and said the French students were removed because they're Jewish. Have you determined whether this was indeed an act of antisemitism?",
      "BARROT: I have called the CEO of this company, who has- to express our- our serious preoccupation. She has confirmed that an internal investigation is ongoing. My team has been reaching out to the ambassador of Spain in- in France, and we've made the same request. We'll keep following this situation as it unravels",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So too- too early to say, despite what the Israeli government is indicating.",
      "BARROT: I cannot comment on that at this point. We've taken action as- as soon as we got, you know, as we got notice of what was happening, we offered support on location through our embassy to this group. We then reached out to the- the airline company, to the Spanish authorities, and we're now following the results of these investigations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: France has been very active diplomatically on a number of fronts. It was just five weeks ago when the United States and Israel bombed Iran. Since that time, France has talked to the Iranian government, along with other European powers, about what remains of Iran's nuclear program. How concerned are you that after these bombings, Iran may now covertly attempt to make a weapon, and the world won't know?",
      "BARROT: This is still a risk that we are facing, and alongside Germany and the UK, we have been very clear, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, and we've been, over the past few months, reaching out to the Iranian authority in close coordination with U.S. authorities in order to express what our expectations are. Ten years ago, we reached a deal on the nuclear program that allowed for a significant rollback of Iranian nuclear capacity. Of course, things has changed. Still then, and since then, Iran has violated all commitments it had taken at the time of signing this agreement. We now want a more comprehensive agreement that would encompass both the nuclear dimension of Iranian destabilization activities, but also it's the ballistic component, as well as the regional destabilization activities that Iran has been conducting, unless we- unless a new and robust and durable and verifiable agreement is reached by the end of the summer, France, Germany and the UK will have no other choice but to reapply the global embargoes that were lifted 10 years ago when the nuclear agreement with Iran was signed, embargoes on weapons, on nuclear equipment, and on banking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So France is ready to snap back sanctions on Iran as soon as August. Are you asking Iran to speak directly to the United States in order to avoid that fate?",
      "BARROT: We've been speaking with Special Envoy Witkoff, Secretary Rubio, on a weekly basis on this topic that is highly important for the U.S., as for Europeans. We- we have supported U.S.-led efforts to enter into discussions with Iran. We have pressed Iran, after the 12 day war, to go back to a discussion with the U.S., and we'll keep pressing them to do so, because indeed, if there is no solid agreement that can be found by the end of August, we will have no other option but to snap back, meaning to reapply those global embargoes, and we are ready to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, thank you very much for your time this morning."

    "published": "Sun, 27 Jul 2025 14:02:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen said rescissions\u2014the bills to cut funding Congress already approved\u2014are \"just a Washington name for double cross.\"",
    "story": [
      "Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought said his office is considering more options to claw back funding approved by Congress and isn't ruling out sending more bills to lawmakers with further cuts before September.",
      "Vought\u00a0said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that \"we are looking to do [a] rescissions package\" to take back some funding from the Education Department and would be \"looking at a lot of different options.\" A rescissions bill is the president's request to rescind funding already appropriated by Congress. Last week, President Trump signed a bill clawing back foreign aid, NPR and PBS funding, becoming the first president in decades to receive approval for such a measure.",
      "\"We're thrilled that we had the first rescissions package in decades, and we've got the process moving again,\" Vought said of the $10 billion clawback. Asked to confirm there'd be no rescissions package before September, as Congress attempts to fund the government and head off a shutdown, Vought responded, \"Not here to say that. We're looking at all of our options, we will look at it and assess where the Hill is, what are the particular funding opportunities that we have?\"",
      "Asked about National Institutes of Health funding for research into heart disease and cancer that has yet to be released, Vought replied, \"We're going through the same process with the NIH that we did with the education.\" He alleged NIH had wasted funds, claiming \"$2 million for injecting dogs with cocaine that the NIH spent money on, $75,000 for Harvard to study blowing lizards off of trees with leaf blowers.\" He vowed to go \"line by line to make sure the NIH is funded properly\" and said funding would be released \"when we are done with that review.\"",
      "Vought's use of rescissions measures to amend government spending is seen by Democrats and some Republicans as a backdoor method of infringing on Congress' constitutional power of the purse.",
      "\"Rescissions is just a Washington name for double cross,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, also on \"Face the Nation,\" said after Vought's interview on the program. \"They support one thing one day \u2014 the president even signs off \u2014 and then they come back and say they change their mind.\"",
      "But the OMB director argued, \"We have the ability and the executive tools to fund less than what Congress appropriated\" under the Impoundment Control Act, which enables the president to delay spending funds appropriated by Congress, and he didn't rule out a legal battle over the executive branch's authority to revise lawmakers' spending downward, if it \"could find waste\" by an agency.",
      "Vought has also caused GOP Senate Majority Leader John Thune some headaches with a comment he made Thursday suggesting the appropriations process must be \"less bipartisan.\" But this put Thune in a bind as he oversees negotiations to avoid a government shutdown in October, since Republicans hold a slim majority of 53 - 47 in the Senate, and most legislation must reach a 60-vote threshold.",
      "\"It's going to take 60 to fund the government,\" Thune said in response to Vought's remark, and he added, \"we plan to move [appropriations] bills that will have cooperation from the Democrats.\"",
      "Van Hollen said it was ironic that Vought is \"calling for these deep cuts to education, NIH, when he has asked for an increase for his OMB budget.\" And referring to reduction-in-force \u2014 or RIF \u2014 staff cuts the administration wants across the government, Van Hollen added, \"He asked for a 13% increase for his OMB budget. He's asked for more people to join the OMB staff while he's talking about RIF-ing people at other departments.\"",
      "The Maryland senator said that Democratic senators, as they negotiate funding government operations, are \"asking for four Republican senators just to publicly declare that when they say they're gonna fund the Veterans Affairs Department, that they actually mean it.\""

    "summary": "The CIA chief \"strongly supports\" Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's release of documents on Russian activity in 2016 \u2014 which sparked concerns about risks to sensitive sources and methods.",
    "story": [
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe \"strongly supports the public release\" this week of highly sensitive documents by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, according to a CIA spokesperson, who said Ratcliffe \"initiated\" the declassification process after he took the helm at the agency this year.",
      "Gabbard's office publicly released a report drafted in 2017 by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee on Russian activity during the 2016 election, sparking concerns about risks to sensitive sources and methods. She said Wednesday that the document contained additional evidence that Obama administration officials \"manufactured\" a narrative about Russia's actions that was designed to undercut President Trump.",
      "Gabbard also declassified a swath of documents related to the 2016 election last Friday.",
      "\"CIA Director Ratcliffe strongly supports the public release of HPSCI's report, which was the result of a process initiated by CIA and led by DNI Gabbard,\" the CIA spokesperson said, using an abbreviation for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.",
      "\"This effort reflects Director Ratcliffe's continued commitment to elevating the truth and bringing transparency to the American people and would not have been possible without his directive to return it to the committee,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The House report, which the committee's Republican staff finalized in December 2017 but updated through 2020, was so highly classified that it was stored at CIA headquarters before Ratcliffe sent it back to the House panel and ultimately toward public release, CBS News has learned.",
      "The committee made it available to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, according to an ODNI official with knowledge of the declassification process. Gabbard would normally have been required to consult with the intelligence agencies that had contributed sensitive information to the report before declassifying it, but Mr. Trump \u2014 who made the decision to declassify the document with relatively few redactions \u2014 was not under the same obligations, the official said.",
      "The report was the result of one of multiple investigations related to the 2016 election that the committee undertook at a time when Kash Patel, now the FBI director, was a senior staffer. It contained discussions about raw intelligence from a CIA source the agency had recruited in Russia, and questioned whether analysts had sufficiently taken into account the source's motivations, proximity to Putin or potential bias towards Mr. Trump.",
      "The CIA source's information helped inform the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment, or ICA, which concluded in part that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government aspired to help then-candidate Donald Trump's election chances by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. The U.S. exfiltrated a CIA asset from Russia in 2017, CBS News previously confirmed.",
      "That judgment within the ICA has vexed Mr. Trump for years and has been a key focus of Gabbard's recent declassifications.",
      "Gabbard has claimed the documents released by her office reveal a \"treasonous conspiracy\" by Obama-era officials to undermine Mr. Trump during his first term by alleging Russian efforts to help him win in 2016. Gabbard says she has forwarded the records to the Justice Department as part of a criminal referral.",
      "Obama's spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush called Gabbard's accusations \"bizarre\" and \"ridiculous\" earlier this week.",
      "The ICA's judgement about Russian actions in 2016 was also the focus of a recent CIA internal review under Ratcliffe. Released earlier this month, that review contained far fewer of the sensitive details included in the House Republicans' report and said the judgment on Putin's preference for Trump should have been issued with moderate rather than high confidence. But it said it did not dispute the \"quality and credibility\" of the information.",
      "The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark Warner, called the release of the House committee's report by Gabbard \"desperate and irresponsible.\" He said it put highly sensitive sources at risk and could disincentivize potential spies from working for the U.S. government.",
      "\"Tell me how you're going to recruit somebody to, in one of our adversarial nations, maybe work with us, if that information is carelessly thrown around,\" Warner said to reporters on Wednesday.",
      "Ratcliffe, who previously served on the House Intelligence Committee as a congressman from Texas, has said one of his primary objectives as CIA director would be to reinvigorate intelligence collection from human sources. Current and former national security officials have said intelligence provided by human sources, known as HUMINT, has dropped off in recent years, as surveillance technologies have become more sophisticated and ubiquitous.",
      "Human sources \u2014 especially those with proximity to world leaders in adversarial countries like Russia, China and North Korea \u2014 are especially prized and especially rare, given how risky, if not life-threatening, it can be for them to provide information to a foreign intelligence agency. Information provided by human sources typically remains classified for decades, often up to 75 years, according to government classification rules.",
      "At his Senate confirmation hearing in January, Ratcliffe said the recruitment of human spies by the CIA is \"not where it needs to be.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 20:28:00 -0400",
    "summary": "In a new survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \"as satisfying or more satisfying\" than talking with real friends.",
    "story": [
      "No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence.",
      "The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister's birthday party.",
      "The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.",
      "\"Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,\" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. \"I think kids use AI to get out of thinking.\"",
      "For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you.\"",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, with 34% reporting daily usage or multiple times a week, according to\u00a0a new study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \"digital friends,\" like Character. AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",
      "In an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" on Wednesday, Common Sense founder and CEO Jim Steyer said what struck him about the study is that AI companions are \"everywhere in teens' lives.\"",
      "Common Sense's study also found that 11% of teens use AI companions to build up their courage and stand up for themselves, which Steyer said can be a good thing. However, he cautioned that problems arise when the technology replaces human relationships.",
      "\"Younger kids really trust these AI companions to be like friends or parents or therapists,\" Steyer said. \"They're talking about serious relationships, and these are robots. They're not human beings.\"",
      "As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,\" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. \"When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.\"",
      "All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an \"AI companion\" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.",
      "\"That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,\" said Nair. \"It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.\"",
      "How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers",
      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \"as satisfying or more satisfying\" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",
      "\"It's eye-opening,\" said Robb. \"When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.\" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.",
      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",
      "\"If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both.",
      "\"It's a challenge with how kids live today because they spend so many hours in front of a screen, and when you substitute a machine or a robot for human interaction, you're fundamentally changing the nature of that relationship,\" Steyer told CBS News.",
      "The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a \"risk assessment,\" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions.",
      "\"In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,\" Steyer said.",
      "A concerning trend to teens and adults alike",
      "Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot.",
      "\"Parents really have no idea this is happening,\" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up.\" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data.",
      "Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.",
      "Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.",
      "\"One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,\" said Telzer. \"They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.\"",
      "Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.",
      "\"If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,\" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.",
      "Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.",
      "\"I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,\" Perry said. \"I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.\"",
      "Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media.",
      "\"Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,\" Nair said. \"I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper \u2014 our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.\"",
      "\"It's the new addiction,\" Nair added. \"That's how I see it.\"",

      "SpaceX launched twin satellites for NASA Wednesday that will study how the electrically-charged solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field, creating constantly changing and occasionally dangerous \"space weather\" affecting satellites, electrical grids and other critical systems.",
      "The identical TRACERS satellites will operate in the magnetosphere, \"the region around our Earth that is dominated by the planet's magnetic field, and it protects us from the stellar radiation and really from everything else that's going on in space,\" said Joseph Westlake, director of NASA's solar physics division.",

      "\"It's going to help us keep our way of life safe here on Earth.\"",
      "Hitching a ride to space along with TRACERS atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket were five other small satellites, including one that will use a new \"polylingual\" terminal to communicate with multiple other satellites and space probes using different protocols.",
      "Another will collect data about how much solar energy Earth absorbs and reemits into space, known as the \"radiation budget,\" and another that will focus on how high-energy \"killer electrons\" are knocked out of the Van Allen radiation belts to rain down into the atmosphere.",
      "Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental \"cubesat\" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world.",
      "The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg.",
      "The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad.",
      "A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch.",
      "Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later.",
      "TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind \"couples\" with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,\" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa.",
      "\"And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system.\"",
      "That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays, \"but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that.\"",
      "\"So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,\" Miles said.",
      "The goals of the other satellites launched Wednesday range from basic science to technology development. The Polylingual Experimental Terminal, or PExT, will test equipment capable of sending and receiving data from multiple government and commercial satellites across multiple communications protocols.",
      "The goal is to streamline communications to and from a wide variety of satellites and space probes to improve efficiency and lower costs.",
      "Another satellite, known as Athena-EPIC, will continue ongoing measurements of Earth's radiation budget, the balance between solar energy coming into Earth's environment compared to the energy radiated back out into space.",
      "Using spare parts from earlier missions, Athena-EPIC will test innovative LEGO-like satellite components intended to lower costs while reducing the size of satellites.",
      "The Relativistic Atmospheric Loss, or REAL, satellite, another small cubesat, will study how electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts get knocked out of place to pose threats to satellites and other systems. Robyn Millan of Dartmouth College is the principal investigator.",
      "\"The radiation belts are a region surrounding the Earth that are filled with high-energy charged particles that are traveling at near the speed of light,\" she said. \"These are sometimes called killer electrons because these particles are a hazard for our satellites in space.

    "summary": "A dating advice app that lets women anonymously review their dates and compare notes has surged in popularity.",
    "story": [
      "The most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store currently isn't ChatGPT, Threads or Google. It's Tea, a dating advice app that lets women review men they've gone out with, as well as warn other single women about dates they claim went awry.",
      "Tea Dating Advice, an app for helping women vet their dates, is also a top app on the Google Play Store, where it's been downloaded more than 100,000 times.",
      "The app's maker says it offers a measure of security for users that traditional dating apps\u00a0don't. Tea doesn't match singles with potential dates; rather, it's a place for women to share information about men they've dated. Tea lets users run background checks on potential matches, check to see if they have criminal records or appear on sex offender databases, and more, all through the app.",
      "The app also ensures that users who sign up are women by requesting that they submit a selfie for verification. That's aimed at protecting users against so-called catfishing schemes, in which people create fake online personas, often as part of a scheme to defraud others.",
      "Tea declined to comment for this article.",
      "Safety in numbers",
      "To be sure, most of the features that Tea offers already exist. Social media forums, such as the Facebook group called \"Are we dating the same guy?,\" also let women compare notes about their dates in a community forum. The main difference: scale. Tea has more than 1.6 million users, according to its website.",
      "\"What this app seems to be doing is centralizing all that into one very large community,\" Doug Zytko, an associate professor at the University of Michigan-Flint who researches human-computer interactions for safety, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Zytko, who has extensively studied dating app designs, said that safety \"has not been prioritized\" for most such tools in the market, which he said helps explain why Tea has struck a chord with women.",
      "\"The dating app safety features that exist are largely reactive in nature. They're not about keeping people safe, but are punitive actions one can take after something has occurred,\" he added.",
      "Zytko also acknowledged the concerns of some men, voiced on forums like Reddit, that Tea users could share false information about them.",
      "\"If inaccurate information about a man is being shared, that damages his dating prospects and social reputation,\" Zytko said. \"That's scary, but it's not a reason to discount the app.\"",
      "Another potential risk is one common to all social media platform, and digital information more broadly. Tea confirmed to CBS News that its app was hacked Friday morning, with bad actors accessing a data storage system containing information, including selfies, that members had uploaded prior to February 2024.",
      "Additionally, hackers accessed almost 60,000 images from posts, plus comments and direct messages, the company said.",
      "\"Tea has engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure its systems,\" the company said in a statement, noting that it is investigating the incident. \"At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 17:50:10 -0400",
    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What kind of AI jobs?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, global head of research at Lightcast.",
      "In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, up from 3,780 in 2010, \u00a0according to Brookings.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the accelerating adoption of AI by businesses is spurring demand for consultants who can help companies integrate AI. Job listings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 15:42:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Automated license plate reader technology is used by law enforcement agencies in communities across the U.S. \u2014 but the systems sometimes get things wrong.",
    "story": [
      "In 2018, Brian Hofer and his younger brother were driving to visit their parents for Thanksgiving. It should have been a routine trip.",
      "But that evening they found themselves held at gunpoint by a group of law enforcement officers.",
      "The incident was the result of technology gone wrong. Hofer's vehicle had been flagged as stolen by an Automated License Plate Reader \u2014 ALPR \u2014 system. When he drove by, the reader alerted authorities.",
      "\"Your life definitely is different after you have guns pointed at you,\" he said.",
      "This incident is one of over a dozen cases verified by CBS News during a six-month investigation into incidents of wrongful stops and even several instances of ALPR technology being abused.",
      "The consequences of ALPR errors can range from the inconvenient \u2014 such as mistaken toll booth charges \u2014 to the potentially dangerous, such as Hofer's armed detainment. In some instances the technology was improperly used by authorities, such as in Kansas, where law enforcement officers used license plate reader systems to stalk former partners in two separate incidents.",
      "The rise of ALPR systems",
      "In use since at least the\u00a0late 1990s, automated license plate reader systems have advanced quickly in recent years. They now marry high-speed, high-resolution cameras with artificial intelligence to scan every license plate passing through a designated field of vision. The data is then compared against license plate numbers in databases.",
      "Thousands of agencies use these systems daily to scan plates in real time and identify potential matches. Departments use ALPRs as a crime-fighting tool to gather evidence for investigations and reduce crime as well as for traffic compliance.",
      "According to a survey from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, every police department overseeing more than 1 million citizens reported using the technology, as did 90% of sheriff's offices with 500 or more sworn deputies.",
      "Law enforcement officials told CBS News that the technology has allowed them to do their job more efficiently and has helped solve crimes ranging from stolen vehicles to missing persons cases.",
      "Pat Yoes, the national president of The National Fraternal Order of Police, an organization of hundreds of thousands of sworn law enforcement officers, said in an emailed statement to CBS News that ALPRs are \"extraordinarily important in cases where there is an immediate threat to life or safety, as in an abduction or an armed threat driving to a target,\" adding that the information can be valuable in generating leads and closing cases.",
      "He said transparency is key. \"The community should be made aware of the new technology, how it's used in the field, how it contributes to public safety, and how it addresses any privacy concerns,\" he said in the statement. \"Technology like ALPRs is a valuable tool for many law enforcement agencies to make their communities safer.\"",
      "The rise of ALPR systems comes as law enforcement agencies across the country face staffing and recruiting challenges. A 2024 survey by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a professional association, found that U.S. agencies are operating at a nearly 10% staffing deficit. ALPR technology is one way to help fill this gap in manpower.",
      "Why license plate readers make errors \u2014 what we found",
      "License plate reader errors may occur for a variety of reasons. In some cases, letters or numbers are interpreted incorrectly by the Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, software. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, common issues including glare or misaligned cameras could impact accuracy. CBS News found that mistakes are often due to a mix of machine and human or administrative errors.",
      "In Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico, a 12-year-old was handcuffed after an ALPR camera misread the last number of a license plate on a vehicle driven by her older sister as a \"7\" instead of the \"2\" it actually ended with, according to a lawsuit filed against the city. A month later, in a separate incident, a 17-year-old honors student was held at gunpoint in Espa\u00f1ola on his way home from school after officers mistook his vehicle for one associated with an individual who was being sought in connection with a string of armed robberies.",
      "In Aurora, Colorado, in 2020, a mother and her family, including her 6-year-old daughter, were pulled over at gunpoint and forced to lie face down on hot pavement. Again, ALPR technology was central to the stop. Police mistakenly flagged their Colorado license plate as matching that of a completely different vehicle from a different state \u2014 a stolen motorcycle registered in Montana. The incident, captured on video and widely condemned, led to a $1.9 million settlement from the city in 2024.",
      "Privacy and accuracy concerns",
      "The ACLU warns ALPR cameras could infringe on civil rights and violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment by encouraging unreasonable searches. Despite widespread use, there is no federal legislative framework for ALPR use.",
      "Hofer, who has been involved in privacy advocacy for over a decade, is now the executive director of Secure Justice, an organization that aims to reduce government and corporate overreach. He says manual verification is necessary to see whether ALPR \"hits,\" or matches, are accurate. Even so, he said, such checks are insufficient because data errors could cause a plate to \"match\" an incorrect entry in a database.",
      "\"There are billions of scans a day in America. If there's even just a 10% error rate, that means there are so many opportunities for abuse to happen,\" Hofer said.",
      "Some concerned citizens are taking action. Last year, residents of Norfolk, Virginia, filed a federal lawsuit against the city, and in Illinois, two residents have sued the Illinois State Police over ALPR systems, arguing that their use violates Fourth Amendment rights. The latter case was dismissed without prejudice in April.",

      "Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental \"cubesat\" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world.",
      "The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg.",
      "The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad.",
      "A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch.",
      "Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later.",
      "TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind \"couples\" with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,\" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa.",
      "\"And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system.\"",
      "That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays, \"but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that.\"",
      "\"So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,\" Miles said.",

      "AI is like a \"beautiful baby that's born,\" he said of the technology's current state.",

      "Another focus will be on reining in what White House officials have called an \"ideological bias\" in chatbots. This is something Sacks, a former PayPal executive, has highlighted after a 2024 incident in which Google's AI image generator created pictures of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show one of the countries Founding Fathers.",
      "\"We believe that AI systems should be free of ideological bias and not be designed to pursue socially engineered agendas,\" Sacks said on Wednesday. \"And so we have a number of proposals there on how to make sure that AI remains truth-seeking and trustworthy.\"",
      "To that end, Kratsios said the plan will update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with AI developers whose systems \"allow free speech expression to flourish.\"",
      "The plan also seeks to maintain the U.S.' edge in the global race for AI dominance as it competes with countries like China, which has moved quickly to expand its AI capabilities. A senior White House official said the report supports export controls to make sure \"that our most advanced technology doesn't get into the hands of [other] countries.\"",
      "As part of its efforts, the White House also seeks to remove what it refers to as \u00a0\"onerous regulation\" that the Trump administration says is hindering AI innovation. The official added that the plan calls for the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion and climate funding requirements from the Biden administration's CHIPS Act.",
      "DEI regulations within the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act \"burden the industry\" and \"slow down the delivery of critical projects,\" they said.",

Investigators found that his vehicle, the BMW he was seen exiting on Park Avenue, passed through Columbia, New Jersey, at 4:24 p.m. Monday afternoon.",
      "That car was registered to Tamura, according to the police commissioner. When officers searched the vehicle, they discovered a rifle case with rounds, a loaded revolver, ammunition and magazines, a backpack, and medication prescribed to the gunman. Tisch said no explosives were found.",

      "The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will lift tariffs on imports of goods from EU countries to their highest level in decades and hurt the trading bloc's economic growth, according to some experts.",
      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028.",
      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",
      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits.",
      "\"Going forward, we are going to start to see these impacts either through lower profitability for corporations and higher costs for consumers, and most likely a combination of the two,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's recent trade deals with the EU, Japan, U.K. and several other Asian countries, the U.S. still faces a self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline to reach agreements with Canada, Mexico, Korean other key trading partners.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's trade policy faces a critical test this week as a federal court weighs the legality of its sweeping tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Thursday in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President\u00a0Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer.",
      "The lawsuit challenges President Trump's claim that he has authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to issue tariffs, a process that normally requires congressional approval.",
      "A victory by the plaintiffs could deal a blow to Mr. Trump as he seeks to negotiate trade deals with U.S. economic partners. The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday\u00a0announced a pact, easing tension over a brewing trade war. But the White House has yet to reach deals with other major trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, South Korea and China.",
      "What both sides are arguing",
      "The plaintiffs in the V.O.S. case argue that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he bypassed congressional approval and invoked IEEPA as the legal\u00a0basis\u00a0for imposing his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on April 2. Mr. Trump also drew on IEEPA in deploying a separate set of\u00a0tariffs\u00a0in February against Canada, Mexico and China that he said was aimed at stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl.",
      "\"This case is about more than high tariffs,\" Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonpartisan think tank, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's about whether a president can stretch a vague statute beyond recognition to sidestep Congress.\"",
      "IEEPA, among other things, gives the president authority to regulate transactions with foreign countries during national emergencies. However, no U.S. president has ever invoked IEEPA as a justification for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It's limited to emergencies where there is an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 and the trade deficit is hardly an emergency. It's been with us for basically 50 years\" said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center, a nonpartisan public interest law representing the five businesses that have filed suit in the case.",
      "The White House has defended President Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs.",
      "\"The administration is legally and fairly using tariff powers that have been granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to level the playing field for American workers and safeguard our national security,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Why the case is important",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to eliminate trade imbalances with other countries, which he said constitutes an \"unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.\"",
      "But a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could have broader implications for trade policy, forcing Mr. Trump to seek congressional approval in imposing tariffs, Schwab said.",
      "\"If the court holds that the President's Liberation Day and fentanyl tariffs are unlawful, then he would not have authority to set those tariff rates, but still Congress could approve these deals \u2014 just like it did the NAFTA renegotiation in the first Trump term,\" Schwab said in an email.",
      "Presidents can draw on\u00a0other statutes, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to authorize the use of tariffs.",
      "How we got here",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade in May\u00a0struck down Mr. Trump's tariffs, with a three-judge panel ruling that the levies exceeded \"any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "At the time, the trade court said the 10% reciprocal tariffs are designed to deal with trade imbalances, which the judges said did not constitute an emergency under IEEPA. But a federal appeals court in May\u00a0blocked the trade court ruling\u00a0and reinstated the tariffs after the Trump administration appealed.",
      "After the trade court ruling in May, Desai\u00a0said\u00a0Mr. Trump would use \"all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "The case now heads to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., where lawyers from both parties will present their arguments. The court could issue a decision as early as August, Schwab told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "Union Pacific wants to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S, and potentially trigger a final wave of rail mergers across the country.",
      "The proposed merger, announced Tuesday, would marry Union Pacific's vast rail network in the West with Norfolk's rails that snake across 22 Eastern states, and the District of Columbia.",
      "The nation was first linked by rail in 1869, when a golden railroad spike was driven in Utah to symbolize the connection of East and West Coasts. Yet no single entity has controlled that coast-to-coast passage.",
      "The railroads argue a merger would streamline deliveries of raw materials and goods nationwide by eliminating delays when shipments are handed off between railroads. The AP first reported the merger talks earlier this month a week before the railroads confirmed the discussions last week.",
      "Any deal would be closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators that have set a very high bar for railroad deals after previous consolidation in the industry led to massive backups and snarled traffic.",
      "Pressure on remaining railroads",
      "If the deal is approved, the two remaining major American railroads \u2014 BNSF and CSX \u2014 will face tremendous pressure to merge to create a second transcontinental railroad so they can compete. The continent's two other major railroads \u2014 Canadian National and CPKC \u2014 may also get involved. The Canadian rails span all of that nation and feed into America. CPKC rails stretch south into Mexico",
      "Some big shippers like chemical plants in the Gulf may be wary of the deal due to fears of a monopoly that could would wield immense influence over rates, but other major rail customers, like Amazon and UPS, may be in favor if it means packages will arrive more quickly and reliably. Those big companies, along with unions and communities across the country that the railroads cross, will have a chance to weigh before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.",
      "Consumers could benefit if the transcontinental rail does reduce shipping rates and delivery times. Union Pacific said that combined, the railroads would improve delivery times.",
      "There's speculation that this deal might win approval under the pro-business Trump administration, but the STB is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. The board is led by a Republican, and Trump will appoint a fifth member before this deal will be considered.",
      "Union Pacific is offering $20 billion cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal.",
      "Union Pacific's stock fell nearly 2% to $224.98 in premarket trading, while Norfolk Southern's stock dipped more than 3% to $277.40.",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who has championed a merger, said lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh will all reach their destinations more seamlessly.",
      "\"It builds upon President Abraham Lincoln's vision of a transcontinental railroad from nearly 165 years ago, and will usher in a new era of American innovation,\" Vena told investors Tuesday.",
      "From 30 to 6",
      "U.S. railroads have already undergone extensive consolidation. There were more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. Today, six major railroads handle the majority of shipments nationwide.",
      "Western rival BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has the war chest to pursue an acquisition of CSX, to the east, if it chooses. CEO Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348 billion cash and the consummate dealmaker may want to swing for the fences one last time before stepping down as planned at the end of the year.",
      "Buffett recently threw cold water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC, but he rarely uses investment bankers anyway. Buffett reached an agreement to buy the parts of the BNSF railroad he didn't already own for $26.3 billion after a private meeting with its CEO more than a decade ago.",
      "Yet there's widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial rail industry.",
      "That's largely due to the aftermath of a consolidation in the U.S nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. It merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups in the East.",
      "\"We're committed to making sure that doesn't happen in this case,\" said Norfolk CEO Mark George. He added that the railroads will spend the next two years planning for a smooth integration before this deal might get approved.",
      "Just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31 billion to create the CPKC railroad.",
      "There were compelling factors in that deal, however, that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America. The deal announced Tuesday would merge the nation's largest freight railroad, with the smallest.",
      "Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027. They predict that they would be able to eliminate $1 billion in costs annually, but Vena said that every union worker at both railroads should still have a job. The railroads also predict they would be able to boost revenue by at least $1.75 billion each year by winning more business from trucking companies and other railroads.",
      "On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern reported a $768 million second-quarter profit, or $3.41 per share, as volume grew 3%. That's up from $737 million, or $3.25 per share, a year ago, but the results were affected by insurance payments from its 2023 East Palestine derailment and restructuring costs.",
      "Without the one-time factors, Norfolk Southern made $3.29 per share, which was just below the $3.31 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-powell-trump-fomc-interest-rate-meeting-july-30/",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 11:08:59 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. Here's what the experts think will happen at this week's monetary policy meeting.",
    "story": [
      "During a\u00a0meeting last week between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president sought to underscore what he said is a \"very simple\" request: \"Interest rates have to come down.\"",
      "That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision on Wednesday. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has for months\u00a0derided Powell  over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a\u00a0building renovation\u00a0at the Fed could be grounds for firing.",
      "Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite.",
      "\"With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note.",
      "In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts\u00a0earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low.",
      "However, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 a key gauge for tracking inflation \u2014 in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher.",
      "Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know.",
      "When is the Fed making its rate cut decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook.",
      "Who makes decisions on interest rates?",
      "The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy.",
      "Lately, at least two members of the FOMC \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates.",
      "\"[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,\" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. \"From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink.\"",
      "Could the Fed cut rates on Wednesday?",
      "It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut.",
      "For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June\u00a0hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Wednesday to report that second-quarter GDP rose by 1.8%, below 2024's 2.8% rate.",
      "With economic clouds on the horizon, the Fed is expected to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note.",
      "Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation.",
      "\"Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump?",
      "Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about\u00a0replacing him as Fed chair, he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,\" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy.",
      "When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates?",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%.",
      "\"With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,\" Daco said. \"We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.\"",

      "Mayor Eric Adams said on \"CBS Mornings\" on Tuesday that the gunman intended to go to the NFL's offices, but took the wrong elevator bank and went to the 33rd floor, where building management is located. He shot and killed one person on that floor, then turned the gun on himself, officials said.",

      "Of the $131 billion in overall losses for 2025, $80 billion was insured, which is the second-highest amount for the first half of any year since recordkeeping began in 1980. The first half of 2011 is the only year where insured losses have been higher, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami in Japan.",

      "Hall of Fame Chicago Cubs slugger and second baseman Ryne Sandberg has died, following a battle with prostate cancer.",
      "Sandberg died Monday, July 28, the Cubs confirmed. He was 65 years old.",
      "\"Ryne Sandberg was a hero to a generation of Chicago Cubs fans and will be remembered as one of the all-time greats in nearly 150 years of this historic franchise,\" Cubs executive chairman Tom Ricketts said in a statement. \"His dedication to and respect for the game, along with his unrelenting integrity, grit, hustle, and competitive fire were hallmarks of his career. He was immensely proud of his teammates and his role as a global ambassador of the game of baseball, but most of all, he was proud of Margaret, his children and his role as husband, father, and grandfather.\"",
      "Sandberg played in parts of 16 big-league seasons, almost entirely with the Cubs.",
      "Sandberg was born Sept. 18, 1959, in Spokane, Washington. He was the youngest of four children of Derwent \"Sandy\" Sandberg, a mortician, and Elizabeth \"Libby\" Sandberg, a nurse, according to the Society for American Baseball Research.",
      "Sandberg's parents named him for New York Yankees pitcher Ryne Duren, the society reported.",
      "At North Central High School in Spokane, Sandberg was a standout in baseball, as well as football and basketball, the society noted, citing local newspaper reports. He received All-America Team honors from Parade Magazine as a quarterback and punter on the school's football team, and received second-team Greater Spokane League basketball honors his junior and senior years, the society reported.",
      "On the basketball court, John Stockton, later of the Utah Jazz, was a rival of Sandberg's from Gonzaga Prep High School, the society reported.",
      "But of course, it was the baseball diamond that turned out to be Sandberg's calling. In high school, Sandberg made the All-City team twice, hitting .417 with four home runs and helped lead his high school team to a 25-3 record and a second-place finish in the state tournament championship.",
      "Major League Baseball scouts already had their eyes on Sandberg when he signed a letter of intent to go to Washington State University on a football scholarship, the society noted. While this was enough to make most scouts lose interest, scouts for the Philadelphia Phillies kept wooing Sandberg, and he ended up choosing baseball over football.",
      "The Phillies drafted Sandberg in 1978 in the 20th round. He played in the minor leagues first with the Pioneer League in Helena, Montana, and then with Class A Spartanburg in the Western Carolinas League in 1979, the society noted.",
      "Sandberg advanced to Double-A Reading in 1980 and made the Eastern League All-Star Team. He played in Triple-A Oklahoma City in 1981, before the Phillies called him up to the majors late that season.",
      "Following the 1981 season, the Phillies and Cubs exchanged shortstops \u2014 Larry Bowa came to the Cubs in exchange for Iv\u00e1n DeJesus \u2014 but Cubs general manager Dallas Green wanted Sandberg too,\u00a0according to the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "In his first season with the Cubs in 1982, Sandberg played third base and hit .271 with 33 doubles and 32 stolen bases. According to the Baseball Hall of Fame, he finished sixth in the National League Rookie of the Year voting.",
      "Sandberg was switched to second base for the 1983 season \u2014 which the Cubs finished with a record of 71-91, and which is best remembered today for a tirade by manager Lee Elia directed at disrespectful fans. But Sandberg won the first of nine straight Gold Glove Awards that year, the Baseball Hall of Fame noted.",
      "In 1984, Jim Frey replaced Elia as the Cubs' manager. Sandberg was a starter for the Cubs alongside other legends such as Jody Davis, Leon Durham, and Keith Moreland.",
      "When the Cubs took on the St. Louis Cardinals at Wrigley Field\u00a0on June 23, 1984, Sandberg kept driving in runs to overcome an early 7-1 Cubs deficit. But the Cubs were still down 9-8 as the bottom of the ninth began \u2014   only for Sandberg to hit a homer and tie it up.",
      "The Cubs did not score again in the bottom of the ninth, and the game went into extra innings. St. Louis scored two more runs in the top of the 10th and took an 11-9 lead, but with two out and no one on base, Bob Dernier worked a walk from ex-Cub Bruce Sutter \u2014  and Sandberg hit another homer to tie the game at 11, according to the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "The Cubs scored one more time on an RBI single by Dave Owen \u2014   and won 12-11. The game became known as the \"Ryne Sandberg Game\" and propelled the 1984 Cubs toward success that season.",
      "\"This is something that might be a once-in-a-lifetime thing,\" Sandberg said at the time. \"Besides being in shock right now, it was a lot of fun.\"",
      "The Cubs won the National League Eastern Division championship in '84 \u2013 for their first appearance in the postseason since the 1945 World Series.",
      "While the Cubs lost the 1984 National League Championship Series 3-2, Sandberg won the National League Most Valuable Player award and made the All-Star roster for the first of 10 times. According to the Baseball Hall of Fame, Sandberg hit .314 in 1984 and led the NL in runs scored with 114 and triples with 19.",
      "In 1989, a season in which the Cubs also won the National League Eastern Division championship, Sandberg reached the 30-homer mark, according to the Baseball Hall of Fame. According to the Baseball Hall of Fame, he led the National League with 40 home runs, 116 runs, 344 bases, 100 RBI, and 25 steals in 1990.",
      "That year, Sandberg was the first second baseman to lead the National League in home runs since Rogers Hornsby in 1925 and the first second baseman to hit 30 or more home runs in consecutive baseball seasons, according to the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "Sandberg announced his first retirement suddenly in the middle of a season on June 13, 1994, saying he had \"lost the edge it takes to play \u2014 the drive, the motivation, the killer instinct.\" But he returned in 1996 and played two more seasons, before finally calling it quits as a player at the end of the 1997 season.",
      "\"I truly lived my field of dreams right here at Wrigley Field,\" Sandberg told the crowd at Wrigley on Sept. 20, 1997, as recalled by the Society for American Baseball Research.",
      "Sandberg finished his career as a .285 hitter with 282 home runs and a fielding percentage of .989. He notched roughly 68 Wins Above Replacement, per Baseball Reference.",
      "Sandberg was a 10-time All-Star and a winner of nine Gold Glove Awards and seven Silver Slugger Awards. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2005, earning more than 76% of the vote in his third year on the ballot.",
      "\"I didn't play the game right because I saw a reward at the end of the tunnel,\" Sandberg said at the time. \"I played it right because that's what you're supposed to do.\"",
      "After his retirement, Sandberg served as a spring training instructor with the Cubs in Mesa, Arizona. From 2007 until 2010, Sandberg was a manager in the Cubs' minor-league system \u2014   first with the Single-A Peoria Chiefs, then the Double-A Tennessee Smokies, and finally the Triple-A Iowa Cubs.",
      "After Lou Piniella retired as Cubs manager during the 2010 season, Sandberg was a favorite to take his place. However, Cubs general manager Jim Hendry passed on Sandberg and instead  went with Mike Quade, who had already served as interim manager for the last six weeks of the 2010 season after Piniella left.",
      "Sandberg then left the Cubs organization and became a minor league manager for the Phillies, working with the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs in the Phillies' farm system. He served as Philadelphia's bench coach and then as manager of the Phillies for three seasons from 2013 to 2015.",
      "Sandberg won 42.8% of his 278 contests as manager of the Phillies before being removed from the post partway through the 2015 season.",
      "For the past decade, Sandberg served as a popular Cubs ambassador. On the 40th anniversary of the 1984 \"Sandberg game\" last year, the Cubs unveiled his statue just outside Wrigley Field near his fellow franchise Hall of Famers.",
      "\"It's miraculous what can happen when dreams meet opportunity and hard work,\" Sandberg said on that occasion. \"Your dreams come true \u2014 and much, much more than you ever dreamed.\"",
      "Sandberg was diagnosed with prostate cancer in January 2024. He underwent treatment and shared he was declared cancer-free in August of that year, but four months later, he let fans know the cancer had come back and spread to other organs.",
      "Sandberg did make an appearance at Cubs spring training in Mesa, Arizona, for Cubs Spring Training in February 2025, along with his former teammates Shawon Dunston, Mark Grace, Rick Sutcliffe, and Fergie Jenkins. Cubs manager Craig Counsell looked like a youngster in awe at Sandberg at the other veterans \u2014 and Counsell talked about the icons' stories as what meant so much to him.",
      "\"People like Ryno, and Hall of Famers, they make an impact like when they step in the room \u2014 and that's what Ryno has done for us already,\" Counsell said during spring training in February. \"He's made an impact already.\"",
      "But Sandberg and the group were also imparting their wisdom on young players like Matt Shaw.",
      "\"That's why we're here. We're here for the players,\" Sandberg said. \"With Matt, you know, I had a conversation \u2014 I could reflect right back to 1982, and being in camp, and having some minor league seasons under my belt with some success, and, 'OK, now it's the Major Leagues' \u2014 just to let him know what I went through, and what it basically was for me to just feel comfortable with what I was doing and feel comfortable with my talents, because that's what got me to that point.\"",
      "In July 2025, shortly before his passing, Sandberg said he had not been able to be at Wrigley Field as much as he had wanted for the baseball season, but he had been cheering the team on and watching from home.",
      "In Wrigleyville, it was a solemn night Monday as the Wrigley Field marquee honored Sandberg's memory. Many took a seat on the lawn at Gallagher Way alongside the ballpark, as a growing memorial was assembled at the base of Sandberg's statue.",
      "Many made a special trip to Wrigley Field to honor Sandberg and be with other fans. They said they will remember him for his character as much as the way he played the game.",
      "\"He meant a lot to this city, you know, after he played,\" said Ed Twohey. \"I mean, he was an ambassador for the team. He was always around.\"",
      "Matt Lindner said he was at the Sandberg statue just weeks ago, with his daughter as she took her first steps. He too emphasized just how much Sandberg meant to Cubs fans.",
      "\"As a Cubs fan in the 80s and the 90s growing up in the Chicago area, like, he was the Cubs to us, right? Like, he was every kid's hero,\" Lindner said, \"and part of it, as I saw it on social media, I have the means to come over here, and I wanted to see if it was actually real, and you see it lit up on the marquee, and it's about as real as it gets.\"",
      "Cubs manager Counsell reflected Monday night on how Sandberg still attended spring training this year despite his ailing condition.",
      "\"You know, we're saddened of the loss of a great man,\" Counsell said. \"We were lucky as a group this year to have Ryno in spring training, and it was an honor to be around a man battling for his life, but who wanted to come to the baseball park and spend his day with us.\"",
      "Major League Baseball Commissioner Robert D. Manfred Jr. issued a statement honoring Sandberg Monday night.",
      "\"Ryne Sandberg was a legend of the Chicago Cubs franchise and a beloved figure throughout Major League Baseball. \u00a0He was a five-tool player who excelled in every facet of the game thanks to his power, speed and work ethic. \u00a0Ryne earned 10 consecutive All-Star selections, nine straight Gold Gloves, seven Silver Sluggers and 1984 National League MVP honors.",
      "\"Ryne remained active in the game he loved as an ambassador for the Cubs, a manager for the Phillies and in the Minor Leagues, and a frequent participant at the Hall of Fame. \u00a0His many friends across the game were in his corner as he courageously fought cancer in recent years.\u00a0 We will continue to support the important work of Stand Up To Cancer in Ryne's memory.",
      "\"On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my deepest condolences to Ryne's family, Cubs fans everywhere and his admirers throughout our National Pastime.\"",

      "\"Let me be clear - the Netanyahu government's rejection of a two-state solution is wrong. It's wrong morally and it's wrong strategically. It harms the interest of the Israeli people, closing off the only path to a just and lasting peace, and that is why we are determined to protect the viability of a two-state solution,\" Lammy said.",

      "\"A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel \u2014 not to live in peace beside it. Let's be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,\" the Israeli leader said in a post on X.",
      "That announcement came as pressure has mounted on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza as images of starving Palestinian children have garnered widespread global attention over the past week. The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday set a 10-day deadline for Russia to reach a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine, or else it risks secondary sanctions, which would mean the Kremlin would have to make a deal with Ukraine by Friday, Aug. 8.",
      "The president, who said in Scotland on Monday that he was shortening his original 50-day deadline for Russia to make peace with Ukraine, spoke to reporters about the revised deadline Tuesday aboard Air Force One\u00a0as he returned to the U.S. Mr. Trump has been in Scotland for the last five days to negotiate trade deals with European leaders and visit his two golf resorts there.",
      "\"Ten days from today. Okay?\" he said on the plane.",
      "\"And then you know, we're going to put on tariffs and stuff, and I don't know if it's going to affect Russia, because he wants to obviously probably keep the war going,\" the president added, seemingly speaking about Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"But we're going to put on tariffs and the various things that you put on. It may or may not affect them, but it could.\"",
      "The U.S. and Ukraine have been pushing for an immediate ceasefire in order to negotiate a lasting peace deal. Earlier in July, Mr. Trump said if Russia doesn't agree to a ceasefire within a 50-day window, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that do business with Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration with Putin, questioning whether the Russian leader really wants to end the war with Ukraine. Mr. Trump has described thinking he'd had a good phone call with the Russian leader, only to find that the next day, more Ukrainians were being killed by Russia.",
      "\"I always hang up, [and] say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call,'\" Mr. Trump said earlier in July. \"And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city, and I say, 'That's strange.' And after that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything.\"",
      "It's a change from earlier this year, when Mr. Trump said he thought Putin \"wants peace.\"",

    "story": [
      "The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will lift tariffs on imports of goods from EU countries to their highest level in decades and hurt the trading bloc's economic growth, according to some experts.",
      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028.",
      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",
      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits.",
      "\"Going forward, we are going to start to see these impacts either through lower profitability for corporations and higher costs for consumers, and most likely a combination of the two,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's recent trade deals with the EU, Japan, U.K. and several other Asian countries, the U.S. still faces a self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline to reach agreements with Canada, Mexico, Korean other key trading partners.",

      "A court in the southern city of Ingolstadt convicted the defendants of gang robbery over the museum heist, German news agency dpa reported. A fourth defendant was acquitted of involvement in the museum heist but convicted of other thefts carried out by the group.",
      "The suspects from northern Germany were arrested months after a Nov. 22, 2022, break-in at the Celtic and Roman Museum in the Bavarian town of Manching, in which 483 Celtic coins discovered during a 1999 archaeological dig were stolen. The coins dated to around 100 B.C.",
      "The coins and a lump of unworked gold were originally discovered during excavations of an ancient settlement in Manching, and authorities have said they are considered the biggest trove of Celtic gold found in the 20th century.",
      "The heist took place in just nine minutes, investigators said. At 1:17 a.m., cables were cut at a telecoms hub nearby, leaving the region without communications networks. The museum's door was pried open at 1:26 a.m. The thieves left the building at 1:35 a.m., officials said, leaving them just a few minutes to smash open a display case and take the treasure. No alarms were triggered during the incident. The museum did not have an overnight guard.",
      "Most of the stolen treasure is still missing, but investigators found lumps of gold on one of the suspects when he was arrested that appear to have resulted from part of the treasure being melted down. Rupert Gebhard, the head of the Bavarian State Archaeological Collection in Munich, said in 2022 that seeing the coins melted down would be \"the worst option.\"",
      "The four defendants were accused of a total of 20 break-ins or attempted robberies in Germany and neighboring Austria, starting in 2014. Other cases involved safes or cash machines being broken into.",
      "The defendants didn't address the charges during the roughly six-month trial, but their lawyers called for their acquittal.",

    "summary": "The leading international authority on food crises predicted \"widespread death\" in Gaza without immediate action.",
    "story": [
      "The \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,\" the leading international authority on food crises said in a new alert Tuesday, predicting \"widespread death\" without immediate action.",
      "The alert, still short of a formal famine declaration, follows an outcry over images of emaciated children in Gaza and reports of dozens of hunger-related deaths after nearly 22 months of war.",
      "The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops. The United Nations and Palestinians on the ground say little has changed, and desperate crowds continue to overwhelm and unload delivery trucks before they can reach their destinations.",
      "The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said Gaza has teetered on the brink of famine for two years, but recent developments have \"dramatically worsened\" the situation, including \"increasingly stringent blockades\" by Israel.",
      "\"Mounting evidence shows that widespread starvation, malnutrition, and disease are driving a rise in hunger-related deaths. Latest data indicates that Famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of the Gaza Strip and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City,\" the IPC said. \"Immediate action must be taken to end the hostilities and allow for unimpeded, large-scale, life-saving humanitarian response. This is the only path to stopping further deaths and catastrophic human suffering.\"",
      "A formal famine declaration, which is rare, requires the kind of data that the lack of access to Gaza and mobility within it have largely denied. The IPC has only declared famine a few times \u2014 in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan's western Darfur region last year.",
      "\"Deadly turning point\" reached",
      "But independent experts say they don't need a formal declaration to know what they're seeing in Gaza.",
      "\"Just as a family physician can often diagnose a patient she's familiar with based on visible symptoms without having to send samples to the lab and wait for results, so too we can interpret Gaza's symptoms. This is famine,\" Alex de Waal, author of \"Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine\" and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, told The Associated Press.",
      "An area is classified as in famine when all three of the following conditions are confirmed:",
      "At least 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving. At least 30% of children six months to 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height. And at least two people or four children under 5 per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.",
      "The report is based on available information through July 25 and says the crisis has reached \"an alarming and deadly turning point.\" It says data indicates that famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of Gaza \u2014 at its lowest level since the war began \u2014 and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City. The report says nearly 17 out of every 100 children under the age of 5 in Gaza City are acutely malnourished.",
      "Mounting evidence shows \"widespread starvation,\" the IPC says. Essential health and other services have collapsed. One in three people in Gaza is going without food for days at a time, according to the World Food Program. Hospitals report a rapid increase in hunger-related deaths in children under 5. Gaza's population of over 2 million has been squeezed into increasingly tiny areas of the devastated territory.",
      "The IPC's latest analysis in May warned that Gaza will likely fall into famine if Israel doesn't lift its blockade and stop its military campaign. Its new alert calls for immediate and large-scale action and warns: \"Failure to act now will result in widespread death in much of the strip.\"",
      "Israel has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. In March, it cut off the entry of all goods, including fuel, food and medicine, to pressure Hamas to free hostages.",
      "Israel eased those restrictions in May but also pushed ahead with a new U.S.-backed aid delivery system that has been wracked by chaos and violence. The traditional, U.N.-led aid providers say deliveries have been hampered by Israeli military restrictions and incidents of looting, while criminals and hungry crowds swarm entering convoys.",
      "While Israel says there's no limit on how many aid trucks can enter Gaza, U.N. agencies and aid groups say even the latest humanitarian measures are not enough to counter the worsening starvation. In a statement Monday, Doctors Without Borders called the new airdrops ineffective and dangerous, saying they deliver less aid than trucks.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said no one is starving in Gaza and that Israel has supplied enough aid throughout the war, \"otherwise, there would be no Gazans.\" Israel's military on Monday criticized what it calls \"false claims of deliberate starvation in Gaza.\"",
      "Israel's closest ally now appears to disagree. \"Those children look very hungry,\" President Trump said Monday of the images from Gaza in recent days.",

      "President Trump opened a new golf course bearing his name in Scotland on Tuesday, capping a five-day foreign trip designed around promoting his family's luxury properties and playing golf, and agreeing on a major trade deal framework with the EU.",
      "\"Let's go. 1-2-3,\" Mr. Trump said before he cut the red ribbon.",
      "Mr. Trump and his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., were also set to play the first-ever round at the new Trump course in the village of Balmedie, on the northern coast of Scotland.",
      "\"This has been an unbelievable development,\" the president said before the ceremonial opening. He thanked his son Eric for his work on the project, saying it was \"truly a labor of love for him.\"",
      "The overseas jaunt enabled Mr. Trump to escape Washington's sweaty summer humidity and the still-raging scandal over the case of Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "It was mostly built around golf \u2014 and walking the new course before it officially begins offering rounds to the public on Aug. 13, adding to a lengthy list of ways the president has used the White House to promote his brand.",
      "Billing itself the \"Greatest 36 Holes in Golf,\" the Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, was designed by Eric Trump. The course is hosting a PGA Seniors Championship event later this week, after Mr. Trump leaves. Signs promoting the event had already been erected all over the course before he arrived on Tuesday and, on the highway leading in, temporary metal signs guided drivers onto the correct road.",
      "Golfers hitting the course at dawn as part of that event had to put their clubs through metal detectors erected as part of the security sweeps ahead of his arrival. Several dozen people, some dressed for golf, including wearing cleats, had filled the sand trap near the tee box to watch the ribbon-cutting ceremony shortly before it was scheduled to start. Another group of people was watching from the other side in tall grass growing on sand dunes flanking the first hole.",
      "Also from Scotland's north is the president's late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born on the Isle of Lewis, immigrated to New York and died in 2000 at age 88.",
      "\"My mother loved Scotland,\" Mr. Trump said during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday at another one of his golf courses, Turnberry, on Scotland's southern coast. \"It's different when your mother was born here.\"",
      "Mr. Trump used his trip to meet with Starmer and reach a trade framework for tariffs between the U.S. and the European Union's 27 member countries\u00a0\u2014 though scores of key details remain to be hammered out. But the trip has featured a lot of golf, and having the president visit is sure to raise the new course's profile.",
      "Mr. Trump's assets are in a trust, and his sons are running the family business while he's in the White House. Any business generated at the course will ultimately enrich the president when he leaves office though.",
      "A press release says the new course features the world's largest natural bunker, dunes and greens overlooking the sea, with a \"focus on environmental sensitivity.\"",
      "Visible from various parts of the new course were towering windmills lining the coast \u2014 some with blades that showed visible dots of rust. They are part of a nearby windfarm that Mr. Trump sued to block construction of in 2013.",
      "He lost that case and was eventually ordered to pay legal costs for bringing it \u2014 and the issue still enrages him. During the meeting with Starmer, Mr. Trump called windmills \"ugly monsters\" and suggested they were part of \"the most expensive form of energy.\"",
      "\"I restricted windmills in the United States because they also kill all your birds,\" the president said. \"If you shoot a bald eagle in the United States, they put you in jail for five years. And windmills knock out hundreds of them. They don't do anything. Explain that.\"",
      "Starmer said in the U.K., \"we believe in a mix\" of energy, including oil and gas and renewables.",
      "The new golf course is the third owned by the Trump Organization in Scotland. Mr. Trump bought Turnberry in 2014 and owns another course near Aberdeen that opened in 2012.",
      "Mr. Trump golfed at Turnberry on Saturday, as protesters took to the streets, and on Sunday. He invited Starmer, who famously doesn't golf, aboard Air Force One so the prime minister could get a private tour of his Aberdeen properties before Tuesday's ceremonial opening.",

      "Mr. Trump said Monday he is giving Russian President Vladimir Putin 10 to 12 days to stop the killing in Ukraine after three years of war, moving up a 50-day deadline he had given the Russian leader two weeks ago.

    "story": [
      "The Los Angeles wildfires and severe spring thunderstorms are just a few of the natural disasters that have contributed to more than $131 billion in global losses for the first half of 2025, according to a new report from the insurance company Munich Re.",
      "Overall losses so far in 2025 were slightly lower than the same time period in 2024, but still above long-term averages.",
      "By this time last year, overall losses were slightly higher at $155 billion, adjusted for inflation. The first half of 2024 included an earthquake in Japan on New Year's Day, coupled with severe thunderstorms in the United States that spawned more than 1,250 tornadoes.",
      "Of the $131 billion in overall losses for 2025, $80 billion was insured, which is the second-highest amount for the first half of any year since recordkeeping began in 1980. The first half of 2011 is the only year where insured losses have been higher, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami in Japan.",
      "The L.A. wildfires have been the costliest natural disaster this year and are estimated to have caused $53 billion in overall losses, with $40 billion insured.",
      "Climate change played a role in the wildfires by increasing the fire weather index conditions, making them more intense and destructive, according to scientists.",
      "\"We need to face it that the losses have been on the rise and make it clear that climate change plays an ever increasing role,\" said Tobias Grimm, chief climate scientist at Munich Re.",
      "As more people move into high-risk climate areas and weather events grow more extreme due to climate change, the damages will likely keep climbing, Grimm said.",
      "Another major global disaster in 2025 was the March 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar that killed an estimated 4,500 people and caused $12 billion in losses, very little of which was insured.",
      "Weather disasters like wildfires and storms have caused 88% of overall losses and 98% of insured losses, according to Munich Re. Earthquakes accounted for 12% of overall losses and 2% of insured losses in 2025 so far.",
      "In seven out of the last eight years, the industry has seen more than $100 billion in insured losses, Grimm said.",
      "\"Usually the second half of the year is more costly,\" he said, due to the bulk of the hurricane season starting in August and concluding in November.",
      "With hurricanes and wildfires being the costliest disasters on-record, the need to adapt and mitigate these climate impacts is necessary to address rising insurance costs, according to Grimm and other company experts.",
      "\"The best way to avoid losses is to implement effective preventive measures, such as more robust construction for buildings and infrastructure to better withstand natural disasters,\" Thomas Blunck, a member of the Board of Management of Munich Re, said in a statement. \"Such precautions can help to maintain reasonable insurance premiums, even in high-risk areas. And most importantly: to reduce future exposure, new building development should not be allowed in high-risk areas.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Monday a significant tightening of his deadline for Russia's Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine. He said as he met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during his visit to Scotland that the 50-day deadline he announced earlier this month would be reduced to less than two weeks, citing a lack of progress in negotiations.",
      "Mr. Trump said as he headed in for his meeting with Starmer that he was \"very disappointed\" in Russia's leader over the ongoing bombing of Ukrainian cities, and that the deadline he gave Russia a couple weeks ago to agree to a truce would be reduced.",
      "Mr. Trump said earlier this month that if Russia failed to agree to a ceasefire within the 50-day timeframe, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that continue to do business with Russia. That would have meant a deal agreed by around the end of August.",
      "But Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday, as he sat down with Starmer, that he was \"going to make a new deadline of about 10 or 12 days from today.\"",
      "\"There's no reason in waiting,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We just don't see any progress being made.\"",
      "\"I've spoken to President Putin a lot, I've gotten along with him very well,\" Mr. Trump said earlier, before sitting down with Starmer.",
      "But he lamented that the Russian leader, \"goes out and starts launching rockets into some city, like Kyiv, and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever, you have bodies lying all over the street.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was \"very disappointed in Putin,\" adding: \"I'm going to reduce that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number, because I think I already know the answer what's going to happen.\"",
      "Russia rejected the deadline when the White House first announced it, calling it \"unacceptable.\"",
      "\"I'm not so interested in talking anymore,\" Mr. Trump said of Putin, explaining that he and Putin will have a nice conversation, and then the following day, the Russians killed more Ukrainians.",
      "Seated alongside Starmer, Mr. Trump also addressed the situation in Gaza, saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid.",
      "\"Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved.\"",
      "While ostensibly a private trip, marked by multiple rounds of golf on his own luxury courses in Scotland, Mr. Trump has also done business \u2013 including nailing down a long-sought-after\u00a0U.S.-European Union trade agreement.",
      "After meeting for just over one hour with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday, Mr. Trump emerged to say, \"We have good news. We've reached a deal.\"",
      "When considered as a combined economy, the EU bloc is the second largest in the world behind the U.S. Including goods and services, U.S.-EU trade is worth about $2 trillion per year.",
      "\"I think it's great that we made a deal today, instead of playing games,\" Mr. Trump said of the framework trade agreement. \"I think it's the biggest deal ever made.\"",
      "\"It's a big deal, it's a huge deal,\" agreed Von der Leyen. \"It will bring stability. It will bring predictability.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with Starmer is also touching on trade, though the U.S. and the U.K. already\u00a0agreed on a framework trade deal\u00a0last month. Starmer has made it clear he wants to keep pushing Mr. Trump to further ease tariffs on British steel and other imports as the details of the agreement are hashed out.",
      "Mr. Trump said his meeting with Starmer would provide a chance to celebrate the U.S.-U.K. agreement, along with the new EU deal.",
      "Most EU member nations' governments voiced support for that agreement on Monday, though some of them unenthusiastically \u2013 and the French Prime Minister even took a jab at the bloc, accusing it of \"submission\" to Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump said the tariff rate for the EU's 27 member countries would be 15% for most imports, including vehicles. The EU, meanwhile, agreed to purchase U.S. military hardware, $750 billion of American energy, and to increase its collective investment in the U.S. by $600 billion.",
      "There was good news for U.S. companies that sell products into the EU market, too, as Mr. Trump announced that all 27 EU nations \"will be opened up to trade with the United States at zero tariff.\"",
      "The agreement was made at Mr. Trump's luxury golf resort in Turnberry, on the Scottish coast, where the president spent the weekend teeing off.",
      "The deal avoids a trans-Atlantic trade war that could have unfolded on Friday, when Mr. Trump had threatened to impose a blanket 30% tariff on all goods imported from the EU, which had vowed to retaliate.",
      "That deadline remains in place for countries that have yet to make a deal with the U.S., including Mexico, Canada, and most consequentially, China. On Monday, Mr. Trump said tariffs for countries that don't reach a deal with the U.S. will be \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range,\" which differs from the 15% to 50% range he floated last week.",
      "Trade talks between Beijing and Washington were taking place Monday in Stockholm, and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in interviews over the weekend that the Aug. 1 deadline for deals to be reached wasn't flexible.",

      "The\u00a0fighting flared last Thursday after a land mine explosion along the border wounded five Thai soldiers. Both sides blamed each other for starting the clashes that have killed at least 35 people and displaced more than 260,000 people on both sides. Both countries recalled their ambassadors and Thailand shut all border crossings with Cambodia, with an exception for migrant Cambodian workers returning home.",

Both President Trump and I remain engaged with our respective counterparts for each country and are monitoring the situation very closely. \u00a0We want this conflict to end as soon as possible.\"",
      "Before departing for Kuala Lumpur, Phumtham told reporters in Bangkok representatives of the U.S. and China would also attend the talks, as observers. He said the key focus would be on an immediate ceasefire but noted trust could be an issue as Cambodia hasn't stopped its strikes.",
      "\"We have informed that we don't have trust in Cambodia. All they have done reflect that they are not sincere in solving this problem. So they have to show the detail how they will do to prove their sincerity,\" he said.",
      "The violence marks a rare instance of open military confrontation between member states of ASEAN, a 10-nation regional bloc that has prided itself on non-aggression, peaceful dialogue and economic cooperation.",
      "In a statement Monday, ASEAN foreign ministers reiterated concern over the rising death toll, destruction of public properties and displacement of a large number of people along the disputed border areas. They urged the two countries to resolve their disputes through negotiations and expressed support for efforts to find a middle ground during Monday's talks.",
      "The conflict also drew the attention of Pope Leo XIV. At the Vatican on Sunday, the pontiff said he was praying for all those affected by war in the world, including \"for those affected by the clashes on the border between Thailand and Cambodia, especially the children and displaced families.\"",
      "At an evacuation shelter in Cambodia's Siem Reap province far away from the border, Ron Mao, 56, prays for a ceasefire deal during the leaders' meeting Monday.

They took refuge in a shelter but moved again to another camp farther away after hearing artillery shelling.",
      "\"I don't want to see this war happen. It's very difficult and I don't want to run around like this,\" she said. \"When I heard our prime minister go to negotiate for peace, I would be very happy if they reached the deal as soon as possible, so that I and my children can return home as soon as possible.\"",
      "The 500-mile frontier between Thailand and Cambodia has been disputed for decades but past confrontations have been limited and brief.

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to French Foreign Minister Jean\u2011No\u00ebl\u202fBarrot, who joins us this morning from Paris. Welcome to \"Face The Nation.\" I want to begin on what is happening in Gaza with those horrific images that we are seeing of starvation overnight, Israel has begun air drops. We know Jordan, other states are looking to organize more aid. Are you exploring any further avenues to bring aid into Gaza?",
      "FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN-NO\u00cbL BARROT: What's happening in Gaza right now is appalling. Gaza is- is- is now in the brink of a full catastrophe, and we've been working out, over the months, to try and relief the sufferings of the Palestinian people. We actually have 52 tons of humanitarian help stuck in El-Arish in Egypt, a few kilometers away from Gaza. So we're exploring all options to seize the opportunity offered by the Israeli government by opening the skies of Gaza, but we call for immediate, unhindered, and massive access by all means of humanitarian help to those who need it most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Has Israel responded to your calls?",
      "BARROT: We have, with the European Union, started tough discussions with the Israeli government, who have made first commitments that have not been fulfilled yet. In the next few days, the European Commission will make clear what our expectations are. We expect the Israeli government to stop the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that has caused bloodbath in humanitarian help distribution lines in Gaza. We expect them to pay the 2 billion euros they owe to the Palestinian Authority and to lift the financial blockage that is now preventing the Palestinian Authority to implement its most basic missions. We also expect the Israeli government to bring to a stop its latest settlement projects, the E1 projects with 3,400 housing units that might split the West Bank in two pieces and prevent the emergence of a political, a two state solution. But what we call for is, of course, the immediate cease-fire, the liberation of whole hostages of Hamas, that needs to be disarmed. And the entry, the massive entry, of humanitarian help in Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are headed to New York, to the United Nations, to help lead a summit to talk about a two state solution. Your president announced France will formally recognize the state of Palestine at the UN in September. More than 100 countries recognize Palestine, but France is the first western UN Security Council member to do so, and the United States opposes what you are saying. Secretary of State Rubio called it \"reckless.\" He says it serves Hamas propaganda, sets back peace, and considers it \"a slap in the face to the victims of October 7.\" In your government's view, why is he wrong?",
      "BARROT: So the reason why President Macron made this decision is that it was absolutely necessary to restart a political process, the two state solution process that was- that is today threatened, more threatened that it- it has ever been. And the conference that will take place in New York tomorrow and Tuesday is a very significant milestone, because by- by- by recognizing, or announcing the recognition of Palestine, France has been able, alongside Saudi Arabia, that has- that will be co chairing this conference with us, to collect very significant historic commitments by all stakeholders, including the Palestinian Authority president and Arab countries, in favor of the two state solution, and guarantee security guarantees for Israel. The two state solution is very simple, and I think everyone can understand what we mean by that. The only way to bring peace and stability back in this region is to have two state, the state of Israel and the state of Palestine, living side by side in peace and in security. This perspective is now threatened, and it's why the- the dynamic that we have initiated was so important, and this is why the conference that will take place in New York is such an important milestone. All these efforts are very, very complementary to the efforts that the U.S. have done in the region since the first term of President Trump. We share the short-term objective: immediate cease-fire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas that needs to be disarmed. We share the long term objective: peace and stability in the region. And what we're doing, by bringing the Palestinian Authority leader to recognize seventh of October as a terrorist attack, by calling the Hamas- the disarm- for the disarmament of Hamas and the liberation of hostages, by committing to deep reform of the Palestinian Authority, and by committing to elections within one year, by bringing the Arab countries for the first time to condemn Hamas and call for its disarmament, we are creating, or recreating, the conditions for this political solution that, again, is the only path forward, and we are paving the way. We're paving the way for the future Abraham Accords that the U.S. administration might lead. So I see our effort as very complementary to the U.S. administration's effort, rather than substitutes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, the president of the United States dismissed what President Macron said, the U.S. Ambassador mocked it. Do you believe that your plans can succeed without U.S. support?",
      "BARROT: Again, our efforts are very complementary . We share the short term objective, cease-fire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas, and the long term objective, peace and stability in the region. In fact, we will welcome any further efforts led by the U.S. to implement the Abraham Accord logics. And what we're doing now with this very significant conference that will take place in New York will pave the way for such accords. But in the meantime, until the U.S. administration provides, through the Abraham Accord logics, a political horizon for this crisis, we need to act in order to facilitate the- or create an off ramp for the catastrophe ongoing in Gaza. Now the terms, we will welcome and support future Abraham Accords, but in the meantime, inaction is not an option.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you briefly about an incident that has gained a lot of attention this past week involving some young French citizens who were removed from a flight from Spain. The airline claims they were kicked off for being disruptive. The Israeli government came out though and said the French students were removed because they're Jewish. Have you determined whether this was indeed an act of antisemitism?",
      "BARROT: I have called the CEO of this company, who has- to express our- our serious preoccupation. She has confirmed that an internal investigation is ongoing. My team has been reaching out to the ambassador of Spain in- in France, and we've made the same request. We'll keep following this situation as it unravels",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So too- too early to say, despite what the Israeli government is indicating.",
      "BARROT: I cannot comment on that at this point. We've taken action as- as soon as we got, you know, as we got notice of what was happening, we offered support on location through our embassy to this group. We then reached out to the- the airline company, to the Spanish authorities, and we're now following the results of these investigations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: France has been very active diplomatically on a number of fronts. It was just five weeks ago when the United States and Israel bombed Iran. Since that time, France has talked to the Iranian government, along with other European powers, about what remains of Iran's nuclear program. How concerned are you that after these bombings, Iran may now covertly attempt to make a weapon, and the world won't know?",
      "BARROT: This is still a risk that we are facing, and alongside Germany and the UK, we have been very clear, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, and we've been, over the past few months, reaching out to the Iranian authority in close coordination with U.S. authorities in order to express what our expectations are. Ten years ago, we reached a deal on the nuclear program that allowed for a significant rollback of Iranian nuclear capacity. Of course, things has changed. Still then, and since then, Iran has violated all commitments it had taken at the time of signing this agreement. We now want a more comprehensive agreement that would encompass both the nuclear dimension of Iranian destabilization activities, but also it's the ballistic component, as well as the regional destabilization activities that Iran has been conducting, unless we- unless a new and robust and durable and verifiable agreement is reached by the end of the summer, France, Germany and the UK will have no other choice but to reapply the global embargoes that were lifted 10 years ago when the nuclear agreement with Iran was signed, embargoes on weapons, on nuclear equipment, and on banking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So France is ready to snap back sanctions on Iran as soon as August. Are you asking Iran to speak directly to the United States in order to avoid that fate?",
      "BARROT: We've been speaking with Special Envoy Witkoff, Secretary Rubio, on a weekly basis on this topic that is highly important for the U.S., as for Europeans. We- we have supported U.S.-led efforts to enter into discussions with Iran. We have pressed Iran, after the 12 day war, to go back to a discussion with the U.S., and we'll keep pressing them to do so, because indeed, if there is no solid agreement that can be found by the end of August, we will have no other option but to snap back, meaning to reapply those global embargoes, and we are ready to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, thank you very much for your time this morning."

Additionally, the substance is widely available and may be appealing to children and teens as it is sold in fruit-flavored gummies and even ice cream cones. The FDA is also warning that 7-OH products \"may not be clearly or accurately labeled as to their 7-OH content and are sometimes disguised or marketed as kratom.\"",
      "\"I am in favor of this move because of the relationship of the 7-OH to the opioid receptors. This is essentially an opioid.

      "Testing, treatment and prevention",
      "A blood test can help diagnose Lyme disease, but timing matters.",

      "But, according to an email sent to faculty and staff last week, from Belmont's Office of the President, the school has decided to tap an \"external partner\" to ensure its compliance with President Donald Trump's executive orders demanding diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives be terminated across all institutions of higher education. The review also aims to ensure the university is abiding by all state and federal immigration laws, after evidence was also uncovered that the school was allegedly admitting illegal immigrants and hiding such information from outside entities.",
      "\"I am reaching out to update you about next steps in response to the concerns raised by elected officials regarding Belmont's compliance with state and federal immigration laws, as well as executive orders addressing DEI in higher education,\" the letter, penned by Belmont University President Greg Jones, stated. \"While we make every effort to ensure compliance and continue to maintain our belief that Belmont complies with all applicable laws, we take these concerns seriously. With this in mind, we are bringing in an external partner to initiate an independent compliance review.\"",

      "The effort to hold Belmont accountable for allegedly maintaining its DEI policies in light of federal directives to terminate them has been spearheaded by Tennessee Republican Rep. Andy Ogles, who has been receiving information from whistle-blowers at the school.",
      "Ogles sounded the alarm earlier this month, after obtaining undercover recordings showing a student services faculty member in Belmont's \"Division of Student Success and Flourishing\" admitting the school has maintained its DEI initiatives but \"just change[d] on how we talk about it.\"",
      "\"The HUB is hope, unity and belonging. That's DEI. Let's be real,\" Jozef Lukey, Belmont's assistant director of student success and flourishing, says in the recording. \"We always try to just adapt to what's happening around us. But that doesn't mean, like, what we're focusing on completely stops. We just changed the terminology and the language that we keep moving forward.\"",
      "In the same recording, Lukey can also be heard admitting that Belmont enrolls illegal immigrants and hides that information from external entities, which Ogles suggested could violate state law against knowingly harboring illegal aliens for profit.",

      "Ogles also likened Belmont to Harvard in the video, adding that the school will be \"held accountable if they don't correct course.\"",

      "Besides the undercover recordings, Ogles has received other whistle-blower documents and information about Belmont's continuance of its DEI initiatives under Trump. For example, Ogles has cited official documents from Belmont he received, which show that professors must fill out a mandatory form if they wish to revise or propose a new course, which requires a \"Diversity Impact Statement\" outlining how the course supports \"historically underrepresented populations.\"",
      "Another source, according to Ogles' office, shared screenshots of an email chain showing Belmont intends to keep its faculty DEI committee for the next academic year. Ogles also received a document outlining Belmont's faculty hiring procedures for deans, which compels the completion of multiple DEI \"assessment[s]\" when engaging in \"pre-search activities.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The hiring document adds that search committees tasked with seeking out new potential hires must be \"diverse across race and gender and preferably include faculty of color.\"",
      "A litany of other DEI requirements, such as required discussions among search committees about \"ways to advertise and attract candidates from a diverse population\" and \"paying special attention to recruiting minority candidates,\" are required as well. The document also instructs search committees to engage in a post-mortem for any positions for which a \"diverse candidate\" does not apply to \"revisit how to best advertise the position to attract qualified, diverse applicants.\"",
      "Earlier this year, President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring the end of DEI policies in higher education, calling them discriminatory. (Getty Images)",
      "The amount of whistle-blower tips that Ogles office has been getting has prompted the congressman to launch a new web page on his congressional website that will provide an easy avenue for people to continue providing his office with inside information about the DEI efforts at Belmont. The website has not launched yet, but is expected to be live soon.",
      "When reached for comment, officials at Belmont pointed Fox News Digital to its July 22 email sent to faculty and staff, indicating the expected compliance review."

      "The latest Fox News survey, released Monday, finds 3 in 10 back deporting all illegal immigrants, while 6 in 10 supports only deporting those charged with crimes but would allow others to stay and apply for citizenship. One in 10 favors letting all illegal immigrants remain in the U.S.",

But electrifying it? That's where things get tricky.",
      "Electric semis are pricey. They're also heavy, have limited range, and take too long to charge. Trucking companies, many of them small operators, run on razor-thin margins and can't afford long downtimes. Public fast-charging for trucks barely exists. And without more demand, investors aren't building new stations. That's the bottleneck.",
      "Revoy's solution flips the equation. Instead of replacing the truck, they simply electrify the space between the cab and trailer.",

      "A big rig using a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a battery pack. (Revoy)",
      "How an electric dolly converts diesel trucks instantly",
      "Imagine your standard diesel rig pulling onto the highway. Nothing looks unusual until you notice something new sandwiched between the truck and trailer. Revoy's innovation is a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a massive battery pack.",
      "The dolly carries a 575-kilowatt-hour battery, putting it in the same class as fully electric semis. But here's the clever part: it doesn't just trail along. It pushes the truck forward using its own powered axle, giving the diesel engine a break and saving fuel. All of this happens without modifying the truck or trailer.",
      "It connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch using a smart kingpin. It also plugs into the existing air and electrical lines between the cab and trailer. No hardwiring. No overhaul. Revoy designed it for fast installation, just minutes, no tools required.",
      "Illustration of how the Revoy dolly connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch. (Revoy)",
      "Electric truck conversion adds smart driving features",
      "This isn't just about range. Revoy's dolly also turns any diesel rig into a smarter, safer machine. Using embedded sensors and cameras, the dolly monitors blind spots and feeds real-time data to a driver's smartphone app. It enhances lane stability, helps correct steering in crosswinds, and delivers regenerative braking that recharges the battery. It also enables automated reversing, especially useful for tight yards and docks.",
      "The best part? Drivers don't need to learn anything new. There's no extra dashboard. The truck drives as it always has, just with extra power, extra control, and extra safety.",
      "EV battery swapping makes truck charging fast and easy",
      "Charging has always been a weak point in electric freight. Even the fastest chargers take 30 minutes or more to top off a truck battery. Revoy dodges that altogether. Instead of plugging in, truckers pull into a Revoy swap station and exchange their depleted dolly for a freshly charged one. The process takes about five minutes, which is faster than refueling a diesel tank.",
      "The first swap stations are already live in Texas and Arkansas, with more coming soon. As the network grows, so does the vision of truly hybrid diesel-electric freight. And if the route doesn't include a Revoy station? No problem. The truck simply runs on diesel alone and drops off the dolly at the last location passed.",
      "Illustration of a Revoy swap station. (Revoy)",
      "Electric conversion for trucks without upfront costs",
      "Worried about capital expense? Revoy's business model removes the barrier entirely. Truckers and fleet operators don't purchase the dolly; they lease it per mile. That means zero capital investment and no maintenance headaches.",
      "The system is designed to pay for itself. Revoy estimates savings of over $5,000 per truck annually, mostly through reduced fuel consumption. In some cases, fleets have reported 3 to 5 times better fuel efficiency.",
      "And weight isn't an issue for most operators. While the dolly adds mass, most truckloads fill trailers by volume, not weight. Revoy says over 60% of loads qualify, making this a practical fit for the majority of long-haul routes.",
      "Can this electric truck add-on work worldwide?",
      "Revoy built its dolly system for U.S.-style single-trailer rigs, but the idea could scale globally. Countries like Australia, with vast, sun-drenched highways, could easily support dolly-swap stations powered by solar energy. Imagine swapping a charged dolly in the Outback instead of waiting an hour for a charger.",
      "Canada and other countries with twin-trailer B-Doubles would require a modified version, but the core concept remains powerful: electrify trucks without replacing them. The technology is modular. The logistics are scalable. The potential is massive.",
      "A big rig on the road using a high-tech electric dolly. (Revoy)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Electric trucks\u00a0are still years away from becoming mainstream. But this electric add-on is already solving the biggest problems today. It's fast. It's smart. It works with the trucks that are already on the road. Instead of overhauling the entire trucking industry, this system works with what exists right now. You don't need a brand-new truck. You just need a smarter way to power it.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "With ChatGPT agent, we're moving from AI chatbots that merely react to those that are proactive and decision-makers. As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, their capabilities will continue to expand.

      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why dogs see TV differently than we do",
      "In the past, older TVs didn't do much for dogs. Their lower refresh rates caused flickering that was hard for canine eyes to process. Dogs see flicker more sensitively than humans do. So while you were watching your favorite sitcom, your dog was probably just seeing a strobe light. Today's high-definition, high-frame-rate TVs are a different story. The improved visuals and sound mean dogs can now recognize what's happening onscreen and respond to it.",
      "What the study found about how dogs respond to different kinds of tv content",
      "Researchers developed something called the Dog Television Viewing Scale (DTVS). It's a 16-question tool that helps measure how dogs respond to different kinds of TV content, like barking, tail-wagging, or even following something off-screen. They surveyed over 650 dog owners. More than 450 respondents reported that their dogs actually watch TV. From there, three main behavior patterns emerged:",
      "Dogs responded most strongly to other animals, especially dogs and wildlife.",
      "Some dogs physically tracked an object as it moved off the screen. This suggests they think the image might exist beyond the TV, like in real life.",
      "Dogs also reacted to people and inanimate objects, such as cars or doorbells.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Personality plays a big role in how dogs react to TV",
      "The researchers found that personality, not breed or age, influenced how dogs reacted. Excitable dogs were more likely to exhibit \"follow\" behavior, actively watching and expecting movement off-screen. Fearful or reactive dogs were more sensitive to non-animal stimuli, like human voices or doorbells. Interestingly, dogs' sex, breed, or even whether they were neutered didn't seem to affect their TV habits. Exposure to TV also wasn't a strong factor, meaning dogs aren't necessarily \"trained\" to watch.",
      "What this means for dog owners",
      "If you leave the TV on for your dog while you're out, you're not alone, and it might even help them feel more at ease. But not all dogs benefit the same way. The content matters. Animal-heavy programming could excite or soothe a curious pup. But shows with loud sounds or human conflict could stress out a fearful dog. Some streaming services, like DOGTV, are now designing content tailored for dogs. This research gives that idea more scientific credibility.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can TV help shelter dogs?",
      "The findings suggest a new tool for improving dog welfare, especially in shelters. Tailored TV programming could help reduce stress and provide mental enrichment for dogs waiting to be adopted. Still, more research is needed. Most of the data came from owners whose dogs already engage with TV. Behavior reports were based on what owners observed, rather than direct measurement.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "TV might not just be background noise for your dog. For some, it could be entertainment. For others, it might even be stress relief or stimulation. And thanks to modern screen tech, they're seeing it clearer than ever before. So next time you catch your dog watching with you, take a moment. They may really be following the action.",

      "In Greek mythology, the Sirens were creatures whose irresistible song lured sailors to their doom. Odysseus, the hero of\u00a0\"The Odyssey,\" wanted to hear that famous song. But he knew it was dangerous. So, he had his men tie him to the mast and block their ears with beeswax. Then, they sailed toward the Island of the Sirens. Why? Because Odysseus understood that once he heard their song, he wouldn't be able to resist. And that song always leads to trouble.",

      "How scammers trick your parents even when they know better",
      "What does this have to do with protecting your parents from scammers? None of us is invulnerable, not even a hero like Odysseus. The trick is knowing what you can't resist and, one way or another, avoiding it. You can teach your parents all there is to know about modern-day fraud and the dangers of sharing personal information, but there's still this Siren song out there that will have them throwing all that knowledge out the window in a heartbeat.",
      "What this Siren song is varies from person to person and day to day. It might be a near-perfect clone of a grandchild's voice, calling in a panic and asking for an urgent transfer to bail them out of trouble, if not jail. Alternatively, a financial adviser could be deftly playing on your parents' anxieties around money since retiring. Another common scam involves a suspiciously foreign-sounding Microsoft customer-support worker calling to inform your parents that the computer they don't have or never use has been infected with a virus.",
      "Emotional triggers are the scammer's best tool",
      "The point is that all of us, no matter how well-informed, careful, or clever, can be exploited by a fast-talking scammer. All it takes is the right hook at exactly the wrong moment, and we're along for the ride. All the more so as we get older and technology advances rapidly, leaving us behind. Scammers rely on emotional reactions as much as, if not more than, ignorance. Letting your parents know about the dangers of engaging with strangers (even if they claim to be from Visa or\u00a0the IRS) is crucial, but it's not enough. Scammers exploit fear, greed, and the desire to please others or simply be a good citizen. They're experts at raising the emotional toll of interrupting, interrogating, or ignoring them. In short, getting drawn into discussions with scammers is playing with fire.",
      "(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "The best solution: Cut off scammers at the source",
      "So, what's the solution? Stop the scammers from making contact in the first place. They're getting your parents' contact information and much more personal data besides, from somewhere. Stop them from getting their hands on it, and they won't have the chance to manipulate your parents into doing something they'll regret.",
      "People-search sites are a great source of information for scammers. Fast, easy, and inexpensive, they fuel smaller operations and individual scammers. People-search sites are a kind of data broker; the other major kind, sometimes called private-database data brokers, are even worse. These data brokers sell personal data in bulk to other businesses.",
      "They've been caught selling the personal data of vulnerable adults before, offering data packs that focused on people who needed in-home care or were suffering from cognitive impairment or decline, for example. This is worse than posting your parents' details publicly. This is packaging up those details and marketing them directly to scammers.",
      "An elderly parent and his daughter \u00a0looking at a laptop screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "Use a data removal service to protect your parents",
      "The good news is that a\u00a0data removal service can scrub both people-search sites and the databases of those other, more shadowy data brokers clean of your parents' information. Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, property values, health information, shopping habits, political preferences, and more. You can take all this down in one fell swoop with a personal data removal service.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you and your parents.",

      "Instead of shutting down to recharge, the Walker S2 walks to a nearby swap station. When one battery starts to run low, the robot turns its torso, uses built-in tools on its arms and removes the drained battery. It then picks up a fresh one, plugs it in and gets back to work immediately. The entire process takes about three minutes. This system is similar to battery-swapping tech used in electric vehicles.

      "An aircraft is redefining air travel by eliminating traditional windows.",
      "Delta Air Lines, one of the country's largest carriers, is making headlines for its ambitious rollout of artificial intelligence-powered ticket pricing. Instead of fixed fares, Delta is using AI.",
      "The airline emphasizes that the system doesn't use personal data like your habits or booking history. Rather, it relies on aggregated market trends and analyst oversight to determine fares.",
      "By the end of this year, Delta aims to set 20% of ticket prices dynamically using AI, a sevenfold increase from just a year ago. This high-tech approach could result in better deals or higher costs, not because of who you are, but because of market demand at the time you book. Let's take a look at how it works, why Delta's betting on it and what it means for your wallet.",

      "FOX NEWS AI NEWSLETTER: WARNING ON ELECTRICITY PRICES",
      "Passengers traveling through an airport\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is AI-powered ticket pricing?",
      "Traditional ticket pricing relies on fare \"buckets,\" where customers are grouped into categories based on when and how they book their tickets. Delta's AI-powered system replaces static pricing with a dynamic model that evaluates real-time market data, like demand surges or route-specific trends, to recommend pricing tiers.",
      "Delta President Glen Hauenstein describes this as a reengineering of pricing, calling AI a\u00a0\"super analyst\" that works 24/7, seeking the optimal price for every traveler, every time. The airline has partnered with Fetcherr, which provides the underlying technology and also supports other global airlines.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why Delta wants smarter, not personalized pricing",
      "Let's be honest. Airlines aren't adopting new, high-tech pricing systems to make less money. Delta says early results from AI-driven pricing show\u00a0\"amazingly favorable\" revenues.",
      "However, the airline states it is not personalizing prices based on individual behavior. Instead, the AI analyzes large-scale patterns, like route demand, seasonal shifts, and timing trends, before analysts set final prices.",
      "Delta's strategy is simple \u2014 a price that's available on that flight, at that time, to you, the individual.",
      "Passengers traveling through an airport (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does this affect travelers?",
      "If you've ever wondered why airfare fluctuates every time you check, get ready for even more volatility. Delta's system could theoretically offer you a different price than someone else for the exact same seat, calculated in real time by AI.",
      "Pros: You might get special offers or early discounts if the AI needs to fill seats.",
      "Cons: It becomes much harder to know if you're getting a \"fair\" deal because the price shown is purely based on what AI thinks you'll pay, not what everyone else pays.",
      "Some privacy advocates worry this could disadvantage customers who lack the means or time to search for the best deals, potentially charging the highest prices to those unable to shop around.",
      "We reached out to Delta for a comment, and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with this statement:",
      "\"There is no fare product Delta has ever used, is testing or plans to use that targets customers with individualized offers based on personal information or otherwise. A variety of market forces drive the dynamic pricing model that\u2019s been used in the global industry for decades, with new tech simply streamlining this process. Delta always complies with regulations around pricing and disclosures.\"",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Industry impact and growing criticism over AI ticket pricing",
      "Delta's transparency regarding this shift has drawn national attention. Other airlines are already testing their own AI fare systems, and experts expect the industry to follow suit. Yet, privacy advocates and some lawmakers are voicing strong concerns. Critics argue that letting AI determine pricing behind the scenes is, in the words of Consumer Watchdog, like airlines\u00a0\"hacking our brains\" to find the maximum price we'll accept.",
      "The legal risks are still emerging. While price variation based on demand or timing is not new, using AI for ultra-personalized pricing raises uncomfortable questions about discrimination and fairness, especially since prior research suggests that poorer customers often receive the worst deals.",
      "Passengers sitting on a plane\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Delta says it does not tailor prices based on your digital footprint. You won't be charged more because you searched twice or booked from a certain device. Instead, prices respond to broader factors like how many seats are left, the time of day, and demand on that route.",
      "That said, airfares will likely feel even more unpredictable. Shopping around is now a must. Quick decisions might save you money, but waiting could result in a price increase.",
      "A VPN may still help you hide your location, but Delta states that its pricing does not vary by personal data like IP or browser history. Still, comparing prices across platforms and booking early remain smart moves.",
      "Privacy matters more than ever, not because Delta is watching you, but because digital tools are transforming how industries think about pricing. In short, you still have power as a consumer. Be smart, be flexible, and always compare before making a purchase.",

      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier examines the U.S. power supply on 'Special Report.'",
      "If your electricity bill seems shockingly high, you're not imagining it. A big part of the spike is being driven by rising artificial intelligence electricity demand.",
      "PJM Interconnection, the largest power grid operator in the United States, says electricity usage is climbing sharply this summer. Some areas may see bills increase by as much as 20%. One of the main drivers behind this trend is the growing power consumption from data centers that support AI systems like ChatGPT and other generative tools.",

      "PJM supplies electricity to 67 million customers across 13 states: Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. It manages a vast and complex network of power distribution. This summer, the grid is showing signs of strain.",
      "In just the past year, data centers running AI have started using much more electricity. These centers can consume up to 30 times more power than traditional data centers. Most of them are connected to the same grid that serves homes and businesses, which means the cost of that power growth is shared by everyone.",

      "AI and data centers are fueling a surge in energy use",
      "AI took off in 2023 when tools like ChatGPT became widely adopted. Since then, companies have been racing to build more infrastructure to keep up. PJM's territory now has the largest number of data centers in the world.",
      "Between 2024 and 2025, electricity demand from AI and data centers in the PJM region contributed to a $9 billion increase in power costs. PJM expects peak usage this summer to reach over 154,000 megawatts, with the potential to exceed all-time records during heat waves or emergencies.",
      "AI data center needing high energy demands\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why electricity prices are rising across the U.S.",
      "While demand is rising quickly, the power supply is not keeping up with the pace. Many fossil fuel plants are shutting down due to state regulations, aging infrastructure or market conditions. More than 9,000 megawatts of coal capacity will retire or convert to gas in 2025 alone.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Clean energy options like wind and solar are often the cheapest ways to add new power, but developers are struggling with permitting delays, rising costs and a loss of federal incentives. For example, the 30% federal solar tax credit for homeowners will end after 2025. That change is already slowing down new installations.",

      "How AI is increasing your electric bill",
      "Even if you never use AI tools yourself, you are still likely paying for their growth. The cost of expanding the data center's power supply is spread across all grid users, including regular households.",
      "PJM customers have been warned to expect electric bills to increase by $25 or more per month. Commercial users may see prices climb nearly 30%.",
      "To help prevent rolling blackouts, PJM is rolling out demand response programs that pay large businesses to temporarily reduce their electricity use during periods of extreme demand. Still, if electricity usage exceeds 166,000 megawatts, some regions may not have enough reserve power to maintain reliability.",

      "3. Report phishing emails: Use Outlook\u2019s built-in tools to report suspicious messages as phishing. You can also forward them to Microsoft at reportphishing@microsoft.com.",
      "4. Use strong antivirus software: Consider using strong antivirus software with built-in phishing and link protection to catch threats before they reach you. Stay vigilant when it comes to emails, phone calls, or messages from unknown sources asking for personal information. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing sensitive details unless you can verify the legitimacy of the request. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "5. Never share sensitive info: Microsoft will never ask for your password, 2FA code, or payment details via email. If you\u2019re unsure, log in directly from a browser to check.",
      "6. Consider personal data removal services: After phishing attempts, your data may end up circulating among data brokers, increasing your risk of future scams and identity theft. Data removal services can help reduce the visibility of your personal information by submitting removal requests to dozens of people-search and broker sites. This limits how easily scammers and spammers can find and target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Fake Microsoft alerts are carefully crafted to appear genuine, which is why it\u2019s crucial to remain cautious. Always verify messages through official channels, avoid clicking suspicious links, and report anything that doesn\u2019t seem right. A few extra seconds of caution can help protect your account and your personal data.",

      "DreamDrive Pro combines advanced hardware and intelligent software to power Lucid's driver-assistance system. It uses 32 integrated sensors, including LiDAR, radar, visible-light and surround-view cameras and ultrasonic sensors. This setup delivers precise environmental awareness for everything from highway cruising to close-range maneuvers.",

      "These updates are just the beginning. Lucid is investing heavily in advanced driver-assistance and automation, with a clear focus on safety, comfort and long-term innovation.",
      "Lucid now joins the ranks of top hands-free driving systems. Tesla's Full Self-Driving and GM's Super Cruise both offer hands-free driving on highways, though they differ in how they monitor driver attention and what roads they support. Ford's BlueCruise is another major option, available on a growing number of mapped highways. Mercedes-Benz Drive Pilot goes a step further by letting drivers take their eyes off the road in certain traffic conditions, though it's only available in limited markets for now.",

      "What this means for you",
      "If you're driving a car with advanced driver-assistance features, such as the Lucid Air or similar models, you're likely noticing real changes in your daily routine. With hands-off driving now available on select highways, those stressful commutes can feel a little easier. Sitting in stop-and-go traffic doesn't have to be such a chore anymore. Long road trips? Suddenly, they're much more comfortable. Many automakers, not just Lucid, are pushing out updates directly to your car, so you can access new tools without ever stepping into a service center.",
      "Safety is at the forefront with these new systems. As you drive, a network of sensors and smart software helps keep your lane changes smooth, your following distances steady and your ride free from abrupt surprises. These advances can give you peace of mind, but it's essential to remember that these systems don't drive for you. You still need to stay alert and keep your hands ready.",
      "With more cars using similar technology each year, the roads themselves are changing. There's hope that fewer accidents caused by distraction or delayed reactions will benefit not just tech-savvy drivers, but everyone out there. While these models, like the Lucid Air, showcase what's possible, the real transformation comes as driver-assistance features become the new normal in cars everywhere.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Lucid's new hands-free driving update puts it in direct competition with Tesla, GM, and other automakers working to change the way we drive. With DreamDrive Pro, Lucid shows that combining advanced hardware, in-house software, and frequent updates can deliver real capability. As more companies roll out similar systems, drivers are getting more options, and the convenience once reserved for luxury models is becoming more accessible.",

      "Choosing the right VPN",
      "Not every VPN offers the same level of security or privacy. Free VPNs might log your activity or sell your data. For true privacy, look for a VPN that does not keep logs, uses strong encryption, and offers high-speed servers. The VPN should support multiple devices under one account, and ideally, the company should be based in a country with strong privacy laws.",

      "Your home Wi-Fi may seem secure, but appearances can be deceiving. Weak router settings, tracking by ISPs and smart devices with poor security all put your personal information at risk. Antivirus software and firewalls cannot fix all of these problems. A VPN offers a powerful layer of protection by encrypting your traffic, hiding your activity, and making your connection truly private. But remember, true digital security comes from layers, VPNs, antivirus, strong passwords, updated firmware and secure DNS, all play a role.",

      "You might think heart disease comes with warning signs. But some of the deadliest types, like structural heart disease (SHD), creep in silently. No chest pain. No shortness of breath. Nothing until it's too late.",
      "Now, a new artificial intelligence tool called EchoNext is changing the game. It can flag hidden heart problems that even trained cardiologists miss just by analyzing a standard ECG. That's right. A routine, five-minute heart test you've probably already had could now unlock life-saving information if AI is watching.",

      "A stethoscope and an electrocardiogram image\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is structural heart disease, and why is it so dangerous?",
      "SHD refers to defects in the heart's walls, valves or chambers. Some are present at birth. Others develop slowly over time. Either way, they often go unnoticed until something major happens, like a heart attack or stroke. That's why experts sometimes call SHD the \"hidden\" heart disease. Here's the problem. Even the ECGs doctors routinely use to spot heart issues often can't detect SHD on their own. And that's where EchoNext comes in.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "EchoNext: The AI that knows when to dig deeper",
      "EchoNext was created by researchers at Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian. The tool was trained on over 1.2 million ECG and echocardiogram pairs from more than 230,000 patients. Its job? Figure out when a patient's ECG suggests a deeper look is needed, specifically, an echocardiogram, the ultrasound that gives a detailed view of heart structure.",

      "EchoNext outperformed human cardiologists",
      "In tests, EchoNext correctly flagged 77% of structural heart disease cases from ECGs. Cardiologists? Just 64%. Even more impressive, when tested on nearly 85,000 people, EchoNext identified over 7,500 at high risk for undiagnosed SHD. A year later, researchers found that 73% of those who followed up with echocardiograms were indeed diagnosed with SHD, a rate far above average. These groundbreaking results were published in Nature, one of the world's most respected scientific journals. That's not just a better test. That's a potential lifesaver.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why this matters now more than ever",
      "Millions walk around every day with SHD and have no idea. They skip heart screenings because nothing feels wrong. Even when they do get an ECG, subtle warning signs can slip by unnoticed. EchoNext doesn't miss them. And it doesn't get tired or distracted. This isn't about replacing doctors. Iit's about giving them a powerful new tool to catch what humans alone can't.",
      "A stethoscope and mask with red foiled chocolate hearts and a person holding a heart\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "You don't need to wait for symptoms to take your heart health seriously. If you've ever had an ECG, or you're getting one soon, AI could now help spot hidden risks your doctor might miss. Tools like EchoNext make it easier to catch heart problems early, even if you feel fine.",
      "This means fewer surprises, fewer missed diagnoses and a better shot at treatment before it's too late. It's not about replacing doctors. It's about giving them, and you, a better shot at catching problems early. Ask your doctor if AI tools are being used to review your heart tests. You deserve every advantage.

      "The 126 MW Omkareshwar Floating Solar Park spans 642 acres, boosting green power. Kurt Knutsson reports on this innovative solution to global energy challenges.",
      "The world's first hybrid solar cargo ship has just launched in Germany, marking a major milestone for sustainable shipping. The Blue Marlin uses advanced solar technology not only to power its onboard systems but also to drive its main propulsion, setting a new standard for eco-friendly cargo transport. By combining solar panels with a diesel-electric system, this vessel is paving the way for cleaner, more efficient movement of goods along Germany's waterways.",

      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "How solar power moves the Blue Marlin",
      "The Blue Marlin uses 192 solar panels, which can generate up to 35 kilowatts in ideal conditions. That\u2019s enough to charge over 1,400 smartphones at the same time. Wattlab designed the solar system to supply electricity directly to the ship\u2019s propulsion system. Unlike earlier vessels, the Blue Marlin uses solar energy for movement, not just for basic onboard functions. When conditions allow, the ship can run on solar power alone for short trips. For example, it can do this when traveling downstream with a light load.",
      "Hybrid technology for reliable shipping",
      "The Blue Marlin also relies on four diesel generators. This hybrid setup lets the vessel switch between solar and diesel-electric power as needed. As a result, the ship stays reliable in any weather. An automated energy management system controls how power is distributed. This system sends energy exactly where it is needed. It also reduces unnecessary fuel use, which helps the environment. In addition, the ship uses a technique called peak shaving. During high energy demand, it draws on solar and battery reserves instead of starting extra generators. This strategy lowers emissions and keeps the operation smooth.",
      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "The Blue Martin is well suited for Germany\u2019s waterways",
      "The Blue Marlin measures approximately 282 feet in length and 31 feet in width, with a shallow draft of just 3 feet 7 inches, making it well suited for Germany's canal network. Its hull was constructed in Romania and later outfitted with systems in the Netherlands. Today, the fully completed vessel operates out of Cologne, Germany. SEAFAR remote navigation technology is another feature; this system allows remote-controlled operation on select routes, improving safety and reducing the workload for the crew.",
      "The Blue Marlin\u2019s environmental impact and design benefits",
      "Each year, the Blue Marlin's solar array can generate up to 37,500 kilowatt-hours of electricity. This output helps prevent about 79,000 pounds of CO\u2082 emissions annually. Thanks to its modular design, the ship can connect with push barges and carry up to 3,430 short tons of bulk goods efficiently. Its hybrid diesel-electric system is also designed to run on cleaner fuels in the future, making it adaptable as greener energy options become more available.",
      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Blue Marlin is more than a technological showcase. By fully integrating solar power with intelligent hybrid systems, it proves that performance and environmental responsibility can work together. This vessel stands as a practical example of cleaner shipping solutions. It offers lessons and inspiration for the future of cargo transport around the world.",

      "Windows 11 has had poor adoption, with many people sticking to the good old Windows 10. Microsoft has been pushing users to upgrade, threatening to end software support and warning about potential cybersecurity risks. But Windows 11 isn\u2019t exactly the best OS to come out of Redmond. Even if it were, many people simply can\u2019t upgrade because of its steep system requirements.",
      "In fact, it took Windows 11 nearly four years after its 2021 debut to finally surpass its predecessor in user numbers. Now that Windows 10 is being phased out, many users, especially those with older PCs that don't meet the hardware requirements, are understandably concerned. Tony from Wisconsin recently asked us the same thing:",
      "\"I heard that Microsoft will stop providing security patches for Windows 10 after October. My laptop can't be upgraded to Windows 11 because the CPU is too old. Since I'm not tech-savvy and don't feel comfortable replacing the CPU (nor do I want to), I'm wondering if I have a good antivirus program, do I still need to upgrade? Or will my system still be vulnerable to hackers and viruses?\"",
      "I understand your concern, Tony. Sticking with an unsupported OS brings security risks. Security researchers warn that unsupported systems, such as Windows 10, will become increasingly attractive targets for hackers. Hackers often reverse-engineer patches released for newer systems like Windows 11 to find similar flaws in older ones like Windows 10. With no more fixes coming, those vulnerabilities remain wide open, making unsupported systems a tempting target.",

      "Windows 11 finally surpasses Windows 10 in market share: Here's why it took so long",
      "According to Statcounter, Windows 11 has finally overtaken Windows 10 in terms of desktop and laptop usage as of early July. The newer OS now accounts for 52 percent of all Windows installations, up sharply from just under 48 percent in June. In the same period, Windows 10 dropped from 53.2 percent to 44.6 percent. Interestingly, Windows 7 still holds a small but notable presence, with 2.35 percent of users refusing to let it go.",
      "This shift comes nearly four years after Microsoft announced Windows 11 in June 2021. From the start, it was criticized for strict hardware rules. It required a TPM 2.0 chip and newer processors. Many functional PCs were left unable to upgrade.\u00a0 The operating system also introduced a revamped user interface that some users found unnecessary or confusing, leading to a slow adoption rate.",
      "A man typing on a Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happens when Windows 10 support ends in 2025? Here's what you need to know",
      "Windows 10 is reaching the end of its official support on October 14, 2025. That means Microsoft will stop releasing new features and routine security updates for the general public. For most users, this marks the end of the road, unless they take specific steps to keep receiving updates.",
      "To extend security updates beyond this deadline, Microsoft is offering a program called Extended Security Updates (ESU). Normally, this would cost $30 per year for personal users. However, Microsoft is making the first year free if you back up your PC using the Windows Backup app and sync your settings to OneDrive, or if you redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.",
      "Microsoft hasn't disclosed pricing beyond the first year, so it's unclear whether the $30/year rate will remain the same in 2026 and 2027.",
      "If you don't opt into either of those methods, you'll need to pay the $30 to continue receiving critical patches through October 2026. This is especially relevant for those who can't upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations.",
      "Even after general support ends, Microsoft will keep updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows 10 until October 2028. So while full system security updates will stop for most, basic malware protection will continue for a few more years.",
      "Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can't upgrade to Windows 11? 8 Safe alternatives for Windows 10 users in 2025",
      "You can continue using Windows 10 until October 14, 2025, with full access to regular security and stability updates. After that, you can extend protection by enrolling in Microsoft's Extended Security Updates program. The first year is free if you use the Windows Backup app to sync your settings to OneDrive, or if you redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.",
      "If your computer meets the hardware requirements for Windows 11, upgrading is the easiest long-term solution. You\u2019ll get access to ongoing feature updates, improved security, and long-term support through at least 2031.",
      "Google offers a free operating system called ChromeOS Flex, designed for older PCs and laptops. It\u2019s based on the same system used in Chromebooks and focuses on speed, simplicity, and security. However, it doesn\u2019t support Android apps or some hardware features like fingerprint readers and may not work for tasks like video editing or gaming.. This can be a great option if you mostly use web apps like Gmail, Google Docs, or Zoom.",
      "Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or Zorin OS provide a stable and user-friendly experience, especially for those coming from Windows. You can use them on older hardware without any licensing fees, and they come with access to thousands of free applications. While there may be a bit of a learning curve, many users find Linux reliable and surprisingly easy to adapt to for everyday tasks like browsing, writing, and media playback.",
      "If your current system can\u2019t handle Windows 11 and you are not interested in alternatives like ChromeOS or Linux, investing in a new computer may be the most straightforward path. New devices come with Windows 11 pre-installed and are built to support it fully. This ensures you\u2019ll continue to receive updates, features, and support for several years without additional effort.",

      "If you decide to stick with Windows 10 beyond its official support period, having strong third-party antivirus protection becomes even more important. While Microsoft Defender will continue receiving updates until 2028, it may not be enough on its own once the system stops getting core security patches. Installing a reputable antivirus program can help protect your device from malware, phishing, and other threats.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The end of Windows 10 support isn\u2019t a crisis, but it does require action. You should start planning your next move now. Consider upgrading to a newer version of Windows. You could also switch to a different operating system. Another option is investing in stronger security tools. And be on alert: as Windows 10\u2019s end-of-life nears, scammers will take advantage. Watch out for phone calls, emails, or pop-ups pretending to be from Microsoft offering \"urgent upgrade help.\" Microsoft doesn\u2019t call users out of the blue\u2014these are scams trying to steal your personal info or install malware.

The signs of dehydration, like dizziness, fatigue, or confusion, can creep in before you even realize you're in trouble. By the time you feel thirsty, you're already behind.

      "Single-side electrode configuration setup using hydration bioimpedance sensor. (University of Texas at Austin)",
      "How the wearable hydration sensor works",
      "Developed by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, the sensor is designed to detect early signs of dehydration using a method called bioimpedance. This method sends a small, painless electrical current through your bicep and measures how easily that current flows through your tissue. Because water is a good conductor of electricity, well-hydrated tissue lets the current pass easily. When you're dehydrated, your tissues resist the current, and the sensor detects that. The sensor connects wirelessly to a smartphone app, delivering instant feedback about your hydration level. You don't have to stop what you're doing or wait for lab results. The data is continuous and always available.",
      "Wearable hydration sensor benefits for workouts, jobs, and health",
      "This isn't just cool tech, it's practical. For athletes pushing through workouts in the heat, the sensor could help them avoid fatigue or cramping. For firefighters or police officers wearing heavy gear in scorching temperatures, it offers a way to stay safe on the job. Even office workers who forget to drink water during long meetings could benefit from a reminder when their hydration levels drop. The researchers believe the wearable hydration sensor could also play a major role in health care. Patients with kidney problems or cardiovascular issues often need to monitor hydration closely. Until now, that meant invasive tests or relying on symptoms. This sensor could make hydration tracking simple, accurate, and non-invasive.",
      "The science behind the hydration sensor",
      "To make sure the sensor really works, the research team ran controlled experiments. They had participants take a diuretic to promote fluid loss and tracked hydration using the sensor. At the same time, they collected urine samples to confirm results. The sensor's data closely matched the chemical markers in the samples. That means the technology is not only accurate, but it can also be trusted even during normal daily activities like walking or working. Study co-author Matija Jankovic explained that arm bioimpedance was highly sensitive to changes in hydration. It also aligned with whole-body hydration, making it a reliable alternative to traditional testing.",
      "Rigid PCB and commercial gel electrode system. (University of Texas at Austin)",
      "Traditional hydration tests fall short",
      "Standard ways of checking hydration, like urine tests or blood work, are time-consuming and not practical for everyday use. Some commercial tools already exist, but they tend to be bulky or require users to stay in one spot. They're just not built for real life. That's where this sensor has the edge. It's compact, portable, and constantly running in the background. It works while you move, exercise, or even just sit at your desk.",
      "What's next for hydration tracking",
      "Right now, the sensor tracks relative changes in hydration, which is a powerful tool on its own. But the research team wants to take it further. They plan to collect data from a larger population to create baseline values for absolute hydration levels. This step would make the device even more accurate and personal. They're also exploring new wearable designs, such as breathable e-tattoos and sweat-wicking sensors, that could offer better comfort and longer wear. Future models might track hydration in other areas of the body, like the forearm or thigh. The team is optimistic that these innovations will make hydration tracking even more seamless and accessible. Lead researcher Nanshu Lu, who has worked on similar wearable health tech in the past, says this is only the beginning. Her vision is to bring simple, real-time hydration tracking to everyone, no matter their lifestyle or profession.",
      "A woman sweating during a workout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Staying hydrated just got a whole lot easier. With a wearable hydration sensor, you no longer have to rely on guesswork or vague reminders to drink water. Whether you're powering through a workout, focused on a demanding job, or just caught up in a busy day, this device keeps tabs on your hydration status in real time. That means you get clear, instant feedback-before dehydration slows you down.",
      "While this technology is still in the research and development phase, the early results are promising. It's not yet available to the public, but the groundwork is in place. Once it moves into production, this kind of real-time hydration tracking could become a part of daily life, helping you stay healthier, more alert, and ahead of the curve.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Dehydration isn't always obvious, but it can quickly become serious. The wearable hydration sensor puts the power to monitor your health back in your hands. It's accurate, non-invasive, and built for daily life. Whether you're training for a marathon or just trying to stay sharp at work, knowing your hydration status in real time could make all the difference.",

      "Inspired by President Donald Trump\u2019s leadership style, Kamiya\u2019s rise has largely been attributed to his social media savvy. He snagged his earliest followers through his opposition to \"blanket mask mandates, mass PCR testing, and vaccine requirements\" during the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan Forward reported.",
      "Kamiya has also adopted a spin-off of Trump\u2019s MAGA motto, proclaiming \"Japanese first\" as his party promises to strengthen Japan\u2019s culture, birth rates and food sufficiency, while finding solutions for its reliance on immigration.",
      "Though the Western media has characterized Kamiya as far-right, fringe or xenophobic, Lance Gatling, a principal at Nexial Research, Tokyo, told Fox News Digital that while Kamiya\u2019s goals of \"protecting Japan, growing Japan, and educating Japan\" are \"fairly populist,\" they do not represent \"a radical move towards the right wing.\"",
      "In fact, Gatling said many in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has dominated Japanese politics for decades, \"are more right-wing than Sanseit\u014d.\" Gatling described members of Kamiya\u2019s party as \"pretty reasonable.\"",

      "Some critics have expressed particular concern over what they call Kamiya\u2019s anti-immigration stance. Immigration, however, has become a chief issue for the island nation. When former President Joe Biden called Japan \"xenophobic\" for failing to increase immigration in May 2024, Kamiya responded on social media. \"It\u2019s not that we\u2019re xenophobic, we are being cautious after seeing your failures,\" Kamiya said. \"You are meddling too much in our internal affairs.\"",
      "Gatling says categorizing the Japanese as xenophobic \"just doesn\u2019t ring true.\" He explained that the country has \"one of the most astonishing cultures in history,\" formed by adopting Western culture and enriching it to create \"a completely unique culture that has tremendous appeal around the world.\"",
      "Gatling says Kamiya is aiming for a return to traditional cultural values, while also lowering taxes and increasing food self-sufficiency, which is currently the lowest rate of all Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development nations at 38%.",

      "Another possible friction point in the future might be Sanseit\u014d\u2019s desire to turn the nation\u2019s farmers into public sector employees, Gatling admitted. \"The agriculture bloc is one of the most powerful in the LDP,\" he explained. \"I\u2019m not sure how many of the farmers want to be public sector employees.\"",
      "While he says that it is too early to determine the future of Sanseit\u014d in Japanese politics, Gatling said Kamiya has stated he is not \"interested in building a coalition government.\" Gatling believes the party\u2019s future will hinge on preparations for subsequent elections and demonstrating that \"they have reasonable policies.\"",
      "Chang said Sanseit\u014d\u2019s win was a loss for the LDP, which he says has \"been adrift\" since Abe\u2019s 2020 resignation and subsequent 2022 assassination. Current Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba \"is weak and unpopular,\" and the LDP now finds itself \"in the minority in both houses of the Diet for the first time since the party was formed in 1955,\" Chang said. \"Ishiba is naturally catching the blame.\"",

      "\"The Iranian Africa strategy can be thought of as having three components,\" Cronje stated. \"The first is the provision of training and material support to extremist groups in Africa to aid in the export of terror globally, and to target Christians and pro-Western communities on the continent, whilst creating a high-threat environment for Western investors.",
      "\"To that end the global terror threat index scores for several African countries have come to exceed those of traditional Middle Eastern terror staples.

      "\"A third pillar of the strategy is that Iran has deepened diplomatic and economic cooperation ties with scores of African governments and business organizations to win trade and investment deals that help it evade global sanctions, as well as securing the diplomatic support of African governments on global fora such as the U.N., for measures ranging from its nuclear weapons program to its investment in proxy forces that threaten Israel.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s approach with Russian President Vladimir Putin pivoted drastically this month when, for the first time since returning to the White House, he not only confirmed his support for Ukraine in a NATO arms agreement but issued an ultimatum to the Kremlin chief.",
      "The warning came in a clear message: Enter into a peace deal with Ukraine or face stiff international sanctions on its top commodity, oil sales.",
      "While the move has been championed by some, it has been questioned by others who debate whether it will be enough to deter Putin\u2019s war ambitions in Ukraine. One security expert is arguing the plan will work, but it might take years to be effective.",

      "\"I think it will be effective, and he's going to stick to that strategy.

      "\"That's something Trump's not going to tolerate,\" Fleitz added. \"We will see this is just the first six months of the Trump presidency. This may take a couple of years to solve.\"",
      "But Trump campaigned on ending the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, which has proven to be more complicated than he suggested from the campaign trail. And not everyone in the Republican Party has backed his approach when it comes to Europe, including a staunch Trump supporter, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.",
      "\"We do not want to give or sell weapons to Ukraine or be involved in any foreign wars or continue the never-ending flow of foreign aid,\" Greene said on X. \"We want to solve our own problems plaguing our own people.\"",
      "Fleitz pointed to Trump\u2019s decision to directly strike Iran and argued it reflected Trump\u2019s ability to be nimble as a leader.",
      "\"He looked at the intelligence and realized it was getting too close, and he decided to adjust his policy, which was first diplomacy,\" Fleitz said.",
      "\"But Trump also specified something very important. He said to his supporters, 'I came up with a concept of the America-first approach to U.S. national security, and I decide what's in it,\" Fleitz added. \"He has ownership of this approach, and he will adjust if necessary.\"",

      "On Thursday, John Hardie, deputy director of FDD\u2019s Russia Program, told U.S. lawmakers on the Helsinki Commission, also known as the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, in a defense briefing that Ukraine needs to be supplied with long-range strike capabilities that can hit key Russian missile and drone plants.",

      "\"Ukraine shouldn\u2019t be restricted merely to shooting down \u2018arrows\u2019,\" Hardie said. \"An optimal approach will combine both offense and defense. Ukraine needs to be able to hit the \u2018archer\u2019 and the factories that make the \u2018arrows.'",
      "\"Putin will continue his unprovoked war so long as he believes it\u2019s sustainable and offers a pathway to achieving his goals,\" Hardie argued. \"By shoring up Ukraine\u2019s defense of its skies and enabling Ukraine to inflict growing costs on Russia\u2019s war machine, as well as pressuring the Russian economy and exhausting Russia\u2019s offensive potential on the ground, we may be able to change that calculus.\"",
      "But Fleitz, who serves as vice chair of the America First Policy Institute's Center for American Security, said he believes this war will only be brought to an end when an armistice agreement is secured.",
      "\"I think there's probably going to be an armistice where both sides will agree to suspend the fighting,\" Fleitz said. \"Someday, we will find a line where both nations will agree to stop fighting.\"",

      "Four people, including an off-duty New York City police officer, were killed Monday evening when a man armed with a rifle walked into a Manhattan high-rise corporate building and opened fire.",
      "The other victims killed were an executive at the investment management company Blackstone, an employee of the real estate firm Rudin Management, and a security guard.",
      "The shooting occurred around 6:30 p.m. in the lobby of 345 Park Ave. in Midtown. Authorities said security video showed the suspect, Shane Devon Tamura, getting out of a double-parked car carrying an M4 rifle.",
      "He entered the building and immediately opened fire \"on an NYPD officer,\" New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. He then shot a woman taking cover behind a pillar and fired at others before taking the elevator to the 33rd floor, where he shot and killed another person, according to authorities.",
      "Tamura, a 27-year-old from Nevada who recently drove across the country, then killed himself, authorities said. Tisch said he has a \"documented mental health history,\" and in his vehicle investigators found a loaded revolver, a rifle case with rounds, ammunition magazines and some prescribed medication.",
      "Investigators are still looking into why Tamura targeted the building. Officials familiar with the investigation told NBC News that he left behind a note insinuating that his mental illness may be linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, from having played football. The brain disease is linked to repeated hits to the head.",
      "The NFL is one of the tenants of the building.",
      "Officials, however, noted that it\u2019s still early in the investigation and a motive remains unclear.",
      "Here's everything we know about the victims.",
      "Wesley LePatner",
      "Blackstone identified one of the slain victims as Wesley LePatner. She joined Blackstone in 2014 after spending over a decade at Goldman Sachs. LePatner, 43, was the senior managing director and also a member of Blackstone real estate\u2019s investment committee, according to the company\u2019s website.",
      "She served on the boards of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the UJA-Federation of New York, Yale University Library Council, and The Abraham Joshua Heschel School, where her son attends the seventh grade.",
      "She was also a member of the advisory board of governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.",
      "The Heschel School described LePatner as \"a uniquely brilliant and modest leader and parent, filled with wisdom, empathy, vision and appreciation.\"",
      "\"There are no right words for this unfathomable moment of pain and loss,\" a representative for the school said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The school said she \"made the world \u2014 and all of the institutions she touched, including the Heschel School \u2014 a better place.\"",
      "\"We are all diminished today by her absence,\" the statement read.",
      "Didarul Islam",
      "Didarul Islam, a 36-year-old immigrant from Bangladesh, was hailed as a hero who \u201cmade the ultimate sacrifice.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was doing the job that we asked him to do,\u201d Tisch said at a news conference Monday night. \u201cHe put himself in harm\u2019s way.\u201d",
      "Islam had been with the NYPD for nearly four years, assigned to the 47th Precinct in the Bronx. He was working off-duty as a security guard when he was shot.",
      "\u201cHe was doing what he does best and all members of the police department carry out,\u201d Mayor Eric Adams said. \u201cHe was saving lives. He was protecting New Yorkers.\u201d",
      "Tisch said Islam was the father of two young boys and was expecting a third child with his wife. Adams said he told Islam's family that \"he was a hero, and we admire him for putting his life on the line.\"",
      "His cousin said Islam was a \"very pious person\" who would regularly attend the mosque for worship.",
      "\"He is very nice guy, and his behavior is very good,\" Muhammad Mainul Islam told NBC New York. \"I really miss him.\"",
      "Aland Etienne",
      "The 32BJ Service Employees International Union remembered Aland Etienne, 46, as \"a dedicated security officer who took his job duties extremely seriously.\"",
      "\"This tragedy speaks to the sacrifice of security officers who risk their lives every day to keep New Yorkers and our buildings safe,\" Manny Pastreich, president of 32BJ SEIU, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\"Every time a security officer puts on their uniform, they put their lives on the line. Their contributions to our city are essential, though often unappreciated,\" he said.",
      "Pastreich called Etienne \"a New York hero.\"",
      "Rudin Management employee",
      "Rudin Management, the real estate company that owns 345 Park Ave. and is headquartered there, confirmed one of its employees was killed. The employee has not been publicly named.",
      "\"The Rudin family and everyone at our company are devastated by yesterday\u2019s senseless tragedy,\" the company said in a statement Tuesday. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with those injured and lost last night, including our cherished Rudin colleague, a brave New York City police officer, a beloved lobby security guard and an employee at a tenant firm.\u201d",
      "\"As New Yorkers, we stand shoulder to shoulder in the face of this hatred, we grieve with the families and loved ones of those lost, and we pray for the full recovery of those injured.\""

      "Officials familiar with the investigation told NBC News that the suspect left a note at the scene voicing anger that his mental illness may be linked to his having played football. Investigators are looking into whether that is a why he targeted the Park Avenue building that houses the NFL offices, the officials said.",
      "The officials stressed that the investigation is early and ongoing.",

      "\u201cYou never would have thought violence was something you\u2019d associate with him,\u201d former classmate Caleb Clarke said. \u201cEverything he said was a joke.\u201d",
      "Tamura transferred to Granada Hills Charter School in Granada Hills, a neighborhood in Los Angeles, in 2015 when he was a senior, coming from a school in Santa Clarita, Clarke said.",
      "Clarke indicated that the pair lost touch but reconnected through social media recently and that Tamura worked at a Las Vegas casino.",
      "Former coach Walter Roby said Tamura was a talented running back and \u201ca great player\u201d who was \u201creal elusive, real agile.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe came in, worked hard, kept his nose down,\u201d Roby added. \u201cHe was a quiet kid, well-mannered, very coachable. Whatever needed to be done, he would do.\u201d",
      "Roby said he was shocked that Tamura was suspected of carrying out a mass shooting.",

      "Not anymore.",
      "As the internet has provided rocket fuel for such claims, Republican lawmakers across the country are introducing, passing and enacting laws to ban \u201cweather modification\u201d and environmental geoengineering and allude to the use of \u201cchemtrails,\u201d a longtime theory that planes are spreading chemical agents on an unsuspecting public. As more people are exposed to dangerous flooding, the GOP lawmakers have pointed to the fringe theories as potential explanations for extreme weather, pushing them further into the political mainstream. (Scientists have found evidence tying the increasing frequency of extreme weather to climate change.)",
      "Republican lawmakers in nearly 20 state legislatures have proposed such legislation, with governors in Tennessee and Florida having signed bills into law. On the federal level, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., recently introduced the \u201cClear Skies Act,\u201d which would outlaw forms of geoengineering and hit alleged weather modifiers with penalties of up to $100,000 for each violation and potential prison sentences of up to five years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a conspiracy theory,\u201d Pennsylvania state Sen. Camera Bartolotta, a Republican who co-sponsored legislation in her state, said in an interview. \u201cAll you have to do is look up.\u201d",
      "At its core, the legislative push seeks to outlaw human-made alterations to the climate \u2014 notable, given how the party has fought to stop efforts to combat climate change tied to fossil fuel consumption and as the Trump administration has cut funding for climate change research and removed the website that hosted the government\u2019s climate assessments.",
      "\u201cOne political party in this country seems especially concerned about the idea of theoretical changes in the weather,\u201d Matthew Cappucci, a meteorologist for the Washington Post and other outlets, told NBC News. \u201cWhereas that same political party will largely turn a blind eye to actual weather modification that is happening in slow motion, i.e., human-induced climate change.\u201d",
      "Greene, who is leading the charge to pass federal legislation to ban weather modification, said she saw \u201ckind of a funny hypocrisy\u201d among climate change activists who are \u201cyelling, \u2018We\u2019ve got to stop climate change.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cBut yet they\u2019re like, \u2018No, don\u2019t stop manmade climate change,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cSo I find that to be a laughable hypocrisy. And so it just doesn\u2019t add up to me.\u201d",
      "Greene has for years been subject to heavy criticism over her 2018 claim that lasers from space may have triggered a 2018 wildfire in California. She now feels a sense of vindication as Republicans across the country feel compelled to produce legislation similar to hers."

The two largest fires, which killed at least 30 people and displaced thousands more, ripped through the communities in  Pacific Palisades and Altadena, fanned by strong Santa Ana winds.",

      "Superheroes are flying high again at the movies. Marvel\u2019s \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d and rival DC\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d ruled the box office this past weekend, giving the genre a much-needed jolt for audiences and corporate executives alike.",
      "While both movies are bonafide summer hits, they\u2019re supporting players in the blockbuster story this year \u2014 a divergence from recent years when superhero flicks, particularly from Disney\u2019s Marvel Studios, would seize most of the spotlight.",
      "\u201cYou have so many movies out there this summer, all competing for the hearts and minds and wallets of the audience,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.",
      "Many moviegoers are also paying more money to see major releases on the biggest, most cutting-edge screens such as IMAX's.",
      "Universal\u2019s \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d Apple and Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cF1 The Movie\u201d and DreamWorks Animation\u2019s \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d have racked up big bucks this season. And it all kicked off with a record-breaking Memorial Day weekend led by Paramount\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 The Final Reckoning\u201d and Disney\u2019s \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d remake. (Universal and DreamWorks Animation share a parent company with NBC News.) \u201cThe Naked Gun,\u201d \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d and \u201cWeapons\u201d are on the way in August.",
      "The box office is on track to outpace last year, which suffered from lingering effects of production delays triggered by the 2023 actors\u2019 and writers\u2019 strikes. The tally to this point is $5.2 billion, ahead of $4.6 billion during the same period last year, according to Comscore. Dergarabedian said the year\u2019s total could reach $9.5 billion, which would make 2025 the best frame since before the pandemic, when domestic grosses would consistently top $10 billion. There\u2019s hope for the back half of the year, with much-anticipated films like \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d and \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d on the slate.",
      "But so far, \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d is the only film this year to cross the $1 billion mark at the global box office, a benchmark several U.S.-produced movies would hit each year before the Covid pandemic started in early 2020. (Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d is close, grossing more than $955 million, according to data from Comscore.)",
      "The biggest superhero movies used to routinely break the billion-dollar barrier. Four of them, including Disney-Pixar\u2019s \u201cThe Incredibles 2,\u201d did it in 2018; another three cleared it in 2019. Marvel\u2019s last superhero film to surpass $1 billion was the R-rated \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d which came out last July and boasted the return of Hugh Jackman\u2019s fan-favorite Wolverine. Before that, it was \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\u201d in 2021. DC\u2019s last billion-dollar grosser was \u201cAquaman\u201d in 2018.",
      "\u201cTo get to a billion dollars is a huge deal,\u201d said Dergarabedian. \u201cWhen you get up into the $800 million range globally, to get to the finish line and cross over to a billion, it\u2019s like trying to break the sound barrier.\u201d",
      "While $1 billion for \u201cThe Fantastic Four\u201d might be too far for even the stretchy Mister Fantastic to reach, the movie\u2019s $218 million global opening is nonetheless a win for Marvel. Previous Marvel releases this year, \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u201d which was released in February and grossed $409 million worldwide, and \u201cThunderbolts,\u201d which grossed $378 million off its May release, were disappointments at the box office.",
      "\u201cSuperman\u201d \u2014 which was directed by James Gunn, who helmed the lucrative \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d trilogy for Marvel \u2014 has already topped $500 million worldwide, according to data from Comscore. Like \u201cFantastic Four,\u201d it won critical praise \u2014 and audiences actually liked it.",
      "\u201cThere is no superhero fatigue,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cIt\u2019s bad movie fatigue.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s been a rough stretch for both Marvel and DC. DC has suffered more outright flops recently \u2014 \u201cThe Flash,\u201d \u201cShazam: Fury of the Gods\u201d and \u201cAquaman: The Lost Kingdom\u201d all underwhelmed in 2023 \u2014 pushing Warner Bros. to hire Gunn from Marvel to revitalize the brand. Marvel, though, has suffered from a dilution of its heroic sagas across theatrical releases and streaming \u2014 something even Disney CEO Bob Iger acknowledged in late 2023. He also warned that the industry might have gotten too accustomed to astronomical grosses.",
      "\u201cI mean, we got to the point where if a film didn\u2019t do a billion dollars in global box office, we were disappointed,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s an unbelievably high standard and I think we have to get more realistic.\u201d",
      "While those kinds of grosses are becoming rarer, Hollywood is still going big on marquee releases. Indeed, the hero of the summer may not be Sue Storm or Superman \u2014 it could be IMAX.",
      "Large-screen IMAX showings accounted for 20% or more of the opening weekend domestic box office revenue for \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 The Final Reckoning,\u201d \u201cF1: The Movie\u201d and \u201cSinners,\u201d the company said.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to going out to the movies, especially for the bigger than life blockbusters like \u2018Mission: Impossible,\u2019 people really want to see those on the biggest screen possible,\u201d said Dergarabedian.",
      "A record eight consecutive movies released on IMAX screens this year were filmed and edited with the format in mind, including \u201cSuperman\u201d and \u201cFantastic Four,\u201d according to IMAX. CEO Rich Gelfond has said he expects the company to clear $1.2 billion at the global box office this year.",
      "\u201cI think people recognize it\u2019s a premium experience, and they\u2019re willing to pay for it,\u201d Gelfond said in IMAX\u2019s earnings call this month."

    "summary": "Trump\u2019s trade deal with the E.U. may lead to higher prices for brand-name drugs in the U.S., including the blockbuster medications Ozempic and Wegovy, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s trade deal with the European Union may lead to higher prices for brand-name drugs in the United States, including blockbuster medications like Ozempic and Wegovy, experts say.",
      "The trade deal, announced Sunday, places a 15% tariff on most imported goods from the E.U., including pharmaceuticals. While that comes in well below the 200% tariffs Trump had threatened on pharmaceutical imports earlier this month, it\u2019ll still have an impact.",
      "Pharmaceuticals are the United States\u2019 fifth largest import, said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.",
      "Europe is a major manufacturing hub for brand-name drugs in particular. Nearly half of the active ingredients for brand-name drugs taken in the U.S. are produced in European countries such as Ireland, Germany, Italy and Belgium, Kesselheim said. Europe is also where many drugmakers do final steps, such as filling and packaging.",
      "Novo Nordisk\u2019s diabetes and obesity drugs Ozempic and Wegovy are both produced in Denmark. Botox, made by Allergen, and the cancer drug Keytruda from drugmaker Merck are made in Ireland. (In recent years, however, more of Keytruda\u2019s manufacturing has shifted to the U.S.)",
      "While brand-name drugs only account for about 10% of prescriptions filled in the U.S., they make up about 80% of all drug spending, Kesselheim said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s because they\u2019re priced so high,\u201d he said. \u201cEach individual [generic] statin is pennies, whereas Botox is thousands to tens of thousands of dollars.\u201d",
      "In the short term, drug companies might increase the list prices of these products to account for the higher cost, said Rena Conti, an associate professor at Boston University\u2019s Questrom School of Business.",
      "\u201cU.S. consumers will pay more at the pharmacy counter for these drugs,\u201d Conti said. \u201cWhat patients pay at the pharmacy counter reflects drug companies\u2019 set price list.\u201d",
      "Kesselheim said it\u2019s an open question whether patients would even notice the higher prices, given that brand-name drugs are already so expensive.",
      "\u201cThe drug prices are already two to three times higher in the United States than they are in other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot more room for drug companies [to charge more.]\u201d",
      "Generic drugs, on the other hand, are often sold at close to the cost that they\u2019re made. About 9 out of 10 prescription drugs taken in the U.S. are generics, Kesselheim added.",
      "The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a drug industry trade group, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The E.U. tariffs aren\u2019t expected to affect the prices of many generic drugs.",
      "Some generic drugs are made in Europe, but the majority are manufactured in countries like China and India, said Arthur Caplan, the head of the division of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.",
      "There have been concerns that tariffs on these countries could \u200bdrive up the cost of generic drugs and exacerbate drug shortages. Generic drugs aren\u2019t a lucrative enough business for companies to invest in new manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Caplan said.",
      "A spokesperson for the Association for Accessible Medicines, a trade group that represents generic drugmakers, said the group is still assessing the potential impact of the tariffs as well as the specifics of the trade deal."

    "story": [
      "The gunman who opened fire in midtown Manhattan on Monday, killing four people before turning the gun on himself, left a note mentioning \u201cCTE\u201d several times, officials familiar with the investigation told NBC News.",
      "CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is a brain condition caused by repeated injuries to the head, typically over many years.",
      "The shooter was targeting the headquarters of the National Football League, which is in the Park Avenue building where the shooting took place, authorities said.",
      "While CTE can\u2019t be formally diagnosed without an autopsy, one third of former NFL players suspect they have the disease, according to a 2024 report. The NFL first acknowledged the link between CTE and football in 2016.",
      "Former NFL player Phillip Adams was found to have severe CTE after he gunned down six people before taking his own life in South Carolina in 2021.",
      "NBC News spoke with Dr. Aaron Lord, chief of neurology at NYU Langone who specializes in brain injuries, about how CTE changes the brain and a person\u2019s behavior.",
      "What is chronic traumatic encephalopathy?",
      "First characterized in boxers, the condition used to be called \u201cpunch drunk syndrome\u201d and can cause neurological conditions including early dementia, memory impairment, personality changes, and movement disorders similar to Parkinson\u2019s disease, Lord said.",
      "CTE can affect anyone who sustains repeated head injuries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just about repetitive shock waves to the brain,\u201d he said.",
      "The condition\u2019s link to suicide and suicidal ideation is an area of active study, in part because there seems to be a higher rate of CTE than expected among high-caliber athletes who have committed suicide, Lord said.",
      "Still, experts haven\u2019t drawn any conclusions about \u201cthe incidence and prevalence of this disease in the population, or in specific athletes,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a new one we\u2019re still defining,\u201d he said.",
      "How is CTE diagnosed?",
      "Without an autopsy, doctors can\u2019t diagnose CTE, and even then it can be difficult to pinpoint because there's no specific criteria to diagnose it, Lord said. An autopsy must reveal evidence of tissue degeneration and abnormal clumps of certain proteins around blood vessels in the brain.",
      "Some patients and their doctors may speculate that they have the disease because of noticeable changes in their moods and behavior. Patients also know if they\u2019ve suffered blows to the head, how many and how severe.",
      "Lord said that a brain MRI on concerned patients might reveal some changes consistent with the disease, but it\u2019s not enough for a diagnosis.",
      "There is some overlap in symptoms with psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Lord said.",
      "Lord has also seen a link between patients with CTE and homicidal ideation and impulsivity as well as other personality changes.",
      "Lord tends to see the disease in older individuals, possibly because of earlier repeated impacts, but even one hit to the head can cause damage, even if that trauma doesn\u2019t result in CTE.",
      "\u201cEven somebody who\u2019s just been in a single car accident and has injured the frontal lobes of their brain can have permanent personality changes and impulse control and psychiatric changes,\u201d he said.",
      "Is there treatment for CTE?",
      "Although there is no direct treatment for the disease, psychiatric medication can help with behavioral control and other symptoms, Lord said.",
      "Not everyone who gets a concussion develops CTE, according to the Mayo clinic. Prevention is the best medicine: Avoiding head injury by using seatbelts or helmets can lower the risk of getting a CTE and other brain-injuries, Lord said."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein \u201cstole\u201d Virginia Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago club, a stunning admission that could increase scrutiny of his relationship with the late financier \u2014 even as his administration seeks to change the subject from Epstein.",
      "Trump was speaking to reporters on Tuesday when he was asked about comments he made over the weekend about falling out with Epstein because he took employees from his business.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday recommended classifying 7-OH, a compound with opioid-like effects found in unregulated tablets, gummies and drink mixes sold in gas stations and convenience stores, as an illicit substance.",
      "Such a move by the Justice Department would restrict or prohibit access to the products, which are also currently sold online.",
      "The chemical, formally known as 7-hydroxymitragynine, is often marketed as a way to help people relax, relieve pain or improve their mood or focus. But studies suggest it\u2019s more potent than morphine, and the FDA has warned it could damage the heart or liver and potentially lead to seizures, digestive issues, shallow breathing, withdrawal symptoms or even death.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a disturbing rise in reports of overdoses, poisonings and emergency room visits linked to products containing 7-OH,\u201d Jim O\u2019Neill, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said at a press conference Tuesday.",
      "He said 7-OH products are often sold without warnings or control over the quality or dosage.",
      "\u201cThis is a recipe for public health disaster,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.",
      "7-OH is found naturally in the leaves of a tropical evergreen tree. An herbal extract made from those leaves, known as kratom, is also sold as an unregulated dietary supplement. Kratom products contain trace amounts of 7-OH, whereas products sold under the name \u201c7-OH\u201d contain a synthetic, concentrated version of the chemical, according to the FDA. Sometimes, 7-OH products are misleadingly marketed as kratom.",
      "The FDA\u2019s recommendation Tuesday will trigger a review from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the branch of the Justice Department responsible for classifying drugs as controlled substances. There are five potential classifications, corresponding to varying degrees of regulation. They\u2019re based on a substance\u2019s medical use, public health risks and potential for abuse.",
      "FDA Commissioner Martin Makary said Tuesday that the FDA is recommending that 7-OH be classified as a Schedule I substance, meaning it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Other drugs in that class include heroin, marijuana and ecstasy.",
      "The FDA currently warns people not to use kratom products due to the risk of serious side effects such as seizures and liver toxicity, and because it may lead to substance use disorder.",
      "The DEA in 2016 said it planned to regulate the active ingredients in kratom, including 7-OH, as Schedule I substances. But the agency nixed the effort after considerable pushback from kratom advocates. Around 1.9 million people ages 12 and up in the U.S. reported using kratom in 2022, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.",
      "Tom Prevoznik, an assistant administrator at the DEA, said at Tuesday's press conference that the public will again have an opportunity to comment before a final decision is made.",
      "\u201cDEA will do what we\u2019ve always done: follow science, follow the law and do what\u2019s right to keep our community safe,\u201d he said.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recalled the availability of heroin fueling his own addiction decades ago, and expressed concern about the widespread distribution of 7-OH products near schools, military reservations and in low-income neighborhoods in the United States.",
      "He added that 7-OH products are \u201cmarketed for children. They\u2019re gummy bears, they\u2019re bright colors, they\u2019re candy flavored. This is really a sinister, sinister industry.\u201d",
      "The FDA issued warning letters in late June to seven companies, which it said were illegally marketing products containing 7-OH. According to the agency, the chemical cannot be lawfully added to conventional foods or dietary supplements because there is not enough information to demonstrate its safety.",
      "Dietary supplements don\u2019t require FDA approval to be sold or purchased, but the agency mandates that companies that manufacture, package, label or store supplements test their ingredients and limit contamination. It\u2019s up to the FDA to test products and determine whether they\u2019re unsafe before the agency can remove them from the market.",
      "Makary said Tuesday that the FDA is focused on 7-OH rather than kratom, noting that the agency\u2019s recommendation distinguishes trace amounts of 7-OH from synthetic, concentrated amounts.",
      "\u201cWe are going after the killer first,\u201d he said.",
      "The Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, which advocates for the use of plant-based compounds to address opioid addiction, said the FDA\u2019s recommendation Tuesday disregards how 7-OH is used in the real world.",
      "\u201cIf 7-OH posed the kind of urgent danger that would justify emergency action, evidence would have been presented. It was not,\u201d Jeff Smith, the group\u2019s national policy director, said in a statement.",
      "Proponents of kratom say it\u2019s useful for pain management and can help people with substance use disorders wean off more dangerous opioids.",
      "The American Kratom Association, which advocates on behalf of kratom users, has said it\u2019s not opposed to the FDA regulating kratom products via labels, age restrictions or limiting the concentration of 7-OH. However, it maintains that kratom does not have a high potential for abuse or warrant classification as a controlled substance."

    "story": [
      "The New York City police officer who was killed when a gunman opened fire in a midtown Manhattan building on Monday evening was a dedicated father and civil servant who was working a second job as a security guard, according to officials.",
      "Didarul Islam, a 36-year-old immigrant from Bangladesh, was the first person to be shot in the attack at 345 Park Ave. that left four others dead, including the gunman, authorities said.",
      "Islam had been with the police department for about four years and leaves behind two young sons and a wife who is pregnant, according to the New York Police Department.",
      "\u201cHe was doing the job that we asked him to do,\u201d NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a news conference Monday night. \u201cHe put himself in harm\u2019s way. He made the ultimate sacrifice, shot in cold blood, wearing a uniform that stood for the promise that he made to this city.\u201d",
      "She added that Islam was working off-duty through a police department program that allows companies to hire officers in uniform to provide extra security.",
      "Those who knew Islam said he \u201cbelieved in living out the life of a godly person,\u201d said New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who told reporters at the news conference that he had met with Islam\u2019s family earlier in the night.",
      "\u201cI told them that he was a hero, and we admire him for putting his life on the line,\u201d said Adams, who is a former police officer. \u201cHe embodies what this city is all about. He\u2019s a true-blue New Yorker, not only in a uniform he wore, but in his spirit and energy of loving this city.\u201d",
      "Officials said the motive for the attack was still under investigation. Shane Devon Tamura, a 27-year-old from Las Vegas with a \u201cdocumented mental health history,\u201d has been identified by police as the gunman. Authorities say he recently drove cross-country to New York, storming into the office tower and spraying the lobby with gunfire before taking the elevator to the 33rd floor to fire more shots and then turning his weapon upon himself.",
      "Two officials familiar with the matter told NBC News that the shooter, who played football in high school, left a note at the scene that said he wanted his brain studied for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE \u2014 a neurodegenerative disorder associated with head injuries that has been diagnosed in hundreds of NFL players after their deaths and that can cause changes in behavior and cognition.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 19:28:58 GMT",
    "summary": "Deion Sanders' recent bladder cancer diagnosis sheds light on the importance of early testing for it \u2014 especially among Black people.",
    "story": [
      "Speculation swirled for weeks around the health of Deion Sanders, Colorado Buffaloes head coach and famed Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee, who had been notably absent from team practice.",
      "When he announced Monday that he had undergone surgery in June to remove his bladder after a cancer diagnosis, it once again became evident that cancer doesn\u2019t discriminate around wealth and status.",
      "But the serious nature of his condition highlights concerns about how Black people tend to be at a disproportionately higher health risk than other groups due to the deficiencies in care. Doctors hope Sanders\u2019 diagnosis can influence others to take preventative steps.",
      "Dr. Geoffrey Mount Varner, an emergency room physician in Maryland, noted that Black people are less likely to get bladder cancer but are more likely to die from it. \u201cIt does impact Black people more and aggressively,\u201d he said.",
      "In a video of Sanders, 57, filmed in May but shared by his son on Sunday, the coach spoke about how emotionally and mentally draining it was to have to write a will before his surgery.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not easy at all,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "A high-profile figure like Sanders having a cancerous tumor on his bladder is likely to prompt more people to seek screening. Five years ago, the shocking death of actor Chadwick Boseman from colon cancer at age 43 raised awareness among Black men of the importance of having a colonoscopy. Black people are at a disproportionately high risk for colon cancer diagnoses, according to the American Cancer Society, and the mortality rate has increased in recent years, particularly among Black men.",
      "Just four days before Sanders\u2019 press conference, Varner, also a Black man in his 50s, completed chemotherapy for prostate cancer.",
      "\u201cCancer touches 100% of people,\u201d Varner said.",
      "What is bladder cancer surgery like?",
      "During the press conference, Dr. Janet Kukreja, the director of urological oncology at University of Colorado Health, said Sanders chose to have bladder surgery over chemotherapy because it increased his chances to continue coaching.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a laparoscopic surgery,\u201d Kukreja, who performed the surgery, said, \u201cwhere we attach a robot to the patient, and then we do all the maneuvering of the robot, and then once the bladder comes out, we also take some lymph nodes to make sure it hasn\u2019t spread \u2014 and it didn\u2019t \u2014 and then we make a new bladder for people. \u201cWe use their own intestine so they don\u2019t have to take immunosuppression.",
      "Life after the surgery, she said, \u201cis a new way of life, and it is a learning curve, for sure.\u201d",
      "Sanders, who plans to coach the Buffaloes in the upcoming season, even joked that there may need to be a \u201cport-a-potty on the sideline.\u201d",
      "Dr. Philippe Spiess, a genitourinary oncologist at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, said this procedure typically lasts between five and seven hours and \u201cinvolves removing the bladder, prostate and surrounding lymph nodes in the pelvis,\u201d since the cancer could spread beyond the bladder.\u201d",
      "Why Black Americans should take note",
      "Sanders used the Monday press conference to urge those watching to \u201cget checked out,\u201d especially when there are even the mildest of symptoms that something is off.",
      "It was sound advice, Varner said.",
      "\u201cOne of the screen exams for bladder cancer is, for instance, just a regular urinalysis,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will pick up blood in the urine, which is a symptom. If you don\u2019t go to your primary care physician and have these basic screenings done, you miss it. And by the time you have obvious symptoms, you\u2019re further along the line for prostate cancer or colon cancer or breast cancer for Black women.\u201d",
      "Varner said up to 70% of cancers are tied to food consumption, especially fast food and ultraprocessed products.",
      "\u201cIn Black communities, there are one and a half times more fast-food restaurants,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason why that matters is that fast food restaurants serve hyperprocessed foods, which leads to or increases the risk of cancer. And so right off the bat, it puts Black folks at a disadvantage.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would help all people, and the Black community specifically, if some of the basic screenings were free,\u201d Varner said.",
      "As an ER doctor, Varner said he often sees patients who have long had symptoms of a serious illness, but by the time they get to the hospital, \u201cthey want immediate care.\u201d But earlier screening would make the issue of care a little less invasive and daunting.",
      "Varner said prostate-specific screenings for cancer and analysis should be more broadly accessible. \u201cThere are programs that help with the cost of some tests,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have to take advantage of them and not wait until it\u2019s too late.\u201d"

      "Four people, including an off-duty New York City police officer, were killed Monday evening when a man armed with a rifle walked into a Manhattan high-rise corporate building and opened fire.",
      "The other victims killed were an executive at the investment management company Blackstone, an employee of the real estate firm Rudin Management, and a security guard.",
      "The shooting occurred around 6:30 p.m. in the lobby of 345 Park Ave. in Midtown. Authorities said security video showed the suspect, Shane Devon Tamura, getting out of a double-parked car carrying an M4 rifle.",
      "He entered the building and immediately opened fire \"on an NYPD officer,\" New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. He then shot a woman taking cover behind a pillar and fired at others before taking the elevator to the 33rd floor, where he shot and killed another person, according to authorities.",
      "Tamura, a 27-year-old from Nevada who recently drove across the country, then killed himself, authorities said. Tisch said he has a \"documented mental health history,\" and in his vehicle investigators found a loaded revolver, a rifle case with rounds, ammunition magazines and some prescribed medication.",
      "Investigators are still looking into why Tamura targeted the building. Officials familiar with the investigation told NBC News that he left behind a note insinuating that his mental illness may be linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, from having played football. The brain disease is linked to repeated hits to the head.",
      "The NFL is one of the tenants of the building.",
      "Officials, however, noted that it\u2019s still early in the investigation and a motive remains unclear.",
      "Here's everything we know about the victims.",
      "Wesley LePatner",
      "Blackstone identified one of the slain victims as Wesley LePatner. She joined Blackstone in 2014 after spending over a decade at Goldman Sachs. LePatner, 43, was the senior managing director and also a member of Blackstone real estate\u2019s investment committee, according to the company\u2019s website.",

      "\"There are no right words for this unfathomable moment of pain and loss,\" a representative for the school said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The school said she \"made the world \u2014 and all of the institutions she touched, including the Heschel School \u2014 a better place.\"",
      "\"We are all diminished today by her absence,\" the statement read.",
      "Didarul Islam",
      "Didarul Islam, a 36-year-old immigrant from Bangladesh, was hailed as a hero who \u201cmade the ultimate sacrifice.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was doing the job that we asked him to do,\u201d Tisch said at a news conference Monday night. \u201cHe put himself in harm\u2019s way.\u201d",
      "Islam had been with the NYPD for nearly four years, assigned to the 47th Precinct in the Bronx. He was working off-duty as a security guard when he was shot.",
      "\u201cHe was doing what he does best and all members of the police department carry out,\u201d Mayor Eric Adams said. \u201cHe was saving lives. He was protecting New Yorkers.\u201d",
      "Tisch said Islam was the father of two young boys and was expecting a third child with his wife. Adams said he told Islam's family that \"he was a hero, and we admire him for putting his life on the line.\"",
      "His cousin said Islam was a \"very pious person\" who would regularly attend the mosque for worship.",
      "\"He is very nice guy, and his behavior is very good,\" Muhammad Mainul Islam told NBC New York. \"I really miss him.\"",
      "Aland Etienne",
      "The 32BJ Service Employees International Union remembered Aland Etienne, 46, as \"a dedicated security officer who took his job duties extremely seriously.\"",
      "\"This tragedy speaks to the sacrifice of security officers who risk their lives every day to keep New Yorkers and our buildings safe,\" Manny Pastreich, president of 32BJ SEIU, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\"Every time a security officer puts on their uniform, they put their lives on the line. Their contributions to our city are essential, though often unappreciated,\" he said.",
      "Pastreich called Etienne \"a New York hero.\"",
      "Rudin Management employee",

      "Superheroes are flying high again at the movies. Marvel\u2019s \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d and rival DC\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d ruled the box office this past weekend, giving the genre a much-needed jolt for audiences and corporate executives alike.",
      "While both movies are bonafide summer hits, they\u2019re supporting players in the blockbuster story this year \u2014 a divergence from recent years when superhero flicks, particularly from Disney\u2019s Marvel Studios, would seize most of the spotlight.",
      "\u201cYou have so many movies out there this summer, all competing for the hearts and minds and wallets of the audience,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.",
      "Many moviegoers are also paying more money to see major releases on the biggest, most cutting-edge screens such as IMAX's.",
      "Universal\u2019s \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d Apple and Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cF1 The Movie\u201d and DreamWorks Animation\u2019s \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d have racked up big bucks this season. And it all kicked off with a record-breaking Memorial Day weekend led by Paramount\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 The Final Reckoning\u201d and Disney\u2019s \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d remake. (Universal and DreamWorks Animation share a parent company with NBC News.) \u201cThe Naked Gun,\u201d \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d and \u201cWeapons\u201d are on the way in August.",
      "The box office is on track to outpace last year, which suffered from lingering effects of production delays triggered by the 2023 actors\u2019 and writers\u2019 strikes. The tally to this point is $5.2 billion, ahead of $4.6 billion during the same period last year, according to Comscore. Dergarabedian said the year\u2019s total could reach $9.5 billion, which would make 2025 the best frame since before the pandemic, when domestic grosses would consistently top $10 billion. There\u2019s hope for the back half of the year, with much-anticipated films like \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d and \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d on the slate.",
      "But so far, \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d is the only film this year to cross the $1 billion mark at the global box office, a benchmark several U.S.-produced movies would hit each year before the Covid pandemic started in early 2020. (Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d is close, grossing more than $955 million, according to data from Comscore.)",
      "The biggest superhero movies used to routinely break the billion-dollar barrier. Four of them, including Disney-Pixar\u2019s \u201cThe Incredibles 2,\u201d did it in 2018; another three cleared it in 2019. Marvel\u2019s last superhero film to surpass $1 billion was the R-rated \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d which came out last July and boasted the return of Hugh Jackman\u2019s fan-favorite Wolverine. Before that, it was \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\u201d in 2021. DC\u2019s last billion-dollar grosser was \u201cAquaman\u201d in 2018.",
      "\u201cTo get to a billion dollars is a huge deal,\u201d said Dergarabedian. \u201cWhen you get up into the $800 million range globally, to get to the finish line and cross over to a billion, it\u2019s like trying to break the sound barrier.\u201d",
      "While $1 billion for \u201cThe Fantastic Four\u201d might be too far for even the stretchy Mister Fantastic to reach, the movie\u2019s $218 million global opening is nonetheless a win for Marvel. Previous Marvel releases this year, \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u201d which was released in February and grossed $409 million worldwide, and \u201cThunderbolts,\u201d which grossed $378 million off its May release, were disappointments at the box office.",
      "\u201cSuperman\u201d \u2014 which was directed by James Gunn, who helmed the lucrative \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d trilogy for Marvel \u2014 has already topped $500 million worldwide, according to data from Comscore. Like \u201cFantastic Four,\u201d it won critical praise \u2014 and audiences actually liked it.",
      "\u201cThere is no superhero fatigue,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cIt\u2019s bad movie fatigue.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s been a rough stretch for both Marvel and DC. DC has suffered more outright flops recently \u2014 \u201cThe Flash,\u201d \u201cShazam: Fury of the Gods\u201d and \u201cAquaman: The Lost Kingdom\u201d all underwhelmed in 2023 \u2014 pushing Warner Bros. to hire Gunn from Marvel to revitalize the brand. Marvel, though, has suffered from a dilution of its heroic sagas across theatrical releases and streaming \u2014 something even Disney CEO Bob Iger acknowledged in late 2023. He also warned that the industry might have gotten too accustomed to astronomical grosses.",
      "\u201cI mean, we got to the point where if a film didn\u2019t do a billion dollars in global box office, we were disappointed,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s an unbelievably high standard and I think we have to get more realistic.\u201d",
      "While those kinds of grosses are becoming rarer, Hollywood is still going big on marquee releases. Indeed, the hero of the summer may not be Sue Storm or Superman \u2014 it could be IMAX.",
      "Large-screen IMAX showings accounted for 20% or more of the opening weekend domestic box office revenue for \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 The Final Reckoning,\u201d \u201cF1: The Movie\u201d and \u201cSinners,\u201d the company said.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to going out to the movies, especially for the bigger than life blockbusters like \u2018Mission: Impossible,\u2019 people really want to see those on the biggest screen possible,\u201d said Dergarabedian.",
      "A record eight consecutive movies released on IMAX screens this year were filmed and edited with the format in mind, including \u201cSuperman\u201d and \u201cFantastic Four,\u201d according to IMAX. CEO Rich Gelfond has said he expects the company to clear $1.2 billion at the global box office this year.",
      "\u201cI think people recognize it\u2019s a premium experience, and they\u2019re willing to pay for it,\u201d Gelfond said in IMAX\u2019s earnings call this month."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Democratic leaders can\u2019t stop talking about releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files \u2014 the rare issue that\u2019s driven a wedge between Donald Trump and his MAGA base and been a nagging nuisance for GOP leaders for weeks.",
      "But while most Democrats think it\u2019s win-win for the party to keep a divisive issue for Republicans at the forefront, not all agree. Some Democrats say the Epstein saga is an unwelcome distraction that\u2019s diverting attention away from Trump\u2019s \"big, beautiful bill,\" which they warn will cause millions of Americans to lose health care and food assistance.",
      "Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Education and the Workforce Committee, went so far as to suggest Republicans deliberately drummed up the Epstein issue \u2014 just as Congress departs for its long, summer recess \u2014 to avoid dealing back home with the political fallout from Trump's unpopular law.",
      "\u201cRepublicans took away people\u2019s health care, took away their nutrition benefits to cut taxes for the wealthy and ran up $3 trillion in debt. And so they\u2019re getting people to talk about Epstein so that people won\u2019t find it out. \u2026 Any discussion about Epstein diverts attention from what we ought to be talking about,\u201d Scott said in a recent interview.",
      "To the contrary, Republican leadership and Trump himself have been eager to set the Epstein issue aside. But Scott\u2019s theory isn\u2019t entirely off-base, according to one GOP official working on congressional campaigns. Though the Epstein saga is proving all-consuming, it is a welcome distraction \u2014 for now \u2014 for some Republicans hoping to avoid discussing the megabill\u2019s cuts, the GOP source said.",
      "\"We need to get them to release the files so people can stop talking about it and then get back to the message,\u201d said Scott, whose state is home to nearly 1.8 million Medicaid and children's health program enrollees. \u201cThe entire August recess needs to be: They\u2019re taking your health care, whether you\u2019re on Medicaid or not. They\u2019re adversely affecting your health care. They\u2019re taking your nutrition benefits.\u201d",
      "Several other Democrats agreed.",
      "\u201cClearly it\u2019s a distraction,\u201d Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., told NBC when asked if it was a mistake to put Epstein front and center. \u201cI\u2019m much more concerned about more substantial things like cuts in Medicaid and now coming up in September, not shutting the government down. I mean, there\u2019s so much more, I think, more impactful at this point, for me.\u201d",
      "Asked about Democrats rushing to play up the Epstein matter,  Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., replied, \"What I'm doing in Virginia in August is I'm going to talk about Medicaid and Medicare and SNAP.\"",
      "And Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said on Monday: \u201cThe most important thing for us to communicate to Americans is that Republicans voted for a bill that is going to close rural hospitals and senior centers. Epstein is also a legitimate concern. But I, overwhelmingly, prioritize the reconciliation bill.\u201d",
      "Most Democrats egg on Epstein feud",
      "The majority of congressional Democrats are relishing the Epstein moment, however. The Republican Party has spent weeks bitterly divided over whether to release the remaining files and records related to the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into Epstein, the financier and convicted sex offender who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.",
      "Democrats say the issue highlights the GOP\u2019s hypocrisy about transparency in the Epstein matter \u2014 Trump and many MAGA figures had called for more disclosure on Epstein during the last campaign but now Trump is failing to deliver on the files. Democrats also have hammered home that Trump socialized with Epstein, though Trump said Monday he ended his friendship with him and threw him out of his private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, many years ago, after the financier \"stole\" his workers.",
      "\u201cJeffrey Epstein was a friend of Donald Trump. Jeffrey Epstein was arrested during the Trump administration. Jeffrey Epstein was detained during the Trump administration. Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide during the Trump administration,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said at a news conference last week.",
      "Speaking to reporters two days later, Jeffries was still talking about Epstein, arguing that Democrats can talk about both Epstein and the negative impacts of what he calls Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, ugly bill.\u201d He even suggested the two seemingly disparate issues are related, saying Republicans are protecting the \u201clifestyles of the rich and shameless, even if that includes pedophiles.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe reality is it\u2019s all connected from the standpoint of Donald Trump, his administration and House Republicans,\u201d Jeffries replied when asked if Democrats focusing so much attention on Epstein is taking away from their attacks on the GOP megabill. \u201cRepublicans are focused on their billionaire donors. That was the centerpiece of the one big, ugly bill and it\u2019s what explains Republican refusal to release the Epstein files.\u201d",
      "'We're winning'",
      "During the House\u2019s final workweek before the August recess, Democrats appeared laser-focused on the Epstein controversy. They forced vote after vote during committee meetings to try to compel the Justice Department to release the Epstein files. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was forced to recess the House one day early because of Democrats\u2019 efforts on Epstein.",
      "Meanwhile, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who\u2019s working closely with Republican Rep. Thomas Massie on a discharge petition to force a floor vote on the matter, talked up the Epstein files in an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and to a gathering of Democratic mayors in Cleveland on Friday.",
      "\u201cThis is effective. We\u2019re fighting,\u201d Khanna said in an interview with NBC News before the Friday event, adding that the issue has yielded more calls and emails to his office than any other in his nine years in Congress.",
      "\u201cAnd a lot of times, you know, they were like, Democrats are not fighting enough, right? And not standing up enough. This is the first time since, I would say, November, that we\u2019re winning. I mean, we forced the Republican speaker to shut down his own agenda a week early.\u201d",
      "Khanna also drew a comparison to the 2024 election, in which Republicans hammered then-Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democratic candidates on the issues of transgender people participating in sports, as well as their use of preferred pronouns. Trump and others have referred to those as \u201c90-10\u201d issues, meaning that an overwhelming majority of voters are in agreement with Republicans.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be on the 90-10 side of an issue, as opposed to the other way around, which we were for some of the 2024 campaign,\u201d Khanna told NBC News.",
      "With the Epstein issue, he continued, \u201cwe are now on the side of transparency. We\u2019re now on the side of populism. ... And it\u2019s hard to say we\u2019re partisan, because you could just cite Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon.\u201d",
      "Changing the subject",
      "Trump and his top aides have been eager to change the subject from the Epstein episode, even as some of his top administration officials do things that drive more Epstein headlines. It all started earlier this month when the DOJ and FBI published a two-page memo stating that Epstein had taken his own life in prison and that their review \u201crevealed no incriminating \u2018client list\u2019\u201d as well as no credible evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent individuals.",
      "Many of Trump\u2019s MAGA allies were incredulous at the memo\u2019s findings, putting some of Trump\u2019s top law enforcement officials in the hot seat. On July 18, Attorney General Pam Bondi filed a motion to unseal grand jury transcripts related to Jeffrey Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s criminal case in Manhattan federal court.",
      "And on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche wrapped up two days of meetings with Maxwell, who is serving out a 20-year sentence after being found guilty of sex trafficking minors.",
      "Though Trump and his supporters drove conspiracy theories about Epstein during his campaign, Republicans have also pointed out that Democrats could have released the files during the Biden administration but chose not to. Speaker Johnson accused Democrats of trying to \u201cweaponize\u201d the issue. \u201cDemocrats said nothing and did nothing, absolutely nothing, about bringing transparency for the entire four years of the Biden presidency,\u201d he said last week.",
      "But Democrats have called that claim bogus. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters he first called for the release of the Epstein files in 2019 \u2014 when Trump was president."

    "story": [
      "Last summer, Chris Paul was, like many Southern Californians, curious about the new Inglewood arena that the Los Angeles Clippers were only weeks away from opening.",
      "Unlike most locals, however, Paul had been one of the best players in the NBA while playing for the Clippers from 2011-17. And although he was about to play for the San Antonio Spurs, he still knew well the new arena\u2019s ultimate tour guide: Steve Ballmer, the Clippers\u2019 owner, who showed the point guard around.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Damn, I wonder what the locker room looks like?\u2019\u201d Paul said.",
      "One year later, Paul walked back into the locker room before his introduction Monday as the Clippers\u2019 latest offseason signing and took note of the differences between his two eras playing for the franchise. New arena, new logo and this: During his first stint, he headlined a team of young, athletic upstarts challenging the league\u2019s entrenched title contenders. Next season, the 40-year-old Paul and the Clippers will still be pursuing their first NBA championship \u2014 but this time behind aspirations that hinge on the NBA\u2019s oldest roster.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of gratitude or whatnot to still get a chance to play at this age,\u201d Paul said.",
      "The NBA has never been more of a young man\u2019s league. Last season\u2019s average age was 26.3 years, and tireless young legs propelled both Oklahoma City and Indiana to June\u2019s NBA Finals. Oklahoma City made the finals with an average age of 25.6 years, the second-youngest team to reach the championship round in the previous 70 years. And when the Thunder won the championship, they were the youngest to do so since 1977.",
      "After the Clippers\u2019 last season ended in the first round, the team\u2019s top basketball executive, Lawrence Frank, described adding youth and athleticism as a priority.",
      "Yet the Clippers have since become one of the NBA\u2019s most fascinating teams by eschewing such youth, betting that experience will give them a puncher\u2019s chance.",
      "The team expects to play a nine-man rotation, Frank said this month, but could credibly go 11 deep. The average age of those 11 is more than 33 years old, which Yahoo Sports determined would be a year older than the previous oldest roster in NBA history.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s age? It\u2019s just a number, right?\u201d Frank joked with reporters earlier this month.",
      "At 40, Paul might be an outlier as the NBA\u2019s second-oldest active player, behind only LeBron James, but he fits right into an offseason that has seen the team sign 37-year-old center Brook Lopez, retain 37-year-old do-everything forward Nicolas Batum, re-sign 36-year-old guard James Harden and sign 32-year-old former All-Star guard Bradley Beal. Of the team\u2019s 11 players who are largely expected to earn regular playing time, just three \u2014 Ivica Zubac, Derrick Jones Jr. and offseason acquisition John Collins, all of whom will be 28 when the season begins \u2014 are under 30.",
      "\u201cThe goal is to get this team as good as we possibly can get it, regardless of age, and everyone\u2019s entitled to the judgments they want to make on the group,\u201d Frank said last week, after the signing of Paul. \u201cWe\u2019re super excited about the group. I think part of the things that, with age, typically, people worry about [is] increased chance for injury. That\u2019s why we lean into the depth.\u201d",
      "The Clippers, clearly, see their experience as a strength. Yet there is a reason only the 2010-11 Dallas Mavericks (31.6 years) and 1997-98 Chicago Bulls (32.1 years) have won NBA titles with an average age older than 31. Deep playoff runs require skill, which the Clippers undoubtedly possess, but also durability and stamina, and no one can foresee what next season holds for Beal, who has played 196 out of a possible 328 games his past four seasons, or Kawhi Leonard, who has played 157.",
      "Yet when asked about the team\u2019s age, Frank immediately recited that Paul and Lopez, the Clippers\u2019 oldest players, had started a combined 162 out of 164 possible games just last season.",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s not like these guys were productive three years ago, or four years ago, they were productive players last year,\u201d Frank said.",
      "The Clippers aren\u2019t the only contender to believe it needed more seasoning. Houston was one of last season\u2019s biggest success stories, producing the Western Conference\u2019s second-best record despite owning the league\u2019s ninth-youngest roster, with an average age, by minutes played, of 25.2. Yet after losing in the playoffs\u2019 first round, Houston decided it needed Kevin Durant, who\u2019ll turn 37 before the season starts, to realize its potential.",
      "Going old in a league that skews young wasn\u2019t the Clippers\u2019 master plan. In the short term, and by Frank\u2019s admission, landing Lopez as a free agent was no guarantee, Beal wasn\u2019t initially expected to be available \u2014 becoming a free agent only after Phoenix bought his contract to the tune of $96 million \u2014 and signing Paul required the starter for virtually his entire two-decade career to accept a role as a reserve. The Clippers made those moves, ultimately, because they allowed the team to improve, regardless of age, while still being \u201cdisciplined to our plan,\u201d Frank said.",
      "That long-term plan, as rival executives view it, has seen the team unwilling to extend pricey contracts past 2026, a priority that will wipe clean virtually the Clippers\u2019 entire current payroll within two seasons. It\u2019s just the type of blank slate, in an attractive market like Los Angeles, that might woo a disgruntled star seeking a trade, or a big-name free agent.",
      "Most teams would clear their books and transition for the future by filling the team with low-cost, younger players. Yet the Clippers have not begun a youth movement for a variety of reasons. One is resources: A 2019 trade with Oklahoma City hamstrung the number of available first-round picks the Clippers could use to theoretically rebuild their roster through the draft. As a workaround, the Clippers have tried giving second chances to young, talented players who had burned through their welcome with previous teams for either on-court or legal reasons, yet none has panned out.",
      "Philosophy has also been a significant factor in why the Clippers have owned the league\u2019s oldest roster each of the past three seasons. Ballmer, the owner and former Microsoft chief executive, does not believe that building a roster to intentionally lose its way to a top draft pick is good for business, or retaining fans in a city already saturated by its rival.",
      "\u201cEach year we are going to put the best possible team we can, while staying disciplined to our plan, to give ourselves and give our team and give our fans the best possible experience of a team that\u2019s trying to compete at the highest level,\u201d Frank said.",
      "That was an attractive enough pitch for Paul, who wanted not only to chase a first championship in his 21st season, but to do so while living in the same city as his wife and children for the first time since he last left the Clippers, in 2017.",
      "\u201cTell you the truth, my wife and my kids probably tired of me already,\u201d Paul said.",
      "Paul spoke with a broad smile all afternoon Monday when talking about his return to the franchise. But before he could exit a reception celebrating his reunion, one of the estimated 650 fans who had packed a court inside Intuit Dome spoke up, catching his attention.",
      "Sitting a few rows back from a raised stage where Paul sat, the fan told Paul what had been said about the team\u2019s offseason moves: that the team\u2019s roster now included so many older 30-or-older players that they were being called \u201cuncs,\u201d or uncles.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely an \u2018unc,\u2019\u201d Paul said. \u201cI think we got a great mix of young guys, older guys and whatnot. And it\u2019s up to us to figure it out.\u201d"

      "When people think of wearables, a few names usually come up: Apple Watch, Oura Ring, Fitbit, Garmin. Whoop is usually not on that list: it\u2019s a smaller brand that appeals to a specific crowd as opposed to the Apple Watch and Fitbit users of the world.",
      "And yet, most people, myself included, will inevitably compare it to an Apple Watch. After all, most people will wear one, not both.

      "Whoop One and Whoop Peak use the same physical Whoop band, but Whoop Peak users have more software features in the app. Whoop Life uses the Whoop MG (Medical Grade) band, which has a more advanced sensor with ECG and AFib detection.",
      "Apple sells the Apple Watch SE ($249), Apple Watch Series 10 ($399) and Apple Watch Ultra 2 ($799). I wore the Apple Watch Series 10 for this comparison, as it is the closest direct competitor to the Whoop, in my view.",
      "Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.",
      "My experience using Whoop and Apple Watch",
      "Whoop and Apple Watch are very different devices for very different people. Both are comfortable to wear and give interesting and mostly accurate health, sleep and fitness insights. But the experience of using them is wildly different, and highlights how they are meant for different kinds of people. Below are some of the key differences between the two.",
      "Whoop is essentially a screenless watch band. The included band is made of a flexible, comfortable yarn, and the sensor itself attaches to the band with a titanium clasp. It\u2019s comfortable, subtle and easy to forget when you are wearing it, plus it looks relatively normal in more formal settings (unlike some smartwatches). The clasp can be a little finicky when taking the Whoop on and off your wrist. Unlike most other wearables, you can wear the Whoop MG (or 5.0) on your bicep using the Whoop Bicep Band, but it hasn\u2019t been released at the time of writing this comparison.",
      "The Whoop MG gets up to 14 days of battery life, which is excellent. This made it easy to forget I was wearing it most of the time.",
      "You charge the Whoop MG using the wireless charging puck, which slides and clicks into place on top of the clasp. It takes about two hours to fully charge, which is pretty slow. You can, however, keep wearing the Whoop MG while it\u2019s charging, though this makes it much heavier and bulkier. I think you\u2019ll either love the wireless charging puck or hate it. One the one hand: it means you never have to take off your Whoop, even to charge. On the other hand, it\u2019s slow, feels  bulky on your wrist and is easier to lose compared to a more standard wireless charging station.",
      "You\u2019re probably familiar with the Apple Watch, and the Series 10 is similar to models before it. It\u2019s thinner and lighter than the Apple Watch Series 9, but ekes out more screen space by reaching further into the edges of the case. It\u2019s very comfortable to wear daily, and you can choose from dozens of bands to maximize comfort or better fit the occasion.",
      "Improvements over the Series 9 include a brighter screen that is easier to see at off-angles and faster charging \u2014 up to 80% charge in 30 minutes (or 100% in an hour). Total battery life is still about 18 hours, though.",
      "My take: This is mostly about battery life and whether you want a screen or not. I barely need to think about battery life with the Whoop MG, and charging is relatively flexible. The Apple Watch needs to be charged almost daily, but it\u2019s a fully-featured smartwatch, with all the features that entails.",
      "Day-to-day",
      "Whoop",
      "Using the Whoop MG feels like a middle ground between the mostly passive Oura Ring ($349) and the arguably over-active Ultrahuman Ring ($349). It offers some notifications, like reminders about tonight\u2019s optimal bedtime for ideal recovery, but it leaves most control in your hands to open the app and explore your data when you want to, not when the app tells you to. Like the Oura Ring, the Whoop MG has automatic workout detection, though you can also open up the app to manually start and stop workouts as they happen.",
      "Apple",
      "An Apple Watch can be as active or as passive as you want it to be. You can have all your smartphone notifications synced, and get pings every time you get a text, emails or app notification. You can also turn everything off, and treat it as a watch that\u2019s also a fitness and sleep tracker \u2014 it\u2019s up to you.",
      "It\u2019s easy to start and stop workouts on the Apple Watch because it has a screen \u2014 you don\u2019t need to pull out your phone. It also automatically detects some workouts, but will prompt you on screen when it does, which makes it easier to know when to start a workout yourself.",
      "My take: I think the Apple Watch is more flexible here. With a couple of minutes in its setting menu, you can make it as hands on or as hands off as you want. Whoop is a more focused product than the Apple Watch, so its day-to-day experience is more one-size-fits-all.",
      "Whoop",
      "My Whoop MG tracked health, sleep and fitness data relatively accurately, and provided a lot more information to dig into than the Apple Watch in most cases, for better or worse.",
      "Sleep data between the Whoop MG and the Apple Watch Series 10 was similar, but the Whoop showed my sleep on a more granular level than the Apple Watch, with exact timings on wake windows and sleep stages.",
      "The Whoop MG does have automatic workout detection, but like the Oura Ring, I found myself starting and stopping workouts manually through the app. After my month of testing, I realized that while the automatic tracking is okay, I didn\u2019t trust it enough to risk not logging a workout or having inaccurate data about my runs or gym time.",
      "Apple",
      "The Apple Watch similarly tracks sleep, health and fitness data, but has more convenient exercise tracking than Whoop, especially outdoors. It has its own GPS built-in, so its outdoor walk, run and cycling workouts tend to be slightly (or significantly) more accurate than the Whoop, depending on the environment. It also has more detailed stats for runners like cadence, stride length and more.",
      "Again, because it has a screen, it\u2019s easier to start and stop workouts on the Apple Watch. That screen is also useful for confirming or denying its automatic workout detection.",
      "My take: Both wearables track similar things. Whoop has the edge when it comes to sleep and health tracking, while Apple is easier and more accurate for exercise tracking.",
      "Metrics and analysis",
      "This is where things get interesting, and where the big differences between the Apple Watch and the Whoop MG reveal themselves.",
      "Whoop",
      "Whoop has three key metrics placed front and center on the Home tab: sleep, recovery and strain. Sleep is pretty self-explanatory, but recovery and strain are impressive but can be a bit confusing. Whoop assigns a strain score to all of your activities, and charts your strain across days, weeks and months. Strain is scored between zero and 21, which is very specific but can take some mental gymnastics when every other brand is using scales of zero to 10 or zero to 100. The specificity around strain and recovery was interesting to look at, but didn\u2019t feel too different from easy to understand features like Training Readiness and Training Status on some Garmin watches.",
      "The Health tab is where you will find most of the new features compared to the previous Whoop 4.0, and this is where I have the most mixed feelings.",
      "Clicking on the Health tab pulls up a slew of other metrics. You can track your respiratory rate, blood oxygen, resting heart rate, heart rate variability and skin temperature. You can see trends in each overtime, from weeks to months, similar to my experience using the Oura Ring 4.",
      "But the biggest new feature is Healthspan. In the essay-length description of the feature on the Whoop app, Whoop calls Healthspan \u201cthe number of years you live in good health.\u201d It gives two measurements: your Whoop Age and your Pace of Aging. Both, but mostly Pace of Aging, fills me with dread and anxiety in a way no other wearable I\u2019ve tested has. I could argue this says more about my relationship with mortality than Whoop, but hear me out.",
      "Pace of Aging \u201creflects how quickly your Whoop Age is changing,\u201d says Whoop in its app. It charts it on a scale from -1.0x to 3.0x, \u201clike a speedometer.\u201d Over 1.0x? Your Whoop Age is increasing faster than your chronological age.",
      "Your Pace of Aging changes weekly, and Whoop would notify me every week that it changed. During my entire test period, my Whoop Age was younger than my actual age (likely a reflection of my fitness activity), but my Pace of Aging was consistently fast, usually at 1.4x. Whoop eventually explained that my Whoop Age and Pace of Aging are increasing because of my sleep consistency, and to \u201ckeep an eye on this trend to stay on track\u201d or else my Whoop Age may increase if \u201cyou keep up with your current behaviors.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s the thing: I know why I get between five and 6.5 hours of interrupted sleep every night: it\u2019s because I live in a one bedroom and have a wonderful one year old. I would love to sleep eight hours uninterrupted every night, but most new parents know that that is a pipe dream. So Whoop telling me that my interrupted sleep is speeding up my aging was just frustrating.",
      "It\u2019s important to remember that Whoop Age and Whoop Pace of Aging ultimately cannot truly tell you how fast you are aging. It\u2019s far too complex a topic for Whoop, or any wearable, to track. Aging is affected by a myriad of factors Whoop either isn\u2019t including or can\u2019t track, including diet, lifestyle, genetics, mental health and underlying medical conditions, to name a few.",
      "Healthspan is a buzzy feature that made me open the Whoop app more than usual. But I don\u2019t think a feature that fills me with dread and anxiety is a win, especially one that is more of a suggestion than objective truth.",
      "Apple",
      "By comparison, metrics and analysis on the Apple Watch are much more grounded and reserved \u2014 it doesn\u2019t go anywhere near fitness age or aging with its data. It\u2019s solely focused on giving you your sleep, health and fitness data, without much suggestion or analysis.",
      "Metrics are spread across two apps: Apple Health and Apple Fitness. Apple Fitness shows you all your workouts, and has features like Training Load and Trends that chart things like exercise frequency, move goals, steps, pace and cardio fitness over time. Apple Health has the Vitals feature, which tracks your overnight heart rate, respiratory rate, wrist temperature and sleep duration, and can tell you when your stats are out of normal range, indicating potential illness. Whoop does this too, but unfortunately for my testing (and fortunately for my health), I did not get sick during this comparison, so I couldn\u2019t test this feature.",
      "My take: Whoop MG gives you more metrics and analysis to look at than the Apple Watch. That\u2019s arguably the whole point of getting the Whoop: detailed strain, recovery and health data. My problem is that I either didn\u2019t find the analysis all that useful or it stressed me out (Healthspan). Apple Watch takes a \u201cjust the facts\u201d approach, with little to no analysis (outside of Vitals), just detailed metrics you can interpret on your own.",
      "Value",
      "My take: Normally I wouldn\u2019t harp on value too much: everyone has their own budget, and knows what they can and can\u2019t afford. But the Whoop subscription model is expensive, even compared to a premium product like the Apple Watch Series 10.",
      "A full-priced Series 10 is $399 (though it\u2019s often on sale for less). The lowest priced Whoop subscription is $199 a year. That means after just two years of use, the Whoop starts becoming more expensive than the Series 10.",
      "Everyone I know uses their wearables for four or five years. Four years of Whoop Life, the version I tested, is $1436. That\u2019s more than basically every wearable on the market.",
      "Whoop vs Apple Watch: The final verdict",
      "Whoop is a much more specific product than the Apple Watch \u2014 it\u2019s for a niche crowd who want a tracker with no screen, in-depth analysis and excellent battery life. If that sounds like you, give the Whoop a try \u2014 the brand has a one month free trial (though the trial does not include Healthspan features).",
      "Whoop is not for me, though. If I am wearing something on my wrist, I want it to have a screen so I can use my phone less. The Apple Watch Series 10 is one of the best wearables for anyone with an iPhone, as long as you don\u2019t mind charging it daily. In the long run, it\u2019s also much cheaper than any Whoop subscription.",
      "Why trust NBC Select?",
      "I am a reporter at NBC Select who covers technology and fitness including recent stories on smartwatches, running shoes, workout earbuds and more. I tested the Whoop MG for a month alongside the Apple Watch Series 10. I test wearables regularly, and tested the Whoop 4.0 in years past.",

      "The actual price tag? Maron says it cost him around $50,000 to use just one minute of the song.",
      "His original plan was to use the entire song until he realized he wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it.",
      "Maron said he went to Jack Antonoff, Swift\u2019s longtime friend and producer, to see if there were any strings he could pull.",
      "\u201cI know Jack Antonoff enough to text him \u2014 and he\u2019s the co-(producer) on that song,\u201d Maron said.",

      "Following Antonoff\u2019s advice to get a proper approval from her team, the comedian told Vulture that he decided to just use one minute of the song.",
      "\u201cIf I would have gone over the minute, it would have been more money,\u201d Maron revealed.",
      "The biggest question is yet to be answered: Has the singer seen Maron's segment?",
      "\u201cI have no idea if Taylor Swift saw the bit,\u201d Maron said.",
      "When Swift's \"Bigger Than the Whole Sky\" was part of the 2022 album \"Midnights.\"",
      "The portion of the song Maron sings describes loss: \u201cGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye / You were bigger than the whole sky / You were more than just a short time,\" he sings, in part. At the time of its release, many listeners used the song to process their miscarriages.",
      "Maron's 2023 HBO special, \"From Bleak to Dark,\" was about the sudden death of his partner, director Lynn Shelton. Shelton died in 2020 of a previously undiagnosed blood disorder. She was 54.",
      "Maron said in a statement that this upcoming special is some of the \"best work\" he's done."

      "More than a decade before the Black Sabbath frontman\u2019s family confirmed his death at the age of 76 on July 22, Osbourne had been asked his thoughts on funeral plans.",
      "In a Dear Ozzy column for The Times in 2011, one person asked if it was \u201ctoo morbid to plan your own funeral? Or is it a thoughtful gift for your surviving relatives?\u201d",
      "Osbourne's reply indicated that he would very much like it to be a joyful moment.",
      "\u201cI honestly don\u2019t care what they play at my funeral; they can put on a medley of Justin Bieber, Susan Boyle and We Are the Diddymen if it makes \u2019em happy,\u201d Osbourne replied, before noting, \u201cbut I do want to make sure it\u2019s a celebration, not a mope-fest.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d also like some pranks: maybe the sound of knocking inside the coffin; or a video of me asking my doctor for a second opinion on his diagnosis of \u2018death,\u2019\u201d the rock star continued. \u201cThere\u2019ll be no harping on the bad times.\u201d",
      "Answering the person, he continued, \u201cSo to answer your question, yes, a bit of planning is the right thing to do for the family you leave behind.\u201d",
      "He noted that \u201cit\u2019s worth remembering that a lot of people see nothing but misery their whole lives. So by any measure, most of us in this country \u2014 especially rock stars like me \u2014 are very lucky.\u201d",
      "The Prince of Darkness, as he was nicknamed, concluded, \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t want my funeral to be sad. I want it to be a time to say \u2018thanks.\u2019\u201d",
      "Osbourne leaves behind wife Sharon Osbourne, six children and 10 grandkids.",
      "Members of his family released a statement following news of his death, stating, \u201cIt is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning. He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.\u201d",

You have no idea how I feel \u2014 thank you from the bottom of my heart,\u201d said the rock legend, according to The Associated Press. \u201cYou\u2019re all \u2026 special.

    "summary": "Why is Sydney Sweeney's new ad campaign with American Eagle sparking controversy? Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Sydney Sweeney's recent partnership with American Eagle Outfitters has generated substantial online criticism.",
      "The ad campaign, which focuses on the company\u2019s new line of denim products, is centered around the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans\" \u2014 and people have a lot to say about the slogan's messaging.",
      "Chatter surrounding the collaboration has added the brand to a growing list of companies experiencing \u201cmeme stock\u201d booms, CNBC reported, or a stock that gains popularity through social media. After the initiative debuted, shares of the company\u2019s stock jumped more than 4%.",
      "So, why are people talking about the ad? Here is everything you need to know.",
      "What do the Sydney Sweeney ads for American Eagle depict?",
      "In American Eagle\u2019s fall campaign, Sydney Sweeney shows off the company\u2019s latest collection of denim.",
      "Videos from the promotion focus on the \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cAnyone But You\u201d star's denim-clad body as she lounges with a puppy, fixes a car and buttons up a pair of over-sized jeans.",
      "\u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign\u2019s slogan booms at the end of each clip as a play on the words \u201cgenes\u201d and \u201cjeans.\u201d",
      "The ads play up the homophone \"good jeans\" and \"good genes.\"",
      "\u201cGenes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My genes are blue,\u201d Sweeney says in one ad as the camera pans her body while she buttons a pair of jeans.",
      "Another print ad spells out, \u201cSydney Sweeney has great genes,\u201d but crosses out the \u201cgenes\u201d and writes in \u201cjeans.\u201d",
      "The collection features over 200 fits of jeans and over 50 new styles. In the campaign announcement, President and Executive Creative Director at American Eagle explains Sweeney\u2019s role in the ad.",
      "\u201cWith Sydney Sweeney front and center, she brings the allure, and we add the flawless wardrobe for the winning combo of ease, attitude and a little mischief,\u201d the announcement reads.",
      "Why is the ad campaign causing controversy?",
      "The campaign has stirred up mixed opinions on the internet, raising questions about its intent and implications.",
      "For some, the campaign\u2019s central messaging about genes uphold outdated and harmful standards of beauty, and even promote eugenic ideals.",
      "Eugenics is an evolutionary theory aimed to select \u201cdesired heritable characteristics in order to improve future generations,\u201d according to Encyclopedia Britannica. The movement has a long history, but in the U.S., it historically used \"genetic superiority\" as justification for white supremacy.",
      "The ad\u2019s messaging surrounding \u201cgood genes\u201d feels like a wink to eugenic ideals.",
      "\u201cThem choosing \u2018Sydney Sweeney has great genes\u2019 was not an accident,\u201d one user said in a TikTok video that received over one million views. \u201cIt\u2019s a dog whistle towards the rise of people who are wanting to see more people who look like them everywhere.\u201d",
      "A representative for Sweeney declined to comment to NBC News. American Eagle did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Cheryl Overton, Chief Experience Officer at integrated marketing communications firm Cheryl Overton Communications, says context is important. The promotion \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum,\u201d she says. Instead, it occurs in \u201ca country actively grappling with social standards rooted in whiteness.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe subtext isn\u2019t imagined; it\u2019s rooted in centuries-old narrative about one archetype of beauty that is seen as genetically superior or \u2018aspirational,\u201d Overton tells TODAY.com.",
      "While the ad never references race, Hillary Herskowitz, CEO and Founder of H2 Marketing Group, tells TODAY.com there is \u201cno denying\u201d that the phrase \u201ccarries historical baggage.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you pair that kind of wordplay with a blond, blue-eyed actress, it can unintentionally reinforce narrow, Eurocentric beauty standards,\u201d she adds.",
      "Whether this implication is purposeful is up for debate.",
      "Overton says the messaging could be the result of a \u201cblind spot of a team lacking cultural fluency\u201d or a \u201cbrand looking actively to cull consumers who value diversity from its base.\u201d",
      "Herskowitz sees the ad as being designed to provoke a reaction.",
      "\u201cIntentional,\u201d Herskowitz says. \u201cThat line \u2014 \u2018good jeans\u2019 \u2014 is too perfectly constructed not to be. It was designed to be cheeky, playful and buzzworthy. The creative team knew exactly what they were doing.\"",
      "Adrienne Alexander, owner of the PR firm IPY Agency, points out the extensive process campaigns like this go through, and says multiple teams likely signed off on the language.",
      "\u201cCampaigns like this go through many hands, including creative, legal, PR, and brand strategy, so it\u2019s unlikely that no one flagged the potential issue. More likely, the team underestimated the reaction or saw it as a playful pun rather than a loaded phrase. Either way, the responsibility remains the same: if you spark a conversation, be prepared to own it and respond accordingly,\u201d she says.",
      "The ad has also garnered criticism for sexualizing Sweeney. Some say the ad\u2019s close-up shots of the actor seem to objectify her and cater to the male gaze.",
      "\u201cAre we selling jeans to women or selling women in jeans to men?\u201d one user commented on American Eagle\u2019s Instagram.",
      "The limited edition Sydney Jean, produced with Sweeney, has a butterfly motif on the back pocket representing domestic violence awareness, per a press release from the company, and the entirety of the purchase price will be donated to the Crisis Text Line.",
      "Marketing professor Melissa Murphy calls the juxtaposition of the sexual nature of the ads, plus the domestic violence tie-in, \"mismatched\" tonally.",
      "Some viewers have also pointed out that the ad feels reminiscent of a controversial Calvin Klein campaign from 1980 featuring a teenage Brooke Shields.",
      "\u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing,\u201d the then 15-year-old model said in the ad as the camera panned her entire body.",
      "The moment caused an uproar for holding sexual implications and taking advantage of the young star. Shields later spoke out about the moment, saying she was unaware of the ad\u2019s meaning.",
      "Like the Calvin Klein ad, which Klein once said put the company on the map, American Eagle has seen increased chatter following the campaign\u2019s debut.",
      "According to Herskowitz, controversy can \u201cdrive brand momentum.\u201d But was the controversy intentional?",
      "Murphy, doubts it, and so calls the ad campaign, and its lack of diversity, a \u201cmiss.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey should have done (the ad) with multiple people \u2014 that would definitely resonate better,\u201d she says. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t more, and this is just it, then that\u2019s not a good sign.\u201d"

      "\u201cI did what I could do, and that\u2019s all you can do. I\u2019ve come a lot further in the last four years than perhaps I could have bargained for,\u201d Cody said in a 2024 post-race interview. \u201cStarting from zero and trying to see how far I could get in half or a third of the time that everybody else has been training, just to do right by that kid in me that gave it up to go and pursue something else, which I had an incredible journey.\u201d",

      "\"One thing Jamie said to me that sticks with me whenever I go to set \u2014 the first thing I think about and will always keep with me \u2014 is that she said, 'Remember, when you go to your set, however you show up that day is the way that everyone else is going to feel on that set. So always bring a positive energy, positive mindset, positive attitude to the people that you work with,'\" she said.",

We started this show nearly six years ago, and Clay\u2019s become a dear friend, so there\u2019s an element of genuine sadness because these two characters will never interact anymore. In a way, though, that echoes Oscar\u2019s own vision of his future self with John being cut short so dramatically and abruptly.\""

      "What is Vince Gilligan\u2019s New Show About?",
      "While Apple TV+ is keeping tight-lipped about the exact plot, Gilligan has teased that this show is a psychological sci-fi drama set in a reimagined version of modern-day Albuquerque, where the world shifts drastically in the very first episode. The show won\u2019t revisit cartels or criminal empires, but it\u2019s still designed to mess with your mind (in the best way).",
      "Gilligan told Deadline the series will \u201cbend reality\u201d by exploring human nature through a character-driven, philosophical lens, likening the tone to \"The Twilight Zone.\" Expect a world that feels familiar but isn\u2019t quite right.",
      "And though it avoids the crime underbelly that defined his earlier work, longtime fans can still expect Gilligan\u2019s signature touches: moral tension, complex characters and flashes of dark, unexpected humor.",

      "\u201cSome of the stuff that audiences have loved about (Gilligan\u2019s) writing: really rich characters, playing with tropes and genres, injecting humor into very dark moments. In this new show, he pushes that to a limit that was both very thought-provoking and upsetting sometimes, and other times, so, so funny,\u201d she added.",
      "In another interview with The Hollywood Reporter, she revealed that Gilligan wrote the role specifically for her \u2014 and that it\u2019s \u201cextremely unlike anything I\u2019ve ever done before.\u201d The character, described as a \u201cdamaged but well-intentioned hero,\u201d offers a departure from her past work.",
      "Additional casting details are still under wraps, but the project is already reuniting Gilligan with several of his longtime collaborators both on and off screen. More familiar faces could still be on the way \u2014 and fans are definitely watching closely.",
      "Is There a Trailer?",
      "Yes, and it\u2019s as weird and wonderful as fans might hope.",
      "The first teaser for \"Pluribus,\" released on July 25, 2025, opens with a woman (not Seehorn) slowly licking donuts in what appears to be an office or factory setting.",

Just one day after she entered the world, Liberty Hospital posted a photo of the newborn when Richardson's nurses fell in love with her baby's name. The hospital is part of the University of Kansas Health System, which is the official health care provider for the Chiefs.",
      "\"We are so excited to announce the birth of the youngest Swiftie and newest member of The Kansas City Chiefs Red Kingdom!!\" reads the post, which has more than 17,000 likes and been covered by People, USA Today and more.",
      "\"Kelce Taylor is officially in her newborn era.\"",
      "Baby Dillon's full name is Kelce Taylor-Grace Dillon, the parents tell TODAY.com in an interview following their discharge from the hospital.",
      "Her first name, Kelce, is a reference to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, who's about to start his 13th season with the 2024 Super Bowl champs. Meanwhile, Taylor is a nod to 14-time Grammy winner Taylor Swift, who has become a Kansas City celebrity in her own right after she and Travis Kelce took their relationship public at Arrowhead Stadium in September 2023.",
      "Dillon, fittingly wearing a No. 87 jersey during the interview, says he's been a Kansas City Chiefs fan for 34 years. (To note, Dillon is 34.)",
      "\"If I was anything else, my dad probably would have disowned me,\" Dillon says.",
      "Growing up, Dillon was a major fan of longtime Chief Tony Gonzalez. He played tight end in middle school and in the local Pop Warner youth football program. Though Dillon eventually \u201cfell out of the love of playing the game,\" he says he never fell out of love with the game itself.",
      "He recalls witnessing Travis Kelce being drafted to the Chiefs in 2013 and how since then, he's become \"as good as we thought he was going to be.\" But Dillon admires Kelce for how he lives his life off the field, citing his organization Eighty-Seven & Running, which aims to provide resources to disadvantaged youth in Kansas City and his hometown of Cleveland Heights, Ohio.",
      "In other words, for Dillon and Richardson, Kelce is a name to be proud of.",
      "\"We felt like the name was appropriate because we would like her to grow up to have his spirit of helping others and making sure his community is better off when he leaves than when he got there,\" Dillon says.",
      "\"Give her some really great people to kind of emulate as she gets older, if she wants to,\" Richardson adds.",
      "The couple say they've never met another Kelce. But in the wake of the Facebook post's virality, Dillon says they've seen comments about similar baby name stories, such as a parent in Philadelphia who said they named their child Kelce Lane, after former Eagles center Jason Kelce and Lane Johnson.",
      "Richardson says they considered spelling their daughter's name the more traditional way, Kelsey. Dillon has two more children who also have five letter names that start with K, so following the spelling of Travis Kelce's last name \"fits a pattern,\" he says.",
      "As for comments from those who wonder if they know the \"real\" pronunciation of Travis Kelce's last name \u2014 which the NFL star's dad, Ed Kelce, clarified in 2023 was \"Kels\" \u2014 the couple are well aware.",
      "In fact, Kels is one of many possible nicknames they already have in mind \u2014 part of the reason they picked the name in the first place.",
      "\"We wanted to give her that opportunity as she gets older and kind of matures and decides whether or not she wants to go by Kelce or Kels, or even if she's more like tomboy-ish, she can go by KT,\" Richardson says. \"We wanted to give her lots of options with her name as she grows up and becomes her own person.\"",
      "Their daughter's middle name, Taylor-Grace, in true Swift fashion, contains another Easter egg, Dillon says.",
      "\"TG in the middle \u2014\u00a0Tony Gonzalez was my first favorite football player, so we kind of snuck that in there as well,\" he says.",
      "As for why they picked Taylor, Richardson says after learning more about the singer since her relationship with Travis Kelce began, she's become a fan.",
      "\"I really grew to love her as a human being, more than just the superstar that she is,\" Richardson says.",
      "She cites Swift's well-publicized philanthropy, including her donations to local charities during the \"Eras Tour\" and the $100,000 bonus checks she gave her truck drivers.",
      "\"I really wanted Kelce to have that ... be able to (say), 'Oh this is who I'm named after. Maybe that's a good person that I should look up to,'\" Richardson says.",
      "When it comes to the attention their baby's name has invited, Dillon says \"98% of the comments are positive.\" There's been some hate and even a little confusion that the baby was actually born to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. (\"I am flattered that people think my baby is Taylor Swift's baby,\" Richardson says with a laugh.)",
      "Some commenters have also asked the question: What if Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce break up?",
      "\"They're still two people at the top of their respective fields,\" Richardson says. \"So honestly, we didn't even think about it. It doesn't matter to us whether or not they break up. We just wanted to give her people to look up to.\""

      "Before one of its planes crashed just after takeoff last month, killing at least 260 people, Air India had been a symbol of the country\u2019s global rise.",
      "Only two years earlier, chief executive Campbell Wilson had inaugurated a brand-new Airbus A350, Air India\u2019s first, calling it \u201ca declaration of Indian aviation\u2019s resurgence on the world stage.\u201d",
      "The aircraft\u2019s delivery made headlines across the country, where the public cheered Air India\u2019s transformation from a neglected state-owned flagship carrier into a modern airline that its new owners, the Tata Group, hoped would become the world\u2019s biggest.",
      "Under the Indian conglomerate, which founded the airline in 1932  and bought it back in 2022 after it spent decades under government operation, Air India was making big moves, announcing a record order in 2023 of 470 aircraft valued at more than $70 billion.",
      "A year later, the airline said it had begun a $400 million retrofit of its legacy fleet, accelerating the upgrade by leasing jets from other airlines, including Delta.",
      "That momentum came to a grinding halt last month when a London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed seconds after takeoff in the northwestern Indian city of Ahmedabad, killing all but one of the 242 people aboard plus 19 others on the ground in one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "Air India has since been under immense pressure to answer for the crash, but bereaved families were left with more questions after investigators released a preliminary report this month that said the plane\u2019s fuel switches had been wrongly cut off, leading to speculation that one of the pilots might have done it accidentally or even intentionally.",
      "Indian investigators and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which is involved in the crash investigation as the aircraft is U.S.-made, said such conclusions were irresponsible.",
      "\u201cInvestigations of this magnitude take time,\u201d NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said, while India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau urged the public and the media to \u201crefrain from spreading premature narratives.\u201d",
      "But Indian commentators were already irate.",
      "\u201cWhy do this rumor mill mongering about possible problems with the pilot?\u201d Arnab Goswami, a firebrand anchor, said on his conservative Republic Media Network. \u201cSo that across the world the impression goes that Indian pilots cannot fly?\u201d",
      "Capt. C.S. Randhawa, a former pilot for Air India and the Indian air force, said the suggestion that one of the pilots may have crashed the plane deliberately has \u201cdemoralized the pilots in the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll pilots are up in arms, and it\u2019s not a good thing. The pilots have to fly with that mental attitude,\u201d Randhawa, who is currently the president of the Federation of Indian Pilots, told NBC News.",
      "The head of the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that the crash did not appear to have been caused by a mechanical issue with the Boeing fuel control unit. The final report is due next year.",
      "On top of the lack of clarity, some British families hoping to bury their loved ones said they had received the remains of the wrong people, according to the Daily Mail, which cited a lawyer representing them. The Indian foreign ministry said Wednesday that all remains were being handled with \u201cutmost professionalism\u201d and that it was working closely with the British side to address concerns.",
      "Air India was also warned last week by India\u2019s aviation regulator that it could face enforcement action over more than two dozen safety violations from this year and last year, Reuters reported, citing government notices. They include pilots not being given mandatory rest and poor compliance with simulator training requirements.",
      "The airline, which voluntarily disclosed the problems last month, said Friday that it would respond to the regulator and that it \u201cremains fully committed to ensuring the safety of its passengers and staff.\u201d",
      "Air India was already under enormous pressure to clean up its reputation after falling into disrepair during its nearly 70 years of government ownership. Its reform nevertheless aligned perfectly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s nationalist narrative of turning India into a global superpower.",
      "\u201cGiven its legacy, the brand remains synonymous with India,\u201d said Shelley Vishwajeet, a New Delhi-based aviation journalist and  author of \u201cThe IndiGo Story,\u201d a book about the Indian airline. He added that the cultural transformation within Air India \u201chas been a challenge\u201d for its new owners.",
      "Things moved quickly after the takeover by the Tata Group, which consolidated several airlines it controlled, including Vistara and Air Asia India, into two entities: the full-cost carrier Air India and its budget arm, Air India Express.",
      "Vistara, which was partly owned by Singapore Airlines, was particularly beloved by Indians, known for its modern planes and best-in-class customer experience. When it merged with Air India, travelers and crew hoped that Air India would be the true Vistara successor.",
      "But Air India has struggled to deliver change as fast as some had hoped.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re struggling with maintenance issues, disrepair issues, and all these things are taking time,\u201d Randhawa said."

      "But around 13 million years ago, one of them may have fallen prey to an even larger creature, a team of paleontologists in Colombia have discovered after examining bite marks in a fossilized bone of one of the fearsome birds.",
      "Publishing their findings in the peer-reviewed scientific journal \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team hypothesized that it was killed and eaten or consumed through scavenging by a medium sized caiman, a crocodile-like reptile.",
      "\u201cThis is a fascinating story of the interaction of two very iconic animals in the past,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Link, the study\u2019s lead author, told NBC News in an email Wednesday. \u201cWe actually found not only the first record of a terror bird in northern south America, but the tooth marks of a large caiman that has probably fed on it,\u201d he added.",
      "Terror bird fossils, which are rare, have mostly been identified in the southern part of the continent.",
      "While tooth marks are \u201cnot uncommon\u201d in the fossil record, it\u2019s \u201cexciting\u201d to find evidence that indicates an apex predator being hunted or scavenged by another, said Link, an associate professor of  biological sciences at the Los Andes University in Colombia.",
      "Writing in \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team said the teeth marks showed no signs of healing, suggesting that the attack was fatal.",
      "Based on the finding, they added that terror birds might have faced higher risk of being killed and eaten than previously expected.",
      "To identify the attacker, Link and his team scanned the fossil and analyzed the size, shape and spacing of the tooth marks. After comparing those marks with teeth of crocodyliforms from the region, they concluded that the trace maker was likely a juvenile caiman about 15 feet long.",
      "It remains \u201cvery difficult\u201d to know if the caiman ate the terror bird after killing it or whether it scavenged the carcass, Link said. If the bird was alive, it was likely attacked while drinking at a river, researchers wrote, and conversely, if it was dead, the caiman found and fed on its body near water.",
      "\u201cThis story will not be told completely as we have no further evidence to choose between these two hypotheses.\u201d Link said.",
      "The discovery challenges the assumption of \u201ca linear relation between predators feeding on herbivores feeding in plants,\u201d he added. \u201cThe food web is really much more complex.\u201d",
      "The lower part of the bird\u2019s left leg bone used in the study was unearthed in the renowned La Venta fossil beds of Colombia two decades ago by Cesar Perdomo, a local paleontologist."

      "At least 60% of liver cancers could be preventable, according to an analysis published Monday in The Lancet.",
      "Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the world, with around 870,000 cases in 2022. That\u2019s projected to increase to 1.52 million cases in 2050, the new report found, if no changes are made.",
      "The leading cause of liver cancer is viral infections, including the hepatitis B and C viruses. Hepatitis B infections \u2014 which are preventable with a vaccine \u2014 accounted for 39% of liver cancers in 2022. That\u2019s expected to fall slightly, to 36.9%, by 2025. Hepatitis C accounted for 29.1% of liver cancers in 2022 and is also projected to fall, to 25.9%, by 2050.",
      "The proportions of alcohol- and obesity-related liver cancers, however, are projected to rise in the next 25 years. Alcohol accounted for 18.8% of liver cancers in 2022, and that is expected to increase to 21.1% in 2050. The share of liver cancers caused by obesity-related disease is projected to increase from 8% to 10.8% by 2050 due to increasing rates of obesity, diabetes and high cholesterol and other metabolic risk factors.",
      "Dr. Hashem El-Serag, one of the report\u2019s co-authors and chair of the department of medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said the public usually thinks of alcohol as the biggest risk factor for liver cancer.",
      "\u201cI think for most people, if you say cirrhosis, they immediately think of a relative, of someone who was a heavy drinker,\u201d El-Serag said. \u201cI think the vast majority do not make the tie between MASLD, or fatty liver, and cirrhosis and liver cancer.\u201d",
      "MASLD, or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, affects about 25% of adults in the U.S. It\u2019s caused by a buildup of fat in the liver. About 5% of U.S. adults have a more severe form, called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can lead to scarring, or cirrhosis, of the liver, significantly increasing the risk of cancer.",
      "Excess alcohol consumption can also lead to cirrhosis.",
      "Liver cancer is still relatively rare in the United States, representing 2.1% of all new cancer diagnoses in 2025. The report estimated that by 2040, U.S. rates of MASLD could more than double, affecting more than 55% of adults.",
      "Detecting liver cancer risk factors",
      "Earlier detection and effective treatment plans for MASLD can reduce the risk of obesity-related liver cancer, El-Serag said. The most common treatment is weight loss. GLP-1 weight loss drugs, which include Ozempic and Wegovy, are promising, he said. (A clinical trial published in April found that Wegovy treated MASH in about two-thirds of patients.)",
      "However, people aren\u2019t screened for MASLD like they are for viral hepatitis, El-Serag said.",
      "Dr. Arun Jesudian, a hepatologist and the director of liver quality and inpatient liver services at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, said patients are tested for MASLD and/or MASH if they have elevated liver enzymes in their blood.",
      "Raising awareness about MASLD among both patients and doctors can lead to more effective testing and diagnosis, Jesudian said.",
      "\u201cI think then we need to make sure that providers who are interacting with these patients are looking at the liver disease component of metabolic syndrome,\u201d he said, referring to patients with a cluster of conditions including high blood sugar, high blood pressure and excess weight. \u201cSo checking liver enzymes, that they know how to assess for fibrosis, even based on these blood test scores.\u201d",
      "MASLD and MASH can often be asymptomatic, making self-detection more challenging.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s haphazard. Some people get tested. Others get suspected. Third, who knows?\u201d El-Serag said.",
      "Dr. Neehar Parikh, a hepatologist at the University of Michigan who specializes in liver cancer, said he is seeing more patients with MASLD as a driving factor for liver cancer.",
      "Patients with MASLD can develop liver cancer without developing cirrhosis, making it even more challenging to detect those cases, Parikh said. Up to 40% of those with liver cancers linked to MASLD don\u2019t develop cirrhosis, according to the report.",
      "Figuring out who those patients are is the \u201cmillion-dollar question,\u201d he said. \u201cThose patients that develop MASLD that develop liver cancer, you know, how do you screen that population? We don\u2019t really know what to do.\u201d",
      "Still, Parikh said these types of cases are rare.",
      "Ultimately, Jesudian said, \u201ctreating these liver diseases early is the best way to prevent liver cancer, because liver cancer almost always occurs in the setting of chronic liver disease.\u201d"

      "That brought the total number of deaths due to malnutrition up to 147, including 88 children, since the war began, the health ministry said, with most of those recorded in recent months, according to statements from the United Nations. NBC News was not able to independently confirm the figures.",
      "Trump, speaking either side of a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at his golf resort in Turnberry, Scotland, said that the U.S. would be working with its European partners to address the crisis in Gaza. He offered few other details about the plan.",
      "Humanitarian groups and doctors have warned for weeks of mounting malnutrition in Gaza, with Israel allowing only a \u201cbasic\u201d amount of food in since May when it lifted its blockade barring the entry of aid into the enclave.",
      "Just under 30 aid packages carrying food were airdropped over Gaza on Sunday, COGAT, the Israeli military's liaison with the Palestinians, said in a statement.",
      "Video captured by NBC News' crew on the ground showed scores of Palestinians running toward a handful of parachutes dotting the sky in northern Gaza, which COGAT said was airdropped in collaboration with the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.",
      "Abdul Rahman Al-Kahlout, 18, said he waited for hours under the blazing sun in hope of reaching the supplies before they ran out.",
      "\"We died in the sun for four hours,\" Al-Kahlout said. He described shots being fired and soldiers surrounding Palestinians as they waited for the aid several times. He said he feared he was \"going to die for flour.\"",
      "More than 1,000 people, including children, have been killed by Israeli forces while waiting for and trying to reach aid since a new distribution system was implemented in late May, led by the controversial U.S. and Israel-backed group the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "Health officials in Gaza said Israeli attacks killed at least 41 Palestinians from late Saturday into Sunday, including 26 people who were seeking aid, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Facing growing pressure from the global community, Israel has sought to justify both its restrictions and the introduction of a new distribution system by arguing that Hamas has been diverting aid from civilians in the enclave throughout the war.",
      "But an internal U.S. government analysis has found no evidence of systematic theft of aid supplies by Hamas, according to a report presented to State Department officials and later seen by NBC News. The IDF dismissed the report as \"biased.\"",
      "The World Food Program said Sunday that it had enough food in and on its way to the region to feed the entire population of Gaza \"for almost three months,\" if enabled to do so, as it warned that a \"third of the population\" is still \"not eating for days.\""

    "summary": "MLB sees major growth opportunity in India for both fans and players, led by Blue Jays prospect Arjun Nimmala.",
    "story": [
      "Baseball is known as America\u2019s pastime, but it has long been a global game. From the Dominican Republic to Japan to Venezuela, the sport reigns supreme for fans, and countless players are on Major League Baseball rosters.",
      "The next country that could soon be on that list? India.",
      "While its residents may prefer a different game with a ball and a bat \u2014 cricket \u2014 it\u2019s also the motherland of Arjun Nimmala, the top prospect in the Toronto Blue Jays organization. Picked 20th overall in the 2023 draft, Nimmala is the first first-generation Indian American to be selected in the first round.",
      "Nimmala, who grew up outside Tampa, Florida, said his father introduced him to cricket at a young age but also taught him baseball. He fell in love with the sport and played competitively all the way through high school until the Blue Jays selected him at just 17 years old.",
      "Two years later, he is ranked No. 46 out of 900 prospects by MLB and considered a future centerpiece of the organization.",
      "While Nimmala, currently with the Blue Jays\u2019 high-A affiliate Vancouver Canadians, continues to ascend the minor leagues, MLB is doing extensive outreach in India by putting together tournaments for children and taking baseball programs to schools.",
      "\u201cWe want to try to introduce the sport to as many kids as possible,\u201d Chris Marinak, MLB\u2019s chief operations and strategy officer, told NBC News. \u201cThat\u2019s the foot in the door. That\u2019s the way that you educate kids on the game \u2014 you get kids to fall in love with it, and they become fans for the rest of their lives.\u201d",
      "He said the goal is to take baseball to India both on the fields and inside homes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on getting our MLB games on broadcast and streaming,\u201d Marinak said. \u201cWe have two partners in India right now that are putting games live for the postseason and the regular season, and we\u2019re seeing great interest from fans around consumption.\u201d",
      "MLB opened an office in India in 2019 and since 2021 has hosted the MLB Cup, a tournament for amateur youth teams across the country.",
      "Nimmala traveled to India in 2023 to see the initiatives the league was producing and to help grow the game in the country where much of his family still lives.",
      "\u201cTo be able to go there and not only see that baseball is a part of India, as well, but just also trying to make it bigger, I think that makes me super proud,\u201d Nimmala said. \u201cKnowing that I have a possibility of doing that and just seeing how much baseball is played in India already, I thought was very cool.\u201d",
      "Asked how big baseball can be in India, a country with 1.46 billion people, Marinak said MLB has high goals.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a billion fans that are watching cricket, it creates a real opportunity to grow the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can get baseball to the scale of cricket, it would be a huge penetration into that market. It would look a lot like what you see in Japan [and the] United States. It can be done.\u201d",
      "Nimmala says the goal remains to make the major leagues, though that could take multiple years because of his age and experience. His 17 home runs last year led all players ages 18 or younger, and after some early-season struggles, he turned up his production in the second half.",
      "From June 27 on, Nimmala hit .265/.331/.564 with 13 homers over his final 53 games.",
      "Known as a solid fielder, he has elite arm strength, according to MLB.com.",
      "But the stats tell only one part of his story. By just being on the field, Nimmala is inspiring a whole new generation of Indian players.",
      "\u201cI do get a lot of messages, especially on Instagram, from younger kids that are Indian that start to play baseball,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Dude, I really look up to you.\u2019 I think it\u2019s super cool to see that.\u201d",
      "But even with all the responsibilities of being a trailblazer, he\u2019s keeping his eyes on the prize.",
      "\u201cI have 100% confidence that I will play with the Toronto Blue Jays one day and make an impact.\u201d"

      "HONG KONG \u2014 The head of China\u2019s famous Shaolin Temple has been defrocked as authorities investigate allegations of financial offenses and sexual misconduct.",
      "Shi Yongxin, the temple\u2019s abbot since 1999, has had his ordination certificate revoked, China\u2019s state-backed Buddhist Association said in a statement Monday, citing allegations that he embezzled and misappropriated project funds and temple assets.",
      "Shi, 59, also broke his vow of celibacy, having \u201cimproper relationships\u201d with women over a long period of time and fathering at least one child out of wedlock, the temple said in a separate statement Sunday.",
      "Shi\u2019s actions are \u201cparticularly egregious, severely damaging the reputation of the Buddhist community and tarnishing the image of monastics,\u201d the association said, adding that it \u201cfirmly supports\u201d the investigation by multiple agencies.",
      "Calls to the Shaolin Temple went unanswered Monday.",
      "Dubbed the \u201cCEO monk,\u201d Shi globally commercialized the Shaolin Temple, based in China\u2019s central province of Henan, a 1,500-year-old monastery recognized as the cradle of kung fu. As of Monday, four companies are still registered under Shi\u2019s name, according to Qichacha, a Chinese corporate database operator.",
      "Led by Shi, the temple has raised its international profile over the years through tourism, performances and training. It has also established multiple overseas cultural centers, including in the United States, Australia and Europe.",
      "Though Shi has faced similar accusations in the past, religious authorities rejected them at the time.",
      "In 2011, Shi downplayed online rumors that he had mistresses and children. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to vindicate. When things like this happen, just let it go,\u201d he told the state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily.",
      "In 2015, several of Shi\u2019s students accused him of extortion and bribery, drawing heightened attention from China\u2019s top religious affairs body. A two-year investigation cleared Shi of wrongdoing.",
      "The latest investigation was widely satirized on Chinese social media, where commenters noted the irony of the allegations given that Shi\u2019s religion requires him to live frugally.",
      "\u201cAll the wishes I made for wealth and success at the Buddhist temples have come true for the monks,\u201d a user wrote on the Chinese social media platform Weibo."

    "story": [
      "Three Venezuelan men told NBC News they experienced physical and psychological torture, including one man\u2019s allegation that he was sexually assaulted, after the Trump administration sent them to a notorious prison in El Salvador.",
      "The men were held for four months in the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a Salvadoran megaprison known for its harsh conditions and reported abuse. The allegations included beatings that left bruises and cuts, psychological abuse and the denial of necessities such as food or bathroom access.",
      "The Trump administration sent about 250 Venezuelan men to CECOT in March and has accused them of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Many of the men and some of their families and attorneys have denied the claim. The men were released and flown to Venezuela on July 18 as part of a prisoner swap with the United States.",
      "Andry Hernandez Romero, a 32-year-old gay asylum-seeker from Venezuela, told NBC News that one day during his imprisonment he was taken to solitary confinement, where prison staff \u201cmade me kneel, perform oral sex on one person, while the others groped me and touched my private parts\u201d and \u201cstroked me with their batons.\u201d",
      "He said he could not identify the guards because their faces were covered and the room did not have a lightbulb, with only a small amount of light coming in through a hole in the ceiling.",
      "Hernandez said the incident left him devastated.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to eat. I didn\u2019t want to do absolutely anything,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cThe only thing I did was stay laying down, look at the toilet, remember my family, asking myself a million questions.\u201d",
      "Another detainee who spoke to NBC News, Jerce Reyes, said Hernandez told him after they were released that he was sexually abused by CECOT staff. Hernandez also said on Venezuelan state media that he was sexually abused while in CECOT.",
      "\u201cHe told us that when we arrived in Venezuela, that he suffered abuse at the hands of guards there in El Salvador,\u201d said Reyes, referring to Hernandez\u2019s account of sexual abuse.",
      "Hernandez said he was unaware of any formal system at CECOT through which he could report the alleged abuse and that if detainees tried to complain to superiors at the prison, they would often be subjected to beatings by guards.",
      "The Salvadoran government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Hernandez\u2019s sexual assault allegations and claims from other Venezuelan men that they were physically and psychologically abused in the prison. The government has previously said it observes safety and order standards, and the director of CECOT told CNN that \u201cthe whole operation is based on strict respect for human rights.\u201d In a statement, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security referred NBC News to the Salvadoran government for comment because the Venezuelan men were \u201cnot U.S. citizens or under U.S. jurisdiction.\u201d",
      "When asked whether the U.S. government would continue to send people to CECOT, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, \u201cwhether it is CECOT, Alligator Alcatraz, Guantanamo Bay or another detention facility, these dangerous criminals will not be allowed to terrorize U.S. citizens.\u201d",
      "The statement said that President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \u201care using every tool available to get criminal illegal aliens off our streets and out of our country. Our message is clear: Criminals are not welcome in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u2018You will not be leaving here\u2019",
      "Hernandez and others said they were repeatedly beaten by prison officials.",
      "\u201cOur daily bread there as Venezuelans were beatings, threats. For whatever circumstance,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cIf you answer an official, they hit you. ... If you talk, they hit you.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery time they went to hit a large group outside, they would put us in the required position so we couldn\u2019t see. And to hear the moans, to hear how they were hitting the people was also very heavy.\u201d",
      "Another detainee, Andry Blanco Bonilla, 40, said he and the other Venezuelans faced verbal, psychological and physical abuse from the day they entered CECOT.",
      "\u201cThere were so many moments of anguish and terror,\u201d he said in Spanish. \u201cI feared for my life.\u201d",
      "Blanco Bonilla said that when they first arrived at CECOT, the men were shackled so tightly at the ankles that walking \u201cwould give us cuts and bruises.\u201d He said the guards denied them food and access to bathrooms or showers as punishment.",
      "Blanco Bonilla, who had gone to the U.S. to seek asylum, said he would never forget the words of a prison official who told the detainees, \u201cWelcome to CECOT. Welcome to hell.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou will not be leaving here. Your days are over,\u201d the official said, according to Blanco Bonilla.",
      "The detainees would suffer beatings as the guards saw fit, he said.",
      "\u201cThey tried to avoid hitting our faces. They kicked us in the back or ribs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they made us get on our knees, they would step on our toes with their boots. They hit us with batons, they hit us on the head.\u201d",
      "After a beating, Blanco Bonilla said he would be brought by guards to a prison doctor, who would say to him, \u201cYou hit yourself. How did you hit yourself?\u201d",
      "When he tried to tell the doctor that he was beaten by prison staff, a guard would hit him with a baton in the back, Blanco Bonilla said. The doctor would then ask him again, \u201cHow did you hit yourself?\u201d",
      "\u201cI realized that if I didn\u2019t tell them what they wanted, they would keep hitting me,\u201d he said, adding that the doctor would then make a false report about the incident.",
      "\u2018We are only migrants\u2019",
      "Reyes, 36, said one of hardest moments for him was when a prison official \u201cencouraged us to commit suicide\u201d and told him \u201cthis is how your whole nightmare ends.\u201d",
      "\u201cI did think about committing suicide at some point. But I thought about my two daughters, I thought about my family,\u201d he said about his two children, ages 3 and 6.",
      "Reyes said there were days when \u201cwe woke up and all said to ourselves, \u2018We aren\u2019t getting out of here.\u2019\u201d He said he witnessed and experienced physical aggression from CECOT guards.",
      "Reyes said he was thankful that he and other men were able to share copies of the Bible inside and motivate each other.",
      "The detainees who spoke to NBC News said they had no contact with the outside world or access to U.S. officials during the four months they were held in CECOT.",
      "Reyes did recall seeing Noem walk by when she toured CECOT in March, shortly after he and the others were sent there. She went past several cells that Salvadoran officials assured her held hardened criminals and gang members.",
      "Reyes says he wasn\u2019t told Noem was coming but remembers that day as the only day the detainees had gotten something cold to drink.",
      "He said he and others pressed their faces to the bars and saw her. \u201cWe began screaming, \u2018Freedom, freedom, freedom. We are not criminals. We are only migrants,\u2019\u201d Reyes said.",
      "The men were sent to CECOT after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March, declaring the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua an invading force. Immigration officials have since used that act to deport hundreds of people without immigration hearings, alleging that they were gang members.",
      "The men who spoke to NBC News, as well as the families of former detainees and their attorneys, have strongly denied any ties to gangs and said they were unfairly targeted because of tattoos that may be popular in Venezuela and are unrelated to Tren de Aragua. They have also said some migrants were denied due process and a chance to defend themselves from the accusations against them. Experts have said tattoos are not closely connected with affiliation to Tren de Aragua. An official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement previously said the administration did not solely rely on tattoos to identify the men sent to CECOT as gang members.",
      "A New York Times investigation, which relied on interviews with prosecutors and law enforcement officials as well as court documents and media reports in multiple countries, found that most of the men sent to CECOT did not have criminal records in the United States or in the region. It found at least 32 of the more than 200 men faced serious criminal accusations or convictions in the United States or abroad. Very few of them appeared to have any documented evidence connecting them to Tren de Aragua.",
      "The men said their strong faith in God, love for their families and a belief that one day they would get justice helped them keep going during their most desperate moments.",
      "\u201cReuniting again with my parents and children was a moment of such happiness,\u201d Blanco Bonilla said.",
      "While the men resume life back in Venezuela, the question of whether they would ever return to the U.S. remains. During a status hearing Thursday tied to the government\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act, the Department of Justice said it would bring any of the men back for immigration or habeas proceedings if a \u201clawful order\u201d were issued.",
      "\u201cVenezuela has made assurances they\u2019ll allow us to do that,\u201d DOJ attorney Tiberius Davis told the court.",
      "Now that they are back home with their families, the men have said they are demanding justice from Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.",
      "On Thursday, former detainee Neiyerver Adri\u00e1n Leon Rengel filed a complaint, reviewed by NBC News, against the Department of Homeland Security under the Federal Tort Claims Act, claiming he was removed from the United States unlawfully and without due process. The complaint was filed on behalf Rengel by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and the Democracy Defenders Fund, which describes itself as a nonpartisan group that defends democratic institutions and opposes autocrats.",
      "LULAC told NBC News that it also planned to file a lawsuit and expected more lawsuits to come after that.",
      "Rengel alleged that he suffered physical, verbal and psychological abuse in CECOT and that the U.S. government could have and should have secured his release, according to the complaint.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the complaint.",
      "\u201cWe were mistreated, our rights were violated, crimes against humanity were committed,\u201d Blanco Bonilla said.",
      "Hernandez said he and others are still working through the psychological effects of their time in CECOT. \u201cAll 252 [of the men] are doing poorly, mentally.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven though we are free, even though we are now with our families, happy and content,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is still a big mental block, a block that particularly I have not been able to find a way to deal with.\u201d",
      "But despite their ongoing struggles, Hernandez said the shared experience has created a lasting sense of community among the men.",
      "\u201cWe entered [CECOT] as 252 strangers, 252 Venezuelans, but 252 brothers came out,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe all supported each other; we were all there in the constant fight.\u201d",

      "Tadej Poga\u010dar blasted his way to a fourth Tour de France victory on Sunday, besting rival Jonas Vingegaard by 4:24 across the famed Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es finish line.",
      "Billed as a clash between two titans, this year\u2019s race was filled with ghosts of Poga\u010dar\u2019s past, including the Hautacam, Mont Ventoux and the Col de la Loze climbs, where he had lost significant time in previous Tours to Vingegaard.",
      "This year, Poga\u010dar, of UAE Team Emirates XRG, conquered them all.",
      "\u201cJust speechless to win the Tour de France. This one feels especially amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cJust super proud that I can wear this yellow jersey.\u201d",
      "Vingegaard, of Denmark, suffered significant time losses early in the race beginning with his botched performance during the Stage 5 time trial. He crossed the finish 1:20 behind Poga\u010dar, who continued to build a steady time gap that eventually became too large for Vingegaard to overcome.",
      "Despite launching attack after attack and maintaining an upbeat attitude during interviews, Vingegaard, of Visma\u2013Lease a Bike, proved to be a mere mortal compared to Poga\u010dar\u2019s superhuman prowess.",
      "\u201cBattling against Jonas was a tough experience, but I must say to him, respect and big, big congratulations to him for his fight and incredible race,\u201d Poga\u010dar said.",
      "As of Sunday, two-time Tour winner Vingegaard has finished runner-up to Poga\u010dar three times. He will next take on the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, Spain\u2019s grand tour, in August.",
      "His teammate, Belgian rider Wout van Aert, won Sunday\u2019s rainy stage, which featured three climbs around Montmartre instead of the traditional ceremonial ride into Paris. Van Aert stunned onlookers in the last kilometer around the hill, known for its artistic history and the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica, as he dropped Poga\u010dar in a final attack on the steepest section.",
      "\u201cWe came to this tour with ambition to also win the yellow jersey, but the strongest rider in the race and biggest rider on the road won,\u201d said van Aert. \u201cI\u2019m proud of how we raced as a team, how we kept trying every day.\u201d",
      "German climber Florian Lipowitz, of Red Bull\u2013BORA\u2013hansgrohe, finished third in the general classification, coming in 11:09 behind Poga\u010dar and taking home the white jersey for best young rider. His podium finish is all the more impressive considering this was his Tour debut. He was meant to be riding in a supportive role for teammate and Tour veteran Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d from Slovenia.",
      "But in the end, Lipowitz, who is 11 years younger than 35-year-old Rogli\u010d, emerged as the stronger rider. And Rogli\u010d, who has crashed out of several grand tours in recent years, appeared happy to just finish the race.",
      "Indeed, this year\u2019s Tour was filled with unforgettable performances by the next generation of emerging talent.",
      "Few people could have predicted the rise of Irish climber Ben Healy, who wore the yellow jersey for two days early in the race after launching strong attacks based purely on instinct. His team, EF Education-EasyPost, came into the race without its team leader, Richard Carapaz, but Healy quickly stepped into the role. He took the Stage 6 win and was awarded with the Tour\u2019s \u201cSuper Combative\u201d prize for what his team described as \u201cexploits\u201d on the road.",
      "\u201cIt is one thing to achieve what you set out to achieve; it is another to do it with a smile,\u201d team sports director Charly Wegelius said in a statement.",
      "Italian sprinter Jonathan Milan, of Lidl\u2013Trek, dominated in the green jersey for much of his Tour debut. The contest for points classification appeared to open in Stage 3 when the reigning champion, Jasper Philipsen, of Alpecin\u2013Deceuninck, was thrown over his handlebars during an intermediate sprint. The Belgian fastman was forced to abandon with a fractured collarbone and at least one broken rib.",
      "Milan and teammate Quinn Simmons, from Durango, Colorado, soon began a relentless campaign to best the remaining sprinters and succeeded. Simmons, donning his iconic handlebar mustache and American flag road champion\u2019s jersey, was seen at the front of the peloton nearly every day for three weeks. He proved to be the perfect lead-out man for Milan, who wouldn\u2019t let rain or crashes slow him down.",
      "In the end, Milan edged out Poga\u010dar in the final points classification and Simmons proposed to his girlfriend \u2014 she said yes! \u2014 after crossing the finish line."

      "Israel announced Sunday it was pausing fighting in some areas of the Gaza Strip to facilitate aid delivery after international outrage swelled in recent days over surging deaths by malnutrition and widespread starvation caused by Israeli restrictions on humanitarian aid.",
      "The announcement issued by the Israel Defense Forces said it would be implementing \u201chumanitarian corridors\u201d for the safe movement of United Nations aid trucks and \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d in some of Gaza\u2019s most densely populated areas.",
      "The military\u2019s \u201ctactical pause\u201d will take place from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. in the areas where the Israeli military is not operating: Al-Mawasi, Deir al-Balah and Gaza City, the IDF said, and will continue daily \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d",
      "Additional secure routes will be in place between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. to enable the safe passage of aid trucks, the IDF said, adding it is \u201cprepared to expand the scale of this activity as required.\u201d",
      "Trucks began moving into Gaza from Egypt after Israel\u2019s announcement, with the Egyptian Red Crescent saying the convoy included over 100 aid trucks containing more than 1,200 tons of food.",
      "However, a spokesperson for the Gaza Health Ministry, Dr. Khalil al-Daqran, told NBC News that 25 people had been killed by Israeli army fire so far on Sunday morning, including 11 people seeking aid in central Gaza. Al-Daqran added that Israeli airstrikes across the strip are ongoing.",
      "The World Food Programme welcomed the implementation of humanitarian corridors, saying it has enough food already in the region, or on its way, to feed Gaza's entire population for three months. Gaza needs more than 62,000 tons of food assistance monthly, it said in the statement Sunday.",
      "Israel also said it had air-dropped seven packages of aid into the enclave on Sunday, after inviting foreign countries to do the same. Aid delivery by air has been slammed by international organizations as a \u201cdistraction\u201d from the roadblocks Israel has imposed on overland aid delivery, which remains the only way to get a meaningful amount of food and other supplies into Gaza.",
      "\u201cAid drops are a grotesque distraction from the reality of what\u2019s needed on the ground in Gaza right now. They can never deliver the volume, the consistency or the quality of aid and services that\u2019s needed,\u201d Ciar\u00e1n Donnelly, vice president of international programs at the International Rescue Committee, told the BBC.",
      "An additional six people in Gaza have succumbed to malnutrition in the last 24 hours, according to the health ministry, bringing the total to at least 133 people killed by starvation, including 87 children.",
      "The enclave\u2019s wider population of some 2 million is also at risk of mass starvation, aid organizations have warned, slamming Israel\u2019s aid delivery mechanism, which they say is riddled with obstructive bureaucracy, delays and arbitrary denials.",
      "Thousands of truckloads of aid are piled up outside Gaza\u2019s border crossings waiting to be delivered, but Israel says it\u2019s the responsibility of the United Nations aid agencies to distribute inside Gaza, which in turn blame Israel for erecting bureaucratic and logistical hurdles so complex that only a fraction can be distributed across the enclave.",
      "\u201cThe U.N. and international organizations are expected to improve the effectiveness of aid distribution and to ensure that the aid does not reach Hamas,\u201d the IDF said Saturday.",
      "Israel has long maintained that aid restrictions are in place to prevent Hamas from stealing the food, though an internal U.S. government analysis found no evidence of systematic theft of the supplies by Hamas over the past 20 months.",
      "OCHA, the U.N.\u2019s humanitarian aid agency, and the World Food Programme, have previously maintained that they have not seen evidence of Hamas diverting aid.",
      "Israel lifted its nearly three-month total aid blockade in May to allow some organizations to distribute a limited amount of aid, and has maintained that there\u2019s no hunger inside Gaza, with the IDF saying on Saturday that \u201cthere is no starvation in the Gaza Strip; this is a false campaign promoted by Hamas.\u201d",
      "International aid agencies, hospitals and medical organizations, as well as NBC News\u2019 reporting on the ground, have widely documented mounting hunger across Gaza.",
      "\u201cFood crisis in Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe,\u201d Jagan Chapagain, chief executive of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said Sunday in a post on X, adding: \u201cEven the carers are not getting enough food to stay healthy enough to care for others.\u201d"

      "TOKYO \u2014 As President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs add to a sense of uncertainty in Japan, more voters here are embracing an idea inspired by their longtime ally the United States: \u201cJapanese first.\u201d",
      "The nationalist slogan helped the right-wing populist party Sanseito make big gains in Japan\u2019s parliamentary elections on Sunday, as it capitalized on economic malaise and concerns about immigration and overtourism.",
      "Party leader Sohei Kamiya, who since 2022 had held Sanseito\u2019s only seat in the upper house of Japan\u2019s parliament, will now be joined by 14 others in the 248-seat chamber. It\u2019s a far cry from the party\u2019s origin as a fringe anti-vaccination group on YouTube during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Though Japan has long had a complex relationship with foreigners and its cultural identity, experts say Sanseito\u2019s rise is another indication of the global shift to the right embodied and partly fueled by Trump, with populist figures gaining ground in Europe, Britain, Latin America and elsewhere.",
      "Kamiya \u201cfancies himself a mini-Trump\u201d and \u201cis one of those who Trump has put wind in his sails,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus.",
      "Speaking at a rally on Saturday at Tokyo\u2019s Shiba Park, Kamiya said his calls for greater restrictions on foreign workers and investment were driven not by xenophobia but by \u201cthe workings of globalization.\u201d He criticized mainstream parties\u2019 support for boosting immigration in an effort to address the labor shortage facing Japan\u2019s aging and shrinking population.",
      "\u201cJapan is still the fourth-largest economy in the world. We have 120 million people. Why do we have to rely on foreign capital?\u201d Kamiya told an enthusiastic crowd.",
      "The election results were disastrous for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is facing calls to resign now that his conservative Liberal Democratic Party \u2014 which has ruled almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II \u2014 has lost its majority in both houses of parliament.",
      "The Japanese leader had also been under pressure to reach a trade deal with the Trump administration, which said Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to a 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese goods.",
      "On Wednesday, Ishiba denied reports that he planned to step down by the end of August.",
      "The message from his party\u2019s string of election losses is that \u201cpeople are unhappy,\u201d Kingston said.",

      "Kamiya, 47, an energetic speaker with social media savvy, is also a strong contrast to leaders such as Ishiba and the Constitutional Democrats\u2019 Yoshihiko Noda, both 68, who \u201clook like yesterday\u2019s men\u201d and the faces of the establishment, Kingston said.",
      "With voters concerned about stagnating wages, surging prices and bleak employment prospects, \u201cthe change-makers got a lot of protest votes from people who feel disenfranchised,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cThe number of [foreign immigrants] who don\u2019t obey rules is increasing. People don\u2019t voice it, but I think they feel that,\u201d the 38-year-old hairdresser told Reuters in Tokyo. \u201cAlso, the burden on citizens including taxes is getting bigger and bigger, so life is getting more difficult.\u201d",
      "The biggest reason Sanseito did well in the election, he said, \u201cis that they are speaking on behalf of us.\u201d",
      "Kamiya\u2019s party was not the only upstart to benefit from voter discontent, with the center-right Democratic Party for the People increasing its number of seats in the upper house from five to 16.",
      "Sanseito, whose name means \u201cParticipate in Politics,\u201d originated in 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic, attracting conservatives with YouTube videos promoting conspiracy theories about vaccines and pushing back against mask mandates. Its YouTube channel now has almost 480,000 subscribers.",
      "The party has also warned about a \u201csilent invasion\u201d of foreigners in Japan, where the number of foreign residents rose more than 10% last year to a record of almost 3.8 million, according to the Immigration Services Agency. It remains far lower as a proportion of the population than in the U.S. or Europe, however.",
      "Critics say such rhetoric has fueled hate speech and growing hostility toward foreigners in Japan, citing a survey last month by Japanese broadcaster NHK and others in which almost two-thirds of respondents agreed that foreigners received \u201cpreferential treatment.\u201d",
      "At the Sanseito rally on Saturday, protesters held up signs that said \u201cNo Hate\u201d and \u201cRacists Go Home.\u201d",
      "Kamiya denies that his party is hostile to foreigners in Japan.",
      "\u201cWe have no intention of discriminating against foreigners, nor do we have any intention of inciting division,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re just aiming to firmly rebuild the lives of Japanese people who are currently in trouble.\u201d",
      "Despite its electoral advances, Sanseito doesn\u2019t have enough members in the upper house to make much impact on its own and has only three seats in the more powerful lower house. The challenge, Kingston said, is whether Kamiya can \u201ctake this anger, the malaise, and bring his show nationwide.\u201d"

      "The analysis, which has not been previously reported, was conducted by a bureau within the U.S. Agency for International Development and completed in late June. It examined 156 incidents of theft or loss of U.S.-funded supplies reported by U.S. aid partner organizations between October 2023 and this May.",
      "It found \u201cno reports alleging Hamas\u201d benefited from U.S.-funded supplies, according to a slide presentation of the findings seen by Reuters.",
      "A State Department spokesperson disputed the findings, saying there is video evidence of Hamas looting aid, but provided no such videos. The spokesperson also accused traditional humanitarian groups of covering up \u201caid corruption.\u201d",
      "A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, questioned the existence of the analysis, saying no State Department official had seen it and that it \u201cwas likely produced by a deep state operative\u201d seeking to discredit President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201chumanitarian agenda.\u201d",
      "The findings were shared with the USAID\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office and State Department officials involved in Middle East policy, said two sources familiar with the matter, and come as dire food shortages deepen in the devastated enclave.",
      "Israel says it is committed to allowing in aid but must control it to prevent it from being stolen by Hamas, which it blames for the crisis.",
      "The U.N. World Food Program says nearly a quarter of Gaza\u2019s 2.1 million Palestinians face famine-like conditions, thousands are suffering acute malnutrition, and the World Health Organization and doctors in the enclave report starvation deaths of children and others.",
      "The U.N. also estimates that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 people seeking food supplies, the majority near the militarized distribution sites of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the new private aid group that uses a for-profit U.S. logistics firm run by a former CIA officer and armed U.S. military veterans.",
      "The study was conducted by the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) of USAID, which was the largest funder of assistance to Gaza before the Trump administration froze all U.S. foreign aid in January, terminating thousands of programs. It has also begun dismantling USAID, whose functions have been folded into the State Department.",
      "The analysis found that at least 44 of the 156 incidents where aid supplies were reported stolen or lost were \u201ceither directly or indirectly\u201d due to Israeli military actions, according to the briefing slides.",
      "Israel\u2019s military did not respond to questions about those findings.",
      "The study noted a limitation: because Palestinians who receive aid cannot be vetted, it was possible that U.S.-funded supplies went to administrative officials of Hamas, the Islamist rulers of Gaza.",
      "One source familiar with the study also cautioned that the absence of reports of widespread aid diversion by Hamas \u201cdoes not mean that diversion has not occurred.\u201d",
      "The war in Gaza began after Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Nearly 60,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Israeli assault began, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Israel says Hamas diverts aid",
      "Israel, which controls access to Gaza, has said that Hamas steals food supplies from U.N. and other organizations to use to control the civilian population and boost its finances, including by jacking up the prices of the goods and reselling them to civilians.",
      "Asked about the USAID report, the Israeli military told Reuters that its allegations are based on intelligence reports that Hamas militants seized cargoes by \u201cboth covertly and overtly\u201d embedding themselves on aid trucks.",
      "Those reports also show that Hamas has diverted up to 25% of aid supplies to its fighters or sold them to civilians, the Israeli military said, adding that GHF has ended the militants\u2019 control of aid by distributing it directly to civilians.",
      "Hamas denies the allegations. A Hamas security official said that Israel has killed more than 800 Hamas-affiliated police and security guards trying to protect aid vehicles and convoy routes. Their missions were coordinated with the U.N.",
      "Reuters could not independently verify the claims by Hamas and Israel, which has not made public proof that the militants have systematically stolen aid.",
      "GHF also accuses Hamas of massive aid theft in defending its distribution model. The U.N. and other groups have rejected calls by GHF, Israel and the U.S. to cooperate with the foundation, saying it violates international humanitarian principles of neutrality.",
      "In response to a request for comment, GHF referred Reuters to a July 2 Washington Post article that quoted an unidentified Gazan and anonymous Israeli officials as saying Hamas profited from the sales and taxing of pilfered humanitarian aid.",
      "Aid groups required to report losses",
      "The 156 reports of theft or losses of supplies reviewed by BHA were filed by U.N. agencies and other humanitarian groups working in Gaza as a condition of receiving U.S. aid funds.",
      "The second source familiar with the matter said that after receiving reports of U.S.-funded aid thefts or losses, USAID staff followed up with partner organizations to try to determine if there was Hamas involvement.",
      "Those organizations also would \u201credirect or pause\u201d aid distributions if they learned that Hamas was in the vicinity, the source said.",
      "Aid organizations working in Gaza also are required to vet their personnel, sub-contractors and suppliers for ties to extremist groups before receiving U.S. funds, a condition that the State Department waived in approving $30 million for GHF last month.",
      "The slide presentation noted that USAID partners tended to over-report aid diversion and theft by groups sanctioned or designated by the U.S. as foreign terrorist organizations \u2014 such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad \u2014 because they want to avoid losing U.S. funding.",
      "Of the 156 incidents of loss or theft reported, 63 were attributed to unknown perpetrators, 35 to armed actors, 25 to unarmed people, 11 directly to Israeli military action, 11 to corrupt subcontractors, five to aid group personnel \u201cengaging in corrupt activities,\u201d and six to \u201cothers,\u201d a category that accounted for \u201ccommodities stolen in unknown circumstances,\u201d according to the slide presentation.",
      "The armed actors \u201cincluded gangs and other miscellaneous individuals who may have had weapons,\u201d said a slide. Another slide said \u201ca review of all 156 incidents found no affiliations with\u201d U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations, of which Hamas is one.",
      "\u201cThe majority of incidents could not be definitively attributed to a specific actor,\u201d said another slide. \u201cPartners often largely discovered the commodities had been stolen in transit without identifying the perpetrator.\u201d",
      "It is possible there were classified intelligence reports on Hamas aid thefts, but BHA staff lost access to classified systems in the dismantlement of USAID, said a slide.",
      "However, a source familiar with U.S. intelligence assessments told Reuters that they knew of no U.S. intelligence reports detailing Hamas aid diversions and that Washington was relying on Israeli reports.",
      "The BHA analysis found that the Israeli military \u201cdirectly or indirectly caused\u201d a total of 44 incidents in which U.S.-funded aid was lost or stolen. Those included the 11 attributed to direct Israeli military actions, such as airstrikes or orders to Palestinians to evacuate areas of the war-torn enclave.",
      "Losses indirectly attributed to Israeli military included cases where they compelled aid groups to use delivery routes with high risks of theft or looting, ignoring requests for alternative routes, the analysis said."
