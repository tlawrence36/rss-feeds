      "Film wasn\u2019t the only thing on people\u2019s minds at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, which comes to a close Sunday in Park City, Utah",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Film wasn\u2019t the only thing on people\u2019s minds at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, which comes to a close Sunday in Park City, Utah ( and online ).",
      "The effects of the wildfires in Southern California loomed large, as did the bittersweet knowledge that this year will be the second to last Sundance based in Park City. Some films offered an escape from reality; others were a pointed reminder of the domestic and international political landscape, from transgender rights to the war in Ukraine.",
      "Here are some of the key takeaways from the 41st edition of the festival.",
      "The wildfires were still burning in parts of Los Angeles when Sundance began last week and reminders of its devastation were everywhere, even on screen. Max Walker-Silverman\u2019s \u201cRebuilding,\u201d starring Josh O\u2019Connor as a cowboy who loses his ranch in a wildfire and forms a community with fellow survivors in a FEMA camp, hit close to home for many.",
      "Filmmakers Meena Menon and Paul Gleason lost their home in Altadena where they filmed some of their zombie apocalypse movie \u201cDidn\u2019t Die.\u201d Sundance artist labs head Michelle Satter lost her Palisades home as well. Satter had an audience of Sundance Institute donors in tears early in the festival while accepting an honor at a fundraising gala.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a deeply devastating time for us and so many others, a moment that calls for all of us coming together to support our bigger community,\u201d Satter said. \u201cAs a friend recently noted, and I have to listen to this, \u2018Take a deep breath ... We lost our village, but at the end of the day we are the village.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was a topic bound to come up in nearly every conversation: The festival\u2019s new home in 2027. \u201cWhere do you think it will go? How do you feel about it leaving Park City? What would Sundance in Ohio even look like?\u201d No one had any answers, but everyone had an opinion about the fact that next year will be the last year in which the center of activity is in Park City. Sundance Institute leadership has narrowed the finalist cities to Salt Lake City, Utah, Boulder, Colorado, and Cincinnati, Ohio, and is expected to announce the winner before spring.",
      "Actor Tessa Thompson, who serves on the institute\u2019s board, was hopeful about a new city.",
      "\u201cI think that Sundance has more to do with the spirit and community, and I think that\u2019s evergreen,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cRegardless of where Sundance is, Sundance will always be.\u201d",
      "In the early days of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second administration, politics were also a main topic of private discussions at least. Several films (mostly documentaries) had direct relevance to recent news, like \u201cHeightened Scrutiny,\u201d about transgender lawyer Chase Strangio and the media coverage of transgender issues amid a pending Supreme Court case.",
      "Even \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d filmmaker Bill Condon quoted Trump\u2019s \u201ctwo genders\u201d mandate before his film screened.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a sentiment I think you\u2019ll see that the movie has a different point of view on,\u201d Condon said.",
      "There also wasn\u2019t the spirit of public protest that was unavoidable eight years ago when Trump first took office, when A-listers took to the streets to march for women's rights. But audiences at Q&As for films like \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d about the abusive Alabama prison systems which the AP has reported extensively on, were curious how they could help change things.",
      "There have been essentially two major deals out of the festival so far: Netflix took \u201cTrain Dreams,\u201d Clint Bentley\u2019s lyrical Denis Johnson adaptation, with Joel Edgerton and Felicity Jones, and Neon acquired the Dave Franco and Alison Brie relationship body horror \u201cTogether.\u201d",
      "As always, some films came in with distribution in place: Focus Features with \u201cThe Ballad of Wallis Island\u201d; A24 with \u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You,\u201d \u201cOpus,\u201d and \u201cThe Legend of Ochi\u201d; Bleecker Street with \u201cThe Wedding Banquet\u201d; Nat Geo with the Sally Ride documentary \u201cSally\u201d; MUBI with \u201cMagic Farm\u201d; and Apple with \u201cDeaf President Now!\u201d; HBO Documentary Films with \u201cThe Alabama Solution\u201d and \u201cEnigma.\u201d",
      "Most deals happen after the festival ends, but there have been private grumblings that the market this year was weaker than usual, and the films were not commercial enough. Several insiders singled out Condon\u2019s adaptation of \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d with Jennifer Lopez as being too expensive for anyone but a streaming service. But there are also plenty of deals in the works, some of which will be finalized soon, while others may be settled at the Berlin Film Festival market.",
      "As festival programmers like to say, Sundance isn\u2019t the end of the story for new films \u2014 it\u2019s just the beginning. Last year\u2019s program had over 100 films distributed to audiences through traditional means, and only a small fraction of those were announced during the festival.",
      "Perhaps the biggest discovery of the festival is \u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d from writer-director-star Eva Victor in her feature debut. This funny and quietly piercing film is about Agnes, who was sexually assaulted by her thesis advisor. Instead of making it about depicting the incident itself (Victor keeps the camera firmly planted outside of the home where it occurs, showing the passage of time through light), Victor, who could be the next Greta Gerwig and/or Phoebe Waller-Bridge, stays focused on how it affects Anges.",
      "Filmmaker James Sweeney also scored a big win with \u201cTwinless,\u201d which picked up the U.S. dramatic audience prize and a special award for his star Dylan O\u2019Brien. The movie is about a bromance between two men in a twin bereavement group.",
      "On the documentary side there was much chatter about \u201cAndr\u00e9 Is an Idiot,\u201d a documentary about a \u201cbrilliant idiot\u201d who is dying because he didn\u2019t get a colonoscopy and trying to live out his final days happily.",
      "The in-person experience at Sundance is also a good reminder that reviews are only part of the equation when it comes to judging the response to a film. Hailey Gates\u2019 war satire \u201cAtropia\u201d got mixed reviews from critics, but premiere audiences were very enthusiastic (as was the U.S. dramatic jury who gave it the festival\u2019s top prize ).",
      "As of publication, all are still seeking distribution.",
      "Others that played notably well with audiences and critics include: \u201cIf I Had Legs I'd Kick You,\u201d \u201cDJ Ahmet,\u201d \u201cCactus Pears,\u201d \"2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d \u201cPlainclothes,\u201d \u201cRicky,\u201d \u201cPrime Minister,\u201d \u201cSelena y Los Dinos,\u201d \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d\u201cSLY LIVES!,\u201d \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d \u201cPredators,\u201d \u201cEast of Wall,\u201d \u201cFolktales,\u201d \u201cFree Leonard Peltier,\u201d \u201cPeter Hujar\u2019s Day,\u201d \u201cThe Ballad of Wallis Island\u201d and \u201cTrain Dreams.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "There have been plenty of out-of-the-ordinary moments at the ongoing trial of rapper A$AP Rocky",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The trial of rapper A$AP Rocky is progressing according to standard legal procedure, but there have been no lack of unusual moments, from visits from Rihanna to a tough-but-quirky judge and lawyers nearly coming to blows.",
      "Testimony is expected to last another week before jurors will decide Rocky's fate on two counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm. A conviction could lead to up to 24 years in prison for the hip-hop star.",
      "Here are some of the out-of-the-ordinary moments from the first two weeks of the trial, most not captured by the cameras in the courtroom.",
      "From the moment it became clear the case was going to trial, nearly everyone involved was asking the same thing: What about Rihanna?",
      "Editors asked it of reporters, who asked it of lawyers. Even Judge Mark Arnold asked it months ago at a hearing: \u201cWill the mother of his children be there?\u201d",
      "Her name came up constantly during jury selection, when prospective panelists were asked whether her attendance would affect their judgment.",
      "Yet when the singing superstar finally did show up, she was easy to miss.",
      "She didn't appear through the first week, but rumors abounded Wednesday that she might appear, on a short court day with important testimony. Yet there was no sign of her outside or in the halls. (Unlike a nearby civil courthouse, where celebrities like Britney Spears and the Kardashians are smuggled in, Rocky and other defendants must use public entrances and many thought she'd accompany him.)",
      "When the media were allowed in the courtroom, many reporters walked past her without noticing she was already sitting inconspicuously between Rocky's mother and sister. She had been brought in through restricted entrances. She could barely be seen from the media section, and the camera capturing the trial is not allowed to shoot the audience.",
      "Her presence caused a quiet stir once the audience realized it, though it's not clear if the jurors had noticed her.",
      "She appeared again the next day, and it soon felt almost unexceptional that she was there. By Friday, she slipped in about 30 minutes into testimony after coming through a public entrance.",
      "Later that day she entered the courtroom together with Rocky for the first time, down a hallway full of jurors from his and other cases that was abuzz.",
      "Court observers knew that when Deputy District Attorney John Lewin joined the prosecution shortly before trial, that he and Rocky's equally bullish and vocal attorney, Joe Tacopina, were sure to butt heads. They weren't wrong.",
      "Lewin, a dogged prosecutor, is best known for his successful murder prosecution of real estate heir Robert Durst. Tacopina is a New York attorney and frequent TV commentator whose clients have included President Donald Trump.",
      "Their shouting matches began quickly. Soon, without judge or jury present, the two had to be separated by a fellow lawyer when they went nose-to-nose in a faceoff that looked like it might become a fistfight.",
      "\u201cMr. Tacopina started literally screaming at me in the courtroom. He basically appeared to challenge me to a fight,\u201d Lewin told the judge later.",
      "Tacopina responded. \u201cNo one screamed. You weren\u2019t there your honor. Mr. Lewin comes up with his little scolding, bullying attitude.\u201d",
      "Arnold, a former sheriff's deputy, forbade the two from talking to each other except on the record.",
      "Moments later, he said a UFC fight might be warranted. \u201cMaybe we should get an octagon.\u201d",
      "Arnold wasn't wrong either. An even more fierce fight broke out between the two men in front of the judge but off camera a few days later as they argued over evidence. Lewin shouted that the defense assertion Rocky was carrying a prop gun was \u201cgarbage.\"",
      "\u201cOh?! Oh?!\u201d Tacopina yelled. \u201cWe'll see what the jury says at the end!\"",
      "\"The argument grew more out of control and turned to personal insults.",
      "\u201cYou don't know me! But you will learn!\u201d Tacopina yelled.",
      "The judge, disgusted, refused to keep playing referee.",
      "\u201cThat's it, we're off the record,\u201d he said, and walked out.",
      "The testimony of A$AP Relli, Rocky's accuser, was dark and difficult but brought a couple of oddly light moments.",
      "At one point, Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec asked him how far away Rocky was at a certain moment.",
      "\u201cAbout three or four skips,\" Relli said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never heard about anyone estimating with skips,\u201d Przelomiec said.",
      "\u201cWait, what does a skip mean?\u201d the judge asked.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I mean?\u201d Relli asked.",
      "They determined for the record that it was about 7 to 8 feet.",
      "Arnold's long-for-a-judge hair and rugged, bushy mustache evoke a biker, or a cowboy. His nameplate on the bench is a carved wooden log. Relli let him know he liked his style.",
      "As he testified, Arnold told him he clearly had to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d for the court reporter.",
      "Relli said sorry, he was nervous, then looking at the judge said, \u201cI like your bracelet.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat?\u201d Arnold said.",
      "Relli pointed at the silver wristband on the judge's right arm. \u201cYour bracelet.\u201d",
      "\u201cOh,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThank you.\u201d",
      "Rocky\u2019s mother, Renee Black, and his sister, Erika Mayers, garnered their own share of attention even before Rihanna sat between them.",
      "The first day they appeared, Arnold asked Rocky who the women in his section were.",
      "\u201cThat's my mother and my sister,\u201d Rocky said. The judge's marveled at Black's youthful appearance.",
      "\u201cWhat were you, 7 when you had him?\u201d the judge asked. She said she was 26.",
      "\u201cYou are very beautiful,\u201d the judge told her. \u201cThat\u2019s on the record.\u201d",
      "Later, Lewin politely approached the women and talked to them during a break. He said of Rocky, \u201cI just hope he's evaluating everything\u201d in a reference to the deal Rocky turned down \u2014 a recommendation of 180 days in jail and other relatively minor punishments for a guilty plea on one count.",
      "Tacopina angrily brought it up to the judge later, and Lewin explained himself.",
      "\u201cI walked up very kindly to the defendants mother and sister. I said \u2018I am very sorry you have to go through this. I hope that your brother and your son, he\u2019s really evaluated what he\u2019s risking here.\u2019\u201d",
      "During jury selection, when the room was packed with tired and seemingly bored potential jurors being questioned one after another, a woman gave everyone a start when she suddenly shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s a woman taking a picture in that corner!\u201d",
      "She pointed to a door with a small window behind the judge, who pounced into action, his robe flying. He and his clerk opened the door and hurried down the hall behind it, but found no one.",
      "The woman swore she saw someone and tried to justify herself, but Arnold cut her off.",
      "\u201cYou did the right thing!\u201d Arnold said. \u201cYou done good!\u201d",
      "They kept the window covered after that."

      "The Grateful Dead kicked off Grammy weekend being honored as MusiCares Persons of the Year",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Colorful dancing bears during cocktails. Tie-dye clothing mixed with black-tie. Oh yeah, the Grateful Dead was in the house to kick off Grammy weekend.",
      "The legendary jam band was honored for its musical achievements and philanthropic efforts as MusiCares Persons of the Year on Friday night, two days before the Grammy Awards.",
      "The band's iconic skull logo was prominent in the ever-changing graphics on stage. Their well-known dancing bears posed for photos with attendees.",
      "Devoted Deadhead Andy Cohen hosted the 2 1/2-hour show at the Los Angeles Convention Center. He recounted convincing his parents to let him drive from St. Louis to Wisconsin to catch his first Dead concert as a teenager.",
      "\u201cI venture to say they are the great American band,\" Cohen said. \"What a wonder they are.\u201d",
      "So what if the Dead owns just two Grammys, for lifetime achievement in 2007 and best music film in 2018. They made their mark with a unique style and long improvisations blending such genres as rock, blues, jazz, folk and psychedelia.",
      "\u201cLongevity was never a major concern of ours,\u201d 77-year-old guitarist Bob Weir said, drawing laughs. \u201cSpreading joy through the music was all we ever really had in mind and we got plenty of that done.\u201d",
      "Drummer Mickey Hart paid homage to the band's free-spirited fans.",
      "\u201cThe Deadheads have kept the dream alive for 60 years now and continue to take this music into the next century,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore the world even knew what to make of us, our community lifted us up and kept us going. Without support there would be no Grateful Dead.\u201d",
      "Actor Woody Harrelson told a few long-winded tales about his adventures with the band, including \u201cgoing drugless to Thailand with Bobby, which is not easy for either of us.\u201d",
      "Weir and Hart were joined onstage to accept the award by three of their bandmates\u2019 offspring: Grahame Lesh, Trixie Garcia and Justin Kreutzmann.",
      "Lesh\u2019s father, Phil, died in October at age 84. Garcia\u2019s father, Jerry, died in 1995 at age 53. Kreutzmann\u2019s father, Bill, didn\u2019t attend and instead gave his thanks in a video message.",
      "\u201cI can feel his spirit in the house,\u201d the 81-year-old Hart said of Bill Kreutzmann. \u201cHe\u2019s in the music, he\u2019s in the rhythm, the heartbeat of everything we built together all these years.\u201d",
      "Grahame Lesh was busy all night playing guitar as part of the backing band led by musical director Don Was. He sang with The War on Drugs during \u201cBox of Rain,\u201d composed by his father.",

      "Technical difficulties briefly affected performances by My Morning Jacket and John Mayer, who rebounded for an extended jam with Was and Jeff Chimenti on \u201cTerrapin Station.\u201d Hart kept looking offstage as he drummed during Dead & Company's finale of \u201cSugar Magnolia\u201d and \u201cTouch of Grey\u201d until a technician appeared to bring him in-ear monitors.",
      "Eaerlier, Hart was on his feet pumping his right arm to Sammy Hagar's version of \u201cLoose Lucy.\u201d",
      "\u201cBobby, Mick, love you brothers,\u201d Hagar said.",
      "Two of the quieter moments were in-the-round performances by Norah Jones on \u201cRipple\" and Bruce Hornsby doing \u201cStanding on the Moon.\u201d",

      "\u201cI love you Robert Weir,\u201d she said from the stage. \u201cYou are my family of choice. You showed up when my momma died.\u201d",
      "Wearing a crown of red roses, Grammy nominee Sierra Ferrell teamed with Lukas Nelson on \u201cIt Must Have Been the Roses.\u201d",
      "Dwight Yoakam had the crowd on its feet dancing during \u201cTruckin.'\u201d Grammy nominee Noah Kahan sang \u201cFriend of the Devil\" featuring three guitars, banjo and bass.",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- DAKAR, Senegal (AP) \u2014 Khaby Lame, the Senegal-born world\u2019s most popular TikTok personality who never says a word in videos watched by millions of followers, addressed the youth in his native country on Friday when he was appointed as UNICEF goodwill ambassador.",
      "The 24-year-old influencer, who has over 162 million followers, rose to fame with charming videos of his reactions to everyday life in which he never says a word. His following surged during the pandemic, when he was fired from his factory job and used the extra time on his hands to make and upload more videos.",
      "Being a UNICEF ambassador will allow him to \u201csee all the world and its problems,\u201d Lame said, adding that he hoped he could contribute to solving some of them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a true honor to be appointed as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador and be part of an organization that puts children\u2019s rights front and center every day,\u201d Lame said in a statement. \u201cFrom my own experience as a child fearing poverty, struggling to find my passion at school, and losing my job during the COVID-19 pandemic, to finding my place and calling in the world, I know that all children can thrive when they are given a chance and opportunity.\u201d",
      "Senegal is a major source of irregular migration to Europe. Over 60% of Senegalese people are under 25, and 90% work in informal jobs. They have watched for years as money made from natural resources has gone overseas, and many say they have no other choice but to embark on treacherous journeys in rickety fishing boats across the Atlantic.",
      "\u201cI tell them to dream big,\u201d Lame said when asked about his message to Senegal's youth. \u201cTry and do your best to accomplish your dreams, even though there are people telling you that you cannot reach them.\u201d",
      "Lame moved to Italy from his native Senegal when he was an infant with his working class parents, but was only granted Italian citizenship when he was 20.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been in Italy for 20 years since I was only 2 years old,\u201d Lame told The Associated Press in Dakar. Looking sharp in a beige suit and a matching tie, he added: \u201cMy blood is from Senegal, but I feel Senegalese and Italian at the same time.\u201d",
      "Lame's appointment to UNICEF came at the end of a four-day visit to Senegal where he met children and young people who are driving positive change in their communities.",

    "story": [
      "Olivier Dubois, a French journalist, was kidnapped by JNIM, a branch of al-Qaida in Africa's Sahel region, while on his way to interview one of the group's leaders in northern Mali",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- For a foreign correspondent in Mali, the assignment seemed like a dream: as Islamic extremists upended the region, Olivier Dubois, a French journalist, secured a rare interview with a leader of JNIM, an al-Qaida\u2019s affiliate in the Sahel.",
      "Or so he thought. En route to the interview in Gao, northern Mali, in April 2021, Dubois, a correspondent for Lib\u00e9ration and Jeune Afrique publications, was kidnapped.",
      "He spent 711 days in desert captivity, sleeping chained to a tree, eating dried goat meat and plotting his escape. Nearly two years after his release, he recounts his ordeal in a book released Thursday in France that draws heavily on notes Dubois secretly kept during his captivity, written on any scrap of paper he could find.",
      "\u201cOne of the main factors that helped me resist and survive was telling myself that I am a journalist,\u201d Dubois told The Associated Press in the first interview for English-language media since his release. \"Let\u2019s continue to gather information, let\u2019s continue to ask questions and pretend I\u2019m working.\"",
      "The Sahel countries of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger in recent years have been upended by military coups and are now led by military juntas, which struggle against rising extremist violence and have made kidnappings a cornerstone of their strategy in the region.",
      "Upon his release, French media published an investigation revealing that Dubois's fixer had worked with French intelligence, who used him to locate the extremist leader he was trying to interview.",
      "Dubois told the AP he knew his project was risky, but that he trusted his fixer too much and ignored the warning signs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said of the circumstances surrounding his kidnapping. \u201cI think it was a betrayal. But the motive for the betrayal is not yet clear. I have not spoken to my fixer since I have been released.\u201d",
      "Kidnappings have skyrocketed in the Sahel in recent years, according to data from the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED.",
      "JNIM, the Sahelian branch of al-Qaida, has been responsible for most of the 1,468 kidnappings in Sahel and Benin between 2017 and 2025, according to the ACLED. The group relies on ransom money to fund their operations and on the fear they instill on local populations to keep them in check.",
      "Dubois recalled being told he would be \"released quickly\u201d if his family and government did as instructed.",
      "Dubois was released on March 20, 2023, in Agadez, Niger, but details of his release, including whether a ransom was paid, remain undisclosed.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron took to the social platform X to write \u201cOlivier Dubois is free,\" but he did not elaborate on the conditions of the release.",
      "Speaking to the AP, Dubois said that he did not know the details either, but he recalled being told by the rebels that ransoms varied by nationality. As a French citizen, he was worth 10 million euros, he was told. A South African was worth 50 million.",
      "Having covered numerous hostage stories in the region, Dubois knew that even if freed, his ordeal could be lengthy.",
      "In order to stay sane, he became obsessed with plotting an escape. But after the fourth unsuccessful attempt, his captors staged a mock execution and threatened to kill him if he tried again. So instead, Dubois started reading the Quran.",
      "Reading the holy book of Islam served a dual purpose: it occupied his mind, and helped him understand his captors better, be able to discuss with them and build a relationship, so they could treat him more as a human being and less as an anonymous hostage.",
      "Unexpectedly, it also put him on a more spiritual path.",
      "\"I am a former atheist, then an agnostic who thought I\u2019d stop there,\u201d he said. \u201cReading the Quran made me want to read other religious texts. This captivity has been the beginning of a journey that will perhaps lead me to God \u2014 or not.\u201d",
      "Now that his book \u2014 \u201cPrisonnier du d\u00e9sert, 711 jours aux mains d\u2019Al-Qa\u00efda,\u201d which translates in English into \u201cPrisoner of the desert, 711 days in the hands of Al-Qaida\u201d \u2014 is out, Dubois said he was hoping he was ready to go back to journalism and move on.",
      "But the experience still haunts him.",
      "\u201cIt was painful labour,\u201d he said of the writing process. \u201cThe first reflex after finishing it was to distance myself from the story, hoping time will pass and, maybe, all of that will be behind me. But I don't really know if that's possible.\u201d"

      "In a stretch of questioning crucial to the defense of A$AP Rocky, his lawyer is challenging the account of his accuser, who says he suffered a hand injury when the hip-hop performer fired a gun at him on a Hollywood street in 2021",
      "LOS ANGELES -- In a stretch of questioning crucial to the defense of A$AP Rocky, his lawyer on Friday challenged the account of his accuser, who said he suffered a hand injury when the hip-hop performer fired a gun at him in 2021.",
      "Superstar singer Rihanna, Rocky\u2019s partner and the mother of their two children, watched from the audience as the man who goes by A$AP Relli, a former friend of Rocky, underwent a second day of cross-examination at the Los Angeles trial that left him visibly frustrated and at times angry.",
      "She slipped into court for a third day about 30 minutes into the testimony and sat next to Rocky\u2019s mother after coming in through a public entrance. After the lunch break, she entered the courtroom together with Rocky for the first time. She had been brought in privately, out of view of the public, on her previous visits.",
      "Relli had testified under prosecution questioning that his hand felt hot when Rocky fired at him on a Hollywood street and his hand was grazed. A photo was shown of scrapes that had torn the skin on his knuckles.",
      "He did not seek medical attention until two days later in New York.",
      "\u201cYou waited to fly all the way across country before seeking medical attention?\u201d defense attorney Joe Tacopina asked.",
      "\u201cI had my hand wrapped that night,\u201d Relli said, then acknowledged he had.",
      "He said that after the incident, \u201cI didn't trust LA. I didn't trust nobody.\u201d",
      "Through their opening statement and the cross-examination, Rocky's attorneys have suggested Relli only sought medical attention because the lawyer in a separate civil case where he's seeking money from the rapper, told him he should.",
      "Relli at first denied that he had been acting on his lawyer's advice, but later conceded after hearing his previous testimony.",
      "\u201cYou really don\u2019t care about getting the police involved, your endgame was getting money from Rocky, correct?\u201d Tacopina asked.",
      "Relli answered, \u201cNo. I wanted protection. I wasn\u2019t sure it wouldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d",
      "Tacopina also challenged him about the short time he spent at the hospital.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one hour and 36 minutes for a gunshot, yeah?\u201d the lawyer said.",
      "\u201cIt was two days later,\u201d Relli replied.",
      "Anticipating the defense tactic, the prosecution told jurors during their opening statement that for the charges in the case \u2014 two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm \u2014 it doesn't matter whether Relli was injured.",
      "Relli appeared angry and frustrated throughout the testimony. He constantly asked if questions were relevant, muttered to himself, and had to be instructed by the judge to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d After listening to two different recordings of phone calls the defense said were him, he declared both were fake.",
      "Guilty findings on both counts could lead to a maximum of 24 years in prison for Rocky.",
      "That verdict could be a major turning point in the life of the rapper, who this weekend is nominated for his third Grammy Award at a ceremony at Crypto.com Arena just two miles from the trial.",
      "Rocky's attorneys are arguing, in a revelation made just before the trial began, that the gun he fired was a starter pistol that carried only blanks that he had just as a prop for security. They allege Relli knew this.",
      "Relli testified under prosecution questioning that he had not known Rocky to carry a gun.",
      "When Tacopina returned to the question, Relli hedged.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really chill with him every day, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the time I chill with him, I don\u2019t know him carrying guns.\u201d",
      "Tacopina continued, \u201cWell one thing you know, is for sure he doesn't carry a prop gun.\u201d",
      "\u201cWho carries a prop gun?\u201d Relli answered. \u201cWho\u2019s going to come to a situation and carry a prop gun?\u201d",
      "After the jury was dismissed for lunch, a vicious argument broke out between Tacopina and Deputy District Attorney John Lewin over a racy photo of Relli's girlfriend that he showed Relli to identify her.",
      "Lewin argued it was an attempt to inflame the witness, and that the defense's entire case failed to address the actual incident, including \u201cthis prop gun garbage!\u201d",
      "\u201cOh?! Oh!?\u201d Tacopina shouted back. \u201cWe'll see what the jury says at the end!\"",
      "Tacopina then called Relli a perjurer, and said that the prosecutors were abetting him.",
      "As it got even louder and more personal, the judge, who seemed disgusted, walked out.",
      "He had previously instructed the men, who have butted heads often, only to talk to each other on the record. In this case they were, though the cameras had been turned off.",
      "Rocky and Rihanna, both 36, have two sons together: 2-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and 1-year-old Riot Rose Mayers.",

      "Rihanna showed up at his Los Angeles trial \u2014 where he\u2019s charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm \u2014 for the first time on Wednesday, sitting between his sister and mother as his former friend testified about the moment he alleges Rocky fired at him.",
      "The singing superstar was escorted in and out of the courtroom surreptitiously, and was already sitting in Rocky\u2019s section before the jurors and the media entered. It\u2019s not clear if the jurors noticed she was there, but all other eyes in the room shifted to her.",
      "Wearing a long black dress with buttons that resembled an overcoat, she watched the proceedings calmly and periodically moved oversized, tortoiseshell glasses from atop her head to her eyes.",
      "The witness, who goes by A$AP Relli and was born Terell Ephron, described the night in November of 2021 when he and Rocky, their relationship straining, had a confrontation and scuffled on a Hollywood street, and Rocky pointed a gun at him before walking away.",

      "Incarcerated men in the Alabama prison system risked their safety to feed shocking footage of their horrifying living conditions to a pair of documentary filmmakers",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Incarcerated men in the Alabama prison system risked their safety to feed shocking footage of their horrifying living conditions to a pair of documentary filmmakers. The result is \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d which premiered this week at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City.",
      "Filmmakers Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman became interested in Alabama prisons in 2019. Jarecki, the filmmaker behind \u201cThe Jinx\u201d and \u201cCapturing the Friedmans,\u201d and Kaufman first gained access to the restricted grounds through a visit with a chaplain during a revival meeting held in the prison yards. There men pulled them aside and whispered shocking stories about the reality of life inside: forced labor, drugs, violence, intimidation, retaliation and the undisclosed truths behind many prisoner deaths.",
      "The Associated Press has written extensively about the problems in the state\u2019s prison system, including high rates of violence, low staffing, a plummeting parole rate and the use of pandemic funds to build a new supersized prison.",
      "This process eventually led them to incarcerated activists Melvin Ray and Robert Earl Council (also known as \u201cKinetik Justice\u201d) who had for years been trying to expose the horrifying conditions and deep- seated corruption across the system. They helped feed dispatches to the filmmakers with contraband cellphones.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re deeply concerned for their safety, and we have been since the first time we met them,\u201d said Kaufman. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this work for decades and as you see in the film, they\u2019ve been retaliated against in very extreme ways. But there are lawyers who are ready to do wellness checks and visit them and respond to any sort of retaliation that may come.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday at the first showing of the film, she had Council on the phone listening in. They put the microphone up to the cellphone so that Council could speak.",
      "\u201cWe thank you all for listening, for being interested,\u201d Council said. \u201cOn behalf of the brothers of Alabama, I thank you all.\u201d",
      "Several family members of their incarcerated subjects were also in the audience, including Sandy Ray, the mother of Steven Davis, who died in 2019 at William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility, his face beaten beyond recognition. Prison officials said Davis was killed in self-defense because he didn\u2019t put down his weapons. The prisoners tell a vastly different story.",
      "Alelur \u201cAlex\u201d Duran, who spent 12 years in prison in New York, also helped produce the film. Jarecki said they wouldn't have taken on the subject without the expertise of someone who had been incarcerated.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in this film is going on all over the nation,\u201d Duran said.",
      "Also embedded in the story is Alabama\u2019s long history of contracting prisoners to do work at private companies from Burger King to Best Western, an issue that the AP investigated for over two years. The cheap, reliable labor force has generated more than $250 million for the state since 2000 \u2014 money garnished from prisoners\u2019 paychecks, the AP wrote in December. Parole numbers have also plummeted in recent years.",
      "\u201cWe want to show viewers the truth about a system that has been cloaked in secrecy,\u201d Jarecki said. \u201cWe hope the film sparks an effort to allow access for journalists and others so the public can have transparency into how incarcerated citizens are treated and how our tax dollars are being spent. We hope to inspire Alabama\u2019s leadership to acknowledge the crisis and to overhaul its prison system and its use of forced labor.\u201d",
      "The film will have a theatrical release before it debuts on HBO sometime this year, but the specific dates and details are still being worked out. And while it is in its early days, the impact, Jarecki said, has already been seen, including in a class action labor lawsuit.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:02:29 -0500",
    "summary": "William E",
    "story": [
      "William E",
      "NEW YORK -- William E. Leuchtenburg, a prize-winning historian widely admired for his authoritative writings on the U.S. presidency and as the reigning scholar on Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal, has died at 102.",
      "Leuchtenburg died Tuesday at his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, according to his son, Joshua A. Leuchtenburg, who cited no specific cause of death.",
      "A professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina and a published author for more than 70 years, William E. Leuchtenburg was praised for his encyclopedic knowledge and rigorous, but accessible style. He received some of the top awards given to historians, including the Parkman and Bancroft prizes, was a political analyst for CBS and NBC and consulted on several of Ken Burns' PBS documentaries. In 2008, he was given the Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Award for \"Distinguished Writing\" of American history.",
      "Leuchtenburg's notable books include \"Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal\" and \"The Perils of Prosperity,\" a history of the U.S. from World War I to the peak of the Great Depression. Although politically liberal, his expertise called upon by aides to Lyndon Johnson and other Democratic politicians, he was as willing to point out the New Deal\u2019s disappointments as its successes: His scholarship was closely studied by younger FDR historians, from Jonathan Alter to Burns collaborator Geoffrey Ward, who dedicated the 2014 book \u201cThe Roosevelts\u201d to Leuchtenburg. And he was otherwise known for his generosity with Ward and others who sought his expertise.",
      "His most influential work was likely the Bancroft-winning \u201cFranklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal,\u201d published in 1963. Leuchtenburg found that the impact of FDR's vast and unprecedented response to the Depression was limited by political calculation, especially the president's reluctance to challenge racial segregation in the South, and that \u201cIt never demonstrated that it could achieve prosperity\" until the U.S. entered World War II. But he also credited the New Deal with transforming the role of federal government and Roosevelt with reinventing the presidency, using the young medium of radio to convince millions that he knew them personally.",
      "\u201cNothing is glossed over at all,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Charles Poore wrote upon the book\u2019s release. \u201cYou live here through years of tumult and disaster, triumph and ineptitude and daring.\u201d",
      "Leuchtenburg's books on Roosevelt covered his presidency and beyond. \"In the Shadow of FDR,\" published in 1983 and periodically updated, demonstrated how presidents from Truman to George W. Bush attempted to shun and/or embrace Roosevelt's legacy. Leuchtenburg wrote of Roosevelt's immediate successor, Harry Truman, gesturing in the White House to a portrait of FDR and admitting, \"I'm trying to do what he would like.\" He noted the frustration of Republican Dwight Eisenhower and Democrat John F. Kennedy in being compared, unfavorably, to Roosevelt, and how Jimmy Carter began his 1976 presidential run with a speech in Warm Springs, Georgia, where FDR often stayed. At the time of his death, Leuchtenburg was working on an edition that would have included the administration of Joe Biden, who kept a portrait of Roosevelt in the Oval Office.",
      "The 2005 book \"The White House Looks South\" featured sections on Roosevelt, Truman and Lyndon Johnson and told of how each embraced or distanced themselves from the South. Roosevelt, a native of New York, spent so much time in Warm Springs that the state's governor referred to him as our \"fellow-Georgian.\" Johnson, a Texan, alternately identified himself as a Southerner or a Westerner, depending on the intended audience.",
      "In the prologue, Leuchtenburg fondly noted his own journey, remembering visits to baseball spring training camps in Florida, marching with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Montgomery, Alabama, and never failing on New Year's Day to partake of black-eyed peas and collard greens, \"even if they are eaten with a grimace.\"",
      "\"In sum, I am in, but not of, the South,\" he concluded.",
      "He was a popular and rigorous educator \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201cThe Big L\u201d \u2014 who taught at Smith College, Harvard University and Columbia University before settling at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the early 1980s. A former president of the American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians, he held such stature that he contributed to later editions of \"The Growth of the American Republic,\" a standard college textbook originally written by Henry Steele Commager and Samuel Eliot Morison. Historians studying under him ranged from Allan Brandt to Howard Zinn.",
      "Leuchtenburg was married twice, most recently to Jean Anne Leuchtenburg, and had three children.",
      "A postal clerk's son born in New York City in 1922, William Edward Leuchtenburg was so fascinated by politics that at age 12, he raised money tutoring neighborhood kids to fund a nine-hour bus ride to Washington, where he would recall his \"wide-eyed\" tour of the White House and the \"brand-new marble palace of the U.S. Supreme Court.\"",
      "His affinity for Roosevelt was lifelong and personal. When he was 10, he sat by the radio and counted delegates as FDR was elected to his first term as president. He was able to afford college with help from a job found through a New Deal program, the National Youth Administration.",
      "Leuchtenburg graduated from Cornell University, received a master's degree and a doctorate from Columbia and worked for a civil rights lobby and other political organizations before deciding to focus on history. His first book, \u201cFlood Control Politics,\u201d came out in 1953, followed five years later by \u201cThe Perils of Prosperity.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Leuchtenburg wrote a short, critical biography of FDR\u2019s predecessor, Herbert Hoover, and the 900-page \u201cThe American President: From Teddy Roosevelt to Bill Clinton.\u201d He continued to work every morning and, at age 101, completed \u201cPatriot Presidents,\u201d the first of a planned multi-volume history that he acknowledged in the book's preface \u201cmay be too ambitious.\u201d"

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Rihanna appeared for the first time at the trial of her longtime partner A$AP Rocky, on the day of its most important testimony \u2014 the description by a former friend of the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him.",
      "The singer superstar, who has two toddler sons with the rapper Rocky, sat out of view of the courtroom\u2019s cameras, between Rocky\u2019s mother and sister, in the downtown Los Angeles criminal courthouse. Security brought her in surreptitiously to avoid crowds Wednesday morning.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Athelston Mayers, has been standing trial on two felony charges that he fired a handgun at the former friend, who is known by the name A$AP Relli and was born Terell Ephron. If convicted, Rocky could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "Rihanna watched Wednesday as Relli testified about the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him on a Hollywood street in 2021.",
      "He had been shouting angrily at Rocky, who was walking away after an initial confrontation and scuffle, when Rocky pulled a gun from his waistband and held it in the air, Relli testified.",
      "\u201cHe turned around and then it was like BOOM!\u201d he told the jury. \u201cThe whole thing was like a movie, he kind of like pointed down and he shot the first shot.\"",

      "The trial's key witness said he grabbed one of their mutual friends who were with Rocky after the first shot was fired and stood behind him for protection. He said he did not see Rocky fire the second shot, and Rocky ran away moments later.",
      "When jurors were being selected, prosecutors asked them whether Rihanna\u2019s connection to the case, especially if she appeared in court, would affect their ability to deliver a guilty verdict.",
      "Nearly all those questioned had heard of her \u2014 far more than had heard of Rocky \u2014 and some described themselves as fans, but all said they felt it would not affect their decisions.",
      "It was not clear whether they could see Rihanna or were aware of her presence as they watched the testimony. She wore a long black dress with buttons on the front that resembled a winter overcoat, and had a pair of glasses on her head that she put on during the prosecution's questioning.",
      "Earlier in the trial, which began on Jan. 21, Relli said he and Rocky, members of A$AP, a crew of creators at a New York high school, had been close but their relationship eroded after Rocky became famous.",
      "He said their relationship had been strained for years and was getting worse in the days leading up to the incident, but he was still \u201cfurious\u201d when Rocky pulled a gun on him after a scuffle that began the moment the two met up near the W Hotel. He dared him to use it.",

      "Rocky\u2019s lawyer says the shots he fired were not even from a real gun \u2014 they were blanks from a starter pistol that he carried as a prop. The lawyer said Relli knew this, and that was why he was so fearless walking after him.",
      "\u201cOh it was a real gun,\u201d Relli testified Wednesday, saying he knew because of his scraped hand.",
      "He said he felt free to follow and shout at Rocky because \u201cI felt like because he put it away and we\u2019re on a busy street in Hollywood. He\u2019s definitely not gonna shoot it.\u201d",
      "Since the shooting, and his decision to go to police and testify, he has gotten death threats and has been shunned as a snitch, he said, and the modest music management career he built fell apart.",
      "\u201cIt's been a living hell,\u201d Relli said.",
      "About an hour after the shooting, Relli returned to the scene and said he photographed and recovered two shell casings. Earlier, while responding to a report of a shooting, police did not find any.",
      "He sent a text to Rocky that was shown in court saying \"U try killing me.\"",

      "Raised in Harlem, Rocky\u2019s rap songs became a phenomenon in New York in 2011. He had his mainstream breakthrough when his first studio album went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2013. The second one, in 2015, did the same.",

      "Snaking traffic, screaming crowds, and a crush of photographers descended on the Grand Palais as Chanel unveiled its final collection before Matthieu Blazy\u2019s highly anticipated debut as creative director",
      "PARIS -- Snaking traffic, screaming crowds, and a crush of photographers descended on the Grand Palais on Tuesday as Chanel unveiled its final collection before Matthieu Blazy\u2019s highly anticipated debut as creative director. Kylie Jenner led a constellation of stars, seated atop two giant interlocking C\u2019s raised like a bridge \u2014 perhaps a metaphor for the house\u2019s transition to its bold new chapter.",
      "Critics expecting an underwhelming, designer-less show were swiftly proven wrong. Chanel\u2019s studio punched above its weight, delivering a collection of striking hues and diverse designs showcasing its couture ateliers\u2019 unrivaled artistry.",
      "For a designer famous for revolutionizing fashion with the use of black, this collection went against the grain. Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel\u2019s lesser-known talent as a colorist took center stage, with joyful pastels, bold tones, midnight blue, and classic black following a complete cycle from day to night \u2014 something like a \u201cgreatest hits\u201d collection on the eve of the reboot.",
      "The runway pieces struck a balance between whimsy and drama. Beyond the house's bread-and-butter tweed skirt suits, leg-of-mutton sleeves brought historical grandeur, evoking a sense of Victorian elegance. Sequins and paillettes shimmered under the bring Grand Palais light. Silk trains in bold red injected a sense of drama. Playful neckties hinted at a 1970s influence.",
      "A standout piece was a satin pastel yellow gown with delicate buttons running down the front, exuding the glamour of old Hollywood while maintaining a fresh feel.",
      "But the devil at Chanel couture is in the detail \u2014 the buttons.",
      "Buttons in rock crystal, metal, and rhinestone ones adorned jackets, skirts, and dresses, adding a quiet brilliance to the vibrant collection.",
      "The audience was a testament to Chanel\u2019s unmatched global power, boasting one of the most prestigious guestlists of Paris Fashion Week. And not just Kylie Jenner perched atop the double-C decor.",
      "Global ambassadors Jennie, the K-pop superstar from BLACKPINK, G-Dragon, and Lily-Rose Depp sat alongside Dua Lipa, Marion Cotillard, and actresses Elsa Zylberstein and Antonia Desplat.",
      "Among the star-studded crowd, Pamela Anderson, who's been seen at shows all week was flanked by teams of menacing security guards.",
      "The chatter centered on the maison\u2019s impending creative shift. Virginie Viard, who succeeded Karl Lagerfeld in 2019, parted ways with Chanel last year following tepid reviews. One guest Tuesday summed up the mood bluntly: \u201cEven the studio show seems better than what Viard did,\u201d capturing the widespread belief that Chanel needed fresh vision.",
      "Blazy, who arrives with a reputation for craftsmanship and innovation. Most recently, he was creative director at Bottega Veneta.",
      "He reportedly inherits a maison in robust financial health, providing a solid foundation for his ambitious vision.",
      "Despite the mixed reception, under Viard's tenure, Chanel saw record sales, with revenue reaching a reported $19.7 billion in 2023, including a 23% increase in ready-to-wear sales.",
      "As Chanel couture celebrates its 110th anniversary, the house released a special film giving an insider\u2019s look at its iconic Rue Cambon headquarters. Featuring Vanessa Paradis, Marion Cotillard, and Naomi Campbell, the film delves into the intricacies of couture craftsmanship.",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum, which he said will be renovated and expanded in a major overhaul within the next ten years",
      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron announced Tuesday that the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum under a major renovation and expansion of the Paris landmark that will take up to 10 years.",
      "The renovation project, branded \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d will include a new entrance near the River Seine, to be opened by 2031, and the creation of underground rooms, Macron said in a speech from the Louvre room where Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece is displayed.",
      "Macron did not disclose an exact amount budgeted for the project to modernize the most visited museum in the world, plagued with overcrowding and outdated facilities. But it is estimated to reach up to 800 million euros ($834 million).",
      "The Louvre's latest overhaul dates back to the 1980s, when the iconic glass pyramid was unveiled. Now, the museum is not up to international standards anymore.",
      "A look at what's at stake:",
      "Macron said the expansion of the museum will allow the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d to be moved to a new, dedicated room accessible to visitors through a special ticket. That will make the visit simpler for those who want to see the painting and ease the life of other visitors in the rest of the museum, he said.",
      "The \u201cMona Lisa\u201d is now being shown behind protective glass in the museum\u2019s largest room, overcrowded with long, noisy queues of visitors eager to take a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s masterpiece. That makes some other paintings in the room by the greatest Venetian painters like Titian and Veronese go unnoticed by many.",
      "The museum\u2019s latest big renovation in the 1980s was designed to receive 4 million annual visitors.",
      "Last year, the Louvre received 8.7 million visitors, over three-quarters being foreigners mostly from the United States, China and neighboring countries Italy, the UK, Germany and Spain.",
      "Macron said a new entrance for the Louvre will be created near the River Seine by 2031, to be financed by ticket sales, patronage and licensing money from the museum's Abu Dhabi branch.",
      "A design competition is to be staged in the coming months, he said. In addition, some new underground rooms will be created to expand the museum.",
      "A French top official said the cost of the renovation is estimated at 700 to 800 million euros ($730 to 834 million) over the next ten years, including half for the creation of the new entrance. The official could not be named in line with the French presidency\u2019s customary practices.",
      "Macron said ticket prices will be raised for foreign visitors from outside the European Union, up from 22 euros ($23) now. He promised the museum will be safer and more comfortable for both the public and the staff.",
      "Half the Louvre's budget is currently being financed by the French state, including the wages of the 2,200 employees.",
      "The other half is provided by private funds including ticket sales, earnings from restaurants, shops and bookings for special events, as well as patrons and other partners.",
      "The renovation announcement comes after Louvre Director Laurence des Cars expressed her concerns in a note to Culture Minister Rachida Dati earlier this month saying the museum is threatened by \u201cobsolescence.\u201d",
      "According to the document first released by French newspaper Le Parisien, she warned about the gradual degradation of the building due to water leaks, temperature variations and other issues \u201cendangering the preservation of artworks.\u201d",
      "The pyramid that serves at the museum\u2019s entrance, unveiled in 1989 as part of late President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s project, now appears outdated. The place is not properly insulated from the cold and the heat and tends to amplify noise, making the space uncomfortable for both the public and the staff, des Cars stressed.",
      "In addition, the museum suffers from a lack of food offerings and restroom facilities, she said."

      "The Grammys will look a little bit different this year",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Grammy Awards will look a little bit different this week.",
      "Each year, the Recording Academy hosts a multitude of events to welcome the music industry during Grammy week and record labels do the same. However, many institutions have canceled their plans \u2014 Universal Music Group, Sony, Spotify, BMG and Warner Music Group among them \u2014 and instead are allocating resources to help those affected by the devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires.",
      "The Grammys will still take place on Sunday at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles but now will focus its attention on helping wildfire victims.",
      "Within days of fires ravaging the Pacific Palisades and Altadena neighborhoods, the Recording Academy and its affiliated MusiCares charity launched the Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort with a $1 million dollar donation. According to a letter sent to members on Jan. 13, thanks to additional contributions, they\u2019ve already distributed $2 million in emergency aid.",
      "Once the fund was set up, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason jr. said they began focusing on reformatting what Grammy week would look like \u2014 many conversations conducted \u201con the road, mobile-y, virtually\u201d as staffers had evacuated their homes.",
      "\u201cThat process has really consisted of reaching out to just listen and learn from a lot of people \u2014 state officials, local officials, the governor\u2019s office, the mayor\u2019s office, the fire department. We talked to hotel managers, just really trying to get a grasp on what was happening currently. What did they project was going to happen in the next week to 10 days? Would be safe to have a show?\"",
      "Ultimately, the Recording Academy decided to condense its pre-Grammy week plans to just four events, each featuring a fundraising element.",
      "On Friday, MusiCares, an organization that helps music professionals who need financial, personal or medical assistance, will hold its annual Persons of the Year benefit gala\u2009celebrating the Grateful Dead.",
      "On Saturday, the Special Merit Awards Ceremony and Grammy nominees' reception will still take place, followed by Clive Davis' pre-Grammy fundraising event.",
      "Then the Grammys take the stage on Sunday.",
      "Events like the annual pre-Grammy Black Music Collective event, Grammy advocacy brunch, and others scheduled to take place at the immersive pop-up Grammy house have been canceled.",
      "\u201cWe thought consolidating the events would allow us to have more impact,\u201d Mason explains. \u201cAnd we just don\u2019t feel it was the right time to have social gatherings or places to party or schmooze and just hang out. We wanted to have our events be places that could be purposeful and impactful. Some of the party settings, we decided to fold down into our fundraising efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cObviously, we can\u2019t have a normal show in the midst of people\u2019s belongings being burned or loss of life or other things like that. At the same time, canceling would not have helped,\u201d Mason says.",
      "\u201cWe needed to raise money. We needed to show unity and come together around music. We need to support the city of L.A. (Over) 6,500 people work on our shows and ancillary gatherings. So, once we decided to move forward, it was really a conversation with (Grammy producers) Ben Winston, Raj Kapoor and Jesse Collins and myself. And we started to think about, \u2018How do we make the show have the greatest impact?\u2019\u201d",
      "They decided the path forward was to still give out awards and host performances to give viewers and attendees a bespoke concert experience. But most importantly, the show could raise awareness, drive donations and resources to funds that benefit people in need.",
      "And the conversations are ongoing. \u201cWe have some great things in the show that will definitely help to raise funds,\" he assures. \"It will honor some of the heroes that have been protecting our lives and our homes. It will hopefully shine a light on some people that need more help and more services.\u201d",
      "Don't expect a traditional telethon, but he says the show will feature announcements and activations in the arena.",
      "\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll be talking about things that have been pledged from the sponsors or from the community,\u201d he adds.",
      "\u201cWe know right off the bat that we\u2019ve got almost 3,000 requests for help from our members or people in the music community,\u201d Mason says. \u201cSo that was just in the first few days.\u201d",
      "The immediate needs have been \u201cthe basics,\u201d as he explains. \u201cFood, water, shelter, the bare necessities to live.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe next phase will involve, you know, where they\u2019re going to live, how are they going to replace maybe damaged or destroyed instruments, studios. How will they make a living? I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some mental health component that people may need assistance with. But it\u2019s really across the board. But the early, immediate relief is around just the bare necessities.\u201d",
      "There's no shortage of natural disasters, and they affect the music community too. Mason brings up the COVID-19 pandemic as a recent example. With MusiCares, they were able to contribute \u201cover $40 million to people who needed help.\u201d They have the infrastructure to provide assistance quickly.",
      "However, he notes, the Grammys are the first major award show taking place after the wildfires, which means \u201cthere's no playbook for this.\"",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019ve always said it all changes if the fires were to continue, or possibly got worse, or the winds changed. So, I always want to reserve that right. We\u2019re not going to go blindly forward if things are unsafe or if it feels inappropriate,\" he says.",
      "But consider the fundraising, the economic and financial impacts, and the possibility of unity, \u201cIt all makes sense for us to move forward.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- A New York judge set a March 2026 trial date on Monday and moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week as the public feud between Blake Lively and her \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d costar and director Justin Baldoni continued to grow and accelerate.",
      "And in a new and separate front in the series of legal battles surrounding the film that became a surprise hit last summer, Lively in a Texas court filed a request for a deposition of a man she says was central to turning online sentiment against her during its release and promotion.",
      "The New York federal judge, Lewis J. Liman, told both sides in an order late Monday to prepare for a March 9, 2026, trial.",
      "He also moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week and told lawyers to be prepared to address complaints about pretrial publicity and attorney conduct.",
      "Liman took the actions after Lively\u2019s lawyers claimed in a filing on Monday that an attorney for Baldoni was trying to taint potential jurors over lawsuits the actors have filed against each other.",
      "The lawyers said Baldoni\u2019s attorney was trying to wreck Lively\u2019s career and turn potential New York jurors against her by creating a website to release selected documents and communications between Lively and Baldoni.",
      "The lawyers said attorney Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni, was \u201cengaging in this extrajudicial campaign to influence these proceedings and the public perception of legal filings to this Court, and there already is a serious risk that his misconduct is tainting the jury pool.\u201d",
      "They added: \u201cThe endless stream of defamatory and extrajudicial media statements must end.\u201d",
      "Freedman said in a statement in response to Monday's assertions that the \u201cirony is not lost on anyone that Ms. Lively is so petrified of the truth that she has moved to gag it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will always respect the court; however, we will never be bullied by those suggesting we cannot defend our clients with pure, unedited facts,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cAll we want is for people to see the actual text messages that directly contradict her allegations, video footage that clearly shows there was no sexual harassment and all the other powerful evidence that directly contradicts any false allegations.\u201d",
      "In a letter to the judge on Thursday, Baldoni attorney Kevin Fritz accused Lively of a publicity campaign that left Baldoni and other defendants the \u201cobjects of public scorn and contempt.\u201d",
      "He said the actions had damaged those she sued so that they were \u201cexiled from polite society and suffered damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars due to Ms. Lively\u2019s scorched-earth media campaign.\u201d",
      "In the separate filing in Hays County, Texas, a precursor to another potential lawsuit, Lively asks for an order for a deposition from Jed Wallace, a crisis management specialist she alleges was behind much of the social media manipulation surrounding the film that turned public sentiment against her through posts on Reddit and TikTok.",
      "Wallace and his Texas-based firm Street Relations were brought on as subcontractors by publicists working with Baldoni and his production company, the filing said.",
      "\u201cHe weaponized a digital army around the country, including in New York and Los Angeles, to create, seed, manipulate, and advance disparaging content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums,\u201d the filing alleges.",
      "Wallace is identified in Lively's federal lawsuit, but he is not a defendant.",
      "Freedman, who the filing says is Wallace's lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment on the issue.",
      "Lively sued Baldoni, his production company and others in New York in late December for sexual harassment and attacks on her reputation and asked for unspecified damages. Baldoni sued earlier this month, accusing Lively and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d actor Ryan Reynolds, of defamation and extortion and seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "The judge said Monday that he'll likely combine the lawsuits for trial.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel that begins as a romance but takes a dark turn into domestic violence, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie\u2019s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing through Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing into Egypt on Saturday for treatment",
      "RAFAH CROSSING, Egypt -- A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing to Egypt for treatment through Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing on Saturday, the first opening of the border since Israel captured it nearly nine months ago.",
      "The reopening of the Rafah crossing represents a significant breakthrough that bolsters the ceasefire deal Israel and Hamas agreed last month. Israel agreed to reopen the crossing after Hamas released the last living female hostages in Gaza.",
      "Egypt's Al-Qahera television showed at least two Palestinian Red Cross ambulances pulling up to the crossing gate. Several children were brought out on gurneys and transferred to ambulances on the Egyptian side. From there, they were rushed to hospitals in the nearby Egyptian city of el-Arish and elsewhere. Footage showed one young girl whose foot had been amputated.",
      "Zaher al-Wahidi, an official with Gaza's Health Ministry, said 37 of the children had crossed into Egypt by Saturday evening.",
      "The Health Ministry said around 60 family members were accompanying the children.",
      "The children are the first in what are meant to be regular evacuations of Palestinians through the crossing for treatment abroad.",
      "Over the past 15 months, Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in retaliation for the militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel has decimated Gaza\u2019s health sector, leaving most of its hospitals out of operation even as more than 110,000 Palestinians were wounded by Israel\u2019s bombardment and ground offensives, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.",
      "Remaining facilities are unable to perform many crucial treatments or specialized surgeries for wounds or diseases. Mohammed Zaqout, the director of hospitals in Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, said more than 6,000 patients were ready to be evacuated abroad, and more than 12,000 patients were in urgent need of treatment. He said the small numbers set to be evacuated will not cover the need, \u201cand we hope the number will increase.\u201d",
      "Rafah is Gaza\u2019s only crossing that does not enter into Israel. Israeli forces closed the crossing in early May after seizing it during an offensive on the southern city. Egypt shut down its side of the passage in protest.",
      "Even before the Gaza war began, the Rafah crossing represented a crucial escape valve from the territory, where a 15-year Israeli-Egyptian blockade aimed at containing Hamas undermined health facilities and impoverished the population. Palestinians routinely applied for permission to travel outside the territory for lifesaving treatments not available in Gaza, including chemotherapy.",
      "It took some diplomatic gymnastics to reopen the crossing and overcome security disputes between Israeli, Egyptian and Palestinian officials. Hamas had overseen the border since 2007, when it took control of Gaza from its rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, or PA, after winning parliamentary elections in 2006.",
      "Israeli troops remain at the Rafah crossing and in the Philadelphia Corridor, a band of land running the length of the border. Israel has refused to allow Hamas to resume management of the crossing, accusing it of smuggling weapons through tunnels under the border, though Egypt says it destroyed the tunnels from its side and stopped smuggling years ago. Israel also refuses to allow the Palestinian Authority to officially run the crossing.",
      "Instead, the crossing will be staffed by Palestinians from Gaza who previously served as border officers with the PA, but they will not be allowed to wear official PA insignia, a European diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to brief the media. Israel has screened the officers to ensure they have no affiliation with Hamas, the European diplomat added.",
      "European Union monitors will also be present, as they were before 2007.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase of the deal \u2014 which calls for a permanent ceasefire, full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of any remaining hostages \u2014 are supposed to begin Monday. Israel has resisted the notion that the PA would control postwar Gaza."

      "The policy did not cover the cost of abortions, and it\u2019s not clear how many of the 12 trips were for abortions or other type of reproductive health care, such as IVF treatment. That specific medical information is protected by health privacy law.",
      "In his memo at the time, Austin said service members and their families were worried they may not get equal access to health care, including abortions. And he noted that service members who often must move for various missions or training would be forced to travel farther, take more time off work and pay more to access reproductive health care.",
      "The problem, Austin said, would create extraordinary hardship and \"interfere with our ability to recruit, retain, and maintain the readiness of a highly qualified force.\u201d",
      "He ordered the department to allow troops and dependents, consistent with federal law, to take time off and use official travel to get to other states for reproductive care not available locally. That care includes in vitro fertilization and other pregnancy aids that also may not be accessible close by.",
      "Under federal law, Defense Department medical facilities can perform abortions only when the life of the pregnant person is at risk or in cases of rape or incest, and those instances have been extremely rare. According to the department, there were 91 abortions performed in military medical facilities between 2016 and 2021."

    "story": [
      "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world\u2019s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rat infestation in many world cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington, and a new study blames climate change, urbanization and other human actions.",
      "A first-of-its-kind examination of trends and reasons in hard-to-count rat populations uses rat sighting reports in 16 cities around the world. In 11 of those cities, rat complaints have increased, according to a study in Friday's journal Science Advances.",
      "Based on individual trends within cities, Washington was by far the leader in rat increases, followed by San Francisco, Toronto, New York City and Amsterdam. Washington's rising rat reporting trend was three times greater than Boston's and 50% more than New York's, the study said. Washington city officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Only three cities saw significant decreasing trends \u2014 New Orleans, Louisville and Tokyo \u2014 with the home of Mardi Gras showing the biggest drop in rat reporting. Experts said the Louisiana city can teach others how to combat the rat problem.",
      "Researchers did a statistical analysis of the rising rat reporting in those cities and concluded that slightly more than 40% of the trend seen is due to warming temperatures from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. And that comes down to sex and food, said study lead author Jonathan Richardson, a biologist at the University of Richmond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these increasing trends in rats in cities that are warming the fastest, probably because this is a small mammal that has physiological challenges in the cold weather months,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIf we're warming the climate and winter starts a week or two later and spring arrives a week or two earlier, that's one, two, maybe even three or four weeks across the entire year where those rats can be above ground foraging, acquiring more food and maybe squeezing out one or two more reproductive cycles. \u201d",
      "An extra month may not sound like much, but female rats can have a litter every month. Each litter is eight to 16 baby rats, Richardson said: \u201cThat is a recipe for accelerated population growth.\u201d",
      "Researchers pointed to two other big statistical links \u2014 that fit with known biological issues \u2014 behind more rat reports: the increase in urbanization and more densely populated cities.",
      "Rats like the built-up environment and being near people and their waste, the study and outside scientists said. They essentially eat at the same table as humans, multiple experts said.",
      "\u201cThe rat is the third most successful mammal behind humans and house mice. So it evolved and engineered to live alongside us,\u201d New York City rat czar Kathleen Corradi said during a break at a New Orleans conference on improving pest management. \u201cThey followed humans, Homo sapiens, across the continents and are in every single continent except Antarctica. So it's considered a wicked problem.\u201d",
      "Even though rats are intelligent and highly adaptive, Richardson and other experts said they are a serious problem for people.",
      "\u201cWhen rodent populations are high, people get sick, motor vehicles become disabled, mental health declines, fires are started and foods fouled,\u201d said Houston rat expert Michael Parsons, who wasn't part of the study. People are rightly bothered by rats because of \u201can innate fear caused by an organism that can make us sick.\u201d",
      "Researchers have not had good figures on rats. Because of the way they live and hide, they are not as easily counted as other critters, so this is one of the first attempts to quantify them. The study is not really a count of rats, but of complaints by people.",
      "Because the statistics go back years and only cities that haven't changed their reporting methods were looked at, Richardson said the trends they spotted have scientific merit. Even though Washington has the highest increasing trend that doesn't mean it has more rats or even rat sightings, it is just that the numbers within the city are increasing fastest, he said.",
      "Several outside experts said the study is legitimate, sensible and was sorely needed.",
      "\u201cThis paper is by far the largest data-driven effort to understand changes in urban rat populations ever attempted,\u201d said Drexel University ecology professor Jason Munshi-South, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Looking at the few cities where rat reports are down may help in the fight against rats, Richardson and Corradi said. The answer is not more poison or traps, but prevention, the study said.",
      "\u201cIn New Orleans they make a big effort to get out into neighborhoods and do educational workshops and campaigns to talk to residents about what makes a property less likely to have rats,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "New York City's recently stepped up rat-fighting, which includes replacing garbage in bags on the street with rat-resistant containers, hasn't quite shown up in Richardson's data yet, but rat czar Corradi said early results are encouraging. The city has signed people up for what it calls an elite squad of rat fighters, named \" NYC rat pack.\u201d",
      "It's an uphill battle.",
      "\u201cAs our cities warm, urbanize and (increase in) density, we create more resources for rats which could result in further increases in numbers,\u201d Simon Fraser University health and rat scientist Kaylee Byers said in an email.",
      "We can fight them better, but in the end people \u201cneed to coexist with wildlife in urban environments, even with rats,\u201d University of Michigan conservation scientist Neil Carter said.",
      "\u201cZero rats is impossible,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut I think an expectation that we need to live with the number of rats that we're seeing in many of these cities is also an unhealthy perspective on this problem.\u201d",

      "A New York doctor has been indicted by a Lousiana grand jury for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "Carpenter did not immediately return a message.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we\u2019ve witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women\u2019s rights,\u201d the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s indictment could be the first direct test of New York\u2019s shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cWe always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn\u2019t the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That\u2019s why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They\u2019re also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed."

      "The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen sea and under siege from a contagious disease known as the \u201cstrangling angel\u201d for the way it suffocated children",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome faced a bleak winter. It was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen sea and unrelenting blizzards, and under siege from a contagious disease known as the \u201cstrangling angel\u201d for the way it suffocated children.",
      "Now, 100 years later, Nome is remembering its saviors \u2014 the sled dogs and mushers who raced for more than five days through hypothermia, frostbite, gale-force winds and blinding whiteouts to deliver life-saving serum and free the community from the grip of diphtheria.",
      "Among the events celebrating the centennial of the 1925 \u201cGreat Race of Mercy\u201d are lectures, a dog-food drive and a reenactment of the final leg of the relay, all organized by the Nome Kennel Club.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fluff around celebrations like this, but we wanted to remember the mushers and their dogs who have been at the center of this heroic effort and ... spotlight mushing as a still-viable thing for the state of Alaska,\u201d said Diana Haecker, a kennel club board member and co-owner of Alaska\u2019s oldest newspaper, the Nome Nugget.",
      "\u201cPeople just dropped whatever they were doing,\" she said. \"These mushers got their teams ready and went, even though it was really cold and challenging conditions on the trail.\u201d",
      "Other communities are also marking the anniversary \u2014 including the village of Nenana, where the relay began, and Cleveland, Ohio, where the serum run's most famous participant, a husky mix named Balto, is stuffed and displayed at a museum.",
      "Jonathan Hayes, a Maine resident who has been working to preserve the genetic line of sled dogs driven on the run by famed musher Leonhard Seppala, is recreating the trip. Hayes left Nenana on Monday with 16 Seppala Siberian sled dogs, registered descendants of Seppala's team.",
      "Diphtheria is an airborne disease that causes a thick, suffocating film to develop at the back of the throat; it was once a leading cause of death for children. The antitoxin used to treat it was developed in 1890, and a vaccine in 1923; it is now exceedingly rare in the U.S.",
      "Nome, western Alaska\u2019s largest community, had about 1,400 residents a century ago. Its most recent supply ship had arrived the previous fall, before the Bering Sea froze, without any doses of the antitoxin. Those the local doctor, Curtis Welch, had were outdated, but he wasn't worried. He hadn\u2019t seen a case of diphtheria in the 18 years he had practiced in the area.",
      "Within months, that changed. In a telegram, Welch pleaded with the U.S. Public Health Service to send serum: \"An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here.\u201d",
      "The first death was a 3-year-old boy on Jan. 20, 1925, followed the next day by a 7-year-old girl. By the end of the month, there were more than 20 confirmed cases. The city was placed under quarantine.",
      "West Coast hospitals had antitoxin doses, but it would take time to get them to Seattle and then onto a ship for Seward, an ice-free port south of Anchorage. In the meantime, enough for 30 people was found at an Anchorage hospital.",
      "It still had to get to Nome. Airplanes with open-air cockpits were ruled out as unsuited for the weather. There were no roads or trains that reached Nome.",
      "Instead, officials shipped the serum by rail to Nenana in interior Alaska, some 675 miles (1,086 kilometers) from Nome via the frozen Yukon River and mail trails.",
      "Thanks to Alaska\u2019s new telegraph lines and the spread of radio, the nation followed along, captivated, as 20 mushers \u2014 many of them Alaska Natives \u2014 with more than 150 dogs relayed the serum to Nome. They battled deep snow, whiteouts so severe they couldn\u2019t see the dogs in front of them, and life-threatening temperatures that plunged at times to minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 51 degrees Celsius).",
      "The antitoxin was transported in glass vials covered with padded quilts. Not a single vial broke.",
      "Seppala, a Norwegian settler, left from Nome to meet the supply near the halfway point and begin the journey back. His team, led by his dog Togo, traveled more than 250 miles (320 kilometers) of the relay, including a treacherous stretch across frozen Norton Sound.",
      "After about 5 1/2 days, the serum reached its destination on Feb. 2, 1925. A banner front-page headline in the San Francisco Chronicle proclaimed: \u201cDogs victors over blizzard in battle to succor stricken Nome.\u201d",
      "The official record listed five deaths and 29 illnesses. It\u2019s likely the toll was higher; Alaska Natives were not accurately tracked.",
      "Seppala and Togo missed the limelight that went to his assistant, Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the dog team led by Balto into Nome. Balto was another of Seppala\u2019s dogs, but was used to only haul freight after he was deemed too slow to be on a competitive team.",
      "Balto was immortalized in movies and with statues in New York's Central Park and one in Anchorage intended as a tribute to all sled dogs. He received a bone-shaped key to the city of Los Angeles, where legendary movie actress Mary Pickford placed a wreath around his neck.",
      "But he and several team members were eventually sold and kept in squalid conditions at a dime museum in Los Angeles. After learning of their plight, an Ohio businessman spearheaded an effort to raise money to bring them to Cleveland. After dying in 1933, Balto was mounted and placed on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",
      "Today, the most famous mushing event in the world is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which is not based on the serum run but on the Iditarod Trail, a supply route from Seward to Nome. Iditarod organizers are nevertheless marking the serum run's centennial, with a series of articles on its website and by selling replicas of the medallions each serum run musher received a century ago, race spokesperson Shannon Noonan said in an email. This year's Iditarod starts March 1.",
      "\u201cThe Serum Run demonstrated the critical role sled dogs played in the survival and communication of remote Alaskan communities, while the Iditarod has evolved into a celebration of that tradition and Alaska\u2019s pioneering spirit,\u201d Noonan said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s famous name, populist stances and loyal following have earned him President Donald Trump's support, but will that get him the votes he needs from the Republican-controlled Senate to become the nation's top health official?",
      "If approved, Kennedy will control a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees food and hospital inspections, hundreds of health clinics, vaccine recommendations and health insurance for roughly half the country.",
      "His confirmation hearings are set before the Senate finance committee on Wednesday and the Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee on Thursday.",
      "Here's what to watch during his confirmation hearings:",
      "Over many years, Kennedy has been clear about his beliefs on vaccines in dozens of interviews, podcasts and social media posts.",
      "He's headed up a nonprofit that has sued the government over its authorizations of vaccines. He's said there is \u201c no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and repeatedly called for further study of routine childhood vaccinations, despite decades of research and real-world use that proves they've safely prevented disease.",
      "But more recently, Kennedy has tried to downplay his past remarks and work, saying he's not anti-vaccine and promising not to \u201ctake away\u201d the shots.",
      "The health committee chairman, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also has expressed concerns about Kennedy's anti-vaccine work. A physician, Cassidy said earlier this month he \u201chad a frank conversation\u201d and \u201cspoke about vaccines at length\u201d with Kennedy. On Tuesday, Cassidy told reporters that he is still unsure if he is backing Trump\u2019s nominee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still working through it,\u201d Cassidy said during a press availability with Louisiana reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI look forward to the hearings and I will allow that to guide my decision.\u201d",
      "The intensity of the questioning on vaccines over the next two days could provide clues for how other Republicans \u2014 like Sen. Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor who represents Kentucky \u2014 might consider Kennedy\u2019s nomination.",
      "Some of the country's most conservative lawmakers have been worried about how Kennedy will handle abortion as health secretary.",
      "Republican Sen. James Lankford, who sits on the finance committee, is expected to grill Kennedy, a longtime Democrat, on the issue during Wednesday's hearing. Lankford is seen as a possible \u201cno\u201d vote over Kennedy's past comments supporting abortion. Last month, the Oklahoma senator said he had a \u201cgood conversation\u201d with Kennedy but stopped short of endorsing.",
      "HHS can influence abortion and reproductive health access in a number of ways, including with millions of dollars in grants it sends to Planned Parenthood and regulations around abortion pills. Under the Biden administration, the agency also said hospitals were required to provide emergency abortions for pregnant women in medical distress.",
      "On Monday, acting HHS Secretary Dorothy Fink signaled the agency is prepared to adopt a tougher stance on abortion under Kennedy. She ordered the agency to investigate all of its programs to make sure no taxpayer money is going toward elective abortions.",
      "Kennedy needs to earn support from nearly all Senate Republicans, but he may also try to pick up a vote or two from the Democratic Party. His closest supporters and advisers have urged followers to call the offices of Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.",
      "Another Democratic senator may also be in play: John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who met with Kennedy and has said he's open to supporting Trump's nominees.",
      "An area where Kennedy is trying to find common ground with Democratic senators: food regulations and access to healthier foods. Kennedy has said he supports Medicare and Medicaid helping people pay for healthier foods and gym memberships, an idea Democrats have lobbied for as well. He's also called for a ban on some of the ingredients used in foods, like dyes and additives.",
      "In a letter sent to U.S. senators on Tuesday, Caroline Kennedy shared shocking personal details about her cousin, saying he is not qualified for the health secretary job.",
      "Caroline Kennedy said RFK Jr.'s views on vaccines are a problem, but she also brought up her experiences growing up with him.",
      "A copy obtained by The Associated Press notes that while she admired him for overcoming a drug addiction, she said he has gone on to \u201cmisrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.\u201d In an extreme anecdote, she accused him of hosting drug-fueled gatherings in his basement, dorm and garage where he \u201cenjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, another cousin, former Rhode Island congressman and Democrat Patrick J. Kennedy, threw his support behind the health secretary nominee in an opinion piece for The Washington Post on Tuesday. RFK Jr. helped pull him out of addiction, Patrick J. Kennedy said.",

      "While former President Joe Biden made climate change a hallmark of his administration and some of his policies remain, at least for now, Trump is quickly unraveling that.",
      "Experts say Trump's moves to step away from global climate action, ramp up domestic oil and gas production and remove incentives for electric vehicles are worrisome as the planet continues to heat up. 2024 was Earth's hottest year on record, and climate scientists say the rising heat is contributing to extreme weather affecting millions.",
      "\u201cThese orders will make our air dirtier, make people sicker, make energy more expensive, and make our communities less prepared for extreme weather,\" wrote Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, a marine biologist, policy expert and author who co-founded the non-profit think tank Urban Ocean Lab.",
      "Here are some of Trump's most notable moves affecting climate and environmental issues in his first week:",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday directing the United States to again withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement aimed at global cooperation on climate change.",
      "The agreement requires participating countries to come up with nationally determined contributions to the effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the planet. Trump's move means the federal government won't be trying to meet emissions reductions goals, nor any financial commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",
      "\u201cWalking away from the Paris Agreement won\u2019t protect Americans from climate impacts, but it will hand China and the European Union a competitive edge in the booming clean energy economy and lead to fewer opportunities for American workers,\u201d said Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Trump declared an energy emergency via executive order earlier this week amid a promise to \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d",
      "The order urges oil and gas expansion including through federal use of eminent domain and the Defense Production Act, which allow the government to use private land and resources to produce goods deemed to be a national necessity.",
      "Experts dispute his description of an \u201cinadequate energy supply\u201d as part of the basis for the order.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that the United States is well-supplied with energy in all of its forms,\u201d said Gary Dirks, senior director of the Global Futures Laboratory at Arizona State University. Dirks said he thinks the move is actually more targeted at bringing down prices at the pump.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the United States right now is the largest producer of oil of any nation in history. And we got to that point under the Biden administration, not because of the Biden administration\u2019s policies necessarily, but because of policies that have been ongoing for four decades,\u201d he said.",
      "One section of the order declaring an energy emergency states that the Endangered Species Act cannot be an obstacle to energy development.",
      "The Endangered Species Act has been a hurdle for the development of fossil fuels in the U.S. for decades, and weakening it would accelerate the decline and potential extinction of numerous endangered species, including whales and sea turtles, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "Trump also opened up areas in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling. Biden had previously both restricted and approved drilling in other parts of the Arctic, part of a long process mired in litigation and complicated by political battles.",
      "\u201cI would begin by pointing out that there was an attempt to lease for oil drilling recently and nobody bid,\u201d Dirks said. \u201cI don\u2019t actually think that the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge is an exciting place for oil and gas exploration.\u201d",
      "But he expressed concern about preserving biodiversity, something other scientists and environmental groups have highlighted.",
      "\u201cThe Arctic is a very fragile system,\u201d said Peter Schlosser, vice president and vice provost of global futures at Arizona State. Schlosser added that drilling there would disrupt the land and sea, and that potential contamination or oil spills are more difficult to clean up there due to low temperatures.",
      "Trump promised to eliminate what he incorrectly calls Biden's \u201celectric vehicle mandate.\"",
      "What that means in practice is that the order will revoke a non-binding goal set by Biden to have EVs make up half of new cars sold by 2030. He will also likely seek repeal of a $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases approved by Congress as part of Biden\u2019s landmark 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "All of that is likely frustrating for automakers, who have to make long-term decisions, said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at auto-buying research firm Edmunds. As the rest of the world moves to electric cars, automakers have to decide how to factor in the global direction the industry is headed alongside the sudden lack of federal support.",
      "\u201cWe do think that the long-term end goal here is going to be electrification. It\u2019s just the timeline it seems is uncertain right now,\u201d she said.",
      "When the government reviews new facilities that emit pollution, officials are no longer likely to consider a concept known as environmental justice, or how that new pollution will add to the emissions that have tended to fall more heavily on poor and minority communities.",
      "Those are sweeping moves that Rena Payan, chief program officer at nonprofit Justice Outside, called \u201crolling back decades of progress in addressing environmental discrimination.\u201d",
      "That means more of a burden for state and local groups to fight to protect those communities. Trump\u2019s decision to cut off support will hurt, but many of these organizations are used to operating without federal support \u2014 they have done so for years, according to Peggy Shepard, co-founder and executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m grappling right now with is both the grief of these losses, and the fact that we were on an upward swing, if you will, just weeks ago,\u201d said Jade Begay, an Indigenous rights and climate organizer.",

      "Vaccination bills are popping up in more than 15 states as lawmakers aim to potentially resurrect or create new religious exemptions from immunization mandates, establish state-level vaccine injury databases or dictate what providers must tell patients...",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Vaccination bills are popping up in more than 15 states as lawmakers aim to potentially resurrect or create new religious exemptions from immunization mandates, establish state-level vaccine injury databases or dictate what providers must tell patients about the shots.",
      "Many see a political opportunity to rewrite policies in their states after President Donald Trump's return to the White House and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 's nomination as the next secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency oversees virtually every aspect of vaccination efforts in the U.S., from funding their development to establishing recommendations for medical providers to distributing vaccines and covering them through federal programs.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates against dangerous infections like measles and polio continue to fall nationwide, and the number of parents claiming non-medical exemptions so their kids don't get required shots is rising.",
      "In 2024, whooping cough cases reached a decade-high and 16 measles outbreaks, the largest among them in Chicago and Minnesota, put health officials on edge. Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "About half of Americans are \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d concerned that those declining childhood vaccination rates will lead to more outbreaks, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Yet only about 4 in 10 Americans oppose reconsidering the government\u2019s recommendations for widely used vaccines, while roughly 3 in 10 are in favor. The rest \u2014 about 3 in 10 \u2014 are neutral.",
      "Scott Burris, director of Temple University\u2019s Center for Public Health Law Research, has tracked public health legislation for years, and watched backlash against COVID-19 vaccines grow to include more routine vaccines as anti-vaccine activists take hold of powerful political pulpits.",
      "\u201cI think COVID and the politics gave standard vaccine denialists a lot of wind in their sails,\" he said.",
      "It's hard to predict what will pass into law in the states, Burris said, considering the vast majority of proposed bills in any state go nowhere. But the proposed legislation offers a glimpse into lawmakers\u2019 thoughts, and what else might follow.",
      "Religious exemptions for school vaccine requirements are among the most popular proposals so far. Lawmakers in New York, Virginia, Connecticut and Mississippi have introduced bills that would allow more people to waive routine shots. Indiana lawmakers will weigh religious exemptions for medical students.",
      "Earlier this month, West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order on his first day in office that enabled families to receive religious exemptions from required school vaccinations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a huge step,\" said Brian Festa, co-founder of the law firm We The Patriots USA, which works on vaccination-related cases throughout the country. \"That\u2019s a state that never had a religious exemption.\u201d",
      "Now, only four states allow just a medical exemption from childcare and K-12 immunization requirements: Connecticut, California, New York and Maine.",
      "Festa credited West Virginia's new religious exemption to Trump's nomination of Kennedy, as well as a 2023 federal court ruling that required Mississippi to allow residents to cite religious beliefs when seeking exemptions from state-mandated vaccinations for children.",
      "\u201cI think the writing\u2019s on the wall and they did feel the pressure,\u201d Festa said of West Virginia.",
      "In Connecticut, at least four Republican bills will try to revive the state's religious exemption for schools, colleges and daycares \u2014 something a contentious 2021 state law eliminated for students without an existing exemption.",
      "Connecticut health experts said at the time there was a slow but steady increase in the number of religious exemptions and declining vaccination rates in some schools. The state has historically maintained some of the highest childhood vaccination rates in the county, and in the 2023-2024 school year, more than 97% of kindergarteners protected against chickenpox, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and more.",
      "Given that the U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge to the Connecticut law and the statehouse is controlled by Democrats, GOP state Sen. Eric Berthel said he\u2019s not optimistic legislative leaders will allow debate on his exemption bill, but does believe the broader cultural shift means \u201cmaybe there is a bit of an appetite to look at things like this again.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that we\u2019re not being fair to families who have a true faith-based reason to not vaccinate their child,\u201d he said.",
      "There's one outlier so far among statehouse trends on exemptions. Hawaii, where legislators are looking to move in the opposite direction with a bill to eliminate all non-medical waivers after struggling for years with high exemption rates.",
      "Other vaccine-related bills touch on some of the opposition that's been growing since the pandemic.",
      "Oklahoma and Alabama have proposals that would require parental consent for any vaccine given to minors. Bills in Wyoming, Oregon and Oklahoma would prohibit \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against people who aren\u2019t vaccinated against COVID-19 or other diseases.",
      "New York and Oklahoma have bills that would require providers to give people getting shots a full ingredient list, and Florida legislation would ban edible vaccines, though none are approved for use in the U.S. and research is still in early stages.",
      "Vaccine injury is also a popular topic, and bills in Indiana and North Dakota propose creating state versions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System \u2014 a federal database that drew the attention of vaccine skeptics during the pandemic. Anyone can file a report about a potential issue after a vaccine, though the CDC\u2019s website notes a report doesn\u2019t prove the shot caused a health issue.",
      "North Dakota Republican state Sen. Dick Anderson said he's not against people getting vaccines \u2014 he got one COVID-19 shot himself \u2014 but proposed the bill because many people don't trust the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe have to do something to restore trust in the system,\" Anderson said.",
      "But experts note state databases are unnecessarily duplicative.",
      "\u201cA lot of these proposals, they're trying to fix something that's not broken and really working to counter the goal of preventing the spread of communicable disease,\u201d said Andy Baker-White, senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "Policy should be focused on getting rid of barriers to vaccination, not adding to them, said Dr. Susan Kressly, a pediatrician and president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Many families miss vaccinations not because of ideology, she said, but because of lack of transportation or not having primary care doctors or clinics nearby, among other things.",
      "But because most Americans are vaccinated, they haven't seen the effects of dangerous infections like bacterial meningitis that Kressly fielded calls about from fearful parents early in her career.",

      "\"It's unconscionable that more than 4 years since this began, we still don't have one FDA-approved drug,\" said Meighan Stone, executive director of the Long COVID Campaign, a patient-led advocacy organization. Stone was among several people with long COVID who spoke at a workshop hosted by the NIH in September where patients, clinicians, and researchers discussed their priorities and frustrations around the agency's approach to long COVID research.",
      "",
      "Some doctors and researchers are also critical of the agency's research initiative, called RECOVER, or Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery. Without clinical trials, physicians specializing in treating long COVID must rely on hunches to guide their clinical decisions, said Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, chief of research and development with the VA St. Louis Healthcare System.",

      "",
      "Now the NIH is starting to determine how to allocate an additional $662 million of funding for long COVID research, $300 million of which is earmarked for clinical trials. These funds will be allocated over the next 4 years. At the end of October, RECOVER issued a request for clinical trial ideas that look at potential therapies, including medications, saying its goal is \"to work rapidly, collaboratively, and transparently to advance treatments for long COVID.\"",

      "This turn suggests the NIH has begun to respond to patients.

She warns it's going to take a lot more money to help people like Hayes regain some degree of health. \"There really is a burden to make up this lost time now,\" Stone said.",
      "",
      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR via email that it recognizes the urgency in finding treatments. But to do that, there needs to be an understanding of the biological mechanisms that are making people sick, which is difficult to do with post-infectious conditions.",

      "That's why it has funded research into how long COVID affects lung function, or trying to understand why only some people are afflicted with the condition.",
      "",
      "Good Science Takes Time",

      "",
      "According to RECOVER's website, it has funded eight clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment or intervention. Just one of those trials has published results.",
      "",
      "On the other hand, RECOVER has supported more than 200 observational studies, such as research on how long COVID affects pulmonary function and on which symptoms are most common. And the initiative has funded more than 40 pathobiology studies, which focus on the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of long COVID.",
      "",

      "",
      "It notes that observational studies are important in helping scientists to design and launch evidence-based clinical trials.",
      "",
      "Good science takes time, said Leora Horwitz, MD, the co-principal investigator for the RECOVER-Adult Observational Cohort at New York University (NYU). And long COVID is an \"exceedingly complicated\" illness that appears to affect nearly every organ system, she said.",
      "",
      "This makes it more difficult to study than many other diseases. Because long COVID harms the body in so many ways, with widely variable symptoms, it's harder to identify precise targets for treatment.",

      "NYU received nearly $470 million of RECOVER funds in 2021, which the institution is using to spearhead the collection of data and biospecimens from up to 40,000 patients. Horwitz said nearly 30,000 are enrolled so far.",

      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR that patients and caregivers have been central to RECOVER from the beginning, \"playing critical roles in designing studies and clinical trials, responding to surveys, serving on governance and publication groups, and guiding the initiative.\" But the consensus from patient advocacy groups is that RECOVER should have done more to prioritize clinical trials from the outset. Patients also say RECOVER leadership ignored their priorities and experiences when determining which studies to fund.",

      "RECOVER has scored some gains, said JD Davids, co-director of Long COVID Justice. This includes findings on differences in long COVID between adults and kids.

      "",
      "\"The name's a little cruel and misleading,\" he said.",

The theory is that higher oxygen concentration and increased air pressure can help heal tissues that were damaged during a COVID infection.",

      "German hunters tried to convince the jury at a national stag calling championship that they can imitate a bellowing red deer most realistically",
      "DORTMUND, Germany -- German hunters tried to convince the jury at a national stag calling championship that they can imitate a bellowing red deer most realistically.",
      "The unique tradition goes back hundreds of years and was initially aimed at feigning a stag's rival during the rutting season so the deer comes out. The trick gave hunters a chance to better assess the stag before deciding whether to shoot it.",
      "The competition took place Friday at the Jagd & Hund, or hunting and dog, trade fair in the western city of Dortmund. There were no animals, only bellowing men wearing traditional hunters' garb including green hats with a tuft of chamois hair.",
      "The hunters used specially made ox horns, triton snail shells, glass cylinders, the hollow stems of the giant hogweed, and a number of artificially produced instruments to amplify the sound and resonance.",
      "A stag\u2019s vocalizations are not only very diverse, but also vary according to age, state of mind and duration of the rut, during which they become increasingly hoarse, as well as the mood of the herd, according to the organizers.",
      "In Dortmund, the hunters were asked to compete in three disciplines: the call of the old, searching stag, the call of the dominant male in a pack of does, and the calling duel between two equally strong stags at the height of the rut. The members of the jury listened with closed eyes to make sure nothing would distract them from the sound.",
      "\u201cThe stag calling for me, it\u2019s the fascinating thing to play with the stags,\" said Fabian Wenzel, who won the championship. \u201cAnd maybe shoot an old stag after calling him \u2014 that's the biggest thing for every hunter.\u201d",
      "Wenzel, a hunter from the small village of N\u00fcdlingen in Bavaria, won the title for the fifth time in a row and will participate in the European Stag Calling Championships, which will take place in Lithuania in October.",

      "Israel has released a total of 183 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for three Israeli hostages held in Gaza as part of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas",
      "RAMALLAH, West Bank -- Israel on Saturday released a total of 183 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for three Israeli hostages held in Gaza as the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas continued to gain traction after nearly two weeks.",
      "In a sign of progress, Saturday\u2019s release included for the first time some of the 1,000 detainees from Gaza that Israel has agreed to free during Phase 1 of the deal on condition that they did not participate in Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "Detained in Gaza on suspicion of militancy, the 111 Palestinians released Saturday have been held without trial since the day after the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "The remaining 72 Palestinians, all arrested from either the West Bank or Gaza before the war, served long sentences or life sentences for deadly attacks against Israelis. They are all men, ranging in age from 30 to 66.",
      "The release of Palestinians from Gaza draws attention to Israel\u2019s mass roundups of men in the enclave during the past 15 months of its military campaign against Hamas. Many were taken to Israel.",
      "Images of Israeli forces rounding up Palestinians in Gaza \u2014 showing men stripped to their underwear, sitting or kneeling on the ground, with some bound and blindfolded \u2014 have sparked outrage and concern from the U.N. human rights body. The Israeli military says it arrests those suspected of involvement in Hamas and other militant groups.",
      "In the occupied West Bank, excited crowds thronged the Red Cross bus carrying the Palestinians from Ofer prison near Ramallah. But the festivities were muted compared to previous weeks. Just 25 prisoners were set free into the West Bank, while another seven were being transferred to Egypt before deportation.",
      "The rest were headed home to Gaza for the first time in months, or, in some cases, years, where celebrations awaited.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some prominent Palestinian prisoners released since the ceasefire deal went into effect on Jan. 19:",
      "The Palestinian manager of the Gaza branch of World Vision, a major Christian aid organization, was arrested in 2016 and accused of diverting tens of millions of dollars to Hamas in a high-profile case that drew criticism from rights groups. He was freed on Saturday.",
      "Both el-Halabi, 47, and World Vision vigorously denied the allegations and independent investigations found no proof of wrongdoing. One independent audit found that el-Halabi had enforced internal controls and ordered employees to avoid anyone suspected of Hamas ties.",
      "World Vision has also said that the accusations that el-Halabi transferred 60% of the charity\u2019s annual budget for Gaza to Hamas could not be reconciled with its financial records.",
      "Rights groups say el-Halabi was denied a fair and transparent trial, as he and World Vision had no chance to review the evidence against them, with all procedures shielded from the public and shrouded in unusual secrecy. U.N. experts say el-Halabi was questioned for 50 days without access to a lawyer. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison.",
      "Israel has attributed the closed hearings to sensitive security information being relayed. Israeli courts typically hold closed hearings to protect the sources of their information.",
      "His prolonged detention sent a chill through nongovernmental groups providing aid to Palestinians in Gaza. After el-Halabi\u2019s arrest, World Vision suspended its activities in Gaza, where it it says its aid had benefited nearly 40,000 children affected by the crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade on the enclave.",
      "Amouri, 44, from the northern West Bank city of Jenin, was arrested for his alleged role in manufacturing the powerful car bomb that detonated beside an Israeli bus packed with passengers on June 5, 2002, killing 17 Israelis in what became known as the Megiddo Junction suicide bombing.",
      "The attack during the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, between 2000 and 2005, took place in northern Israel. The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility.",
      "Amouri was sentenced to life in prison, plus 20 years. He was among those transferred to Egypt Saturday and released into exile.",
      "\u201cWe wish to have felt the joy of his release here, on the land of Jenin refugee camp,\u201d said Bassam Amouri, his brother. \u201cBut, thank God, what matters is that he is free of the suffering of prison.\u201d",
      "Abu Srour, 50, sentenced to life in prison over a 2000 attack that killed Israeli soldier Shahar Veckart, was also among those released Saturday into exile.",
      "Hailing from Aida refugee camp in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, Abu Srour was detained in 2001 and convicted the next year over the shooting at Rachel\u2019s Tomb, the traditional burial place of the wife of the biblical patriarch Jacob. During the second intifada, the shrine became a target of Palestinian militants protesting Israel\u2019s claim to the holy site revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims alike.",
      "Abu Srour belonged to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Brigade \u2014 an armed group affiliated with Fatah, the secular political party that controls the Palestinian Authority.",
      "Zakaria Zubeidi is a prominent former militant leader and theater director whose dramatic jailbreak in 2021 thrilled Palestinians across the Middle East and stunned the Israeli security establishment.",
      "Zubeidi once led the Al-Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Brigade. After the second intifada in 2006, he co-founded a theater in his hometown of Jenin refugee camp, a hotbed of Palestinian militancy, to promote what he described as cultural resistance to Israel. Even today, the Freedom Theater puts on everything from Shakespeare to stand-up comedy to plays written by residents.",
      "In 2019, after Zubeidi had already served years in prison for attacks in the early 2000s, Israel arrested him again over his alleged involvement in shooting attacks that targeted buses of Israeli settlers but caused no injuries.",
      "Zubeidi, who was released Thursday into the West Bank, had been awaiting trial in prison. He denies the charges, saying that he gave up militancy to focus on his political activism after the intifada.",
      "In 2021, he and five other prisoners tunneled out of a maximum-security prison in northern Israel, an escape that helped solidify Zubeidi\u2019s image among Palestinians as a folk hero. All six were recaptured days later.",
      "A Hamas militant during the second intifada, Abu Warda helped organize a series of suicide bombings that killed over 40 people and wounded more than a hundred others. Israel arrested him in 2002, and sentenced him to 48 terms of lifetime imprisonment, among the longest sentences it ever issued.",
      "As a young student, Abu Warda joined Hamas at the start of the intifada following Israel\u2019s killing of Yahya Ayyash, the militant group\u2019s leading bomb maker, in 1996.",
      "Palestinian authorities said at the time that Warda had helped to recruit suicide bombers \u2014 including his cousin, his cousin\u2019s neighbor and a classmate at the Ramallah Teachers College \u2014 whose attacks targeting crowded civilian areas in Israeli cities killed scores of people in the early 2000s.",
      "Warda was released and deported on Thursday.",
      "An activist in Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Aradeh was sentenced to life in prison for a range of offenses going back to the second intifada. Some of the charges, according to the Israeli Prison Service, included planting an explosive device and attempting murder.",
      "He was credited with plotting the extraordinary prison escape in 2021, when he and five other detainees, including Zubeidi, used spoons to tunnel out one of Israel\u2019s most secure prisons. They remained at large for days before being caught.",
      "From an impoverished and politically active family in Jenin, in the northern occupied West Bank, Aradeh has three brothers and a sister who have all spent years in Israeli prisons.",
      "He was welcomed as a sort of cult hero in Ramallah on Jan. 25 as family, friends and fans swarmed him, some chanting \u201cThe freedom tunnel!\u201d in reference to his jailbreak.",
      "All three men hail from the neighborhood of Silwan, in east Jerusalem, and rose within the ranks of Hamas. Held responsible for a string of deadly attacks during the second intifada, the men were sentenced to multiple life sentences in 2002.",
      "They were accused of plotting a suicide bombing at a crowded pool hall near Tel Aviv in 2002 that killed 15 people. Later that year, they were found to have orchestrated a bombing at Hebrew University that killed nine people, including five American students. Israel had described Odeh, who was working as a painter at the university at the time, as the kingpin in the attack.",
      "All three were transferred to Egypt on Jan. 25. Their families live in Jerusalem and said they will join them in exile.",
      "Three brothers from the prominent Abu Hamid family of the Al-Amari refugee camp in Ramallah \u2014 Nasser, 51, Mohammad, 44, and Sharif, 48 \u2014 were also deported to Egypt on Jan. 25. They had been sentenced to life in prison over deadly militant attacks against Israelis in 2002.",
      "Their brother, a different Nasser Abu Hamid, was one of the founders of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Brigade. He was also sentenced to life in prison for several deadly attacks. His 2022 death from lung cancer behind bars unleashed a wave of angry protests across the West Bank as Palestinian officials accused Israel of medical neglect.",
      "The family has a long arc of Palestinian militancy. The mother, Latifa Abu Hamid, 72, now has three sons exiled, one still imprisoned, one who died in prison and one who was killed by Israeli forces. Their family house has been demolished at least three times by Israel, which defends such punitive home demolitions as a deterrent against future attacks.",
      "Al-Tous had held the title of longest continuous Israeli imprisonment until his release last Saturday, Palestinian authorities said.",
      "First arrested in 1985 while fighting Israeli forces along the Jordanian border, the activist in the Fatah party spent a total of 39 years behind bars. Originally from the West Bank city of Bethlehem, he was among the prisoners exiled on Jan. 25."

      "A coast guard ship took 43 migrants from the port of Shengjin, 66 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the capital, Tirana. They were among the 49 men who were transferred to Albania on an Italian naval ship Tuesday. Five of them were returned the same day \u2014 four because they were minors and the fifth because he was considered a \u201cvulnerable\u201d person.",

      "The court referred the case to the European Court of Justice, in Luxembourg, which is expected to issue a ruling on Feb. 25 related to the previous cases, in which the series of lower court rulings have opened a fissure between the Meloni government and the Italian judicial system.",
      "In October and November, judges similarly refused to approve the expulsion of much smaller groups of migrants, seeking clarity from the European court on which countries were safe for repatriation of people whose asylum claims are rejected.",
      "Italy last year signed a five-year agreement to process up to 3,000 migrants a month beyond EU borders as part of Meloni\u2019s program to combat illegal migration to Italy, which is the first landfall for tens of thousands of migrants who make the perilous journey across the central Mediterranean Sea.",
      "While the agreement has raised concerns among human rights activists, European partners have expressed interest in the project.",
      "In the first four weeks of this year, 3,704 migrants arrived in Italy, almost three times as many as in the same period last year. In the whole of last year, 66,317 migrants arrived in Italy, a drop of 58% from the previous year. The largest nationality was Bangladeshis, followed by Syrians, Tunisians and Egyptians, according to the Italian Interior Ministry.",

      "Horst K\u00f6hler, a onetime head of the International Monetary Fund who became a popular German president before stunning the country by resigning abruptly in a flap over comments about the country\u2019s military, has died",
      "BERLIN -- Horst K\u00f6hler, a onetime head of the International Monetary Fund who became a popular German president before stunning the country by resigning abruptly in a flap over comments about the country's military, has died. He was 81.",
      "K\u00f6hler, who was head of state from 2004 to 2010, died Saturday morning in Berlin after a short illness, surrounded by his family, the office of current German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a statement.",
      "K\u00f6hler was little known to most Germans and a stranger to front-line politics before he won the presidency. His nomination was greeted by the mass-circulation daily Bild with the headline \"Horst Who?\"",
      "However, he built up high popularity ratings once in the job, something that he achieved in part by positioning himself as an outsider to the country's political elite.",
      "He occasionally refused to sign bills into law due to constitutional concerns and didn't always make himself popular with the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose choice he was for the presidency \u2014 a largely ceremonial job but often seen as a source of moral authority.",
      "K\u00f6hler was elected before Merkel came to power, at a time when Germany was struggling to come to terms with labor market reforms and welfare state cuts. He said Germans must not rest on past achievements, and said he was \"deeply convinced Germany has the strength for change.\"",
      "In July 2005, K\u00f6hler agreed to dissolve parliament and grant struggling then-Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der an unusual early election. He declared that Germany faced \"giant challenges\" and that \"our future and the future of our children is at stake.\"",
      "Merkel won power, but nearly blew a huge poll lead after her talk of deeper reform turned off voters. K\u00f6hler also talked less of economic change in later years and was strongly critical of financial markets during the banking and economic crisis \u2014 describing them as a \"monster\" that hadn't yet been tamed.",
      "Amid criticism that he appeared to have little to say after winning a second term, K\u00f6hler resigned in dramatically abrupt fashion on May 31, 2010. He cited criticism over a radio interview he gave following a visit to German troops in Afghanistan.",
      "In that broadcast, he said that for a country with Germany's dependency on exports, military deployments could be \"necessary ... in order to defend our interests, for example free trade routes.\"",
      "That was taken by many as relating to Germany's unpopular mission in Afghanistan, although his office later said he was referring to anti-piracy patrols off the coast of Somalia.",
      "Many wondered whether that was the real reason for the sometimes thin-skinned Koehler's resignation, with critics speculating that he had simply become fed up with a lack of backing from Merkel \u2014 for whom his resignation was an embarrassment.",
      "In foreign policy, K\u00f6hler won praise for trying to draw attention to the needs of Africa. He became the second German president to address Israel's parliament, telling the Knesset: \"I bow my head in shame and humility before the victims\" of the Holocaust.",
      "K\u00f6hler also paid attention to relations with eastern neighbor Poland, making it the first foreign destination of both of his two terms and saying he would like the country to become as important a partner for Germany as France.",
      "K\u00f6hler, the son of ethnic German farmers from Romania, was born on Feb. 22, 1943, in Skierbieszow, in Nazi-occupied Poland. His family fled to Germany after the war \u2014 first to Leipzig in what became communist East Germany, then to West Germany in 1954.",
      "Before rising to the presidency, K\u00f6hler had a long record as an efficient behind-the-scenes official.",
      "Starting in the early 1980s, he worked for more than a decade in the Finance Ministry under Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who once called him \"a treasure\" and relied on him in economic diplomacy.",
      "He helped draft the legal framework for Europe's single currency, the euro, and played a role in negotiating German reunification in 1990.",
      "He later served as president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.",
      "In 2000, K\u00f6hler emerged as Schr\u00f6der's backup choice for the IMF leadership. He won American support after Berlin's first candidate, Deputy Finance Minister Caio Koch-Weser, was rejected by the United States as too lightweight.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow later praised K\u00f6hler's tenure, saying that \u201che transformed the institution in terms of its transparency ... and worked to develop better crisis prevention tools and more effective crisis management.\"",
      "Merkel, then Germany's opposition leader, brought him back to Germany as her surprise choice for the presidency four years later, securing his election by a parliamentary assembly.",
      "In a letter of condolence to K\u00f6hler\u2019s wife, Eva Louise, President Steinmeier wrote Saturday that \u201cmany people in our country will mourn with you. For in Horst K\u00f6hler we have lost a highly esteemed and extremely popular person who achieved great things \u2014 for our country and in the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was above all his approachability, his infectious laughter and his optimism, his belief in the strength of our country and in the energy and creativity of its people that won him so many hearts. But it was also his often clear and by no means always comfortable admonitions and speeches that won him recognition,\u201d Steinmeier wrote.",
      "K\u00f6hler is survived by his wife, daughter Ulrike and son Jochen.",

Meanwhile, Moscow\u2019s troops continued their grinding advance through the country\u2019s east. A Russian missile strike on an apartment block in the Ukrainian city of Poltava killed at least three people and injured 10 more, Ukraine's emergency services reported.",

      "In 2022, the U.S. transferred $3.5 billion in Afghan central bank assets previously frozen in America to the Swiss-based Fund for the Afghan People. The fund has grown to nearly $4 billion since then, according to the inspector general.",

      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government has presented an annual budget that focuses on wooing the salaried middle class with tax cuts and spurring economic growth by boosting agriculture and manufacturing",
      "NEW DELHI -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government presented an annual budget to Parliament on Saturday that focused on wooing the salaried middle class with tax cuts and spurring economic growth by boosting agriculture and manufacturing.",
      "In her budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government is focused on boosting private investment to strengthen growth, increasing funding in the agriculture sector and enhancing the spending power of India\u2019s middle class.",
      "\u201cThe focus of the budget is taking everyone together on an inclusive path,\u201d Sitharaman said, adding that the government is aiming for a fiscal deficit of 4.4% of India\u2019s gross domestic product for the 2025-26 financial year.",
      "The world\u2019s fifth-largest economy is expected to post its slowest growth in four years due to a sluggish manufacturing sector, persistent food inflation, stagnant job growth and weak urban consumption. The country\u2019s chief economic advisor, in a report released on Friday, forecast India\u2019s economy would grow 6.3% to 6.8% in the next fiscal year.",
      "Here are some takeaways from the budget:",
      "Sitharaman said her government will initiate reforms in sectors like finance, power, urban development and mining, with \u201ctransformative reforms in taxation.\u201d She raised the starting point for income tax to $14,800 from $8,074 and said the government will introduce a new income tax bill next week.",
      "\u201cThe new structure will substantially reduce the taxes of the middle class and leave more money in their hands, boosting household consumption, savings and investment,\u201d Sitharaman said.",
      "Modi, who is now in his third term as the country's prime minister, has been under pressure to allay discontent among the country's middle class and generate more jobs to help sustain growth. Many economists had suggested his government make tax cuts on individuals' income and implement job creation programs to mitigate rising unemployment.",
      "According to the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy, youth unemployment was at 7.5% in January, underscoring the challenge of delivering jobs in a country of more than 1.4 billion people.",
      "To boost productivity across the agriculture sector, the Indian government will launch a nationwide program to push high-yielding crops, focusing on the cultivation of pulses and cotton production. Sitharaman said the program will target at least 17 million farmers and raise the limit for subsidized credit offered to them from $3,460 to $5,767.",
      "The government also plans to formally register India's gig workers and ease their access to health care. Sitharaman said the government will issue them identity cards and maintain a national registry that will ensure their inclusion in welfare initiatives.",
      "India\u2019s gig economy could employ more than 23 million people by 2030, according to estimates by government think tank NITI Aayog.",
      "Sitharaman announced a new fund for startups and said the government will provide more money to promote innovation in partnership with the private sector and launch programs to push manufacturing and exports. The share of manufacturing in India's economy is close to 17%, short of its aimed goal of 25%.",
      "The government will infuse more money to increase tourism-led employment in several Indian states and help with building infrastructure and boosting air connectivity to 120 new destinations over 10 years, Sitharaman said.",
      "She also announced the Nuclear Energy Mission to drive India\u2019s transition toward clean energy, with a goal of developing at least 100 GW of nuclear power by 2047."

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 02:30:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The M23 rebel group that is backed by Rwanda has emerged as a more potent force after being crushed during their first rebellion in 2012",
    "story": [
      "The M23 rebel group that is backed by Rwanda has emerged as a more potent force after being crushed during their first rebellion in 2012",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- After Rwanda-backed M23 rebels took control of the biggest city in eastern Congo this week, the man who emerged from the shadows to assert his leadership was not the group's long-time military leader.",
      "Sultani Makenga, an ethnic Tutsi rebel leader sanctioned by both the U.S. and the U.N., was nowhere to be seen in Goma\u2019s Serena Hotel as the bearded Corneille Nangaa, in military fatigues, was ushered into the hall. Nangaa, who is not a Tutsi and who analysts say brings a more diverse, Congolese face to the group, told reporters of his plan to fight all the way to Kinshasa, the national capital a thousand miles away.",
      "The spectacle was significant because it captures the evolution of M23 from an ethnic Tutsi-dominated outfit more than a decade ago to one that\u2019s now actively seeking to be seen as a Congolese nationalist group. That's the case despite the military support it gets from neighboring Rwanda, according to observers and analysts in Africa\u2019s Great Lakes region.",
      "Nangaa is the former head of Congo's electoral body who oversaw the 2018 presidential election won by President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi. He has been a controversial figure in Congolese politics for years. As the election commission chair, he oversaw the heavily criticized vote that elected Tshisekedi and led the U.S. to sanction him in 2019 for undermining Congo's democracy.",
      "A falling-out with Congolese authorities, including a dispute over a mining concession, sent Nangaa into exile in Kenya. In 2023, he joined the Congo River Alliance, a political-military coalition including 17 parties and rebel groups opposed to the government of Tshisekedi and became a top political figure.",
      "Besides the mining, his grievance is also believed to be due to the president\u2019s alleged refusal to advocate for the U.S. dropping Nangaa from its sanctions list, according to Christian Moleka, a political scientist at the Congolese think tank Dypol. \u201cHis perception that he had been mistreated by the authorities is what pushed him towards radicalization,\u201d Moleka said.",
      "Last year, Makenga\u2019s M23 joined Nangaa\u2019s Congo River Alliance and with Nangaa at the helm of the revamped outfit, the M23 looked even more menacing to Congolese authorities, analysts say.",
      "M23 is more of a threat now because the group is trying to \u201cdecouple the question of self-determination in eastern Congo\u201d from evidence of Rwandan support, said Angelo Izama, an analyst with the Uganda-based Fanaka Kwawote think tank.",
      "The rebels want to provoke a national discussion on widespread feelings of neglect in eastern Congo while gaining \u201cas much territory as possible such that they can force the Congolese state to deal with questions of genuine autonomy and to force some kind of negotiation,\u201d he said.",
      "Forcing political negotiations is \u201ca smart move\u201d for the rebels, \u201cthe only path out of this crisis,\u201d he added.",
      "Unlike in 2012, when the M23 took Goma in a campaign led by Kinyarwanda-speaking fighters pushing mainly for their full integration into the Congolese army, \u201cthis time it has a national agenda,\u201d the Crisis Group think tank said of M23 in a recent assessment.",
      "With Nangaa\u2019s Congo River Alliance as the \u201cpolitical umbrella\" for the M23, the think tank said the rebels have accumulated resources and allies that made them \u201cattractive partners not only to armed groups in eastern (Congo) but to others aiming to undermine Tshisekedi.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is in line with (Rwanda's) probable strategy of creating a deniable but powerful Congolese front to exact the maximum leverage over Kinshasa and confirm its dominance of North Kivu (province), at a minimum,\u201d the think tank said.",
      "United Nations experts have asserted that some 4,000 Rwandan troops back M23 rebels in North Kivu. To take Goma, which is strategically located close to the Rwanda border, the rebels defeated Congolese government troops who long had been supported by local militias known as Wazalendo as well as U.N. and regional peacekeepers and mercenaries from Europe.",
      "M23 has about 6,500 fighters, according to U.N. estimates. It emerged in 2012 as a rebel group led by Congolese ethnic Tutsis who said a 2009 agreement signed to look after their interests \u2014 including integration into the army and the return of refugees from elsewhere in east Africa \u2014 had been violated by Congo\u2019s government.",
      "Led by Makenga, a Congolese Tutsi, M23 took Goma in a November 2012 offensive and pulled out days later under international pressure. They were later repulsed by U.N. forces fighting alongside Congolese government troops in a military campaign that forced hundreds of them to flee to Rwanda and Uganda. Makenga, a self-appointed major-general often seen wielding a herder\u2019s staff in the bush, was among those who fled to Uganda.",
      "In December 2013, with hundreds of the rebels cantoned in a remote forested area of western Uganda, M23 signed an agreement with Congo\u2019s government that called for the repatriation of the rebels to Congo within a year. That proved difficult to achieve because of a dispute over the rebels\u2019 demand for a blanket amnesty while Congo\u2019s government wanted commanders such as Makenga tried for their alleged crimes against civilians.",
      "In 2016, hundreds of M23 rebels fled custody in Uganda, from where they were to be airlifted back to Congo. The rebels resurfaced in 2021 and became the most potent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control in the mineral-rich territory. The U.S. Department of Commerce estimates mineral deposits there to be worth $24 trillion, most of them crucial to global technology.",
      "Unlike in 2012, Nangaa's selling point as the face of M23 is that he is from the Haut-Uele province and not Tutsi,\" said Moleka with the Dypol Congolese think tank. \"This allows M23 to give itself a new, more diverse, Congolese face, as M23 has always been seen as a Rwanda-backed armed group defending Tutsi minorities,\u201d said Moleka.",
      "The Washington-based Africa Center for Strategic Studies, in an analysis published Wednesday, cited \u201ca shifting political calculus by sponsors\" of M23. Efforts to establish a parallel civilian administration and expand the illicit exploitation of minerals \u201csuggests that the rebel group and their regional backers have longer-term objectives in holding and potentially expanding their territorial control,\" according to the assessment by Paul Nantulya, a Ugandan analyst with the group.",
      "At an M23 news conference in Goma on Thursday, Nangaa said the rebels aim to set up a new administration in the city of 2 million people that's now home to hundreds of thousands of displaced Congolese. The rebels spoke to reporters of their plans to return displaced people to their homes, presenting a major challenge to Tshisekedi.",
      "\"We are here in Goma to stay as Congolese,\u201d Nangaa said. \u201cWe will continue the march for liberation all the way to Kinshasa.\u201d",

      "Three high-profile Israeli hostages are set to be released by Hamas on Saturday, while Palestinian authorities say Israel has agreed to release dozens of prisoners, in the fourth round of exchanges during the Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas",
      "Three high-profile Israeli hostages are set to be released by Hamas on Saturday, while Palestinian authorities say Israel has agreed to release dozens of prisoners, in the fourth round of exchanges during the Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.",
      "The six-week phase one truce calls for the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 prisoners, as well as the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and an increase in humanitarian aid to the devastated territory.",
      "Israel and Hamas are set next week to begin negotiating a second phase of the ceasefire, which calls for releasing the remaining hostages and extending the truce indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached.",
      "Palestinian health authorities in Gaza also announced that the long-shuttered Rafah border crossing with Egypt would reopen on Saturday for thousands of Palestinians who desperately need medical care \u2014 a breakthrough that signals the ceasefire agreement continues to gain traction.",
      "___",
      "Here's the latest:",
      "The hostages to be released, according to Hamas and Israel, are: Yarden Bibas, 35; American-Israeli Keith Siegel, 65; and French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, 54. All were abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war.",
      "News that Yarden Bibas, 35, is among the hostages set to be freed on Saturday brought renewed attention to the uncertain fate of the Bibas family. Hamas says his kidnapped wife and two young boys were killed in an Israeli airstrike, but Israel has not verified the claim.",
      "A video of their abduction by armed men showed Shiri swaddling in a blanket her two redheaded boys \u2014 Ariel, 4, and Kfir, 9 months old at the time. Kfir was the youngest of about 250 people taken captive on Oct. 7, and his plight quickly came to represent the helplessness and anger the hostage-taking stirred in Israel, where the Bibas family has become a household name.",
      "Like Bibas, Kalderon was also captured from Kibbutz Nir Oz. His two children and ex-wife, Hadas, were also taken, but they were freed during the 2023 ceasefire.",
      "Keith Siegel, originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, was taken hostage from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, along with his wife, Aviva Siegel. She was released during the 2023 ceasefire and has waged a high-profile campaign  to free Keith and other hostages.",
      "Today\u2019s exchange is part of a deal that paused fighting in Gaza on Jan. 19. Israeli forces have pulled back from most of Gaza, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to return to what remains of their homes and humanitarian groups to surge assistance.",
      "It calls for Hamas to release a total of 33 hostages, including women, children, older adults and sick or wounded men, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the hostages to be released in this phase are dead.",
      "The initial Phase One ceasefire paused fighting for six weeks, calling for the sides to use that time to negotiate a second phase in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages and the ceasefire would continue indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached.",

      "Hamas-led militants are set to release three male hostages from the Gaza Strip on Saturday, in return for the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners as part of a fragile ceasefire with Israel that has halted more than a year of intense fighting and...",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Hamas-led militants are set to free three more hostages \u2014 all men \u2014 on Saturday, and Israel will release dozens of Palestinian prisoners as part of a fragile agreement that has paused fighting in the Gaza Strip after more than 15 months of war.",
      "The hostages to be released, according to Hamas and Israel, are: Yarden Bibas, 35; American-Israeli Keith Siegel, 65; and French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, 54. All were abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war.",
      "It will be the fourth swap of hostages for prisoners since the ceasefire began on Jan. 19. Fifteen hostages and hundreds of prisoners have already been freed in that time.",
      "Also on Saturday, wounded Palestinians are expected to be allowed to leave Gaza for Egypt through the Rafah crossing. It had been the only exit point for Palestinians during the war before Israel closed it in May. A European Union civilian mission was deployed Friday to prepare for the reopening of the crossing.",
      "The reopening would mark another key step in the first phase of the ceasefire, which calls for the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 prisoners, the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and an increase in humanitarian aid to the devastated territory.",
      "The imminent release of Bibas has brought renewed attention to \u2014 and concern for \u2014 the fate of his wife, Shiri, and their two young sons. All four were captured from Kibbutz Nir Oz.",
      "A video of their abduction by armed men showed Shiri swaddling in a blanket her two redheaded boys \u2014 Ariel, 4, and Kfir, 9 months old at the time.",
      "Kfir was the youngest of about 250 people taken captive on Oct. 7, and his plight quickly came to represent the helplessness and anger the hostage-taking stirred in Israel, where the Bibas family has become a household name.",
      "Hamas has said Shiri and her sons were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel has not confirmed that, but a military spokesman recently acknowledged serious concern about their fates.",
      "Yarden Bibas is believed to have been held separately from his family. Photos taken during his abduction appeared to show him wounded.",
      "Like Bibas, Kalderon was also captured from Kibbutz Nir Oz. His two children and ex-wife, Hadas, were also taken, but they were freed during the 2023 ceasefire.",
      "Keith Siegel, originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, was taken hostage from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, along with his wife, Aviva Siegel. She was released during the 2023 ceasefire and has waged a high-profile campaign  to free Keith and other hostages.",
      "The dozens of Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel on Saturday include people serving lengthy and life sentences.",
      "More than 100 hostages were released during a weeklong ceasefire in Nov. 2023. About 80 more hostages are still in Gaza, at least a third of them believed dead. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the 33 to be released in the first phase of the ceasefire are dead.",
      "Israel and Hamas are set next week to begin negotiating a second phase of the ceasefire, which calls for releasing the remaining hostages and extending the truce indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached.",
      "Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas, even after the militant group reasserted its rule over Gaza within hours of the latest ceasefire. A key far-right partner in Netanyahu\u2019s coalition is calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire\u2019s first phase.",
      "Hamas says it won\u2019t release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.",
      "In the Oct. 7 attack that started the war, some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel\u2019s retaliatory air and ground war, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "The Israeli military says it killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters operate in residential neighborhoods."

The gathering, known as \u201cL\u2019Appel,\" (\"The Call\"), marked the 145th anniversary of Seydina Limamou Laye\u2019s controversial declaration as the prophet.",

      "As part of the celebrations, worshippers made a pilgrimage to the sacred grotto where Seydina Limamou Laye first retreated for meditation and \u2014 according to believers \u2014 received divine inspiration. The site remains a powerful symbol of his spiritual awakening and a place of connection between the Layene community and their founder.",
      "His message emphasized that the Prophet Muhammad had returned in his form as a Black man to restore justice and correct societal wrongs, including those caused by slavery. This message of racial equality and spiritual unity continues to resonate with followers today.",

He brought equality among the races.\u201d",

      "Ambulance services stretched thin in the U.K. are drawing attention to the non-emergency calls that are hampering their response times",
      "LONDON -- If your pet alligator escapes, don't call for an ambulance \u2014 unless it has sunk its teeth into someone.",
      "That's the message from the Welsh Ambulance Service in a plea to get people to stop phoning with non-emergencies.",
      "With public health services stretched thin in the U.K., there is no shortage of anecdotes about people suffering from true health emergencies who wait hours for medical care \u2014 whether from paramedics or a hospital doctor. But the ambulance service said 15% of its 426,000 calls last year \u2014 175 a day \u2014 were not urgent. Some weren't even health-related and were far from being matters of life and death.",
      "There was a call about a chipped tooth (\"it's starting to throb\"), a bloody toe (\"I\u2019ve cut my little nail on the toe and I\u2019ve nipped across the top of it.\") and a person who stuck their finger in an electrical socket who appeared to be fine (\"I\u2019m worried that I could be electrocuted\").",
      "Then there was the call Emma Worrall took last year that she won't soon forget.",
      "\u201cI remember saying \u2018alligator?\u2019 and my call-taker supervisor just looked at me and was like, \u2018What is going on in your call?\u2019\u201d Worrall said.",
      "As a dispatcher in a busy call center in Wales, Worrall has to be unflappable, patient and able to efficiently handle the most stressful calls in which a delay of seconds or minutes could be the difference between life and death.",
      "She understands that some people have a different gauge of what is life-threatening and an emergency. But it's still frustrating when someone phones the emergency number to say they\u2019re locked out of their house and cold or their dog jumped in a river and won\u2019t swim back \u2014 calls she also fielded.",
      "\u201cWe just ask everybody to find alternative pathways before phoning for an ambulance,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ambulance service is for those who are experiencing life-threatening problems.\u201d",
      "Worrall\u2019s craziest call came one afternoon when a man phoned to say his son\u2019s pet alligator had escaped and was hiding under the sofa.",
      "\u201cI asked if he\u2019d been hurt, and he said, no. he was scared,\u201d Worrall recounted.",
      "He wanted paramedics to help him corral the toothy reptile.",
      "\u201cI told him that we wouldn\u2019t be sending an ambulance for something like that. And he said, \u2018So you\u2019re not going to send me any help until I get bit, is that right?\u2019 I went, \u2018That\u2019s correct.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Welsh Ambulance Service isn't alone in publicizing the wacky calls they got last year. The South Western Ambulance Service in England this week said more than a quarter of the 1 million-plus calls it fielded last year did not merit sending help.",
      "The non-emergency calls included a person looking for assistance in finding their walking stick, a patient who had fallen off a chair \u2014 who was already in the hospital \u2014 and a woman who complained of having a \u201chorrendous nightmare.\u201d",
      "Emergency calls \u201care for situations where minutes matter and lives are at risk,\u201d said William Lee, assistant operations director at South Western Ambulance. \u201cInappropriate calls tie up our emergency lines and divert valuable resources away from those in genuine need.\"",
      "Worrall was gobsmacked the gator caller thought paramedics were the panacea for his problem. When she got off the phone, she took a short break and shared the story with her amused colleagues.",
      "\u201cWe did have a little chat about that and, yeah, back to work I went,\u201d she said. \u201cOn to the next call.\u201d"

      "BOCA DEL RIO, Mexico -- A startup in Mexico is trying to help get a handle on one Gulf coast city\u2019s plastic waste problem by converting it into gasoline, diesel and other fuels.",
      "With less than 10% of the world\u2019s plastics being recycled, Petgas\u2019 idea is that rather than letting discarded plastic become waste, it can become productive again as fuel.",
      "Petgas developed a machine in the port city of Boca del Rio that uses pyrolysis, a thermodynamic process that heats plastics in the absence of oxygen, breaking it down to produce gasoline, diesel, kerosene, paraffin and coke.",
      "Carlos Parraguirre D\u00edaz, chief technology officer at Petgas, said that in a week, the machine can process 1.5 tons of plastics and produce 356 gallons (1,350 liters) of fuel.",
      "The process does require propane to initiate the heating, but once the pyrolysis begins, the gas it produces is used to keep it going, according to the company. And using fuel it produces does throw off carbon dioxide, but the company says its net impact is less than comparable fuels because their fuel is lower in sulfur.",
      "Parraguirre D\u00edaz said that the machine shows that \u201cwe can transform that (plastic) into a product that\u2019s useful and has high value in the world economy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn place of having a dump, it\u2019s as if we dug into the earth and found hydrocarbons that can be used by our community,\u201d he said.",
      "Global plastic production, already exceeding 400 million tons annually, could surge by 70% by 2040 without policy changes, according to the United Nations. China was by far the biggest exporter of plastic products in 2023, followed by Germany and the United States.",
      "Many plastics are used for packaging. Every day, the equivalent of 2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic are dumped into the world\u2019s oceans, rivers and lakes.",
      "Negotiations on a treaty to end plastic pollution concluded in Busan, South Korea in December without reaching an agreement. This was supposed to be the fifth and final round to produce the first legally binding treaty on plastics pollution, including in the oceans, by the end of 2024.",
      "Petgas envisions a circular economy where plastic is no longer waste, but rather a resource for the production of energy.",
      "To that end, the company has organized plastic collection drives to remove bottles and other material from the city\u2019s beaches. It encourages people to bring plastic waste to a drop-off point and receives most of its material clean and shredded from a recycler.",
      "Alexa Mendoza, a biologist specializing in plastic contamination of the sea who is not involved in the project, said Petgas plan was a good initiative, but a \u201cband-aid\u201d for a massive global problem.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to me a solution to put a band-aid on it and say, \u2018great, it\u2019s solved and let\u2019s do it,\u2019 but rather it could be a first step,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cFrom there, with the help of scientists you could take into account what needs to be adjusted so that it doesn\u2019t become another source of pollution.\"",
      "For now, Petgas donates the fuel it produces to the local fire department and food delivery services.",
      "\"The future is being able to really take production to a scale that has impact,\u201d said Parraguirre D\u00edaz.",

      "BANGKOK -- Peace prospects look bleak in Myanmar as a civil war rages despite international pressure on the military four years after it seized power from an elected civilian government.",
      "The political situation remains tense with no negotiation space in sight between the military government and the major opposition groups fighting against it.",
      "The four years after the army's takeover on Feb. 1, 2021, have created a profound situation of multiple, overlapping crises with nearly half the population in poverty and the economy in disarray, the U.N. Development Program said.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Office said the military ramped up violence against civilians last year to unprecedented levels, inflicting the heaviest civilian death toll since the army takeover as its grip on power eroded.",
      "The army launched wave after wave of retaliatory airstrikes and artillery shelling on civilians and civilian populated areas, forced thousands of young people into military service, conducted arbitrary arrests and prosecutions, caused mass displacement, and denied access to humanitarians, even in the face of natural disasters, the rights office said in a statement Friday.",
      "\u201cAfter four years, it is deeply distressing to find that the situation on the ground for civilians is only getting worse by the day,\u201d U.N. human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk said. \u201cEven as the military\u2019s power wanes, their atrocities and violence have expanded in scope and intensity,\u201d he said, adding that the retaliatory nature of the attacks were designed to control, intimidate, and punish the population.",
      "The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others criticized the military takeover in a statement that also called for the release of ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners.",
      "They said nearly 20 million people need humanitarian assistance and up to 3.5 million people are displaced internally, an increase of nearly 1 million in the last year. They also expressed concern about increased cross-border crime in Myanmar such as drug and human trafficking and online scam operations, which affect neighboring countries and risk broader instability.",
      "\u201cThe current trajectory is not sustainable for Myanmar or the region,\u201d the countries said in the joint statement that also included Australia, Canada, South Korea, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland.",
      "The military's 2021 takeover prompted widespread public protests, whose violent suppression by security forces triggered an armed resistance that has now led to a state of civil war. Ethnic minority militias and people\u2019s defense forces that support Myanmar\u2019s main opposition control large parts of the country, while the military holds much of central Myanmar and big cities including the capital, Naypyidaw.",
      "The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which keeps detailed tallies of arrests and casualties linked to the repression of the military government, said that at least 6,239 were killed and 28,444 were arrested since the takeover. The actual death toll is likely to be much higher since the group does not generally include deaths on the side of the military government and cannot easily verify cases in remote areas.",
      "Aung Thu Nyein, director of communications for the Institute for Strategy and Policy-Myanmar think tank, told The Associated Press that Myanmar's current situation is at its worst with peace and development being pushed back.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s worse is that the sovereignty which ever-proclaimed by the military is losing, and the country\u2019s borders could even shift,\u201d Aung Thu Nyein said in a text message.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s army suffered unprecedented battlefield defeats over the past year, when a coalition of ethnic armed groups won victories in the northeast near the Chinese border and in the western state of Rakhine.",
      "The ethnic rebels were able to quickly capture several towns, military bases and two important regional commands, and their offensive weakened the army\u2019s grip in other parts of the country.",
      "The ethnic minorities have been fighting for decades for greater autonomy from Myanmar\u2019s central government and are loosely allied with the People\u2019s Defense Force, the pro-democracy armed resistance formed after the army\u2019s 2021 takeover.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Office and rights groups including Amnesty International also made rare allegations in recent statements that armed groups opposing the military have also committed human rights violations in areas under their control.",
      "In pursuit of a political solution, the military government is pushing for an election, which it has promised to hold this year. Critics say the election would not be free or fair as civil rights have been curtailed and many political opponents imprisoned and the election would be an attempt to normalize military control.",
      "On Friday, the military government extended a state of emergency another six months because it said more time was needed to restore stability before the election, state-run MRTV television reported. No exact date for the polls was given.",
      "Tom Andrews, a special rapporteur working with the U.N. human rights office, said it wasn't possible to hold a legitimate election while arresting, detaining, torturing and executing leaders of the opposition and when it is illegal for journalists or citizens to criticize the military government.",
      "\u201cGovernments should dismiss these plans for what they are \u2013 a fraud,\u201d Tom Andrews said."

      "French President Emmanuel Macron says the cauldron balloon, one of the Paris Olympics\u2019 most admired attractions, would float in the skies over the French capital every summer until the 2028 Los Angeles Games",
      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron announced Friday that the cauldron balloon, one of the Paris Olympics ' most admired attractions, would float in the skies over the French capital every summer until the 2028 Los Angeles Games.",
      "Macron posted on his TikTok account a video of the cauldron flying through the air at night, accompanied by Celine Dion's cover of Edith Piaf\u2019s \u201cHymne \u00e0 l\u2019amour\u201d (\u201cHymn to Love\u201d) \u2014 the song Dion performed at the Paris Olympics\u2019 opening ceremony.",

He is also accused of lying to Federal Reserve investigators and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau officials.",
      "The Department of Justice announced Rogers' indictment and arrest on Friday, the same day he made his first appearance before a Washington court. Rogers is being held without bond and is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday, according to court records.",
      "\u201cAs alleged in the indictment, Rogers betrayed his country while employed at the Federal Reserve by providing restricted U.S. financial and economic information to Chinese government intelligence officers,\u201d said Assistant Director Kevin Vorndran of the FBI Counterintelligence Division in an announcement of Rogers' indictment and arrest.",
      "\u201cThis information could allow adversaries to illegally gain a strategic economic advantage at the expense of the U.S. This indictment sends a clear message that the FBI and our partners will hold accountable those who threaten our national security,\u201d Vorndran said.",

      "The Justice Department said the information \u201ccould allow China to manipulate the U.S. market ... in a manner to insider trading.\u201d The department noted that China, as of October 2024, held about $816 billion in U.S. foreign debt and that Chinese financial players could benefit from inside knowledge of U.S. economic policy, such as advance notice of federal funds rate changes, when making decisions about buying and selling U.S. debt instruments.",

      "Prosecutors allege that Rogers and two Chinese co-conspirators began communicating as early as 2013. The indictment asserts that Rogers later forwarded protected information to his personal email or made print copies to pass along to his co-conspirators. The cache allegedly included proprietary economic data and analysis, briefing books written for Federal Reserve governors, details of Federal Open Market Committee deliberations and future announcements, and accounts of conversations about tariffs targeted at China, according to the indictment.",
      "Rogers is accused of meeting co-conspirators in China for multiple visits, under the guise of him being an academic instructor teaching them as students. The indictment alleges that in 2023, Rogers received $450,000 as a part-time professor at a Chinese university. ___"

    "story": [
      "With home prices high, American families are grappling with the prospect that homeownership might remain out of reach for them for a long time",
      "The Petersen family\u2019s two-bedroom apartment in northern California is starting to feel small.",
      "Four-year-old Jerrik's toy monster trucks are everywhere in the 1,100-square-foot unit in Campbell, just outside of San Jose. And it's only a matter of time before 9-month-old Carolynn starts amassing more toys, adding to the disarray, says her mother, Jenn Petersen.",
      "The 42-year-old chiropractor had hoped she and her husband, Steve, a 39-year-old dental hygienist, would have bought a house by now. But when they can afford a bigger place, it will have to be another rental. Petersen has done the math: With mortgage rates and home prices stubbornly high, there's no way the couple, who make about $270,000 a year and pay about $2,500 in monthly rent, can afford a home anywhere in their area.",
      "According to October data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, a San Jose family with a median income of $156,700 would need to spend 80% of their income on housing \u2014 including an $8,600 monthly mortgage payment \u2014 to own a median-priced $1.54 million home. That's far higher than the general rule of thumb that people should pay no more than 30% of their income on a mortgage or rent.",
      "Moving out of state is out of the question for the Petersens \u2014 they have strong family ties to the area and their income would plummet if they move to a lower cost-of-living area. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to give up my job and close connections with my family for a house,\u201d Petersen said.",
      "The issue is widespread and near historic highs nationally: As of last fall, the median homeowner in the U.S. was paying 42% of their income on homeownership costs, according to the Atlanta Fed. Four years ago, that percentage was 28% and had not previously reached 38% since late 2007, just before the housing market crash.",
      "\u201cThe American dream, as our parents knew it, doesn\u2019t exist anymore,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cThe whole idea that you get a house after you graduate college, get a steady job and get married? I\u2019ve done most of those milestones. But the homeownership part? That just doesn\u2019t fit financially.\u201d",
      "The same is true for an increasing number of American families.",
      "In 2024, the median first-time homebuyer was 38 years old, a jump from age 35 the previous year, according to a recent report by the National Association of Realtors. That's significantly above historic norms, when median first-time buyers hovered between 30 and 32 years old from 1993 to 2018.",
      "The biggest driver of this trend, experts said, is simple: There are far too few houses on the market to match pent-up demand, driving prices past the point of affordability for many people who are relatively early in their careers. Coupled with high mortgage rates, many have concluded that renting is their only option.",
      "\u201cWage growth hasn\u2019t kept up with the increase in home prices and interest rates,\u201d said Domonic Purviance, who studies housing at the Atlanta Fed. \u201cEven though people are making more money, home prices are increasing at a faster rate.\u201d",
      "That gap has left many out of the housing market, which for generations has been a way for Americans to build equity and wealth that they can pass down or leverage to buy a larger home. It's also led to widespread worries about housing in the U.S. About 7 in 10 voters under age 45 said they were \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the cost of housing in their community, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters in the 2024 election.",
      "Brian McCabe, a sociology professor at Georgetown University, said he frequently tells his students that \u201cthere are few things that all Americans agree on, but one of them is that they\u2019d rather own a home than rent.\u201d",
      "McCabe said homeownership, especially as a wealth-building tool, is the right move for many, especially if the owner intends to be in one place for a long time. But he also said many are realizing that not owning a home has its advantages, too \u2014 it gives people more flexibility to move and allows them to live in exciting neighborhoods they would not be able to afford to buy property in.",
      "McCabe said millennials are getting married later, having children later, have a stronger desire to stay in cities and, especially due to remote work, value the flexibility of being able to move with ease \u2014 all of which he said could prompt an end to the notion that homeownership is the \u201capex of the American dream.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe big question is whether we see the sheen of homeownership start to fade,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cIt's such an interesting cultural marker: Why is owning a home the pinnacle for so many people?\u201d",
      "It's a question Petersen wrestles with because she knows any three-bedroom home she found in her area would leave her family \u201chouse poor.\u201d",
      "\"I used to subscribe to the idea that owning a house is just a natural milestone you have to reach,\" she said. \u201cAt some point, though, what are you sacrificing by just owning a house and gaining equity? I want to be able to travel with my kids. I want to be able to sign them up for extracurriculars. How are we supposed to do that if we're paying a mortgage that's most of our take-home pay?\u201d",
      "Petersen said she'll \u201calways hold out a little bit of hope\" that homeownership will be in her family's future. But if they find a townhouse to rent that has space for her kids and fits within their $3,600 monthly rental budget?",
      "\u201cI'd take that,\u201d she said.",
      "Lifelong Boston resident Julieta Lopez, 63, spent decades hoping to buy a home but watched as prices became increasingly out of reach.",
      "\u201cThe prices in Boston just got higher and higher and higher and higher,\u201d said Lopez, who works for the city traffic department issuing tickets for parking violations.",
      "Two years ago, furious to learn that her subsidized apartment's monthly rent was being hiked to $2,900, Lopez, who earns about $60,000 annually, took out her phone and began searching for government programs that help first-time homebuyers. She was determined to finally own her own place.",
      "Within months, she had succeeded. Lopez qualified to receive $50,000 from the local Massachusetts Affordable Homeownership Alliance nonprofit and another $50,000 from the city of Boston's Office of Housing \u2014 funds that helped her with a down payment on the $430,000 two-bedroom condominium she shares with her 30-year-old son. She now pays about $2,160 a month on her mortgage.",
      "Lopez knows she is lucky the city has placed such a focus on aiding first-time buyers like herself \u2014 Boston has poured more than $24 million into its homeownership assistance programs since Mayor Michelle Wu took office in 2021, helping nearly 700 residents get their first homes.",
      "But Lopez also feels proud to have her own place after years of working so hard \u2014 jobs that included everything from telecommunications to health care to electronics.",
      "\u201cI was determined to have my piece of the pie,\" she said. \u201cI felt I deserved that. I\u2019ve always worked. Always. Nonstop.\"",

      "Canada and Mexico say they\u2019ve prepared the option of retaliatory tariffs to be used if necessary now that the White House says the U.S. will put in place 25% tariffs on imports from them this weekend",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump will put in place 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China effective on Saturday, the White House said, but it provided no word on whether there would be any exemptions to the measures that could result in swift price increases to U.S. consumers.",
      "Trump had been threatening the tariffs to ensure greater cooperation from the countries on stopping illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used for fentanyl, but he has also pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing and raise revenues for the federal government.",
      "\u201cStarting tomorrow, those tariffs will be in place,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. \u201cThese are promises made and promises kept by the president.\u201d",
      "The tariffs carry both political and economic risks for Trump, who is just two weeks into his second term. Many voters backed the Republican on the promise that he could tamp down inflation, but the possibility of tariffs could trigger higher prices and potentially disrupt the energy, auto, lumber and agricultural sectors.",
      "Trump had said he was weighing issuing an exemption for Canadian and Mexican oil imports, but Leavitt said she had no information to share on the president's decision on any potential carveouts.",
      "The United States imported almost 4.6 million barrels of oil daily from Canada in October and 563,000 barrels from Mexico, according to the Energy Information Administration. U.S. daily production during that month averaged nearly 13.5 million barrels a day.",
      "Trump has previously stated a 10% tariff on Chinese imports would be on top of other import taxes charged on products from the country.",
      "Shortly after Leavitt spoke, the S&P 500 stock index sold off and largely erased its gains on the day.",
      "Both Canada and Mexico have said they\u2019ve prepared the option of retaliatory tariffs to be used if necessary, which in turn could trigger a wider trade conflict that economic analyses say could hurt growth and further accelerate inflation.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that Canada is ready is a respond if Trump goes ahead with the tariffs, but he did not give details.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re ready with a response, a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we want, but if he moves forward, we will also act.\u201d",
      "Trudeau said tariffs would have \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d for the U.S, putting American jobs at risk and causing prices to rise. Trudeau reiterated that less than 1% of the fentanyl and illegal crossings into the U.S. come from Canada.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that Mexico has maintained a dialogue with Trump\u2019s team since before he returned to the White House, but she emphasized that Mexico has a \u201cPlan A, Plan B, Plan C for what the United States government decides.\"",
      "\u201cNow it is very important that the Mexican people know that we are always going to defend the dignity of our people, we are always going to defend the respect of our sovereignty and a dialogue between equals, as we have always said, without subordination,\u201d Sheinbaum said.",
      "A study this month by Warwick McKibbin and Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics concluded that the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China \u201cwould damage all the economies involved, including the US.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cFor Mexico,\u2019\u2019 the study said, \u201ca 25% tariff would be catastrophic.

      "In the first serious fallout from President Donald Trump\u2019s early actions against offshore wind power, oil and gas giant Shell is walking away from a major project off the coast of New Jersey",
      "In the first serious fallout from President Donald Trump's early actions against offshore wind power, oil and gas giant Shell is walking away from a major project off the coast of New Jersey.",
      "Shell told The Associated Press it is writing off the project, citing increased competition, delays and a changing market.",
      "\u201cNaturally we also take regulatory context into consideration,\u201d spokesperson Natalie Gunnell said in an email.",
      "Shell co-owns the large Atlantic Shores project, which has most of its permits and would generate enough power for 1 million homes if both of two phases were completed. That\u2019s enough for one-third of New Jersey households.",
      "It's unclear whether Shell's decision kills the project \u2014 partner EDF-RE Offshore Development says it remains committed to Atlantic Shores.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order singling out offshore wind for contempt with a temporary halt on all lease sales in federal waters and a pause on approvals, permits and loans. Perhaps most of interest to Shell, the order directs administration officials to review existing offshore wind energy leases and identify any legal reasons to terminate them.",
      "Large offshore wind farms have been making electricity for three decades in Europe, and more recently in Asia. They are considered by experts to be an essential part of addressing climate change because they can take the place of fossil fuel plants, if paired with battery storage. New Jersey has set a goal of generating 100% of its energy from clean sources by 2035.",
      "The Biden administration approved plans to build the Atlantic Shores project in two phases in October, but construction has not begun. Oliver Metcalfe, head of wind research at BloombergNEF, said the partners are facing significant uncertainty about their lease, and other developers are watching what happens with Atlantic Shores closely. \u201cWe\u2019re in uncertain territory here,\u201d he added.",
      "Offshore wind foes, who are particularly vocal and well-organized in New Jersey, celebrated Shell\u2019s withdrawal. Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew, of New Jersey, helped the Trump team draft the executive order. He said Shell\u2019s decision is a \u201cbig win\u201d for New Jersey\u2019s coastline and economy but \u201cthis fight is not over.\u201d",
      "Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast NJ, said that without Shell's financial backing, it appears the project is \u201cdead in the water.\u201d",
      "Shell is writing off a nearly $1 billion investment. It announced its decision on Thursday, as it reported a 16% decline in full-year earnings of $23.7 billion from $28.3 billion. Most of its business is oil and gas.",
      "Danish wind developer Orsted was close to beginning work on two offshore wind farms in New Jersey but scrapped the project in Oct. 2023 after deciding it would not be economical.",
      "A lot of clean energy is cheap now, but offshore wind is still among the most expensive. That can make these projects less attractive to investors, absent strong policy support, said Coco Zhang, vice president for environmental, social and governance research at ING.",
      "\u201cThe potential uncertainty that the executive order has brought to the market, it cannot be ignored,\u201d she said.",
      "The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals to deploy offshore wind energy, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale offshore wind energy projects.",

      "The latest inflation figures arrive as President Donald Trump has threatened to impose big import taxes on goods from Canada and Mexico, potentially affecting everything from autos to avocados, which could push prices higher in the coming months.",
      "Friday\u2019s report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose 2.6% in December from a year earlier, up from a 2.4% annual pace in November and the third straight increase. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices increased 2.8% compared with a year ago, the same as in November and October.",
      "There were some positive signs in Wednesday\u2019s report, however. When measured in shorter time frames, inflation is slowing: In December, core prices ticked up 0.2% from the previous month, a pace that is nearly consistent with the Fed\u2019s annual target. Economists \u2014 and Fed officials \u2014 pay close attention to core prices because they provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures arrive just two days after Federal Reserve officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, decided to pause their interest rate cuts in part because inflation has largely been stuck at about 2.5%, above their 2% target, for the past six months.",
      "In the past three months, core prices have risen at an annual rate of just 2.2%, down from 2.6% in November.",
      "Many businesses raise prices at the start of the year, which could push up inflation a bit when January's figures are released next month. But the Fed's preferred gauge should decline steadily in the next few months, economists say, as higher inflation readings early last year fall out of the year-over-year figures.",
      "\u201cBeyond that, however, the growing risk that Trump will impose tariffs a little earlier than we are assuming presents an upside risk to inflation,\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm, said in a written note.",
      "Overall inflation climbed 0.3% in December from the previous month, driven higher by a jump in gas prices. Monthly increases at that level, if they continued, would exceed the Fed's target.",
      "The Commerce Department's report also showed consumer spending rose a healthy 0.7% in December from the previous month, fueled in part by steady wage gains and higher stock prices and home values. Incomes rose 0.4%, the government said. With spending outpacing incomes, the savings rate fell to 3.8% from 4.1%.",
      "Americans specifically ramped up spending on goods, such as electronics and furniture, likely a sign that consumers are buying more manufactured products, many of which are imported, before the potential imposition of tariffs that Trump has threatened to implement.",
      "Underlying trends point to lower inflation ahead. Apartment rental prices and other housing costs are slowly moderating. And a sluggish labor market has meant wage growth has slipped, which means companies are under less pressure to raise prices to offset higher labor costs.",
      "\u201cWe seem to be set up for further progress,\u201d Powell said Wednesday at a news conference, referring to inflation. \u201cBut being \u2018seem to set up for' it is one thing, having it is another. So we're going to want to see further progress on inflation.\u201d",
      "Until then, Powell suggested, the Fed is likely to keep its key rate at about 4.3%, down a full percentage point from a two-decade peak last year before three cuts at the end of 2024. The Fed expects higher borrowing costs will weigh on spending and bring inflation down further.",
      "Consumers, meanwhile, powered strong growth in the final three months of last year, when the economy expanded at a solid 2.3% annual rate. Growth was stronger in the July-September quarter, at 3.1%, but the fourth-quarter expansion was held back by a sharp reduction in business inventories, which should reverse in coming quarters."

      "WASHINGTON -- The 25% tax that President Donald Trump plans to slap on imports from Canada and Mexico as soon as Saturday could drive up the price of everything from gasoline and pickup trucks, to Super Bowl party guacamole dip.",
      "The tariffs would also invite retaliation. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, has already vowed to counterpunch by pulling American alcohol off store shelves in the Canadian province \u2013 no idle threat; Canada is the world\u2019s No. 2 market for America\u2019s distilled spirits (behind the 27-nation European Union).",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs threaten to blow up the trade agreement he himself negotiated with America\u2019s neighbors in his first term. His U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2013 \u201cthe fairest, most balanced, and beneficial trade agreement we have ever signed into law,\u2019\u2019 Trump once declared -- was supposed to bring predictability to North American trade, giving businesses the confidence to make investments.",
      "But when it comes to the self-proclaimed \u201cTariff Man,\u2019\u2019 Trump and his passion for plastering taxes on foreign goods, nothing is predictable, and nothing is ever really settled.",
      "\u201cTariffs at those levels and at that scope would effectively destroy the agreement that Trump himself negotiated and always brags about,\u2019\u2019 said Scott Lincicome, a trade analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.",
      "The president says the 25% levies are designed to pressure America\u2019s two neighbors to do more to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl into the United States.",
      "Michael Robinet of S&P Global Mobility and many other analysts suspect the tariff threat is also designed to get Canada and Mexico to go along with America\u2019s demands for changes to the USMCA when it comes up for renewal next year.",
      "Robinet, executive director of automotive consulting at S&P Global, said he doubts that Trump will go ahead with 25% across-the-board tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports \u2013 what he calls a \u201cshock-to-the-system\u2019\u2019 approach that would freeze the North American economy in a \u201cTariff Winter.\u2019\u2019 Instead, Robinet said, Trump might postpone or phase in the tariffs or initially exempt some industries to show Canada and Mexico how much worse things could get if he doesn\u2019t get his way.",
      "Trump pressured Mexico and Canada into agreeing to the USMCA five years ago, partly to narrow the United States\u2019 big trade deficit \u2013 the gap between what the U.S. sells and what it buys.",
      "It hasn\u2019t worked out that way.",
      "The U.S. deficit in the trade of goods of Mexico has widened from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion in 2023 (the last full year for which numbers are available). That is partly because Mexico has replaced China, locked in an ongoing trade war with the United States, as the source of many U.S. imports \u2013 furniture, textiles, shoes, laptops, computer servers.",
      "The trade gap in goods with Canada has ballooned, too: From $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023. The deficit largely reflects America\u2019s imports of Canadian energy.",
      "\u201cThe USMCA has not met the goals that Trump set forth for it. Our trade deficit with Canada and Mexico is bigger than it was, considerably,\u2019\u2019 said Lori Wallach, director of the Rethink Trade program at the American Economic Liberties Project and a longtime critic of America\u2019s free trade pacts. \u201cA lot of jobs have been offshored to Mexico since USMCA.\u2019\u2019",
      "When the USMCA comes up for renewal next year, the U.S. is expected to press for rules that would do more to encourage factories to produce in the United States. And it could seek a crackdown on Chinese goods being sent through Mexico to the United States to evade tariffs that Trump and President Joe Biden imposed on Beijing.",
      "The United States now does far more business \u2013 exports and imports alike \u2013 with both Canada and Mexico than it does with China. In 2023, U.S. trade of both goods and services with Canada and Mexico came to more than $1.8 trillion, compared with $643 billion with China. Because of USMCA \u2013 and the regional trade deal it replaced in 2020 \u2013 most products cross the region\u2019s borders tariff-free.",
      "The threatened 25% tariffs are causing heartburn in corporate boardrooms. If Trump goes ahead with his threat, tariffs would surge from $1.3 billion to $132 billion a year on Mexico\u2019s imports to the United States and from $440 million to $107 billion on Canada\u2019s, according to the tax and consulting firm PwC.",
      "And no one knows if Trump will really pull the trigger or how long the tariffs would stay in place if he does. \u201cIt\u2019s really thrown industry into this turmoil of anxiety,\u201d said trade lawyer Chandri Navarro, senior counsel at Baker & McKenzie. \u201cWhat industry likes is certainty. You\u2019re making production decisions, supply chain decisions, purchasing decisions five years out.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump views tariffs as a fix-it for most of what ails the economy. He says they raise money for cuts in income and corporate taxes, encourage companies to move production to the United States and offer useful leverage in pressuring other countries to make concessions on trade and other issues.",
      "Trump administration officials also say critics of potential tariffs shouldn't view them in isolation, arguing that their other policies, including lowering taxes and easing regulations, will strengthen the economy.",
      "Companies are scrambling to prepare. Some bought goods and shipped them to the United States ahead of time to beat the tariffs. Others are calculating how much of the cost they can pass along to their customers. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s going to impact a lot of consumers,\u2019\u2019 said Dave Evans, co-founder and CEO of Fictiv, a San Francisco company that helps clients manage their supply chains in plastics and metals. \u201cWe saw this in his first term. A tariff isn\u2019t fully absorbed by the companies.\u2019\u2019",
      "Canada and Mexico are bracing, too. Chrystia Freeland, the former finance minister who represented Canada in USMCA negotiations, has called for retaliation if Trump moves ahead with tariffs. \u201cBeing smart means retaliating where it hurts,\u201d said Freeland, who is running to replace prime minister Justin Trudeau. \u201cOur counterpunch must be dollar-for-dollar \u2014 and it must be precisely and painfully targeted: Florida orange growers, Wisconsin dairy farmers, Michigan dishwasher manufacturers, and much more.\u201d",
      "Likewise, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum promised in November that \u201cfor every tariff, there will be a response in kind.\u2019\u2019",
      "A closer look at three industries that likely would bear the brunt of Trump\u2019s tariffs:",

      "\u201cIn Moldova\u2019s case, foreign donor support is vital to balancing the media landscape,\" says Oxana Greadcenco, the director of independent media platform Moldova.org. \u201cMany television networks and media institutions are funded by Russia so there needs to be a counterbalance ... This is an unprecedented situation, but we are trying not to panic.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, informed her that grants officially ended on Jan. 24 and they aren\u2019t allowed to spend any remaining funds in their accounts. This week, Greadcenco promoted their online Patreon campaign, which garnered 135 new backers in two days, which should cover salaries for the platform\u2019s 16-strong staff through March, she said.",
      "\u201cWe did not expect it to impact Moldova so severely, as we thought there would only be a partial cut in funds,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \"Being aware of how much Moldova depends on U.S. funds, not just NGOs and the press but also local municipalities, many public institutions \u2026 this is a shock for everyone.\"",
      "Since the 1990s, USAID has invested several billion dollars in countries like Moldova, Serbia, Albania, Kosovo, and Bosnia and Herzegovina \u2014 all former communist countries with aspirations of joining the European Union.",
      "In these countries, USAID money has promoted democratic institutions and reforms, aided infrastructure and energy security projects, bolstered businesses and economies, and supported a significant number of nongovernmental organizations and independent media platforms. The agency says it \u201ctailors its approach to each country\u2019s unique challenges and opportunities.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no exaggeration to say that we have democracy in Moldova, in part thanks to American financial support,\u201d Valeriu Pasa, the chairman of the Chisinau-based think-tank WatchDog, said in a statement on Wednesday.

      "Safet Gerxhaliu, an independent economic analyst in Kosovo, also believes the USAID freeze could have \u201ca very negative impact\u201d on the country\u2019s future, affecting everything from the government to the private sector and education.",
      "\u201cI do believe that the impact is very bad, because those measures come at the same time that Kosovo is under sanctions from the European community,\u201d he said. Brussels froze some funding to Kosovo in 2023 following a series of clashes with ethnic Serb minorities.",
      "Although Serbia obtained EU candidate status in 2012, the Balkan nation is also a key ally of Russia and China in Europe. Under the government of populist President Aleksandar Vucic, reforms in areas such as strengthening the rule of law and tackling corruption have been slow, and the USAID suspension could further hamper progress.",
      "\u201cWe currently have a USAID project about public financing. Training for local NGOs regarding following of public finances,\u201d Nemanja Nenadic from Transparency International organization in Serbia, told the AP. \u201cThis has been put on hold.\u201d",
      "For the Promo-LEX Association, a longtime pro-democracy and human rights NGO in Moldova, USAID funds are vital since they account for about 75-80% of its projects, which include monitoring elections, political financing and parliamentary oversight.",
      "\u201cAll USAID-funded activities have been put on hold. Without immediate alternative support, these crucial activities may not continue at the same scale or effectiveness,\u201d said Ion Manole, the association\u2019s executive director. \u201cGiven previous Russian interference \u2014 through illicit campaign funding, political corruption, and disinformation \u2014 our observation mission is essential to ensuring electoral transparency.\"",
      "Moldova will hold a pivotal parliamentary election this fall which comes after the pro-Western government accused Russia of meddling in two key votes last year \u2014 including backing a vast vote-buying scheme in the country of about 2.5 million people.",
      "\u201cWithout resources, we cannot deploy long-term observers, conduct election-day monitoring, or track foreign interference effectively,\" Manole said. \u201cA change to an anti-Western government could affect Moldova\u2019s European path and ... significantly destabilize the whole of Eastern Europe and the Black Sea region.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain hopeful that the U.S. government\u2019s evaluation process will allow programs like ours to resume,\u201d he said, adding that his NGO is already seeking alternative funding, mainly from European donors.",
      "Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told the AP that any suspension of aid \u201cgives Russia an unnecessary opportunity to exploit and benefit further from Moldova\u2019s weaknesses, which the lack of USAID funding would exacerbate.\u201d",
      "\u201cMoscow would therefore have greater abilities to derail Chisinau from its European Union integration course,\u201d he said. \u201cSimilarly, cutting funding to independent news outlets makes it more difficult for journalists to hold corrupt politicians \u2014 many of whom have connections to Russia \u2014 accountable and therefore weakens Moldova\u2019s sovereignty and institutional independence.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has cast the aid freeze as an accountability quest to justify American spending abroad. Beyond support for Ukraine in recent years, the U.S. is spending about $40 billion in foreign aid annually, according to the U.S. State Department.",
      "Greadcenco of the Moldova.org news platform hopes that other international partners will consider stepping in to stem a potential longer-term shortfall.",
      "\u201cThese funds are vital to keeping Moldova afloat,\u201d she said. \u201cI dread to think what the complete cessation of these funds would mean for our country.\u201d",

      "The Kospi in South Korea fell 1.4% to 2,501.83 as trading resumed on Friday after the holidays, during which Chinese startup DeepSeek stirred panic in the AI world. Shares of SK Hynix, a major supplier to Nvidia Corp., plummeted by 9.9%. Another tech giant, Samsung, lost 2.4%.",
      "Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 advanced 0.3% to 8,516.90. In Bangkok, the SET was up 0.1%.",

      "Meta Platforms helped push indexes higher by rising 1.6%. The company behind Facebook and Instagram delivered a better profit for the end of 2024 than analysts expected. Perhaps just as importantly for the market, it also talked up its artificial-intelligence efforts and said it will continue to invest in the space.",
      "That calmed some of the worries created by DeepSeek when it said it developed a large language model capable of competing with the world\u2019s best without having to use top-flight chips. That raised questions about whether all the investment expected for AI chips, data centers  and electricity is really needed and sent a shock through markets at the start of the week.",
      "The AI boom has been a primary reason for the U.S. stock market\u2019s run to repeated records, and the threat has hit stocks like Nvidia particularly hard. The chip company that\u2019s become the symbol of the AI frenzy spent most of Thursday lower but ended with a gain of 1% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500.",
      "Keeping indexes in check was Microsoft, which fell 6.2%. The Redmond, Washington-based software giant topped analysts\u2019 expectations for profit in the latest quarter, but the focus was instead on the slower-than-expected growth in its cloud computing business, which is a centerpiece of its AI efforts.",

    "summary": "Friday marks five years since Britain left the European Union at 11 p.m. on Jan. 31, 2020",
    "story": [
      "Friday marks five years since Britain left the European Union at 11 p.m. on Jan. 31, 2020",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Five years ago Friday, two crowds of people gathered near Britain\u2019s Parliament \u2014 some with Union Jacks and cheers, others European Union flags and tears.",
      "On Jan. 31, 2020 at 11 p.m. London time \u2013 midnight at EU headquarters in Brussels \u2014 the U.K. officially left the bloc after almost five decades of membership that had brought free movement and free trade between Britain and 27 other European countries.",
      "For Brexit supporters, the U.K. was now a sovereign nation in charge of its own destiny. For opponents, it was an isolated and diminished country.",
      "It was, inarguably, a divided nation that had taken a leap into the dark. Five years on, people and businesses are still wrestling with the economic, social and cultural aftershocks.",
      "\u201cThe impact has been really quite profound,\u201d said political scientist Anand Menon, who heads the think-tank U.K. in a Changing Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s changed our economy.",
      "\u201cAnd our politics has been changed quite fundamentally as well,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a new division around Brexit becoming part of electoral politics.\u201d",
      "An island nation with a robust sense of its historical importance, Britain had long been an uneasy member of the EU when it held a referendum in June 2016 on whether to remain or leave. Decades of deindustrialization, followed by years of public spending cuts and high immigration, made fertile ground for the argument that Brexit would let the U.K. \u201ctake back control\u201d of its borders, laws and economy.",
      "Yet the result \u2014 52% to 48% in favor of leaving \u2014 came as a shock to many. Neither the Conservative government, which campaigned to stay in the EU, nor pro-Brexit campaigners had planned for the messy details of the split.",
      "The referendum was followed by years of wrangling over divorce terms between a wounded EU and a fractious U.K. that caused gridlock in Parliament and ultimately defeated Prime Minister Theresa May. She resigned in 2019 and was replaced by Boris Johnson, who vowed to \u201cget Brexit done.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t so simple.",
      "The U.K. left without agreement on its future economic relationship with the EU, which accounted for half the country\u2019s trade. The political departure was followed by 11 months of testy negotiations on divorce terms, culminating in agreement on Christmas Eve in 2020.",
      "The bare-bones trade deal saw the U.K. leave the bloc\u2019s single market and customs union. It meant goods could move without tariffs or quotas, but brought new red tape, costs and delays for trading businesses.",
      "\u201cIt has cost us money. We are definitely slower and it\u2019s more expensive. But we\u2019ve survived,\u201d said Lars Andersen, whose London-based company, My Nametags, ships brightly colored labels for kids\u2019 clothes and school supplies to more than 150 countries.",
      "To keep trading with the EU, Andersen has had to set up a base in Ireland, through which all orders destined for EU countries must pass before being sent on. He says the hassle has been worth it, but some other small businesses he knows have stopped trading with the EU or moved manufacturing out of the U.K.",
      "Julianne Ponan, founder and CEO of allergen-free food producer Creative Nature, had a growing export business to EU countries that was devastated by Brexit. Since then she has successfully turned to markets in the Middle East and Australia, something she says has been a positive outcome of leaving the EU.",
      "Having mastered the new red tape, she is now gradually building up business with Europe again.",
      "\u201cBut we\u2019ve lost four years of growth there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the sad part. We would be a lot further ahead in our journey if Brexit hadn\u2019t happened.\u201d",
      "The government\u2019s Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that U.K. exports and imports will both be around 15% lower in the long run than if the U.K. had remained in the EU, and economic productivity 4% less than it otherwise would have been.",
      "Brexit supporters argue that short-term pain will be offset by Britain\u2019s new freedom to strike trade deals around the world. Since Brexit. the U.K. has signed trade agreements with countries including Australia, New Zealand and Canada.",
      "But David Henig, a trade expert at the European Center for International Political Economy, said they have not offset the hit to trade with Britain\u2019s nearest neighbors.",
      "\u201cThe big players aren\u2019t so much affected,\u201d Henig said. \u201cWe still have Airbus, we still have Scotch whisky. We still do defense, big pharmaceuticals. But the mid-size players are really struggling to keep their exporting position. And nobody new is coming in to set up.\u201d",
      "In some ways, Brexit has not played out as either supporters or opponents anticipated. The COVID-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine piled on more economic disruption, and made it harder to discern the impact of Britain\u2019s EU exit on the economy.",
      "In one key area, immigration, Brexit\u2019s impact has been the opposite of what many predicted. A desire to reduce immigration was a major reason many people voted to leave the EU, yet immigration today is far higher than before Brexit because the number of visas granted for workers from around the world has soared.",
      "Meanwhile, the rise of protectionist political leaders, especially newly returned U.S. President Donald Trump, has raised the stakes for Britain, now caught between its near neighbors in Europe and its trans-Atlantic \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe world is a far less forgiving place now than it was in 2016 when we voted to leave,\u201d Menon said.",
      "Polls suggest U.K. public opinion has soured on Brexit, with a majority of people now thinking it was a mistake. But rejoining seems a distant prospect. With memories of arguments and division still raw, few people want to go through all that again.",
      "Labour Party Prime Minister Keir Starmer, elected in July 2024, has promised to \u201creset\u201d relations with the EU, but has ruled out rejoining the customs union or single market. He\u2019s aiming for relatively modest changes such as a making it easier for artists to tour and for professionals to have their qualifications recognized, as well as on closer cooperation on law enforcement and security.",
      "EU leaders have welcomed the change of tone from Britain, but have problems of their own amid growing populism across the continent. The U.K. is no longer a top priority.",
      "\u201cI completely understand, it\u2019s difficult to get back together after quite a harsh divorce,\u201d said Andersen, who nonetheless hopes Britain and the EU will draw closer with time. \u201cI suspect it will happen, but it will happen slowly and subtly without politicians particularly shouting about it.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Police boats have returned to the Potomac River as part of the recovery and investigation after the United States\u2019 deadliest aviation disaster in almost a quarter century",
      "ARLINGTON, Va. -- Police boats combed the banks of the Potomac River on Friday morning, moving slowly and scanning the shoreline as part of the investigation into the midair collision that killed 67 people in the United States' deadliest aviation disaster in almost a quarter century.",
      "More than 40 bodies have been pulled from the river as the massive recovery effort continued, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press on Friday. The officials were not authorized to discuss details of the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "Crews worked under overcast skies Friday morning with rain expected throughout the day. Planes continued to take off and land at Reagan National, with airport operations gradually returning to normal after a slew of canceled and delayed flights following the crash.",
      "Investigators have already recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder of the American Airlines plane that collided with an Army helicopter as the plane was landing Wednesday night at Ronald Reagan National Airport next to Washington, D.C. Officials are scrutinizing a range of factors in what National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Hommendy has called an \u201call-hands-on-deck event.\u201d",
      "All aboard the two aircraft were killed, with officials examining the actions of the military pilot as well as air traffic control after the helicopter apparently flew into the path of the American Airlines jet.",
      "Air crash investigations normally take 12-18 months, and investigators told reporters Thursday they would not speculate on the cause.",
      "Authorities were still looking for the helicopter's black box recorder, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday on Fox News Channel. Other factors in the crash, including the helicopter\u2019s altitude and whether the crew was using its night vision goggles, are still under investigation, Hegseth said.",
      "Although some of the airspace had already been restricted following the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration decided to indefinitely bar most helicopters from using the low-to-the-ground routes that run under or parallel to the airport\u2019s flightpaths, an official told the AP on Friday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.",
      "Military aircraft frequently conduct such flights in and around the nation\u2019s capital for familiarization with routes they would fly in case of a major catastrophe or an attack on the U.S. that would require relocation of key officials from the capital region.",
      "\u201cYou need to train as you fight, you need to rehearse in ways that would reflect a real world scenario,\u201d Hegseth said. He stressed that it remained the Pentagon\u2019s duty to also mitigate risks, while conducting such training. But he underscored U.S. forces need \u201cto ensure, if unfortunately, there were a real world event where things needed to happen we could respond to it day or night.\u201d",
      "The plane carried 60 passengers and four crew members, and three soldiers were aboard the helicopter.",
      "One air traffic controller was responsible for coordinating helicopter traffic and arriving and departing planes when the collision happened, according to a report by the FAA that was obtained by the AP. Those duties are often divided between two people, but the airport typically combines the roles at 9:30 p.m., once traffic begins to slow down. On Wednesday the tower supervisor directed that they be combined earlier.",
      "\u201cThe position configuration was not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,\u201d the report said.",
      "A person familiar with the matter, however, said the tower staffing that night was at a normal level. The positions are regularly combined when controllers need to step away from the console for breaks, during shift changes or when air traffic is slow, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures.",
      "The FAA has long struggled with a shortage of air traffic controllers.",
      "Officials said flight conditions were clear as the jet arrived from Wichita, Kansas, carrying, among others, a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches, and four union steamfitters from the Washington area.",
      "A top Army aviation official said the crew of the helicopter, a Black Hawk, was \u201cvery experienced\u201d and familiar with the congested flying that occurs daily around the city.",
      "\u201cBoth pilots had flown this specific route before, at night. This wasn\u2019t something new to either one of them,\u201d said Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for Army aviation.",
      "The helicopter's maximum allowed altitude at the time was 200 feet (about 60 meters), Koziol said. It was not immediately clear whether it exceeded that limit, but Hegseth said altitude seemed to be a factor in the collision.",
      "Koziol said investigators need to analyze the flight data before making conclusions about altitude.",
      "President Donald Trump said in a Friday morning post on his Truth Social platform that the helicopter was \u201cflying too high\u201d at the time of the crash.",
      "\u201cIt was far above the 200 foot limit. That\u2019s not really too complicated to understand, is it???\u201d Trump said. His comments came a day after he questioned the helicopter pilot's actions while also blaming diversity initiatives for undermining air safety.",
      "Flights at Reagan National resumed around midday Thursday.",
      "Wednesday's crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when an American Airlines flight slammed into a residential area of Belle Harbor, New York, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport, killing all 260 people aboard and five people on the ground.",
      "The last major fatal crash involving a U.S. commercial airline occurred in 2009 near Buffalo, New York. Everyone aboard the Bombardier DHC-8 propeller plane was killed, along with one person on the ground, bringing the total death toll to 50.",
      "Experts often highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, however. The National Safety Council estimates that Americans have a 1-in-93 chance of dying in a motor vehicle crash, while deaths on airplanes are too rare to calculate the odds. Figures from the Department of Transportation tell a similar story.",
      "But the airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots no matter how ideal the conditions. They must navigate hundreds of other commercial planes, military aircraft and restricted areas around sensitive sites.",
      "Just over 24 hours before the fatal collision, a different regional jet had to go around for a second chance at landing at Reagan National after it was advised about a military helicopter nearby, according to flight tracking sites and control logs. It landed safely minutes later.",

      "Satellite analysis and on-the-ground visits found a rapid increase in land given over to mining pits in Raja Ampat Regency, a group of tropical islands near West Papua, according to the report from Auriga Nusantara, an environmental and conservation organization in Indonesia.",
      "A few degrees south of the equator, the islands are home to 75% of the world\u2019s coral species and over 1,600 fish species, including critically endangered hawksbill sea turtles and vulnerable reef manta rays. The regency has at least nine marine protected areas spread over nearly 2 million hectares (4.9 million acres), and was named a UNESCO Global Geopark in 2023, recognizing the international value of its geological heritage.",
      "Much of the materials mined in Indonesia fuel the international supply chain for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more. Experts fear that continued expansion of mining \u2014 which more than tripled in the area the past five years \u2014 will lead to further deforestation, water pollution and disruption of the area's precious ecosystem.",
      "Auriga Nusantara's report found that land used for mining in Raja Ampat grew by about 494 hectares (about 1,220 acres) from 2020 through 2024. That was about three times the rate of expansion from the previous five years. The total permit area for mining in Raja Ampat \u2014 all for nickel \u2014 is more than 22,420 hectares, or about 55,400 acres.",
      "Felled trees and open pits of orange-brown gravel and earth scar the islands where mining has started, according to Auriga Nusantara. Sediment from the mines could also be seen along the islands\u2019 coasts as it was carried away by the ocean\u2019s current.",
      "\u201cAs long as the nickel mining continues to operate, the sediment will destroy coral and its surrounding ocean ecosystem,\u201d said Timer Manurung, the director of Auriga Nusantara. \u201dIt\u2019s really a threat for Raja Ampat, as the archipelago is known for ocean biodiversity and richness that makes it an international tourism destination.\u201d",
      "With the world\u2019s largest known nickel reserves and rich deposits of cobalt, bauxite and other materials, Indonesia has been experiencing a mining boom on demand for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more that are needed for the global energy transition. The island nation has sought to expand its mining and processing capabilities while facing backlash from international and local watchdogs for various environmental concerns.",
      "New mining pits were located on at least four islands in the regency, according to the report. One island where mining has occurred is located within the UNESCO Global Geopark area.",

      "Local communities who rely on the area for their local livelihoods \u2014 including subsistence fishing for food and tourism-related activities for income \u2014 have said they've noticed decreased water quality since mining began, said marine ecologist Edy Setyawan, who works in Raja Ampat.",

    "story": [
      "Civil rights activists have gathered outside Target's Minneapolis headquarters to call for a boycott of the retailing giant over its decision to phase out its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Civil rights activists gathered outside the headquarters of Target Corp. on Thursday to call for a national boycott of the retailing giant over its decision to phase out its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "Target announced last Friday that it would join competitor Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back their DEI initiatives, which have come under attack from conservatives and the new White House of President Donald Trump.",
      "Nekima Levy Armstrong, a veteran civil rights lawyer in Minneapolis and founder of the Racial Justice Network, joined other local activists and their supporters at a news conference to urge people to begin the boycott on Saturday, the first day of Black History Month. Many of the participants were regular Target shoppers until now, she said.",
      "Levy Armstrong said they were \u201cstunned\u201d that Target, which increased its commitment to building a more diverse workforce in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis in 2020, backed away from its support of racial equity.",
      "\u201cWe thought that they would hold the line. We thought that they would continue to stand for the values that we all hold dear,\u201d she said. \"But instead they acted cowardly, and they made the decision to bow down to the Trump administration. Well, we are here today saying we will not bow down. We will not step back, and we will not turn around.\u201d",
      "Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on Islamic-American Relations, said that as a company based in the city where Floyd's murder sparked a national reckoning with racial injustice, Target must be called out.",
      "\u201cWe here in Minneapolis today, the good people of the state, are saying to our friends all over the country, \u2018If you were moved to do something good after the murder of George Floyd, it is time for you to stand up and boycott Target,\u2019\u201d Hussein said.",
      "The organizers of the boycott include local Black Lives Matter groups. During the boycott announcement, some speakers cut up their distinctive red Target charge cards, while others called on DEI supporters to shop at Costco, which reaffirmed its commitment to DEI last week.",
      "Despite the anger with Target, the news conference-turned-rally took on a festive atmosphere, with a New Orleans-style brass band playing protest songs like Bob Marley's \u201cGet Up, Stand Up.\u201d Participants circled up for a prayer before the speeches began.",
      "Target, which long was viewed as a strong advocate for the rights of Black and LGBTQ+ people, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday on the call for a boycott. But in a memo to employees last week, Kiera Fernandez, Target\u2019s chief community impact and equity officer, described the company's decision to retire its diversity goals as a \u201cnext chapter\u201d in the company\u2019s human resource and customer engagement strategy.",
      "\u201cAnd as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Levy Armstrong said Target has not reached out to her or other local Black leaders. She said they expected more from Target, and now feel like everything it had done in support of people of color was just window dressing. The starting point for any conversation, she said, would be for the company reverse its decision immediately.",
      "\u201cTarget knows what its presence and its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion means to this community,\" Levy Armstrong said. \u201cSo that is why we are focusing on Target first. But that does not mean that those other businesses should not also be held accountable. All of those businesses should be held accountable, and they should not have access to our dollars.\u201d",
      "Speakers also called on long-established civil rights groups that have benefited from Target\u2019s philanthropy, such as the NAACP and the Urban League, to join the opposition to Target\u2019s decision. Levy Armstrong and Hussein said they plan to partner with other national organizations to get the word out about the boycott and to take other steps they were not yet ready to share publicly.",

    "story": [
      "Emails obtained by The Associated Press reveal Doug Burgum as North Dakota governor catered to the whims of oil and gas executives while leveraging those connections to expand his political profile",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- When North Dakota's petroleum association was going to hold a banquet honoring top fracking executives last year, it turned to Gov. Doug Burgum. The two-term Republican, now President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Interior Department, co-hosted the event \u2014 at the governor's mansion.",
      "And when energy industry lobbyists were looking for help taking on Biden administration greenhouse gas rules, they also turned to Burgum. In an email to Burgum's office seeking the legal heft the state could provide, an industry lobbyist argued that \u201ccombating\u201d such regulations required \u201ca one-two punch\" from industry and government.",
      "While it is not surprising that the governor of the third-largest oil producing state would have a close relationship with fossil fuel producers, records obtained by the Associated Press reveal Burgum's administration eagerly assisted the industry even as the governor was profiting from the lease of family land to oil companies. And his assistance came at a time when Burgum was leaning on those very connections to build his national profile in the Republican Party.",
      "Now that he's been confirmed to run the Interior Department, Burgum will have vast control over federal lands, including the issuance of oil and gas leases, as well as a mandate from Trump to extract such resources even though the U.S. is producing record amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "Those ties concern Democrats and environmentalists who say his zeal to expand drilling was \u201ctroubling.\u201d",
      "\u201cAre you going to protect our resources, or are you going to \u2018drill, baby, drill?\u2019\u201d Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat, asked during Burgum's confirmation hearing this month.",
      "The selection of Burgum, who briefly pursued the presidency in 2023 before endorsing Trump, represents an abrupt pivot from Biden's emphasis on combating climate change. It also signals that Trump intends to follow through on a proposal made last spring when he urged oil and gas CEOs to donate $1 billion to his campaign in exchange for the dismantling of Biden's environmental agenda.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment, and a spokesman for Burgum declined to make him available for an interview.",
      "\u201cGovernor Burgum worked tirelessly to build a prosperous economy in North Dakota,\" spokesman Rob Lockwood said in a statement. \"This economic growth included sustainably developing natural resources. As governor, he met with job creators and leaders who generated opportunities for the people of North Dakota.\u201d",
      "Under the partisan glare of Washington, and faced with stricter federal ethics rules governing conflicts of interest, Burgum has pledged to sell his interest in his family\u2019s lease with the shale oil giant Continental Resources, as well as another one with Hess, a Chevron subsidiary. He has also pledged to sell stock held in a handful of energy companies, some of which he interacted with as governor, which are worth as much as $200,000 according to his 2023 financial disclosures.",
      "There is perhaps no better demonstration of Burgum\u2019s close ties to oil and gas producers than his friendship with Harold Hamm, the founder of Continental Resources who is responsible for much of North Dakota\u2019s fracking boom. The billionaire Oklahoma wildcatter advises Trump on energy policy and is widely viewed as playing a role in helping Burgum secure the nomination to lead Interior.",
      "Hamm did not respond to a request for comment made through his company.",
      "During his 2023 state-of-the-state speech, Burgum likened Hamm to Teddy Roosevelt for his \"grit, resilience, hard work and determination\" that he said \u201cchanged North Dakota and our nation.\u201d The shout-out came after Hamm had donated $50 million toward a library honoring Roosevelt in western North Dakota \u2014 a passion project of Burgum's.",
      "The documents obtained by AP reveal that several months later Hamm gifted Burgum a set of cuff links along with a note thanking Burgum for his \u201cfriendship\" and willingness to take a break from the \u201cgrueling task\u201d of running for president to speak at an energy conference that Hamm had hosted in Oklahoma City.",
      "These were not his only displays of patronage. Though Burgum, an independently wealthy former software company CEO, had a dim chance of winning the Republican presidential primary, Hamm's Continental Resources contributed $250,000 in the summer of 2023 to a super PAC supporting Burgum, campaign finance disclosures show. He also contributed to Burgum's campaign for governor.",
      "Emails between Burgum and Hamm's offices reveal the two communicated often.",
      "In a May 2020 email, Hamm's executive assistant asked if Burgum had time to talk with Hamm and shared a briefing document that railed against wind power, blasting wind turbines as a blight on \u201cour special places and sacred lands\u201d while excoriating tax breaks for wind energy providers as \"unconscionable.\"",
      "\u201cThis does NOTHING to Make America Great Again!\u201d the document states.",
      "Though Burgum set a goal in 2021 to make North Dakota carbon-neutral by 2030, he has adopted Hamm's tone. During his Senate confirmation hearing this month, he was dismissive of renewable energy, such as wind power, suggesting such sources were unreliable when compared to fossil fuels.",
      "In early 2023, as Hamm prepared to publish a memoir, Continental lobbyist Blu Hulsey emailed to ask if Burgum could write a blurb praising the book, the newly obtained records show. Burgum happily complied, heaping praise on the memoir, which the governor called \u201can inspiring story worthy of sharing.\u201d Burgum added that Hamm's impact was \"immeasurable.\u201d",
      "Ethics experts say there are other aspects of their relationship that pose a greater conflict of interest. As governor, Burgum never disclosed that his family leased roughly 200 acres of farmland to Continental for well drilling, as previously reported by CNBC. When Burgum ran for president and faced greater transparency requirements, he revealed making as much as $50,000 in royalties from Continental in 2023.",
      "Despite this relationship, Burgum routinely took action that benefited Hamm's company. As chairman of North Dakota's Industrial Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry, he voted nearly a dozen times or more on measures that had favorable outcomes for Continental, records show.",
      "\u201cNorth Dakota is a leading energy producing state,\" Lockwood, the Burgum spokesman said. \"Tens of thousands of families and mineral owners have similar arrangements. As the publicly available disclosures show: the cited agreement began many years before he became governor.\u201d",
      "Burgum also used the governor's office to support a proposed pipeline that received $250 million in financial backing from Hamm. If completed, it will transport earth-warming CO2 gas that is the byproduct of ethanol fuel production to North Dakota, where it will be stored deep underground. It\u2019s been touted as a way to decarbonize the atmosphere, but has also run into stiff resistance from landowners, who fear their property will be seized to complete the project.",
      "Sarah Vogel, a Democrat and former North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner who previously sat on the commission, said Burgum seemed more like a cheerleader of the industry than a regulator.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he had a regulator\u2019s mindset. He had a promoter\u2019s mindset, which has probably made him beloved in the oil and gas industry,\u201d Vogel said.",
      "Hamm is not the only oil executive or lobbyist who has cultivated ties with Burgum, emails and office schedules show. Ryan Berger, a lobbyist for Occidental Petroleum, emailed Burgum's staff last year seeking a meeting for Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub after Burgum moderated a panel she participated in at an oil industry conference.",
      "\u201cIn an ideal world, a face-to-face over lunch or dinner would be amazing,\u201d Berger wrote in a May 2024 email. He added that Hollub had recently discussed energy issues \u201cdirectly with President Trump\u201d and \u201cwe thought you would benefit from hearing from her\u201d to see \u201cif there are mutually shared policies and perspectives that could be amplified this year.\u201d",
      "Berger declined to comment on the email. Lockwood, the spokesman, declined to say if Burgum had a meeting with Hollub happened.",
      "The records revealed that a Who's Who of oil executives had calls scheduled with Burgum. The include: CEOs of Chevron and Exxon; Marathon Oil officials had an audience with Burgum in 2022; and the governor also spoke before the Hess Corporation's board of directors' dinner. Burgum's family also has an oil lease with Hess that paid him as much as $1,000 in 2023, according to his financial disclosure.",
      "Burgum turned down an invitation to address an American Petroleum Institute convention in Washington, the records show, but agreed to speak at a private dinner for the American Exploration and Production Council in 2023, which drew top executives from Conoco Phillips, Devon Energy, Hilcorp and others.",
      "When Burgum was a leading contender last year to be Trump's vice presidential pick, he co-hosted a banquet at the governor's mansion with the North Dakota Petroleum Council that drew fracking industry heavy hitters, lobbyists and executives. Burgum, Hamm and Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy who is now Trump's pick for energy secretary, addressed attendees as they dined on beef, walleye cakes and bourbon caramel-topped cobbler.",
      "On Inauguration Day, after he had been named by Trump to lead Interior, Burgum declined an invitation to a party at the posh Hay-Adams Hotel that was hosted by Hamm and a number of petroleum trade associations and oil companies.",
      "Burgum\u2019s presence may not have been missed. Many of those executives and lobbyists, who will have business before the Interior Department, have shown they know how to reach him.",

    "summary": "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is planning to unveil proposals to put limits on lawsuits",
    "story": [
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is planning to unveil proposals to put limits on lawsuits",
      "ATLANTA -- The pitch from Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is simple: Putting limits on lawsuits will halt rising insurance costs.",
      "The reality, though, is more complicated.",
      "Changes could reduce liability insurance costs for businesses and commercial property owners. The evidence is mixed on whether it would drive large premium reductions for car and other types of insurance. And some researchers say efforts limiting lawsuits, often called tort reform, fattens insurers' profits more than it cuts the price of policies.",
      "\u201cThe net impact is that it really improves insurer profitability,\u201d said Tyler Leverty, a business professor who studies risk and insurance at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",
      "When Kemp unveils his proposals Thursday, the Republican governor is likely to keep leaning on his argument that everyone's insurance rates are increasing because unfair lawsuits are on the rise and juries are awarding excessive damages.",
      "The issue is Kemp\u2019s top priority this year after promising the Georgia Chamber of Commerce he would take action and instead pushed a law to have Georgia Insurance Commissioner John King gather data in 2024.",
      "King said that lawsuits are driving insurance companies to reduce coverage for retail businesses, apartment owners, drivers and others. He said business owners in areas that insurers label as high crime are among those struggling the most. Companies that offer low-income housing have also complained.",
      "\u201cGo down to southeast Atlanta and talk to the small convenience owners having to close because they can\u2019t find insurance,\u201d King said.",
      "Some say there's no evidence that a nationwide litigation crisis is driving high insurance rates.",
      "\u201cI went in search of the data, and I have not found it,\u201d said Kenneth Klein, a law professor at California Western School of Law. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say it isn\u2019t happening. It\u2019s to say we cannot document it.\u201d",
      "But Mike Iverson of Oakbridge Insurance and former president of the Independent Insurance Agents Association said insurance companies like predictability when determining rates and how to spread out losses.",
      "In a well-known case, a jury awarded a man almost $43 million after a shooting in a CVS parking lot in Atlanta, arguing the company should have strengthened security. In another case, a Jonesboro mobile home park was ordered to pay $31 million to the daughter of a man who was shot and killed there.",
      "Opponents note that few verdicts are that large and insurance companies are still profitable. They want lawmakers to demand more transparency on how they set rates.",
      "\u201cWhenever they want an excuse to raise rates or limit coverage they will always point to a verdict here and there and make all kinds of claims about how it\u2019s affecting their bottom line,\u201d said Joanne Doroshow, executive director of the Center for Justice & Democracy at New York Law School.",
      "Studying how tort reform impacts premiums in other states is difficult because other factors are in play and there are different combinations of reform. Some saw benefits, but the research varies.",
      "Other factors that influence insurance rates include inflation, extreme weather, and the costs of labor and materials. It is normal for insurance markets to cycle through tough years where less coverage is offered as rates rise.",
      "In many lines of coverage, including those not heavily impacted by lawsuits, insurers in 2022 were less profitable in Georgia than in several other states, according to data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. A spokesperson said over a longer period, though, nothing is abnormal about Georgia's fluctuations.",
      "King\u2019s report, using mostly auto insurance data, says the number of claims and the size of resulting payments have risen over the years, especially those involving lawsuits. Some numbers dropped in 2022 and 2023, but he said that was because the data is incomplete.",
      "King also found that a greater percentage of legal claims are resulting in payments that hit the maximum dollar amount a policy covers.",
      "The Georgia Trial Lawyers Association, which lobbies against tort reform, disputes King's conclusions.",
      "Risk consultant David Stegall said the number of claims is in line with Georgia\u2019s high number of car accidents. Both claims and payouts have mostly been stable or falling, especially when adjusted for population growth and inflation, he said.",
      "He also found that while Georgia residents pay between 11% and 68% more for car insurance than residents of other states, they are more than 200% more likely to be in an accident.",
      "Adam Willis, president of trucking firm F&W Transportation, said his company\u2019s premiums have doubled over the last 10 years while fewer insurers offer full coverage. His company also has been sued more often, he said.",
      "Defenders of the current system say the trade-offs of lawsuit limits are a bad deal.",
      "\u201cThe governor says that limiting your right as a consumer will lower your insurance costs, but that is not only a bad idea for everyday citizens, it\u2019s just not correct,\u201d said state Rep. Tanya Miller, an Atlanta Democrat.",

      "An upstate New York food bank was offered more than 40,000 pounds of coho salmon \u2014 a bountiful feast",
      "AUBURN, N.Y. -- A New York food bank was offered a huge donation of fresh fish this month \u2014 but it came with a catch.",
      "LocalCoho, a soon-to-close salmon farm in the small upstate city of Auburn, wanted to give 40,000 pounds (18,100 kilograms) of coho salmon to the Food Bank of Central New York, a mother lode of high-quality protein that could feed thousands of families.",
      "But the fish were still alive and swimming in the farm\u2019s giant indoor tanks. The organizations would need to figure out how to get some 13,000 salmon from the water and then have them processed into frozen fillets for distribution to regional food pantries.",
      "And they\u2019d need to do it fast, before the business closed for good. LocalCoho is ceasing operations this Friday.",
      "Thanks to dozens of food pantry volunteers willing to help staffers scoop up the salmon, the team was able to empty the tanks in a matter of weeks and cold pack tons of fish for shipment to a processor.",
      "\u201cThe fact that we only had weeks to execute this really ratcheted up the intensity and the anxiety a little bit,\u201d said Brian McManus, the food bank\u2019s chief operations officer. \u201cI knew that we had the will. I knew we had the expertise.\u201d",
      "Tackling food waste has been a daunting challenge for years both in the U.S. and around the world. More than one-third of the food produced in the U.S. is never eaten and much of it ends up in landfills.",
      "On a recent day, workers waded through knee-deep water teeming with salmon to fill their nets. Christina Hudson Kohler was among the volunteers who donned waterproof overalls and gloves to grab the fish-laden nets and empty their contents into cold storage containers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit different,\u201d Kohler said during a break. \u201cIn the past, my volunteer work with the food bank has been sorting carrots or peppers, or gleaning out in the field.\u201d",
      "LocalCoho is a startup that had been piloting a sustainable salmon farming system employing recirculated water. Its facility west of Syracuse had been supplying coho salmon to wholesalers and retailers, including high-end Manhattan sushi restaurants, with the goal of building regional farms across the country.",
      "But company officials said they could not raise enough capital to expand and become profitable. Thus, they decided to wrap things up at the end of January.",
      "With a shutdown looming, farm manager Adam Kramarsyck said they didn\u2019t want the fish to go to waste or end up as biofuel. That's when they reached out to see if the fish could be donated as food.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018lemonade out of lemons,\u2019 I guess is the phrase,\u201d Kramarsyck said.",
      "LocalCoho can process about 600 fish a week by hand. But there was less than a month to clear the tanks of many times that number of fish.",
      "Enter the food bank.",
      "McManus was excited by the offer to land so many fish \u2014 and nervous about the challenge. But while the Syracuse-based operation knew how to distribute canned or frozen seafood, they\u2019re not set up to handle fresh fish. How could they turn thousands of fish into frozen fillets in a tight time frame?",
      "Kramarsyck said it took \u201ctons and tons of logistics.\u201d",
      "The food bank enlisted 42 volunteers to help out. A local business with refrigerated trucks, Brown Carbonic, offered to ship the fish for free to a processor an hour away in Rochester. And LocalCoho staff pitched in to get the job done in time.",
      "\u201cA lot of companies going out of business would just be like, \u2018Take what you can get, we\u2019ll do the best we can.\u2019 I mean, they\u2019re working extra hard,\u201d said Andrew Katzer, the food bank\u2019s director of procurement.",
      "The salmon was being processed and quick-frozen. It will be distributed soon among 243 food pantries, as well as soup kitchens, shelters and other institutions in the food bank\u2019s network.",
      "All told, the catch is expected to yield more than 26,000 servings of hard-to-source protein for the hungry.",
      "\u201cProtein, animal protein is very, very desirable. We know that people need it for nourishment and it\u2019s difficult to get. And so this is going to make a very large impact,\" said McManus.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t anticipate this being here very long,'' he added. \"We\u2019ve had salmon before, but not like this.\u201d"

    "summary": "Utah leaders, locals and longtime attendees of the Sundance Film Festival are making their final push to keep the world-renowned independent film festival in the state as its directors consider uprooting it",
    "story": [
      "Utah leaders, locals and longtime attendees of the Sundance Film Festival are making their final push to keep the world-renowned independent film festival in the state as its directors consider uprooting it",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- With the 2025 Sundance Film Festival underway, Utah leaders, locals and longtime attendees are making a final push \u2014 that could include paying millions of dollars \u2014 to keep the world-renowned film festival as its directors consider uprooting.",
      "Thousands of festivalgoers affixed bright yellow stickers to their winter coats that read \u201cKeep Sundance in Utah\" in a last-ditch effort to convince festival leadership and state officials to keep it in Park City, its home of 41 years.",
      "Gov. Spencer Cox said previously that Utah would not throw as much money at the festival as other states hoping to lure it away. Now his office is urging the Legislature to carve out $3 million for Sundance in the state budget, weeks before the independent film festival is expected to pick a home for the next decade.",
      "It could retain a small presence in picturesque Park City and center itself in nearby Salt Lake City, or move to another finalist \u2014 Cincinnati, Ohio, or Boulder, Colorado \u2014 beginning in 2027.",
      "\u201cSundance is Utah, and Utah is Sundance. You can\u2019t really separate those two,\" Cox said. \u201cThis is your home, and we desperately hope it will be your home forever.\"",
      "Festival Director Eugene Hernandez told reporters last week that they had not made a final decision. An announcement is expected this year by early spring.",
      "Colorado is trying to further sweeten its offer. The state is considering legislation giving up to $34 million in tax incentives to film festivals like Sundance through 2036 \u2014 on top of the $1.5 million in funds already approved to lure the Utah festival to its neighboring state.",
      "Cincinnati approved a resolution allocating $2.5 million to Sundance if festival leaders relocate to southwest Ohio. Yet money may not be the ultimate draw.",
      "Sundance leaders say the festival has outgrown the ski town it helped put on the map decades ago, and they worry it has developed an air of exclusivity that takes the focus away from the films. An ideal home would make Sundance more centralized, affordable and accessible to all who appreciate independent film.",
      "Some festivalgoers and industry leaders worry Sundance would lose its identity outside its idyllic mountain hometown.",
      "Roger and Carin Ehrenberg, major donors to the festival, said they would stop attending regularly if the festival was outside Utah. Sundance is a \u201cmagical experience\u201d for the New York City philanthropists, they said, due in large part to the atmosphere in Park City.",
      "\u201cIf it goes to Cincinnati, maybe once in a blue moon we would go, but it wouldn't be a regular thing,\" Carin Ehrenberg said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019ll lose its appeal.\u201d",
      "The couple said they would likely continue to donate even if they did not attend.",
      "Nineteen years of fond memories at Sundance helped inspire Dr. Rhonda Taubin to relocate her family from Atlanta to Heber City \u2014 Park City's neighboring town. She has no ties to the film industry but has become a fervent advocate for keeping the festival in her new home state.",
      "This year, she and her friends distributed thousands of \u201cKeep Sundance in Utah\u201d stickers \u2014 and another that read \u201cNOhio for Sundance\u201d \u2014 to show the festival how much it means to the local community.",
      "\u201cI really am not a movie buff, but my other girlfriends are, and being able to share all that we've been through as women, as mothers, as wives, as daughters, I don't want it to end,\u201d Taubin said. \u201cWe watch provocative movies that make us talk and think about things that maybe we've never thought about before. Utah would be at a huge loss without those conversations.\u201d",
      "If Sundance stays in Utah, the festival\u2019s former director John Cooper said major adjustments are needed to improve transportation between Salt Lake City and Park City and make lodging for filmmakers more affordable.",
      "Cooper, who led the festival from 2009 to 2020, said he would be sad to see Sundance shift away from actor and filmmaker Robert Redford's original vision. Its very name comes from Redford's character in the 1969 film \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like my role was to be a keeper of the flame for Robert Redford and his legacy,\" Cooper told The Associated Press. \u201cThe mountains of Utah, this was his vision. It\u2019s weird to say \u2018Sundance in Ohio.\u2019 But I think it could go anywhere. What it does for a community is so strong.\u201d",
      "On the red carpet this week, many were split on whether Sundance should stay or go.",
      "Actor Elijah Wood urged the festival to remain in Park City, saying the location is part of its DNA.",
      "Others were open to it relocating. Actor Tessa Thompson, who serves on the Sundance Institute's board of trustees, said the festival could maintain its identity in a new city.",
      "\u201cI think that Sundance has more to do with the spirit and community, and I think that's evergreen,\" Thompson said. \"Regardless of where Sundance is, Sundance will always be.\u201d"

      "Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver A",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- A.J. Brown lingered with some of his Eagles teammates outside the Los Angeles Lakers' locker room like any fan who had even a hint of a chance to hug it out with LeBron James.",
      "Sure enough, James spotted Brown, Darius Slay and other Eagles players, threw his arm as thick as a log around Brown\u2019s shoulder and posed for photos with the NFC champions. James knows a thing or two \u2014 four, actually \u2014 about winning championships, and the good fortune of truly rubbing shoulders with the NBA's scoring king was one the star Eagles receiver could not pass up.",
      "\u201cHe's one of my favorite players,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI didn't grow up watching Michael Jordan. I grew up watching LeBron.\u201d",
      "Brown even ripped a page out of James' championship playbook this season when he was caught reading a book on the bench. James flipped through \u201cThe Alchemist\u201d by Paulo Coelho during a shootaround in the 2018 NBA Eastern Conference Finals while Brown passed time during a game with \u201c Inner Excellence \u201d by self-help author Jim Murphy.",
      "Brown, who studied journalism while in college at Mississippi, knows the ultimate headline in bold letters above the fold still awaits the Eagles: Super Bowl champions.",
      "Brown and the Eagles were oh so close to hoisting the Lombardi Trophy when they lost 38-35 to the Kansas City Chiefs two years ago. Here the teams are again, ready for a rematch next weekend in New Orleans, with the Eagles still haunted by the memory of how they let their chance at winning the franchise's second Super Bowl championship slip away in the final minutes.",
      "A play here, a play there and the Eagles could have been Super Bowl champions. Instead, most Eagles players tense up and recoil at any questions \u2014 quarterback Jalen Hurts replied \u201cnext question\u201d when asked his most vivid memory of the Super Bowl \u2014 about that game and Brown recounted a missed opportunity for him to score a touchdown that could have swayed the outcome.",
      "\u201cThe play really kept me up thinking about, how did I miss that and what I got confused on,\u201d Brown said.",
      "The play?",
      "\u201cI don't want to get into it because we may run it back,\u201d he said.",
      "Time for the Chiefs to fire up the game film.",
      "Brown otherwise did his part that February night in Arizona, with six catches for 96 yards and a touchdown against the Chiefs. Those kind of numbers are the norm for Brown. Playing through injuries that cost him four games and an often staid passing attack, Brown still finished with 67 catches and a team-high 1,079 yards this season, the third straight year he's topped 1,000 yards receiving with the Eagles and fifth time overall in six NFL seasons.",
      "\u201cA.J. is the best receiver that this city has ever seen,\u201d coach Nick Sirianni said.",
      "Brown was rewarded last April with a three-year contract extension that included $84 million in guaranteed money. He was set to become the highest-paid wide receiver in the NFL at $32 million a season \u2014 until Minnesota's Justin Jefferson topped him later that summer \u2014 and he could earn as much as $96 million over the life of the extension.",
      "He's paid like an elite receiver.",
      "In the Super Bowl, Brown said, he felt like nothing but a \u201cpaid actor.\u201d",
      "Brown said if he had his way, the Eagles would arrive Friday in New Orleans, hold a walkthrough on Saturday and play the game Sunday. His Super Bowl experience was like something out of a movie where he played the role of football player rather than acting like he would in a regular-season lead-up to a game. He has tried to steel his emotions amid this year's Super Bowl hype.",
      "\u201cIt's about us, but it's not about us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have so much we have to do for everyone else. The media, the fans. There\u2019s only so little time that we get to focus on what\u2019s important and that\u2019s the game.\u201d",
      "The Eagles have a decided edge over the Chiefs among receivers, with Brown the head of the pack.",
      "DeVonta Smith, who topped 1,000 yards receiving the previous two seasons, also missed four games but led the Eagles with 68 catches and had 833 yards receiving. Tight end Dallas Goedert \u2014 who threw three stiff-arms in a playoff touchdown against Green Bay \u2014 and even 2,000-yard rusher Saquon Barkley are regular threats to catch the ball.",
      "\u201cThey take pride in the way they catch the ball. They take pride in the way they run routes,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cThey take pride in the way they change games with the ball in their hands. And they take pride in the way they block and help their teammates succeed.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs boast tight end Travis Kelce \u2014 who has lost a step but still had 97 regular-season catches \u2014 but top wide receivers DeAndre Hopkins and Juju Smith-Schuster were each held without a catch in a playoff win against Houston.",
      "Brown said he's been turning down media requests \u201cleft and right\u201d because when it comes to Super Bowl hype, \u201cnone of this stuff matters.\u201d",
      "All he cares about is winning that championship ring \u2014 just like LeBron.",

      "President Donald Trump is meeting Friday with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whose company designs and supplies the advanced computer chips that play an integral role in developing artificial intelligence.",
      "The meeting at the White House was confirmed by a person familiar who insisted on anonymity to discuss the conversation between Huang and Trump. The person said the meeting was set up weeks ago and would enable them to get acquainted and talk about AI policy. Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, Calif., declined to comment on the meeting.",
      "Nvidia had loudly protested a last-minute move by the Biden administration in January to expand AI chip restrictions beyond adversaries like China to more than 100 other countries, including Singapore. But it remains to be seen if Trump will follow through with or drop those proposed rules.",
      "Trump signed an order on his first day in office last week that said his administration would \u201cidentify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls,\u201d signaling that he might continue and harden Biden\u2019s approach.",
      "The Republican president is banking on AI to foster economic growth and draw hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, but he also saw the performance of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI technology as a sign that the technology can be developed more cheaply.",
      "Speaking Monday to House Republicans in Miami, Trump called the DeepSeek news \u201cpositive\u201d if it\u2019s accurate because \u201cyou won\u2019t be spending as much and you\u2019ll get the same result.\u201d",
      "Trump said it was a \u201cwake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek has said its recent models were built with Nvidia\u2019s lower-performing H800 chips, which are not banned in China. DeepSeek began attracting more attention in the AI industry last month when it released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and was more cost-effective in its use of expensive Nvidia chips to train the system on troves of data. The chatbot became more widely accessible when it appeared on Apple and Google app stores early this year.",
      "The meeting between Trump and Huang comes as leaders of a special House committee focused on countering China have urged Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, to consider the potential national security benefits of placing export controls on Nvidia semiconductor chips used by DeepSeek. They said the examination should be part of a review that Trump ordered on his first day in office that called on the secretaries of State and Commerce to review the U.S. export control system.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said DeepSeek made extensive use of a Nvidia chip designed specifically to fall outside U.S. export controls. The lawmakers said that the committee supports American AI innovation, and that support \u201cincludes imposing reasonable safeguards\u201d to protect those innovations from China.",
      "\u201cThis demonstrates what the Select Committee has long argued: frequently updating export controls is imperative to ensure (China) will not exploit regulatory gaps and loopholes to advance their AI ambitions,\u201d the two lawmakers wrote in letter dated Wednesday.",
      "The pair asked that Waltz look for ways to strengthen controls on shipments through third countries \u201cthat pose a high risk of diversion.\u201d Singapore, the letter said, represented 22% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue in its most recently quarterly statement, \u201cdespite the company itself revealing most of these shipments ultimately went to users outside of Singapore.\u201d",
      "Countries such as Singapore, they added, should be subject to strict licensing requirements if they aren't willing to \u201ccrack down\u201d on China using their country as an intermediary for shipments.",
      "In an emailed statement, Nvidia said that its revenue associated with Singapore \"does not indicate diversion to China.\"",
      "\u201cOur public filings report \u2018bill to\u2019 not \u2018ship to\u2019 locations of our customers,\u201d a Nvidia spokesperson said. \u201cMany of our customers have business entities in Singapore and use those entities for products destined for the U.S. and the west. We insist that our partners comply with all applicable laws, and if we receive any information to the contrary, act accordingly.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world\u2019s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rat infestation in many world cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington, and a new study blames climate change, urbanization and other human actions.",
      "A first-of-its-kind examination of trends and reasons in hard-to-count rat populations uses rat sighting reports in 16 cities around the world. In 11 of those cities, rat complaints have increased, according to a study in Friday's journal Science Advances.",
      "Based on individual trends within cities, Washington was by far the leader in rat increases, followed by San Francisco, Toronto, New York City and Amsterdam. Washington's rising rat reporting trend was three times greater than Boston's and 50% more than New York's, the study said. Washington city officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Only three cities saw significant decreasing trends \u2014 New Orleans, Louisville and Tokyo \u2014 with the home of Mardi Gras showing the biggest drop in rat reporting. Experts said the Louisiana city can teach others how to combat the rat problem.",
      "Researchers did a statistical analysis of the rising rat reporting in those cities and concluded that slightly more than 40% of the trend seen is due to warming temperatures from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. And that comes down to sex and food, said study lead author Jonathan Richardson, a biologist at the University of Richmond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these increasing trends in rats in cities that are warming the fastest, probably because this is a small mammal that has physiological challenges in the cold weather months,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIf we're warming the climate and winter starts a week or two later and spring arrives a week or two earlier, that's one, two, maybe even three or four weeks across the entire year where those rats can be above ground foraging, acquiring more food and maybe squeezing out one or two more reproductive cycles. \u201d",
      "An extra month may not sound like much, but female rats can have a litter every month. Each litter is eight to 16 baby rats, Richardson said: \u201cThat is a recipe for accelerated population growth.\u201d",
      "Researchers pointed to two other big statistical links \u2014 that fit with known biological issues \u2014 behind more rat reports: the increase in urbanization and more densely populated cities.",
      "Rats like the built-up environment and being near people and their waste, the study and outside scientists said. They essentially eat at the same table as humans, multiple experts said.",
      "\u201cThe rat is the third most successful mammal behind humans and house mice. So it evolved and engineered to live alongside us,\u201d New York City rat czar Kathleen Corradi said during a break at a New Orleans conference on improving pest management. \u201cThey followed humans, Homo sapiens, across the continents and are in every single continent except Antarctica. So it's considered a wicked problem.\u201d",
      "Even though rats are intelligent and highly adaptive, Richardson and other experts said they are a serious problem for people.",
      "\u201cWhen rodent populations are high, people get sick, motor vehicles become disabled, mental health declines, fires are started and foods fouled,\u201d said Houston rat expert Michael Parsons, who wasn't part of the study. People are rightly bothered by rats because of \u201can innate fear caused by an organism that can make us sick.\u201d",
      "Researchers have not had good figures on rats. Because of the way they live and hide, they are not as easily counted as other critters, so this is one of the first attempts to quantify them. The study is not really a count of rats, but of complaints by people.",
      "Because the statistics go back years and only cities that haven't changed their reporting methods were looked at, Richardson said the trends they spotted have scientific merit. Even though Washington has the highest increasing trend that doesn't mean it has more rats or even rat sightings, it is just that the numbers within the city are increasing fastest, he said.",
      "Several outside experts said the study is legitimate, sensible and was sorely needed.",
      "\u201cThis paper is by far the largest data-driven effort to understand changes in urban rat populations ever attempted,\u201d said Drexel University ecology professor Jason Munshi-South, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Looking at the few cities where rat reports are down may help in the fight against rats, Richardson and Corradi said. The answer is not more poison or traps, but prevention, the study said.",
      "\u201cIn New Orleans they make a big effort to get out into neighborhoods and do educational workshops and campaigns to talk to residents about what makes a property less likely to have rats,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "New York City's recently stepped up rat-fighting, which includes replacing garbage in bags on the street with rat-resistant containers, hasn't quite shown up in Richardson's data yet, but rat czar Corradi said early results are encouraging. The city has signed people up for what it calls an elite squad of rat fighters, named \" NYC rat pack.\u201d",
      "It's an uphill battle.",
      "\u201cAs our cities warm, urbanize and (increase in) density, we create more resources for rats which could result in further increases in numbers,\u201d Simon Fraser University health and rat scientist Kaylee Byers said in an email.",
      "We can fight them better, but in the end people \u201cneed to coexist with wildlife in urban environments, even with rats,\u201d University of Michigan conservation scientist Neil Carter said.",
      "\u201cZero rats is impossible,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut I think an expectation that we need to live with the number of rats that we're seeing in many of these cities is also an unhealthy perspective on this problem.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The unsolved death of a teenager in 1977 haunted students and staff at Honolulu's McKinley High School for nearly half a century",
      "HONOLULU -- Former Hawaii lawmaker Suzanne Chun Oakland remembers arriving at school one morning in 1977 to an eerie buzz.",
      "The 15-year-old had met up with girlfriends as usual before class at Honolulu's McKinley High School when she learned a student named Dawn Momohara had been found dead on the second floor of a school building.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how we got word of it, but everything spread really quickly,\u201d Chun Oakland said.",
      "Chun Oakland didn't know Momohara, who was 16, but the unsolved death has haunted her and other McKinley students and staff for nearly half a century. That was until last week, when police used advances in DNA technology to arrest a 66-year-old resident of a Utah nursing home.",
      "The suspect, former McKinley student Gideon Castro, was scheduled to make an initial court appearance Friday before a judge in Salt Lake County District Court. He remained in custody Thursday with the bond for his release set at $250,000, according to Salt Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office records.",
      "Castro\u2019s attorney, Marlene Mohn, did not respond to email and phone messages seeking comment.",
      "Momohara had been sexually assaulted and strangled, police said.",
      "\u201cI was just really sad,\" Chun Oakland recalled earlier this week. \"I think for our student body, of course there\u2019s that concern that what if he\u2019s still out there and he does it to somebody else.\u201d",
      "On March 21, 1977, shortly after 7:30 a.m., Honolulu police found Momohara lying on her back, partially clothed, an orange cloth wrapped tightly around her neck.",
      "Details from more than four decades ago are fuzzy for 1967 McKinley graduate Grant Okamura, who was the school\u2019s 28-year-old band teacher in 1977, but the morning Momohara was found has remained a core memory.",
      "Momohara's sister \u2014 one of his flute players \u2014 arrived at school that day not knowing her sister had been found dead, he recalled. The sister was called to the office and later walked into the band room, devastated.",
      "\u201cThe other students were trying to console her,\" Okamura said. \"At that point, I couldn't have band. How do you have a class? She just sat there crying.\u201d",
      "She didn't return to school for weeks afterward.",
      "He doesn't remember the sister's name. The Associated Press was unable to make contact with any possible relatives. Okamura said he met Momohara a few times when he let her into the air-conditioned band room to wait for her sister.",
      "The morning before Momohara was killed, she got a call from an unknown male and told her mother she was going to a nearby shopping center with friends. That was the last time her mother saw her, homicide Lt. Deena Thoemmes said.",
      "Police released sketches of a person of interest and a possible vehicle described by witnesses as a 1974 or 1975 Pontiac Lemans. A witness reported seeing the car when he and his girlfriend drove through campus the night before Momohara died. The witness saw a man and the car on the grass near the school's English building, Thoemmes said.",
      "The witness circled back around but the car and the man were gone.",
      "Police were unable to identify a suspect and the case grew cold, though grief lingered over the campus.",
      "In 2019, cold case detectives asked a forensic biology unit to examine several items of evidence from the scene, including Momohara's underwear. They were able to develop a DNA profile in 2020. Then, in 2023, police received information about potential suspects, two brothers who were interviewed in 1977.",
      "Several days after Momohara was killed, detectives interviewed Castro, who graduated from McKinley High in 1976. He said he met Momohara at a school dance that year and last saw her at a carnival on campus in February 1977. Police interviewed his brother, who also met Momohara at the dance.",
      "In November 2023, Honolulu police went to Chicago, where the brother was living. They \u201csurreptitiously\u201d obtained DNA from one of the brother's adult children, Thoemmes said.",
      "Lab findings excluded the brother as a suspect, but a DNA sample from Castro's adult son, and later from Castro himself, proved he was responsible, Thoemmes said.",
      "He was arrested last week at the nursing home where he lived in Millcreek, just south of Salt Lake City, on suspicion of second-degree murder.",
      "Neither Okamura nor Chun Oakland remembered Castro.",
      "Chun Oakland graduated in 1979 and grew up to become a Democratic member of the Hawaii Senate. She said Momohara's killing bothered her over the years, especially when she would meet victims through her work as a lawmaker or as a board member of the nonprofit Sex Abuse Treatment Center, a statewide program provding services for sexual assault survivors.",
      "Chun Oakland said she is grateful an arrest was possible even after all these years.",
      "\u201cI think the community in general, and our elected officials, they know the importance of trying to preserve the evidence that can someday be able to see justice for that individual or individuals,\" she said.",

      "Apple on Thursday disclosed its iPhone sales dipped slightly during the holiday-season quarter, signaling a sluggish start to the trendsetting company\u2019s effort to catch up to the rest of Big Tech in the race to bring artificial intelligence to the masses",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple on Thursday disclosed its iPhone sales dipped slightly during the holiday-season quarter, signaling a sluggish start to the trendsetting company\u2019s effort to catch up to the rest of Big Tech in the race to bring artificial intelligence to the masses.",
      "The iPhone\u2019s roughly 1% drop in revenue from the previous year\u2019s October-December period wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected, given the first software update enabling the device\u2019s AI features didn\u2019t arrive until just before Halloween, and the technology still isn\u2019t available in many markets outside the U.S.",
      "The countries still awaiting Apple\u2019s AI suite include China, a key market where the company continued to lose ground.",
      "Apple also was only able to eke out a modest revenue gain across its entire business, although the results came in ahead of the analyst projections that guide investors. The Cupertino, California, company earned $36.3 billion, or $2.40 per share, a 7% increase from the previous year. Revenue edged up from the previous year by 4% to $124.3 billion.",
      "Those numbers included iPhone revenue of $69.1 billion. In China, Apple\u2019s total revenue registered $18.5 billion, an 11% decrease from the previous year.",
      "Part of that erosion in China reflected the iPhone\u2019s shrinking market share in that country, where homegrown companies have been making more headway. Apple\u2019s iPhone year-over year shipments in China declined nearly 10% in the most recent quarter, while native companies Huawei and Xiaomi posted year-over-year increase of more than 20%, according to the research firm International Data Corp.",
      "The holiday-season results served to confirm bringing AI to the iPhone and Apple\u2019s other products may not boost the company\u2019s recently lackluster growth as much as investors initially thought it might after CEO Tim Cook unveiled the technology before a rapt crowd last June.",
      "The anticipation that an AI-infused iPhone would prod hordes of consumers to ditch their current devices and splurge on an upgrade is the main reason Apple\u2019s stock price surged by 30% last year. But the sinking realization that an uptick in demand may take longer than expected has caused Apple\u2019s shares to backtrack by 5% during the first month of the new year. The stock slipped slightly in extended trading after the numbers came out.",
      "The concerns hovering around Apple's weakening iPhone sales come against broader worries about whether AI will be as lucrative for U.S. tech companies as once envisioned after Chinese startup DeepSeek released a version of the technology that was built at a far lower cost than had been previously thought possible.",
      "Unlike tech peers such as Microsoft, Google corporate parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook corporate parent Meta Platforms, Apple hasn\u2019t been investing as heavily in AI \u2013 one of the reasons it has been an industry laggard. But that restraint could work to its advantage if DeepSeek\u2019s early breakthroughs in driving down AI costs gains momentum.",
      "Apple\u2019s services division remained the company\u2019s biggest moneymaker outside the iPhone, with revenue of $26.3 billion in the past quarter, a 14% increase from the previous year. Although the services division has been thriving for years, it generates more than $20 billion annually by locking in Google as the automatic search engine on the iPhone and other products. That deal is now under threat of being banned as part of the proposed punishment for Google\u2019s search engine being declared an illegal monopoly."

    "story": [
      "U.S. government regulators sued to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s $14 billion acquisition of rival Juniper Networks on Thursday, saying the combination would eliminate competition, raise prices and reduce innovation",
      "The Justice Department sued to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise's $14 billion acquisition of rival Juniper Networks on Thursday, the first attempt to stop a merger by a new Trump administration that is expected to take a softer approach to mergers.",
      "The Justice complaint alleges that Hewlett Packer Enterprise, under increased competitive pressure from the fast-rising Juniper, was forced to discount products and services and invest more in its own innovation, eventually leading the company to simply buy its rival.",
      "The lawsuit said that the combination of businesses would eliminate competition, raise prices and reduce innovation.",
      "HPE and Juniper issued a joint statement Thursday, saying the companies strongly oppose the DOJ's decision.",
      "\u201cWe will vigorously defend against the Department of Justice\u2019s overreaching interpretation of antitrust laws and will demonstrate how this transaction will provide customers with greater innovation and choice, positively change the dynamics in the networking market,\u201d the companies said.",
      "The combined company would create more competition, not less, the companies said.",
      "The Justice Department's intervention \u2014 the first of the new administration and just 10 days after Donald Trump's inauguration \u2014 comes as somewhat of a surprise. Most predicted a second Trump administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to mergers and deal-making after years of hypervigilance under former President Joe Biden\u2019s watch.",
      "Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced one year ago that it was buying Juniper Networks for $40 a share in a deal expected to double HPE\u2019s networking business.",
      "In its complaint, the government painted a picture of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a company desperate to keep up with a smaller rival that was taking its business.",
      "HPE salespeople were concerned about the \u201cJuniper threat,\u201d the complaint said, also alleging that one former executive told his team that \u201cthere are no rules in a street fight,\u201d encouraging them to \u201ckill\u201d Juniper when competing for sales opportunities.",
      "The Justice Department said that Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Juniper are the U.S.'s second- and third-largest providers of wireless local area network (WLAN) products and services for businesses.",
      "\u201cThe proposed transaction between HPE and Juniper, if allowed to proceed, would further consolidate an already highly concentrated market \u2014 and leave U.S. enterprises facing two companies commanding over 70% of the market,\u201d the complaint said, adding that Cisco Systems was the industry leader.",
      "Many businesses and investors accused Biden regulatory agencies of antitrust overreach and were looking forward to a friendlier Trump administration.",
      "Under Biden, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block a $24.6 billion merger between Kroger and Albertsons that would have been the largest grocery store merger in U.S. history. Two judges agreed with the FTC\u2019s case, blocking the proposed deal in December.",
      "In 2023, the Department of Justice, through the courts, forced American and JetBlue airlines to abandon their partnership in the northeast U.S., saying it would reduce competition and eventually cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars a year. That partnership had the blessing of the Trump administration when it took effect in early 2021.",
      "U.S. regulators also proposed last year to break up Google for maintaining an \u201cabusive monopoly\u201d through its market-dominate search engine, Chrome. Court hearings on Google\u2019s punishment are scheduled to begin in April, with the judge aiming to issue a final decision before Labor Day. It\u2019s unclear where the Trump administration stands on the case.",
      "One merger that both Trump and Biden agreed shouldn\u2019t go through is Nippon Steel\u2019s proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel. Biden blocked the nearly $15 billion acquisition just before his term ended. The companies challenged that decision in a federal lawsuit early this year.",
      "Trump has consistently voiced opposition to the deal, questioning why U.S. Steel would sell itself to a foreign company given the regime of new tariffs he has vowed."

    "story": [
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro says he wants to fast-track the construction of power plants in Pennsylvania and offer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects that produce electricity and use hydrogen",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Gov. Josh Shapiro said Thursday that he wants to fast-track the construction of big power plants in Pennsylvania and offer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects that provide electricity to the grid and use hydrogen.",
      "Shapiro's announcement comes a few days before he delivers his third budget proposal to lawmakers amid an energy crunch that threatens to raise electricity bills across Pennsylvania, the nation's second-biggest natural gas-producing state.",
      "Shapiro, a Democrat, said he wants to start the \u201cnext chapter in Pennsylvania\u2019s long story of energy leadership\u201d and keep pace with other states that are attracting big projects, such as data centers and electric vehicle factories.",
      "\"Pennsylvania, it\u2019s time for us to be more competitive. It\u2019s time for us to act. We need to take some big and decisive steps right now, build new sources of power so Pennsylvania doesn't miss out,\u201d Shapiro said at a news conference at Pittsburgh International Airport.",
      "Shapiro said Pennsylvania is one of just 12 states that doesn't have an entity to fast-track siting decisions for energy projects. He wants to change that by creating the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition Board to streamline permitting and support for new energy projects.",
      "\"We need shovels in the ground now, not in the years to come,\" Shapiro said.",
      "The tax credits Shapiro is proposing are aimed at large projects producing electricity, using hydrogen and making hydrogen-based aviation fuel.",
      "A new power plant could qualify for up to $100 million per year for three years based on the amount of power the facility can produce, under Shapiro's plan.",
      "The Shapiro administration said it would leave it to lawmakers to hammer out what sort of power plants would qualify for a tax credit, although they said it wouldn't include the proposed restart of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to feed data centers run by tech giant Microsoft.",
      "At the federal level, former President Joe Biden's administration enacted rules last year as a centerpiece of his efforts to fight climate change by requiring coal and newer, higher-usage gas plants to slash their carbon dioxide emissions by 90% to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases from a major source.",
      "For the other tax credits, a user of hydrogen fuel could qualify for up to $49 million a year and an aviation fuel producer could qualify for up to $15 million a year, under Shapiro's plan. The hydrogen-related tax credits are an attempt to create demand for the two federally subsidized hydrogen-making projects in which Pennsylvania or some of its businesses and institutions play a role, another part of Biden\u2019s agenda to slow climate change.",
      "The plans would require approval from lawmakers. Republican lawmakers have been critical of Shapiro\u2019s energy policy, saying it is a major hurdle for Pennsylvania to attract companies that want to build big new natural gas-fired power plants and stabilize the power grid.",
      "Shapiro's plans elicited applause from renewable energy advocates, while business groups echoed Republican criticism, but said they were encouraged by Shapiro's focus on energy.",
      "Shapiro's plan unveiled last year to make power plant owners in the nation\u2019s third-biggest energy-producing state pay for their greenhouse gas emissions and require utilities to buy more electricity from renewable sources gained no traction in the Legislature.",
      "One project Shapiro said he wants to help is a proposal by natural gas producer CNX Resources to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh\u2019s airport to make hydrogen-based fuels.",
      "CNX has said it would only go through with it if the federal government allows coal mine methane to qualify for tax credits that were central to Biden's plan to fight climate change.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "That\u2019s spurred proposals to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, develop small modular nuclear reactors and build utility-scale renewable installations or new natural gas plants.",
      "However, the growth in energy demand comes at a time when the power supply is already strained by efforts to shift away from planet-warming fossil fuels and the closure of aging nuclear power plants.",
      "In recent months, governors including Shapiro and state ratepayer advocates have pressured the operator of the mid-Atlantic electricity grid to reduce the amount of money it offers to power plant owners, warning that it will unjustifiably raise electricity bills across the region.",
      "__",
      "This story has been corrected to show that the hydrogen tax credit is for businesses that use it, not make it.",

    "story": [
      "Researchers have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution dating to around 5,200 years ago in ancient Greece",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ancient Greece produced the earliest records of democracy, western philosophy \u2014 and, it turns out, lead pollution.",
      "Researchers studying sediment cores recovered from mainland Greece and the Aegean Sea have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution in the environment dating to around 5,200 years ago.",
      "That's 1,200 years older than the previous earliest recorded lead pollution, which was found in a peatbog in Serbia.",
      "In antiquity, lead was released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of smelting ore for copper and silver. The toxic metal later condensed as dust and settled onto the soil.",
      "\u201cSilver was used for jewelry, for special objects \u2014 but it wasn't found in a pure state,\u201d but mined in ore combined with lead, said Heidelberg University archaeologist Joseph Maran, co-author of a new study published Thursday in Communications Earth and Environment.",
      "The site with the earliest signs of lead contamination is located in northeastern Greece, near the island of Thasos. Prior archaeological evidence suggests Thasos was one of the region\u2019s most significant sites for silver mining and metalwork, said Maran.",
      "\u201cLead released from smelting is the world\u2019s first form of toxic or industrial pollution,\u201d said Yale historian Joseph Manning, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The researchers found that levels of lead contamination remained fairly low and localized in ancient Greece, considered the cradle of European civilization, throughout the Bronze Age, the Classical period and the Hellenistic period. The Classical period is famous for Athenian democracy, Socrates and Plato, and the Hellenistic period saw Greek cultural influence peak across the Mediterranean region.",
      "But around 2,150 years ago, the researchers detected \u201ca very strong and abrupt increase\" in lead emissions caused by human activities across Greece, said co-author Andreas Koutsodendris at Heidelberg University.",
      "Around that time, in 146 B.C., the Roman army conquered the Greek peninsula, transforming the region\u2019s society and economy. As Roman trade, colonies and shipping expanded across the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, demand for silver coins grew rapidly, requiring smelting that released lead, said Koutsodendris.",
      "Later the Roman Empire used lead for tableware and for construction, including pipes.",
      "Previous research \u2013 including an analysis of ice cores from Greenland \u2013 had detected high levels of lead across much of the Northern Hemisphere during Roman times.",
      "But the new study adds a more \"specific and local picture to how lead levels changed,\u201d said Nathan Chellman, an environmental scientist at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was not involved in the research.",

      "A new report says advanced artificial intelligence systems have the potential to create extreme new risks, such as fueling widespread job losses, enabling terrorism or running amok",
      "LONDON -- Advanced artificial intelligence systems have the potential to create extreme new risks, such as fueling widespread job losses, enabling terrorism or running amok, experts said in a first-of-its-kind international report Wednesday cataloging the range of dangers posed by the technology.",
      "The International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI is being released ahead of a major AI summit in Paris next month. The paper is backed by 30 countries including the U.S. and China, marking rare cooperation between the two countries as they battle over AI supremacy, highlighted by Chinese startup DeepSeek stunning the world this week with its budget chatbot in spite of U.S. export controls on advanced chips to the country.",
      "The report by a group of independent experts is a \u201csynthesis\u201d of existing research intended to help guide officials working on drawing up guardrails for the rapidly advancing technology, Yoshua Bengio, a prominent AI scientist who led the study, told the Associated Press in an interview.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are high,\u201d the report says, noting that while a few years ago the best AI systems could barely spit out a coherent paragraph, now they can write computer programs, generate realistic images and hold extended conversations.",
      "While some AI harms are already widely known, such as deepfakes, scams and biased results, the report said that \u201cas general-purpose AI becomes more capable, evidence of additional risks is gradually emerging\u201d and risk management techniques are only in their early stages.",
      "It comes amid warnings this week about artificial intelligence from the Vatican and the group behind the Doomsday Clock.",
      "The report focuses on general purpose AI, typified by chatbots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT used to carry out many different kinds of tasks. The risks fall into three categories: malicious use, malfunctions and widespread \u201csystemic\u201d risks.",
      "Bengio, who with two other AI pioneers won computer science\u2019s top prize in 2019, said the 100 experts who came together on the report don\u2019t all agree on what to expect from AI in the future. Among the biggest disagreements within the AI research community is the timing of when the fast-developing technology will surpass human capabilities across a variety of tasks and what that will mean.",
      "\u201cThey disagree also about the scenarios,\u201d Bengio said. \u201cOf course, nobody has a crystal ball. Some scenarios are very beneficial. Some are terrifying. I think it\u2019s really important for policymakers and the public to take stock of that uncertainty.\u201d",
      "Researchers delved into the details surrounding possible dangers. AI makes it easier, for example, to learn how to create biological or chemical weapons because AI models can provide step by step plans. But it\u2019s \u201cunclear how well they capture the practical challenges\u201d of weaponizing and delivering the agents, it said.",
      "General purpose AI is also likely to transform a range of jobs and \u201cdisplace workers,\u201d the report says, noting that some researchers believe it could create more jobs than it takes away, while others think it will drive down wages or employment rates, though there\u2019s plenty of uncertainty over how it will play out.",
      "AI systems could also run out of control, either because they actively undermine human oversight or humans pay less attention, the report said.",
      "However, a raft of factors make it hard to manage the risks, including AI developers knowing little about how their models work, the authors said.",
      "The paper was commissioned at an inaugural global summit on AI safety hosted by Britain in November 2023, where nations agreed to work together to contain potentially \u201ccatastrophic risks.\u201d At a follow-up meeting hosted by South Korea last year, AI companies pledged to develop AI safety while world leaders backed setting up a network of public AI safety institutes.",
      "The report, also backed by the United Nations and the European Union, is meant to weather changes in governments, such as the recent presidential transition in the U.S., leaving it up to each country to choose how it responds to AI risks. President Donald Trump rescinded former President Joe Biden\u2019s AI safety policies on his first day in office, and has since directed his new administration to craft its own approach. But Trump hasn\u2019t made any move to disband the AI Safety Institute that Biden formed last year, part of a growing international network of such centers.",
      "World leaders, tech bosses and civil society are expected to convene again at the Paris AI Action Summit on Feb 10-11. French officials have said countries will sign a \u201ccommon declaration\u201d on AI development, and agree to a pledge on sustainable development of the technology.",
      "Bengio said the report's aim was not to \"propose a particular way to evaluate systems or anything.\" The authors stayed away from prioritizing particular risks or making specific policy recommendations. Instead they laid out what the scientific literature on AI says \u201cin a way that\u2019s digestible by policymakers.\"",
      "\u201cWe need to better understand the systems we\u2019re building and the risks that come with them so that we can we can take these better decisions in the future,\u201d he said.",

      "That immediately called into question the billions of dollars U.S. tech companies are spending on a massive expansion of energy-hungry data centers they say are needed to unlock the next wave of artificial intelligence.",
      "Could this new AI mean the world needs significantly less electricity for the technology than everyone thinks? The answer has profound implications for the overheating climate . AI uses vast amounts of energy, much of which comes from burning fossil fuels, which causes climate change. Tech companies have said their electricity use is going up, when it was supposed to be ramping down, ruining their carefully-laid plans to address climate change.",
      "\u201cThere has been a very gung ho, go ahead at all costs mentality in this space, pushing toward investment in fossil fuels,\u201d said Eric Gimon, senior fellow at Energy Innovation. \u201cThis is an opportunity to tap the brakes.\u201d",
      "Making AI more efficient could be less taxing on the environment, experts say, even if its huge electricity needs are not going away.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s claims of building its impressive chatbot on a budget drew curiosity that helped make its AI assistant the No. 1 downloaded free app on Apple\u2019s iPhone this week, ahead of U.S.-made chatbots ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden we wake up Monday morning and we see a new player number one on the App Store, and all of a sudden it could be a potential gamechanger overnight,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \u201c It caused a bit of a panic. These were the hottest stocks in the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s app competes well with other leading AI models. It can compose software code, solve math problems and address other questions that take multiple steps of planning. It's attracted attention for its ability to explain its reasoning in the process of answering questions.",
      "Leading analysts have been poring through the startup's public research papers about its new model, R1, and its precursors. Among the details that stood out was DeepSeek\u2019s assertion that the cost to train the flagship v3 model behind its AI assistant was only $5.6 million, a stunningly low number compared to the multiple billions of dollars spent to build ChatGPT and other well-known systems. DeepSeek hasn\u2019t responded to requests for comment.",
      "The $5.6 million number only included actually training the chatbot, not the costs of earlier-stage research and experiments, the paper said. DeepSeek was also working under some constraints: U.S. export controls on the most powerful AI chips. It said it relied on a relatively low-performing AI chip from California chipmaker Nvidia that the U.S. hasn\u2019t banned for sale in China.",
      "Data centers consumed about 4.4% of all U.S. electricity in 2023 and that's expected to increase to 6.7% to 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.",
      "It's been axiomatic that U.S. tech giants must spend much more on building out data centers and other infrastructure to train and run their AI systems. Meta Platforms, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, says it plans to spend up to $65 billion this year, including on a massive data center complex coming to Louisiana.",
      "Microsoft said it plans to spend $80 billion this year. And Trump last week joined the CEOs of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank to announce a joint venture that hopes to invest up to $500 billion on data centers and the electricity generation needed for AI development, starting with a project already under construction in Texas.",
      "When there's an innovative technology that's useful to the general population and it's affordable, people will use it, said Vic Shao, founder of DC Grid, which delivers off-grid, direct current power to data centers and electric vehicle charging stations.",
      "That means data centers will still be built, though they may be able to operate more efficiently, said Travis Miller, an energy and utilities strategist at Morningstar Securities Research.",
      "\u201cWe think that the growth in electricity demand will end up at the lower end of most of the ranges out there,\u201d he said.",
      "If DeepSeek's claims hold true, some routine AI queries might not need a data center and could be shifted to phones, said Rahul Sandil, vice president and general manager for global marketing and communications at MediaTek, a semiconductor company. That would ease the computing need and give more time to scale up renewable energy sources for data centers.",
      "Bloom Energy is one of the AI-related stocks that took a hit Monday. KR Sridhar, founder and CEO, said it's imperative that the U.S. leads in AI because it can power data centers with clean energy, unlike other countries that still primarily rely on coal.",

The offering, Yaccarino noted, will support an in-platform digital wallet and peer-to-peer payments connected to users' debit cards, with an option to transfer funds to a bank account.",
      "According to Visa, which also posted about the partnership on X Tuesday, these services will be powered by Visa Direct \u2014 the payment giant's instant money transferring service \u2014 and will be available to X Money Account users in the U.S.",
      "Whether X Money will become available to consumers in other countries, and perhaps through additional payment partners in the near future is still known. And an exact date for the U.S. launch has also not been announced yet.",
      "In her post Tuesday, Yaccarino called the partnership with Visa a \u201cmilestone for the Everything App\u201d and the \u201cfirst of many big announcements about X Money this year.\"",
      "The prospect of San Francisco-based X, formerly known as Twitter, becoming an \u201ceverything app\" has been floated around for some time. Before officially closing the deal to purchase the platform for $44 billion back in 2022, Musk expressed interest in creating his own version of something similar to China\u2019s WeChat \u2014 a \u201csuper app\u201d that does video chats, messaging, streaming and payments.",
      "And his fascination with such a platform began long before the Twitter deal was on the table. Musk has been toying with the idea of an \u201ceverything app\u201d since the late 1990s when he launched a startup called X.com that was later merged into what became X.com. He continued to push for PayPal to diversify but was rebuffed by company CEO Peter Thiel and other executives. PayPal was sold in 2002 to eBay for $1.5 billion \u2014 providing Musk with a windfall that he funneled into the creation of SpaceX and an investment in Tesla in its early days.",
      "The landscape is far more competitive today \u2014 with a handful of companies making similar efforts to expand their in-platform offerings. Other social media giants, such as Facebook parent Meta, have added shopping, games and even dating features.",
      "Consumers now have different platforms at their disposal for communications, payment services, entertainment and more. How X's coming \u201ceverything\u201d features will fare has yet to be seen. Since Musk's 2022 takeover, the platform has already alienated many users and advertisers over reports of rising hate speech and misinformation.",
      "X\u2019s ambitions could also thrust the company into the crosshairs of other powerful tech giants trying to fend off a perceived competitive threat. U.S. regulators have alleged that Apple, for example, has been illegally using its market power to stifle so-called super apps from making their way onto its iPhone since 2017.",
      "As part of an antitrust lawsuit filed last year, the U.S. Justice Department said it had uncovered evidence showing that Apple believed a super app would lessen consumers\u2019 usage of the iPhone\u2019s own software and services, including payment processing. The Cupertino, California, company has vehemently denied the allegations and is trying to persuade a federal judge in New Jersey to dismiss the entire case.",

      "The 40-year-old founder of China's DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund that now manages a reported $8 billion in assets",
      "BANGKOK -- The 40-year-old founder of China\u2019s DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund and then refined its quantitative models to branch into artificial intelligence.",
      "Liang Wenfeng, who founded DeepSeek in 2023, was born in southern China's Guangdong and studied in eastern China's Zhejiang province, home to e-commerce giant Alibaba and other tech firms, according to Chinese media reports.",
      "The hedge fund he set up in 2015, High-Flyer Quantitative Investment Management, developed models for computerized stock trading and began using machine-learning techniques to refine those strategies.",
      "Like many Chinese quantitative traders, High-Flyer was hit by losses when regulators cracked down on such trading in the past year. However, it reportedly manages $8 billion in assets, ample resources for funding DeepSeek\u2019s AI research.",
      "It also has abundant computing power for AI, since High-Flyer had by 2022 amassed a cluster of 10,000 of California-based Nvidia\u2019s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips that are used to build and run AI systems, according to a post that summer on Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. soon after restricted sales of those chips to China.",
      "\u201cThing is, we are sure now that we want to do this, can do this, and are capable of doing this, so we\u2019re among the best-suited candidates to tackle it at this moment,\" Liang told Waves, a tech media outlet, in 2023.",
      "\u201cCurrently, neither tech giants nor startups have an unassailable lead. With OpenAI paving the way, everyone is working with published papers and open-source code,\u201d it quoted him as saying.",
      "Liang said he spends his days reading papers, writing code, and participating in group discussions, like other researchers.",
      "DeepSeek is exploring what intelligence means, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople may think there\u2019s some hidden business logic behind this, but it\u2019s mainly driven by curiosity,\u201d Liang said.",
      "When DeepSeek was asked, \u201cWho is Liang Wenfeng?\u201d its first answer was to name a different Chinese entrepreneur with the same name, at least as spelled in English letters.",
      "When asked: \u201cWhere is Liang Wenfeng from and where did he go to university?\u201d it said that as of October 2023, the most recent knowledge cutoff for DeepSeek's R1 AI model, \u201cthere is no publicly available information about Liang Wenfeng\u2019s background, including his place of origin or educational history.\"",
      "\"If you are referring to the founder of DeepSeek, details about his personal life or academic background have not been disclosed publicly. For more information about DeepSeek, you can visit its official website,\u201d it said.",
      "Liang's focused approach fits in with his determination to push AI learning forward. After decades of relying on innovation from the West, he says China should be making its own contributions.",
      "\u201cWhat we see is that Chinese AI can\u2019t be in the position of following forever. We often say that there is a gap of one or two years between Chinese AI and the United States, but the real gap is the difference between originality and imitation,\u201d he said in another Waves interview in November. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t change, China will always be only a follower \u2014 so some exploration is inescapable.\u201d",

      "DeepSeek\u2019s emergence has raised concerns that China may have overtaken the U.S. in the artificial intelligence race despite restrictions on its access to the most advanced chips. It's just one of many Chinese companies working on AI, with a goal of making China the world leader in the field by 2030 and besting the U.S. in their battle for technological supremacy.",
      "Like the U.S., China is investing billions into artificial intelligence. Last week, it created a 60 billion yuan ($8.2 billion) AI investment fund, days after the U.S. imposed fresh chip export restrictions.",
      "Beijing has also invested heavily in the semiconductor industry to build its capacity to make advanced computer chips, working to overcome limits on its access to those of industry leaders. Companies are offering talent programs and subsidies, and there are plans to open AI academies and introduce AI education into primary and secondary school curriculums.",
      "China has established regulations governing AI, addressing safety, privacy and ethics. Its ruling Communist Party also controls the kinds of topics the AI models can tackle: DeepSeek shapes its responses to fit those limits.",
      "Here's an overview of some other leading AI models in China.",
      "Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Qwen-2.5-1M is the e-commerce giant's open-source AI series. It contains large language models that can easily handle extremely long questions, and engage in longer and deeper conversations. Its ability to understand complex tasks such as reasoning, dialogues and comprehending code is improving.",

      "Doubao 1.5 Pro is an AI model released by TikTok's parent company ByteDance last week. Doubao is currently one of the most popular AI chatbots in China, with 60 million monthly active users.",
      "ByteDance says the Doubao 1.5 Pro is better than ChatGPT-4o at retaining knowledge, coding, reasoning, and Chinese language processing. According to ByteDance, the model is also cost-efficient and requires lower hardware costs compared to other large language models because Doubao uses a highly-optimized architecture that balances performance with reduced computational demands.",
      "Moonshot AI is a Beijing-based startup valued at over $3 billion after its latest fundraising round. It says its recently released Kimi k1.5 matches or outperforms the OpenAI o1 model, which is designed to spend more time thinking before it responds and can solve harder and more complex problems. Moonshot claims that Kimi outperforms OpenAI o1 in mathematics, coding, and ability to comprehend both text and visual inputs such as photos and video."

      "The tariffs, which will be implemented on Feb. 4, will be imposed via three separate executive orders that have been signed for each country, according to a White House official.",
      "There will be a 25% tariff on all Mexican exports to the U.S. as well as on all exports to the U.S. from Canada. However, Canadian energy products will be tariffed at a lower rate of 10%.",
      "There is a 10% tariff on all China exports to the U.S.",
      "Hours before the tariffs were set to take effect, leaders in Canada and Mexico vowed to respond, indicating the possibility of a trade war.",
      "According to the White House official, there is a retaliation clause so that if any country chooses to retaliate in any way, the signal will be to take further action with likely increased tariffs.",
      "Tariffs of this magnitude will likely increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers, experts previously told ABC News.",
      "The policy could raise prices for an array of products ranging from avocados to tequila to auto parts.",
      "The price impact remains unclear, however, since businesses within the supply chain could opt to take on some or all of the tax burden, some experts added.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Friday, U.S. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the tariffs target the three countries for hosting the manufacture and transport of illicit drugs that end up in the U.S.",
      "\"Canada, Mexico and China have all enabled illegal drugs to pour into America,\" Leavitt said.",
      "The sentiment echoed comments made by President Donald Trump when he proposed such tariffs in a post on Truth Social weeks after winning the November election.",
      "\"These are promises made and promises kept by the president,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Less than two hours after Leavitt addressed reporters, Canadian President Justin Trudeau said in a post on X that such tariffs would elicit a \"forceful and immediate response.\"",
      "Speaking earlier in the day, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum cast doubt on the likelihood of tariffs. \"We don't believe that it will happen and if it does, we have our plan,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "Mexico and Canada account for 70% of U.S. crude oil imports, which make up a key input for the nation's gasoline supply, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a government agency.",
      "The tariffs could raise gasoline prices by as much as 70 cents a gallon for some drivers, Timothy Fitzgerald, a professor of business economics at the University of Tennessee who studies the petroleum industry, previously told ABC News.",
      "Trump said at the Oval Office earlier this week that the tariffs may feature an exemption for oil. Such a move could mitigate the risk of a price hike for gasoline, but the inclusion of the exemption remained unclear a day before the tariffs were set to take effect.",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued a statement Saturday slamming the executive orders.",
      "\"The imposition of tariffs under IEEPA is unprecedented, won\u2019t solve these problems, and will only raise prices for American families and upend supply chain,\" U.S. Chamber of Commerce Senior Vice President and Head of International John Murphy said in the statement.",
      "When asked on Friday about a possible exemption for oil, Leavitt declined to directly respond. \"I don't have an update,\" Leavitt said. \"Those tariffs will be for public consumption in about 24 hours.\"",
      "The proposed tariffs could also raise the price of an array of fresh fruits and vegetables, including tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, jalapenos, limes and mangoes, Jason Miller, a professor of supply-chain management at Michigan State University, told ABC News.",
      "It would be difficult for the U.S. to replace those goods with domestic production or an alternative supplier, making it likely that prices would rise significantly if the tariffs take effect, he added.",
      "The auto industry also retains deep ties to Canada and Mexico, making tariffs a threat to prices for cars and auto parts, experts said.",
      "Inflation has slowed dramatically from a peak of more than 9% in June 2022, but price increases have picked up in recent months, keeping inflation nearly a percentage point higher than the Fed's target rate of 2%.",
      "Speaking on Friday, Leavitt touted Trump's previous achievements in keeping inflation under control.",

      "The White House's Office of Personnel Management had told government workers in an email Tuesday that if they quit by Feb. 6, they would still get paid through Sept. 30.",
      "Employment lawyers questioned whether such an offer was lawful because Congress, not the White House, is responsible for authorizing workers' paychecks. Many agencies are expected to run out of money this spring, with the federal government only funded through March, raising questions about how the Trump administration can promise those who take the buyouts would still get paid if the executive branch doesn't control spending.",
      "Many federal workers also wondered whether the memo, titled \"A Fork in the Road,\" was a phishing scam, prompting OPM to release a new memo assuring workers they are \"most welcome [to] stay at home and relax or to travel to your dream destination. Whatever you would like.\"",
      "On Friday morning, senior officials at the various agencies sent memos to staffers assuring them the offers were indeed real.",
      "\"On behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), I am informing you that the offer is valid, lawful, and will be honored by USDA,\" said one such memo signed by Kailee Tkacz Buller, chief of staff at the Department of Agriculture.",
      "\"If you accept the deferred resignation offer, you will receive pay and benefits through September 30, 2025, and will not be subject to a reduction-in-force or other premature separation,\" she wrote.",
      "However, Max Alonzo, the national secretary-treasurer for the National Federation of Federal Employees, a labor union that represents 110,000 federal workers, said his union is advising federal workers not to respond to the email.",
      "In part, he said, the union is worried about the lack of clarity and specifics in the offer email. He pointed to the lack of a contract and the fact that Congress has not allocated funds for large-scale federal buyouts, and he worried people might offer to resign but not actually be paid in the end or may have their benefits stripped.",
      "\"Absolutely do not resign. There is nothing that says that the day that you resign, that they can't just let you go,\" he said. \"They don't have to pay you -- there's nothing that says they have to pay you till Sept. 30. This is nothing that has been done before. This is not in our regulations. There's no regs about it. We're not even sure if it's actually legal. So, yeah, absolutely do not resign.\"",
      "The buyout offers come as President Donald Trump has pushed for federal employees to return to working in person, signing an executive order on his first day in office calling for an end to teleworking.",
      "However, the email went to many workers across the country who never had telework agreements, including firefighters with the U.S. Forest Service and nurses at hospitals with the Department of Veterans Affairs, and many remain skeptical about the intention of the offer and ramifications for those who reply.",
      "Asked about the buyout offers in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump was blunt, saying, \"We'd love to have them leave.\"",
      "\"We're trying to reduce government,\" Trump added, noting that he didn't know how many people had taken the offer but that it would become clear on Feb. 6, when the offer expires.",
      "\"Nobody knows how that's going to turn out,\" Trump said. \"Everybody's replaceable, and we'll get very good people to replace them if it turns out to be more than we thought it could be.\"",

      "Democrats had seized on Kennedy\u2019s financial stake in the lawsuit, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., warning that he could use his perch in government to make it easier for lawyers \u2013 including himself \u2013 to sue vaccine manufacturers and drug makers in court.",
      "The lawsuit alleges marketing fraud against pharmaceutical company Merck for its HPV vaccine, Gardasil, which Merck denies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains that the vaccine has been proven safe, with more than 160 studies finding no concerns.",
      "\u201cKennedy can kill off access to vaccines and make millions of dollars while he does it,\u201d Warren said at Kennedy\u2019s confirmation hearing on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cKids might die, but Robert Kennedy will keep cashing in,\u201d she added.",

      "The next day, Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy said he was \u201cstruggling\u201d with Kennedy\u2019s nomination, noting at one point that Kennedy was \u201cfinancially vested in finding fault with vaccines.\u201d",
      "Kennedy told senators in his testimony Thursday that he was giving away his rights to the fees in the lawsuit against Merck. However, it was unclear whether he misspoke because his ethics agreement still maintained that he was entitled to the fees.",

And three years later, they come up with a report that nobody looks at, especially not in all cases.\"",

      "DEI or any similar program does not apply to hiring for air traffic control, which requires rigorous health examinations and a multiyear training process. Applicants must pass a medical exam, an aptitude test and a psychological test that is more stringent than that required of a pilot, said Chris Wilbanks, FAA deputy vice president of safety and technical training.",
      "Trump pointed to a New York Post article as he accused Democrats of pushing to hire people with severe mental disabilities at the Federal Aviation Administration. But the diversity language referenced in the article was on the FAA website during the entirety of Trump\u2019s first term and has been on the site for more than a decade, according to Snopes.",
      "Trump's attacks, though, are in line with his agenda to dismantle DEI from the federal government. In his first week in office, he signed multiple orders to place federal employees working on DEI on administrative leave and to remove DEI efforts from the Pentagon.",
      "Democrats pushed back on Trump's claims about the crash.",
      "\"Listen, it's one thing for internet pundits to spew off conspiracy theories. It's another for the president of the United States to throw out idle speculation as bodies are still being recovered and families still being notified,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on Thursday. \"It just turns your stomach.\"",
      "Pete Buttigieg, Biden's transportation secretary and another target of Trump's criticism in the wake of the crash, called Trump's comments \"despicable.\"",
      "\"President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA,\" Buttigieg wrote in a social media post. \"One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who helped keep our skies safe.

      "ABC NEWS: The director of the Center on National Security at Fordham Law School, Karen Greenberg. Karen, thanks for being with us. We are talking about an American military base on foreign soil. What does that mean for immigrants' access to due process?",
      "KAREN GREENBERG: OK, so first, it's not really foreign soil in the United States' terms -- it's an outpost of the United States. And that's always been one of the confusing things about Guantanamo.",
      "What it is is a place where, repeatedly, the United States has sought to place individuals without the kinds of protections by law that they have in the United States on the homeland, as we've seen with the detention of war on terror detainees. And also, you know, we can talk about the migration center as well, but it is not correct to call it on foreign soil. It is on a U.S. base located in Guantanamo Bay.",
      "ABC NEWS: All right, so you've been to that facility where they'd be held at Guantanamo Bay. What challenges will the administration face in trying to implement the plan?",
      "GREENBERG: So one big challenge that they're going to face is basically the numbers he was throwing around. He threw out 30,000 -- I don't know that they have the capacity for that, but I have never heard that before. At the height that I knew about it, in the old days and the '90s, I think they held 21,000 at the most.",
      "They've held refugees repeatedly. In current context, President Biden talked about using it for migrants as well, but never, and we're using it now for some intercepted asylum seekers and migrants. But that kind of capacity, that kind of number, hasn't been thrown around before.",
      "So I'm assuming that will mean they will need to build up some kind of facility, not just for the numbers they're talking about in terms of migrants, but also for the guards, the health facilities, etc., etc., that we'll need there.",
      "And just to make a point there, they had to build Guantanamo detention facility, also, you know, for the war on terror detainees. And they did that very rapidly. They did it within 100 days, and built, you know, state-of-the-art maximum security prisons and housing for those who would need to attend to them. So it can be done quickly.",
      "ABC NEWS: As you point out, the base has been used to hold much smaller numbers of immigrants for years. What could some of their experiences tell us about Guantanamo?",
      "GREENBERG: Well, the reports are not good. And I want to say that it's not just the past reports that are not good. It's also, there was a report released in September by the International Refugee Assistance Project, which sort of detailed the conditions that migrants are held in currently at Guantanamo, which included unsanitary conditions, mistreatment, not to mention this sort of fuzzy legal status.",
      "So I don't think that's projected well in the past, there's also been in these prior times, in the '70s and the '90s also, you know, allegations of, and documents of mistreatment and unsanitary conditions, etc.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 09:22:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Marco Rubio is set to embark on his first diplomatic mission abroad since being confirmed to his post, visiting five countries in Central and South America.",
    "story": [
      "The trip is Rubio's first as America's top diplomat.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to embark on his first diplomatic mission abroad since being confirmed to his post, visiting five countries in Central and South America over the first week of February.",
      "During the trip, Rubio is expected to reinforce the Trump administration's immigration priorities with leaders in the region, according to a senior official, who said the secretary is also planning to address Beijing's influence during several of the stops.",
      "The State Department is also billing Rubio's trip as historic -- saying his six-day journey to Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic marks the first time a U.S. secretary of state has opted to make his or her first official visit to Latin America in over 100 years.",
      "\"This is where we live\"",
      "In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Rubio said the trip is part of a realignment of American diplomatic priorities.",
      "\"For many reasons, U.S. foreign policy has long focused on other regions while overlooking our own. As a result, we've let problems fester, missed opportunities and neglected partners,\" he said. \"That ends now.\"",
      "State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said the region's proximity to the United States was an important factor in selecting it for Rubio's first trip.",
      "\"The fact of the matter is, this is where we live. This is who we are,\" she said. \"This is about not just wanting to have new partnerships -- but that's always good -- but the nature of what it means to have an extended relationship with the people closest to you.\"",
      "Those relationships are vital for fulfilling the Trump administration's border security and deportation plans, Rubio noted.",
      "\"Diplomacy's role in this effort is central. We need to work with countries of origin to halt and deter further migrant flows, and to accept the return of their citizens present in the U.S. illegally,\" he said.",
      "Cooperation and coercion",
      "However, the countries on his itinerary have largely been very cooperative with the administration so far, as other countries in the region Rubio will skip over remain hesitant to comply.",
      "Guatemala, for instance, has accepted hundreds of migrants brought to the country on military planes since Trump took office, and the country's leadership has signaled it is open to accepting deportees of other nationalities.",
      "Meanwhile, Mexico, which is traditionally the U.S.' most important partner in handling illegal immigration, has been much more tentative.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum originally said the country wouldn't accept migrants from other countries, but she quietly reversed course in late January when she revealed Mexico had accepted over 4,000 deportees and that while \"the large majority\" was Mexican, others were not.",
      "Mexico has also so far refused requests from the U.S. to allow military flights carrying deportees to land in the country, according to officials from both countries.",
      "Honduras has posed another challenge to the administration's agenda. According to data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the end of 2024, Hondurans made up the largest share of the population in the deportation pipeline. But ahead of Trump's inauguration, the president of Honduras threatened to expel members of the U.S. military stationed in the country in response to mass deportations of Honduran nationals.",
      "However, Honduran authorities have signaled the country's position may be softening. The country's foreign minister wrote on X that the government is in the process of launching a program to support returning migrants called \"Brother, Come Home.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also had some early success in overtly pressuring countries to acquiesce. His threatened trade war against Colombia prompted its government to allow military deportation flights to land on its territory.",
      "\"It sends a message that this administration, President Trump, Secretary Rubio -- they mean what they say,\" said Mauricio Claver-Carone, special envoy for Latin America.",
      "Claver-Carone also suggested the Trump administration would use gentler diplomatic tactics as well, saying that during Rubio's trip, he will attempt to lay the groundwork for a program to repatriate migrants travelling through Central America with the government of Costa Rica.",
      "He also addressed Richard Grenell's visit to Venezuela to meet with strongman Nicolas Maduro on Friday.",
      "\"President Trump expects Nicolas Maduro to take back all of the Venezuelan criminals and gang members that have been exported to United States and to do so unequivocally and without condition,\" he said, adding that Grenell, the envoy for special missions, will also urge Maduro to release American hostages held in the country.",
      "A \"direct threat\" from China",
      "Beyond immigration, Claver-Carone said Beijing's growing influence in Central America will also be top of mind for Rubio through much of the trip, but it is expected to take center stage during the secretary's first stop in Panama.",
      "Trump has lodged a litany of complaints related to Panama's operation of the canal that cuts through the country -- claiming that American vessels are overcharged, lamenting that the U.S. ceded control of the vital waterway in the first place and promising \"we're taking it back\" during his inaugural address.",
      "Rubio has taken a more measured approach in discussing the Panama Canal while also underscoring that what he says are Trump's legitimate concerns about the waterway -- especially when it comes to companies controlled by Beijing located on each end of it.",
      "\"If the government in China in a conflict tells them to shut down the Panama Canal, they will have to,\" Rubio said in an interview on Thursday. \"That is a direct threat.\"",
      "Rubio continued to say it is a dynamic that cannot be allowed to continue.",
      "\"It is not in the national interest of the United States to have a canal we paid for and we built used as a leverage and a weapon against us. That can't happen,\" he said.",
      "But ahead of Rubio's visit, Panama President Jose Raul Mulino said handing back control of the canal isn't a thought he can entertain.",
      "\"It's impossible,\" Mulino said during a press conference on Thursday. \"I cannot negotiate, and much less open, a process of negotiation over the canal. That's sealed. The canal belongs to Panama.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 15:17:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Senior White House officials had not reviewed the Office of Management and Budget's sweeping order freezing federal grants and loans before it was issued, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "The funding freeze order was rescinded following legal challenges.",
      "When the Office of Management and Budget issued a sweeping order this week freezing trillions of dollars in federal grants and loans, senior White House officials had not reviewed it beforehand, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "The order was rescinded following legal challenges and intense backlash amid widespread confusion and disruptions to critical services like Medicaid.",
      "And now, amid the fallout, finger pointing has begun inside the administration, sources said, with the attention turning to Mark Paoletta, OMB's general counsel, who played a key role in drafting the order.",
      "Top White House policy adviser Stephen Miller and staff secretary Will Scharf were among those who had been left out of the review process, sources said.",
      "The fallout has already led to discussions about reassigning Paoletta away from his position as OMB's general counsel, though no final decision has been made, according to multiple sources.",
      "Sources said senior advisers were caught off guard and frustrated that they had not reviewed the memo before its release, seeing its rollout as a stain on what had otherwise been smooth messaging around President Donald Trump's rapid rollout of executive orders.",
      "Meanwhile, some rank-and-file officials at OMB were themselves left confused both when the memo was issued and after it was rescinded, sources said.",
      "OMB officials did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "On Wednesday, a federal judge signaled he would issue a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from freezing federal loans and grants. That's now raised concerns that the White House will try to enact the same policy described in the now-rescinded memo.",
      "District Judge John McConnell Jr. had harsh words for the Trump administration following a social media post by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in which Leavitt said it was the memo that was being rescinded, not the freeze itself.",
      "\"This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze,\" Leavitt posted on X, defending the policy after the memo was rescinded. \"It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo. Why? To end any confusion created by the court's injunction. The President's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented.\"",
      "Despite the Office of Management rescinding their directive, Judge McConnell said he believed there was \"sufficient evidence\" that the government still plans to carry out the policy based on Leavitt's social media post.",
      "\"That's my read of the tweet. I can't believe I'm saying that, but that's my read of the tweet,\" Judge McConnell said.",

      "A group of immigrant advocacy centers and nonprofits has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security for shutting down legal orientation programs for immigrants, including people detained at ICE detention facilities.",
      "The lawsuit was filed a week after the Department of Justice told legal service providers who receive federal funding to stop providing legal orientation and other work intended to support immigrants at immigration court and detention facilities.",
      "\"With increased detentions, rapid deportation processes, and new detention centers, legal access to these detention centers to ensure these activities are being carried out following applicable laws has never been more important,\" the lawsuit says. \"The Programs at issue here are thus essential: they provide basic due process to noncitizens and they ensure lawyers are regularly inside detention centers to observe or be told about potential legal violations.\"",
      "The groups argue that legal orientation programs were stopped without advanced notice and that many of the nonprofits lost access to detention facilities across the country.",
      "\"By denying Program providers access, Defendants ensure that no legal service providers' eyes are watching what the government does inside,\" the complaint says.",
      "Officials with the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment when contacted by ABC News. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In the 51-page complaint, the groups argue that because immigration courts don't guarantee individuals the right to counsel, the programs are necessary because they give noncitizens facing deportation critical access to basic legal information.",
      "The programs that were shut down include the Legal Orientation Program; the Immigration Court Helpdesk; the Family Group Legal Orientation Program; and the Counsel for Children Initiative, which provides legal representation to children in immigration court proceedings.",

      "Ex-Officer Derek Chauvin allegedly pinned Patty Day with his knee in 2020.",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The city of Minneapolis has agreed to pay $600,000 to settle a lawsuit by a woman who alleged that ex-Officer Derek Chauvin hauled her from her minivan and pinned her to the ground with his knee in January 2020, just as he did four months later when he killed George Floyd.",
      "Patty Day, formerly employed by the Public Works Department, claimed in a lawsuit filed last May that she was the victim of excessive force and a wrongful arrest. She acknowledged that she was drunk on the evening of Jan. 17, 2020, and depressed over her impending divorce and other difficulties when she got stuck in the snow for several hours.",
      "Chauvin and his partner that night, Officer Ellen Jensen, eventually arrived on the scene. The lawsuit alleged that the officers \u201cviolently yanked\u201d Day from her vehicle and threw her to the pavement, causing several injuries.",
      "\u201cChauvin then assumed his signature pose, pressing his knee into the subdued and handcuffed Patty\u2019s back \u2014 just as he would later do to snuff the life out of George Floyd \u2014 and remaining that way well after Patty was controlled,\u201d the complaint alleged. A drunken driving charge was later dropped after a judge ruled that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest her and suppressed the blood alcohol test evidence.",
      "The Minneapolis City Council unanimously approved the $600,000 settlement Thursday. Council member LaTrisha Vetaw told her colleagues that $175,000 will go to Day while her attorneys will get $425,000.",
      "The city has now paid over $36 million to settle police misconduct cases involving Chauvin, including $27 million to the Floyd family.",
      "\u201cWhile no settlement can undo what Patty endured, we are grateful to have reached an agreement that holds the officers accountable for their actions,\u201d Day's attorney, Katie Bennett, said in a statement. \u201cThis case is yet another example of the critical need for justice and reform in policing.\u201d",
      "Chauvin, who is white, remains incarcerated at a federal prison in Texas for his conviction in state court of murdering Floyd and a federal conviction for violating Floyd's civil rights. The Black man's murder sparked a national reckoning with racial injustice."

      "In 2022, the U.S. transferred $3.5 billion in Afghan central bank assets previously frozen in America to the Swiss-based Fund for the Afghan People. The fund has grown to nearly $4 billion since then, according to the inspector general.",

      "Groundhog Day predictions about the coming of spring put the spotlight on Punxsutawney Phil every Feb. 2",
      "Groundhog Day predictions about the coming of spring put the spotlight on Punxsutawney Phil every Feb. 2, but celebrating the midpoint between the shortest and darkest day of the year and the spring equinox has ancient roots in European agricultural life.",
      "Punxsutawney Phil is far from the only groundhog whose human handlers make annual announcements about whether they've seen their own shadows and are predicting six more weeks of winter or an early spring.",
      "The date not only divides the calendar between the winter solstice and the spring equinox \u2014 it's also a time of year that figures in the Celtic calendar and the Christian holiday of Candlemas.",
      "And in eastern and central Pennsylvania, where people of German descent have been watching the groundhog's annual emergence from hibernation for centuries, there's a tradition of groundhog clubs and celebrations that are independent of Phil.",
      "Some dismiss the Punxsutawney event as an unworthy rival to their own festivities, which they say forecast more accurate weather predictions. There have been weather-predicting groundhogs in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces, and less formal celebrations far and wide.",
      "One thing it's not: serious business.",
      "\u201cWe know this is silly; we know this is fun,\u201d said Marcy Galando, executive director of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. \u201cWe want people to come here with a sense of humor.\u201d",
      "Here are some things to know about the holiday:",
      "Celtic people across Europe marked the four days that are midway between the winter solstice, the spring equinox, the summer solstice and the fall equinox. What the Celts called Imbolc is also around when Christians celebrate Candlemas, timed to Joseph and Mary's presentation of Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem.",
      "Ancient people would watch the sun, stars and animal behavior to guide farming practices and other decisions, and the practice of watching an animal\u2019s emergence from winter hibernation to forecast weather has roots in a similar German tradition involving badgers or bears. Pennsylvania Germans apparently substituted the groundhog, endemic to the eastern and midwestern United States.",
      "Historians have found a reference in an 1841 diary to groundhog weather forecasts in early February among families of German descent in Morgantown, Pennsylvania, according to the late Don Yoder, a University of Pennsylvania professor whose 2003 book about Groundhog Day explored the Celtic connection.",
      "Yoder concluded the festival has roots in \u201cancient, undoubtedly prehistoric, weather lore.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania Germans settled in the area, and in the late 1880s, they started celebrating the holiday by picnicking, hunting and eating groundhogs.",
      "Members of Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, organized in 1899, care for Phil and his woodchuck family at a customized space beside Punxsutawney Memorial Library, where there's a window with a view into the creature's burrow.",
      "The Punxsutawney groundhog makes predictions, but he's not always predictable. The designated groundhog emerged before sunrise in 1929 and didn't come out until late afternoon in 1941.",
      "The 1993 Bill Murray movie \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d caused such a resurgence of interest that two years after it came out, event organizers voiced concern about rowdy crowds drinking all night, people climbing trees and others stripping to their underwear. In 1998, a groundhog club leader wearing a $4,000 groundhog suit reported being assaulted by a half-dozen young men.",
      "Alcohol is now prohibited at Gobbler's Knob, Phil's spot some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh.",
      "The early festivities in Punxsutawney were followed in 1907 by folks in Quarryville, a farming area in Lancaster County in Pennsylvania's southeastern corner. The roughly 240 members of the Slumbering Groundhog Lodge there report the winter forecast from Octoraro Orphie, or least via his well-preserved remains.",
      "The groundhog is a member of the squirrel family and related to chipmunks and prairie dogs. It's also known as a woodchuck, a whistle pig \u2014 or in the parlance of Pennsylvania Dutch, a language with German roots, a \u201cgrundsau.\u201d",
      "Groundhogs are herbivores that are themselves edible to humans, although they are not widely consumed. Their lifespan in the wild is typically two or three years.",
      "Some cooks advise groundhogs are best taken when they are young and after clover is in bloom, since a clover diet is thought to improve the meat's taste.",
      "Starting in the 1930s, groundhog lodges opened in eastern Pennsylvania. They were social clubs with similarities to Freemasonry.",
      "Intended to preserve Pennsylvania German culture and traditions, clubs would sometimes fine those who were caught speaking anything but their Pennsylvania Dutch language at meetings. They were traditionally all-male groups and several of the clubs remain active.",
      "They all share the unifying feature of a groundhog's weather prognostication, according to William W. Donner, a Kutztown University anthropology professor and author of \u201cSerious Nonsense,\u201d a book about the lodges and other efforts to preserve German heritage.",
      "\u201cI think it's just one of these traditional rituals that people enjoy participating in, that maybe take them away from modern life for 15 minutes,\u201d Donner said.",
      "Some well-meaning efforts have sought to determine Phil's accuracy, but what \u201csix weeks of winter\u201d means is debatable. Claims that a groundhog has or has not seen its shadow \u2014 and that it's able to communicate that to a human \u2014 are also fair territory for skeptics and the humor impaired.",
      "By all accounts, Phil predicts more winter far more often than he predicts an early spring.",
      "Groundhogs are mostly solitary creatures who start to emerge in midwinter to find a mate. The science behind whether they can make any accurate weather predictions is problematic at best.",
      "Among the skeptics is the National Centers for Environmental Information, within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The government agency compares Phil's record with U.S. national temperatures to conclude he's hardly perfect."

      "Democrats are poised to elect a new leader in a low-profile Democratic National Committee election that could have big implications for the party\u2019s future",
      "OXON HILL, Md. -- Democrats, desperately seeking a new message and messengers to push back against the Trump administration, will elect a new leader Saturday in a low-profile Democratic National Committee election that could have big implications for the party's future.",
      "More than 400 DNC members from every state and U.S. territory have gathered in suburban Washington for the election, which features a slate of candidates dominated by party insiders. Outgoing Chair Jaime Harrison is not seeking reelection.",
      "Most of the candidates acknowledge that the Democratic brand is badly damaged, but few are promising fundamental changes. Indeed, nearly three months after Donald Trump won the popular vote and gained ground among key Democratic constituencies, there is little agreement on what exactly went wrong.",
      "Facing an emboldened Trump presidency, however, the leading candidates are talking tough.",
      "\u201cAs we reel with shock at the horror that Trump is visiting on communities across this country, we need a DNC and a DNC chair who\u2019s ready to bring the intensity, the focus and the fury to fight back,\u201d said Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic chairman and a top candidate for DNC chair.",
      "The election comes less than two weeks after Trump's inauguration as Democratic leaders struggle to confront the sheer volume of executive orders, pardons, personnel changes and controversial relationships taking shape in the new administration. The next DNC chair would serve as a face of the Democratic response, while helping to coordinate political strategy and repair the party's brand.",
      "Just 31% of voters have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week that offers a dramatic contrast with Trump's GOP. Forty-three percent of voters have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party.",
      "The leading candidates for DNC chair, Wisconsin's Wikler and Minnesota\u2019s Ken Martin, are low-profile state party chairs. They're promising to refocus the Democratic message on working-class voters, strengthen Democratic infrastructure across the country and improve the party's anti-Trump rapid response system.",
      "They have promised not to shy away from the party's dedication to diversity and minority groups, a pillar of the modern-day Democratic Party. But if Martin, 51, or Wikler, 43, is elected, as expected, either would be the first white man to lead the DNC since 2011.",
      "Also in the race: Marianne Williamson, the activist and author; former Maryland governor and Biden administration official Martin O\u2019Malley; and Faiz Shakir, who managed Bernie Sanders\u2019 last presidential campaign.",
      "Shakir has called for sweeping changes within the party, such as more coordination with labor unions and less focus on minority groups sorted by race and gender. The only Muslim seeking the chairmanship, Shakir was alone during a candidate forum this week in opposing the creation of a Muslim caucus at the DNC.",
      "But he has struggled to gain traction.",
      "Shakir declined to raise money for the contest, decorating his modest booth at this week's gathering with pictures drawn by his young children with crayons. By contrast, Martin and Wikler hosted would-be supporters in large hotel suites adorned with dozens of professionally printed signs and offered T-shirts, sunglasses and food.",
      "Wikler has faced questions about his relationship with Democratic donor Reid Hoffman, the billionaire cofounder of LinkedIn. But he cast his fundraising connections as an asset. Indeed, the DNC chair is expected to raise tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats win elections.",
      "Some Democratic leaders remain concerned about the direction of their party.",
      "\u201cAs positive as I am and as hopeful as I am, I\u2019m watching this in real time, thinking to myself, \u2018We\u2019re in real trouble because I don\u2019t see a desire to change,\u2019\u201d said Kansas Democratic Chair Jeanna Repass, a candidate for DNC vice chair.",

For Wichita, which once built many of the nation\u2019s aircraft, the skating showcase was another way of putting the community in America's heartland on a larger stage.",

      "The midair collision Wednesday night between the plane and an Army helicopter in Washington, D.C., has left Wichita grieving. The worst U.S. air disaster in a generation killed 67 people, including young figure skaters who had attended a national development camp in Wichita following the championships. No one survived.",

      "It was unclear how many of the victims may have been Wichita residents. Authorities have not released a list of the passengers, who included hunting buddies, an attorney on a business trip and a college student returning from her grandfather's funeral.",
      "Following the collision, city and religious leaders held a prayer vigil that turned out hundreds of people who prayed for victims' families and pledged to provide comfort.",
      "\u201cThis unity cannot just stay in sadness. It has to elicit something greater, something brighter, something that can shine forth,\u201d said Rabbi Shmulik Greenberg of Chabad, a Hasidic synagogue and community center in Wichita.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of connections to this plane. There\u2019s a lot of connections to Bombardier as a company,\u201d said Howell, who spent two decades working in flight testing, including a stint with Bombardier in the early 1990s. \u201cWe have a lot of employees who work for Bombardier who are still involved in testing and maintaining those types of planes here in Wichita.\u201d",

Kennedy Jr.\u2019s nomination as secretary of Health and Human Services includes the names of doctors who have had their licenses revoked, suspended or faced other discipline, The Associated Press has found.",
      "The letter was meant to lend credibility to Kennedy\u2019s nomination, which has faced strenuous opposition from medical experts due to his two decades of anti-vaccine activism. Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a medical doctor who boasts on his official website of an effort he created to vaccinate 36,000 children against hepatitis B, expressed hesitancy about Kennedy's nomination and is seen as a key vote.",
      "The AP found that in addition to the physicians who had faced disciplinary action, many of the nearly 800 signers are not doctors. The letter with the names of those who signed was provided to the AP by Sen. Ron Johnson\u2019s office after he entered it into the Congressional Record on Wednesday during the first of Kennedy\u2019s two confirmation hearings.",
      "Among those who signed it were a self-described journalist, a certified public accountant, a firefighter/paramedic, a certified health coach and someone who said they had a bachelor\u2019s degree \u201cwith an emphasis on Jungian Psychology.\u201d The signers include at least 75 nurses, as well as physician's assistants. More than 90 did not include any credentials at all.",
      "Over 20 were chiropractors, representing an industry that has funded Kennedy's work. An AP investigation found that donations from a chiropractic group represented one-sixth of the revenues collected by Kennedy's anti-vaccine nonprofit in 2019.",
      "The letter was organized and submitted by MAHA Action, which is run by Del Bigtree, who worked for Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign and is a longtime anti-vaccine activist. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Kennedy transferred the trademark for the \u201cMAHA\u201d slogan to an limited liability company run by Bigtree. Kennedy reported that he received $100,000 in income from licensing the slogan and said in his financial disclosures that he had transferred the trademark for \u201cno compensation.\u201d",

Kennedy Jr. \u201d and begins with the words, \u201cWe, the undersigned physicians.\" It says lower down that it \u201creflects the collective voice of physicians and medical professionals\u201d committed to addressing chronic disease.",
      "The AP\u2019s review found that at least 10 doctors who signed the letter had run into trouble with state medical boards or their board certification body for a variety of alleged misconduct. Sanctions they faced included having their license revoked or suspended, being put on probation, receiving a reprimand or other action. One received a warning letter from the Federal Trade Commission, which said he was unlawfully advertising products as treatments or prevention for COVID-19, including intravenous nutrient therapy and vitamins.",
      "Among the signers was Paul Thomas, an anti-vaccine doctor who voluntarily surrendered his medical license in 2022 after Oregon's medical board found he had engaged in repeated and gross negligence in the practice of medicine.",
      "Thomas did not admit or deny the finding. NBC News reported that Thomas was part of a team assembled by Kennedy who remotely advised an anti-vaccine activist in Samoa during a measles outbreak there on how to treat children with vitamins. A person who responded on behalf of Thomas, DeeDee Hoover, said the information the AP had was inaccurate but did not reply when asked what specifically was wrong.",
      "Other signers included Dr. Simone Gold, who was reprimanded by California\u2019s medical board after she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for her conduct at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Gold was recently pardoned by Trump and told the AP in an email that her reprimand and other disciplinary action were overturned by a judge prior to her pardon.",
      "\u201cRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is an honorable and honest person with vast subject matter knowledge and experience who values the health of the American people, and furthermore because he is willing to challenge corporate interests where they conflict with the best interests of those citizens,\u201d Gold wrote in an email.",
      "Meryl Nass, whose medical license was suspended in Maine over her treatment of COVID-19 patients, also signed. She told the AP she is appealing the decision and expects to be fully vindicated.",
      "At least two of the doctors were disciplined, prior to the pandemic, for improperly giving out vaccine waivers, including one who had his license revoked and another who was put on probation. Another doctor's license was revoked for refusing to follow COVID-19 guidelines.",

    "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio embarks this weekend on his first foreign trip in office",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio embarks this weekend on his first foreign trip in office",
      "WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Marco Rubio embarks this weekend on his first foreign trip in office, heading to Central America to press President Donald Trump's top priority \u2014 curbing illegal immigration \u2014 and bring the message that the U.S. wants to reclaim control over the Panama Canal despite intense resistance from regional leaders.",
      "It's an unusual destination for the maiden voyage of America\u2019s top diplomat, whose predecessors have generally favored Europe or Asia for their initial outings. It reflects not only the personal interest that Rubio \u2014 the first Hispanic to hold the nation\u2019s most senior Cabinet post \u2014 has in the region but also the Trump administration\u2019s intent to focus much of its foreign policy energy close to home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no accident that my first trip abroad as secretary of state will keep me in the hemisphere,\u201d Rubio wrote in The Wall Street Journal on Friday.",
      "Limiting immigration and fighting narcotics smuggling are major elements of that effort, but another key priority will be curbing China\u2019s growing influence in the Western Hemisphere, topped by reasserting U.S. control over the Panama Canal. The American-built canal was turned over to the Panamanians in 1999 and they object strongly to Trump's demand to hand it back.",
      "Mass migration, drugs and hostile policies pursued by Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela have wreaked havoc, Rubio said in the Journal opinion piece. \"All the while, the Chinese Communist Party uses diplomatic and economic leverage \u2014 such as at the Panama Canal \u2014 to oppose the U.S. and turn sovereign nations into vassal states.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Rubio's first stop on the five-nation tour Saturday will be Panama, whose president, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, says there will be no negotiation with the United States over ownership of the canal. He said he hoped Rubio\u2019s visit would instead focus on shared interests like migration and combating drug trafficking.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible, I can\u2019t negotiate,\u201d Mulino said Thursday. \"The canal belongs to Panama.\u201d",
      "Yet Rubio said he will make clear Trump's intent. In an interview Thursday with SiriusXM host Megyn Kelly, he said Trump's desire to retake control of the Panama Canal is driven by legitimate national security interests stemming from growing concerns about Chinese activity and influence in Latin America.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to address that topic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president\u2019s been pretty clear he wants to administer the canal again. Obviously, the Panamanians are not big fans of that idea. That message has been brought very clear.\u201d",
      "Chinese investments in ports and other infrastructure and facilities at both the Pacific and Caribbean ends of the canal are a cause for major concern, leaving Panama and the critical shipping route vulnerable to China, he said.",
      "Rubio added that \u201cif China wanted to obstruct traffic in the Panama Canal, they could,\u201d and that would be a violation of the 1977 treaty signed by former President Jimmy Carter under which the U.S. later ceded control.",
      "Despite Mulino's rejection of any negotiation over ownership, some believe Panama may be open to a compromise under which canal operations on both sides are taken away from the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports company that was given a 25-year no-bid extension to run them. An audit into the suitability of that extension is already under way and could lead to a rebidding process.",
      "What is unclear is whether Trump would accept the transfer of the concession to an American or European firm as meeting his demands, which appear to cover more than just operations.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, Trump is pushing on an open door,\u201d said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. \u201cBut it will depend on how his red lines are defined.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere's been a lot of heavy rhetoric and it will be up Rubio to clarify it,\u201d Berg said, adding that some kind of compromise was possible \u201cbut we\u2019ll have to see if he\u2019s really serious about taking it back. If that\u2019s the case then nothing short of that will satisfy him.\u201d",
      "Rubio will arrive in Panama on Saturday for meetings the following day with Mulino and the canal administrator. He will then travel to El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.",
      "His arrival will come just a day after the U.S. resumed visa processing at its embassy in Bogota, Colombia, which had been shut down Sunday after the Colombian government refused to accept two planeloads of Colombian deportees from the United States.",
      "Previous secretaries of state have often traveled abroad with so-called \u201cdeliverables\u201d \u2014 assistance packages, new cooperation initiatives and the like \u2014 that they can announce at each stop. However, such as with Colombia, Rubio may only be able to bring limited relief from a U.S. freeze on foreign assistance that Trump ordered pending a review of all programs.",
      "In Latin America, such programs have generally focused on policing, counternarcotics operations and efforts to stem illegal migration. Rubio has made provisions for certain programs offering life-saving assistance to be exempted from the funding pause, and waiver applications for programs in several of the countries he will be visiting are under review.",
      "Among the countries for which waivers for certain programs have been submitted are Panama, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and its neighbor, Haiti. Although Rubio will not be traveling to Haiti, the State Department has already allowed some $41 million in support of an international peacekeeping force there to go ahead."

      "Around the United States, colleges and universities are cautiously navigating the Trump administration's crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- In Boston, Northeastern University renamed a program for underrepresented students, emphasizing \u201cbelonging\u201d for all. In New Jersey, a session at Rutgers University catering to students from historically Black colleges had to be abruptly canceled. And around the U.S., colleges are assessing program names and titles that could run afoul of a Trump administration crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "New White House orders ban DEI policies in programs that receive federal money. Across higher education, institutions rely on federal funding for research grants, projects and contract work.",
      "As they figure out how to adapt, some schools are staying quiet out of uncertainty, or fear. President Donald Trump has called for compliance investigations at some schools with endowments over $1 billion.",
      "Others have vowed to stand firm.",
      "The president of Mount Holyoke College, a liberal arts school in Massachusetts, said she hopes colleagues in higher education will not capitulate to Trump\u2019s vision for the country. Danielle Holley said she believes Trump\u2019s orders are vulnerable to legal challenges.",
      "\u201cAnything that is done to simply disguise what we\u2019re doing is not helpful,\u201d said Holley, who is Black. \u201cIt validates this notion that our values are wrong. And I don\u2019t believe that the value of saying we live in a multiracial democracy is wrong.\u201d",
      "Trump has said DEI amounts to discrimination. To get colleges to shutter diversity programs, he said during the campaign he would \u201cadvance a measure to have them fined up to the entire amount of their endowment.\u201d",
      "Efforts by colleges to build the diversity they seek on campuses already had been constrained by the 2023 Supreme Court ruling that struck down affirmative action in higher education. Many colleges have said they are no less committed to recruiting students of color and helping all students succeed, even if strategies change or go by a different name.",
      "Northeastern changed the name of what had been called \u201cThe Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\u201d to \u201cBelonging in Northeastern,\u201d which it described as a \u201creimagined approach\u201d that embraces everyone at the school.",
      "\u201cWhile internal structures and approaches may need to be adjusted, the university\u2019s core values don\u2019t change. We believe that embracing our differences \u2014 and building a community of belonging \u2014 makes Northeastern stronger,\u201d university spokesperson Renata Nyul said.",
      "The orders are having a chilling effect at many colleges, said Paulette Granberry Russell, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education.",
      "\u201cWe are also seeing institutions preemptively reevaluating courses, programs and even administrative positions,\u201d she said. \u201cThe long-term consequences of such shifts could be profound, both for higher education and for the broader workforce and society.\u201d",
      "Some changes are outside the control of the colleges.",
      "At Rutgers University, professor Marybeth Gasman awoke Jan. 23 to a contractor's email telling her to cancel an upcoming conference on student internships. The funding, from the Department of Labor, was coming through the contractor and earmarked for DEI programs that were put on hold. About 100 students and staff from historically Black colleges and universities had planned to attend the online session.",
      "\u201cIt feels like a punch in the gut,\u201d said Gasman, who runs Rutgers\u2019 Center for Minority Serving Institutions, which was completing its final project on a $575,000 grant. With the grant frozen, she now hopes to raise the remaining $150,000 from other sources so they can finish the work and retain staff.",
      "Beyond scrutiny of their own policies and programs, many universities and faculty members also are worried about research grants.",
      "The White House this week paused federal grants and loans to conduct an ideological review to uproot progressive initiatives. It later reversed itself, but uncertainty remains over the future of research touching on issues related to diversity.",
      "California Polytechnic professor Cameron Jones said he is worried whether he would still get a $150,000 National Endowment for the Humanities grant to study the history of African descendants in early California, even though it\u2019s not a DEI grant. He also worries about the ban\u2019s effect on his students, especially students of color.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re worried that even indirect pressure might lead administrators to back off on programs that benefit students of color (and) first generation students,\u201d Jones said, \u201cand I\u2019m a white, cisgender, church-going man.\u201d",
      "Colleges already had experience with DEI restrictions in several Republican-led states, including Oklahoma, where Shanisty Whittington, 33, is studying political science at Rose State College.",
      "Compared to her first stint in college, more than a decade ago, she notices some concern \u201cabout being able to speak freely,\u201d along with \u201cjust a lot of confusion.\u201d",
      "One effect of the Oklahoma ban was the loss of a long-running networking program for female students interested in politics. Whittington, who is juggling work, school and parenting, recently applied for two jobs at the statehouse, but her applications went nowhere.",
      "\u201cIt would be great to have a tool that would help me be able to kind of get into that world and start introducing myself to people and getting to know them,\u201d she said.",
      "Sheldon Fields has been through a time like this before. He was a post-doctoral student studying AIDS/HIV prevention in the early 2000s when the conservative tide put his federally funded program on the chopping block. Instead of abandoning the work, he and his colleagues got creative.",
      "\u201cI had to write a whole grant about AIDS prevention without even talking about sex. We were able to do it because we shifted some language,\u201d said Fields, president of the National Black Nursing Association and associate dean for equity and inclusion at Penn State University\u2019s nursing school.",
      "Others will not be discouraged in the the current political climate, Fields said.",
      "\u201cPeople have spent their entire careers working on certain areas,\u201d said Fields, who has worked to diversity the nursing profession, which is overwhelmingly white and female. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to completely abandon them.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has targeted the rights of transgender people in executive orders in his first two weeks back in office",
      "President Donald Trump has targeted transgender and nonbinary people with a series of executive orders since he returned to office.",
      "He has done it with strong language. In one executive order, he asserted \u201cmedical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child\u2019s sex.\u201d",
      "That's a dramatic reversal of the policies of former President Joe Biden's administration \u2014 and of major medical organizations \u2014 that supported gender-affirming care.",
      "American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Sruti Swaminathan said that to be put into effect, provisions of the orders should first go through federal rulemaking procedures, which can be years long and include the chance for public comment.",
      "\u201cWhen you have the nation\u2019s commander-in-chief demonizing transgender people, it certainly sends a signal to all Americans,\u201d said Sarah Warbelow, the legal director at Human Rights Campaign.",
      "Things to know about Trump's actions:",
      "On Trump's first day back in office, he issued a sweeping order that signaled a big change in how his administration would deal with transgender people and their rights.",
      "It questions their existence by saying the government would recognize only two unchangeable sexes: female and male.",
      "The stated purpose is to protect women. \u201cEfforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being,\u201d the order says.",
      "The document calls on government agencies to use the new definitions of the sexes, and to stop using taxpayer money to promote what it calls \u201cgender ideology,\u201d the idea broadly accepted by medical experts that gender falls along a spectrum.",
      "Federal agencies have been quick to comply. Andrea Lucas, the acting chair of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, for example, announced this week that she would remove identity pronouns from employees' online profiles and disallow the \u201cX\u201d gender marker for those filing discrimination charges.",
      "\"Biology is not bigotry. Biological sex is real, and it matters,\u201d Lucas said in a statement.",
      "On Friday, information about what Trump calls \u201cgender ideology\u201d was removed from federal government websites and the term \u201cgender\u201d was replaced by \u201csex\u201d to comport with the order. The Bureau of Prisons stopped reporting the number of transgender incarcerated people and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention removed lessons on building supportive school environments for transgender and nonbinary students.",
      "Researchers have found less than 1% of adults identify as transgender and under 2% are intersex, or born with physical traits that don't fit typical definitions for male or female.",
      "In the order calling for a new federal definition of the sexes, Trump included some specific instances in which policy should be changed, including on passports.",
      "The State Department promptly stopped granting requests for new or updated passports with gender markers that don't conform with the new definition.",
      "The agency is no longer issuing the documents with an \u201cX\u201d that some people who identify as neither male nor female request and will not honor requests to change the gender markers between \u201cM\u201d and \u201cF\u201d for transgender people.",
      "The option to choose \u201cX\u201d was taken off online passport application forms Friday.",
      "The ACLU says it's considering a lawsuit.",
      "Trump's initial order called for transgender women in federal custody to be moved to men's prisons. Warbelow, from Human Rights Campaign, said her organization has received reports from lawyers that some have been.",
      "The Federal Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to requests for information about such moves.",
      "There have been at least two lawsuits trying to block the policy. In one, a federal judge has said a transgender woman in a Massachusetts prison should be housed with the general population of a woman's prison and continue to receive gender-affirming medical care for now.",
      "Trump set the stage for a ban on transgender people in the military, directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to come up with a new policy on the issue by late March.",
      "In the executive order, the president asserted that being transgender \u201cconflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one\u2019s personal life.\u201d",
      "Trump barred transgender service members in his first term in office, but a court blocked the effort.",
      "A group of active military members promptly sued over the new order this week.",
      "Trump called for halting the use of federal money to support gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth under 19 years old.",
      "The care in question includes puberty blocking drugs, hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgery, which is rare for minors.",
      "If fully implemented, the order would cut off government health insurance including Medicaid and TRICARE, which serves military families, for the treatments.",
      "It also calls on Congress to adopt a law against the care, though whether that happens is up to lawmakers.",
      "Twenty-six states already have passed laws banning or limiting gender-affirming care for minors, so the change could be smaller in those places.",
      "Some hospitals have paused some gender-affirming care for people under 19 following the executive order while they evaluate how it might apply to them.",
      "Another executive order this week seeks to stop \u201cradical indoctrination\u201d in the nation's school system.",
      "It calls on the Education Department to come up with a policy blocking schools from using federal funds to support students who are socially transitioning or using their curriculum to promote the idea that gender can be fluid, along with certain teachings about race.",
      "The order would block schools from requiring teachers and other school staff to use names and pronouns that align with transgender students' gender identify rather than the sex they were assigned at birth.",
      "Some districts and states have passed those requirements to prevent deadnaming, the practice of referring to transgender people who have changed their name by the name they used before their transition. It is widely considered insensitive, offensive or traumatizing."

The flight\u2019s final destination was Tijuana after a stop in Missouri. All six people aboard were from Mexico.",
      "The plane crashed Friday 30 seconds after takeoff from Northeast Philadelphia Airport, which primarily serves business jets and charter flights.",
      "Here's what to know about air medical transport:",
      "An air ambulance provides transportation to people in critical or life-threatening situations when a ground ambulance can\u2019t reach a patient or wouldn\u2019t get to them fast enough.",
      "They help boost a patient's odds of surviving and recovering, particularly in rural areas that don't have trauma or burn centers, according to a 2017 U.S. Government Accountability Office report.",
      "They've grown in importance as more rural hospitals have closed, according to a medical journal report from 2022.",
      "Air ambulances can be either a helicopter or a fixed wing aircraft. Helicopters are generally used to take patients between hospitals or from the scene of an accident to a hospital. The airplane versions fly longer distances between airports.",
      "Helicopters make up 74% of all air ambulances, according to the GAO report.",
      "The Philadelphia crash involved a Learjet 55, a small business jet.",
      "People with traumatic injuries, pregnancy complications, heart attacks, strokes and respiratory diseases are the most common users of air ambulances, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. More than 550,000 patients in the U.S. use them every year.",
      "In Hawaii, for example, they are frequently used to take patients from less populated islands, where health care is more limited, to Honolulu, where the state\u2019s biggest hospitals are located.",
      "The owner of the plane that crashed in Philadelphia, Jet Rescue, flew baseball Hall of Famer David Ortiz to Boston after he was shot in the Dominican Republican in 2019.",
      "Air ambulances will often have similar life-saving equipment like ventilators and blood transfusion devices. They will have stretchers and incubators.",
      "The Mayo Clinic, for example, said its air ambulances will have an external defibrillator, an external pacemaker and more than 60 medications.",
      "Paramedics and emergency medical technicians care for patients on board. Sometimes doctors and nurses are on board.",
      "The average air ambulance trip is 52 miles (84 kilometers) and costs between $12,000 and $25,000 per flight, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The medical condition of the patient and the staff on board can influence the price.",
      "Many insurers will pay what they believe to be a reasonable but sometimes they will disagree with the air ambulance provider and in these cases the patient may have to pay the difference.",
      "Insurance experts say big invoices are becoming more common as costs rise and coverage shifts.",
      "Yes, there were 87 accidents that led to 230 deaths from 2000 to 2020, according to a study in the journal Prehospital and Disaster Medicine. Nearly three-fourths of those accidents were on helicopters.",
      "Human factors that can include pilot error or disorientation, impairment and fatigue contributed to 87% of the fatal crashes.",

      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- A federal judge on Friday refused to stop what would be the fourth nitrogen gas execution in the U.S., saying the inmate had not proven his claims that the new method is unconstitutionally cruel and causes psychological terror.",
      "Chief District Judge Emily C. Marks rejected Demetrius Frazier\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction to either stop his execution on Thursday in Alabama or require that the state give him a sedative before administering the gas.",
      "Marks ruled Frazier had not met the \u201cexceedingly high\u201d legal bar required to win an injunction.",

      "Frazier is scheduled to be executed for the 1991 rape of murder of Pauline Brown. Prosecutors said Frazier broke into Brown\u2019s Birmingham apartment, raped her and shot her in the back of the head.",
      "Alabama became the first state to carry out executions with nitrogen gas when three inmates were put to death using the new method in 2024. The method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen.",

      "Marks ruled that the descriptions do not support a finding that any of the men \u201cexperienced severe psychological pain or distress over and above what is inherent in any execution.\u201d The state has maintained the movements by the inmates may have been involuntary or faked.",
      "However, the judge noted there could be a point that depriving an inmate of oxygen while conscious is unconstitutional.",
      "\u201cNotwithstanding the State\u2019s stubborn refusal at the evidentiary hearing to concede this point, the longer an inmate remains conscious while breathing in nitrogen during an execution, the more likely it becomes that the Eighth Amendment may be violated,\u201d Marks wrote.",
      "Before his conviction in Alabama, Frazier was convicted in Michigan for the 1992 murder of a 14-year-old girl. He was sentenced to life in prison. Michigan does not have the death penalty.",
      "Frazier\u2019s mother made a last-minute plea to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to intervene and request that Frazier be sent back to Michigan to serve the life sentence instead of being executed in Alabama.",
      "\u201cPlease bring my son back to Michigan. Please don\u2019t let Alabama kill my son if you can stop it,\u201d Carol Frazier wrote in the letter to Whitmer.",

      "There's no evidence that the White House effort to downsize government played any role in the collision, with shortages of air traffic controllers long predating Trump taking office. But those who\u2019ve worked in air safety say that those who try to dramatically shake up the federal workforce need to remember that lives are on the line.",
      "\u201cIt concerns me that there are people who don\u2019t want to reform or restructure institutions, they want to destroy institutions,\u201d said James Hall, who was head of the National Transportation Safety Board under President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. \u201cThe American people enjoy the safest aviation system in the world. I don\u2019t doubt there should be changes in government, but someone should remember the old adage to look before you leap.\u201d",

Trump and his supporters have made personal loyalty to the president a top priority in hiring new workers or keeping existing ones.",
      "During the campaign, Musk demanded the resignation of FAA administrator Michael Whitaker, who clashed with Musk over regulating SpaceX and stepped down the day before Trump took office. That left the FAA leaderless until Trump, at a Thursday press conference after the crash, named an acting head of the agency.",

He decried an FAA diversity policy that existed during his first administration.",
      "Though the Trump administration talks about the need to shed federal workers, the government has been desperate to hire air traffic controllers for nearly a decade. The FAA has struggled to keep up with the rapidly increasing number of commercial flights, even as there had been no fatal air accidents since 2009. Last year, Biden pushed for funding to hire 2,000 more controllers and announced the hiring of 1,800 controllers in September.",
      "An FAA report obtained by the AP said that air traffic control staffing at the airport Wednesday \u201cwas not normal,\u201d with one person doing the work normally assigned to two people at the time of the collision. A person familiar with the matter noted that the positions are regularly combined when controllers need to step away from the console for breaks, during shift changes or when air traffic is slow. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures.",
      "Don Kettl, an emeritus professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, warned that it is likely to become even harder to recruit those sorely needed air traffic controllers now.",

      "Before Trump returned to the White House, there were already about 2,500 Guard and Reserve forces consistently deployed to the border. Officials noted that given the length of the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico, it will take additional forces to help put large rolls of concertina wire barriers in place and provide support to the Border Patrol.",

      "Trump on Wednesday said his administration planned to send the \u201cworst criminal aliens\u201d to Guantanamo. He ordered the Pentagon to prepare to hold up to 30,000 migrants. He said some of the migrants can\u2019t be trusted to stay in their home countries once they are sent back.",

      "Some are on flashing video screens in places where they can easily be seen by children. The BBC has also seen adverts in Morrisons for a similar device called Ploom.",
      "Heated tobacco is different from vapes, which contain nicotine but no tobacco, and they are much less popular. But tobacco companies are keen to promote it as a new revenue stream to replace dwindling cigarette sales.",

      "CTSI says the issue has never been tested in court, so it cannot say conclusively that running them is illegal.",
      "\"The only people who can definitively test it are the courts. Now the courts are chocka. Trading Standards is very stretched, and I think that's probably the reason why you're seeing more and more of these ads,\" Kate Pike, lead officer for tobacco and vaping at CTSI, told the BBC.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:41:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.",
      "On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.",
      "Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement.",
      "Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.",
      "Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.",
      "1) Trade",
      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "EU citizens can stay in the UK for up to six months without needing a visa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20.",
      "Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.",
      "Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.",
      "The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country,",
      "So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.",
      "The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years.",
      "Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.",
      "However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.",
      "After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.",
      "However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.",
      "The future",
      "There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:00:14 GMT",
    "summary": "In choppy global seas, going for growth will require tricky navigation",
    "story": [
      "It has been a wild January for Rachel Reeves and frankly for economics in the UK and the world.",
      "When Labour swept to victory last summer, Reeves pledged she would be an \"iron\" chancellor, reining in public spending and improving the lives of working people through growing the economy. Without solid public finances, she argued, the government couldn't achieve any of its other aims.",
      "This month has tested that plan.",
      "It started off with a global bond market tantrum - UK borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years and the pound fell sharply.",
      "Some argued that Reeves's Budget decisions had made the UK more vulnerable to such shocks. The prime minister was forced to confirm Reeves had his backing after political opponents called for her resignation.",
      "The market turbulence sparked concerns that a verdict of sorts was being made on the chancellor.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this Parliament. That meant, the rise in global and UK debt interest costs would require some spending cuts.",
      "The message was sent out that the government, with its massive majority, could do and would do what it takes to keep to the self-imposed rules, which it said were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The markets have now recovered all their negative moves. Short term and long term government borrowing costs are all lower than at the beginning of the year.",
      "While the \"gilt crisis\" hyperbole was overdone, there have been consequences.",
      "From doom to promises of a boom",
      "The chancellor sped up an already planned \"drumbeat\" of pro-growth measures, culminating in this week's speech. Reeves's counsel of doom and warnings about black holes and pain has been replaced by a promise of an investment boom.",
      "She has vowed a new runway at Heathrow, visas for those with AI and life science skills and said she would ease the non-dom ban to allow a more generous phase out of tax benefits.",
      "Alongside this are plans to make it easier to build, delays to new rules on banks and the ousting of the boss of the competition regulator, which shows she's serious on growth. As Meatloaf might have scripted for her: \"I would do anything for growth\".",
      "But Reeves's plans are not yet a fully fledged growth plan. Her announcements signal that she is willing to take a series of political hits to foster long term growth.",
      "The chancellor will deploy the near total executive power from her party's commons majority to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Some outside advisers who support the chancellor say that stability is not enough, and nor is planning, and nor is deregulation.",
      "Reeves has not pledged any allocation of public money to these grand projects.",
      "Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye sounded a little coy after plans for a third runway were confirmed, saying they would not spend more money on it unless they really believed it was going to happen.",
      "\"This will take years, it will take what I call Churchillian resolve and lots of ingenuity but we can trust a government that will be with us for many years to deliver this,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Reeves's UK growth mission",
      "Reeves is focusing on a very specific type of growth - increasing the supply of goods and services. She believes a lack of this supply side growth has held back the UK, and she is on a mission to remove barriers, and open new markets.",
      "For example, Reeves is very concerned about small businesses who have told her they have given up on exporting to the EU, because post Brexit it is now easier to export to the US.",
      "At a meeting last week, one business told the chancellor that exports to Europe meant for Christmas, had only just arrived.",
      "The problem is that while the chancellor awaits a long term growth spurt, she has prioritised stabilising public finances through significant tax rises.",
      "In April, employers will be hit with an increase in national insurance payments and a higher minimum wage. These costs could be passed on in price rises meaning inflation - already higher than target at 2.5%, could remain sticky.",
      "Reeves would have preferred employers to squeeze pay settlements rather than raise prices or cut staff.",
      "Retail and hospitality businesses using low wage labour will be most impacted by the bumper rise in minimum wages. Downing Street insiders acknowledge that many domestic business bosses are \"grumpy\" as they put it.",
      "The concern is whether the impact will show up in higher unemployment. At last October's Budget, the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted extra government spending would help boost the economy and bring unemployment down to 4% this year. Some outside forecasters now think it will top 5%.",
      "It is a critical few months for the animal spirits in the economy to reignite.",
      "How far will she go?",
      "But how far is Rachel Reeves willing to push this pro-growth agenda?",
      "Will she follow the US away from the decarbonisation path to benefit from cheaper hydrocarbon prices promised by President Trump? Will she accede to construction industry requests to import foreign workers to meet the target to build 1.5 million homes?",
      "Will she push the Brexit reset to remove all the barriers to UK-EU trade in food and farm products, and many goods too? Will she offer Britain to the global tech and pharma industries as a deregulatory haven from the EU and US respectively?",
      "Taken at face value, she will do most of this, with big political consequences. Take the Brexit reset. Cabinet ministers at The World Economic Forum were delighted with the tone of the EU's new trade chief Maros Sefcovic in his interview with me, saying he was open to Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "The arrangement allows for tariff-free trade of some goods from across dozens of countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.",
      "But if the UK demanded effective single market treatment in certain sectors, it would need to follow the EU rule book in those areas. There would be counter asks, such as extending EU fishing arrangements in UK waters, and some sort of youth cultural exchange scheme.",
      "The need for delicate diplomacy",
      "Push is coming to shove on these issues, and the question is whether the chancellor's pro growth agenda is the overwhelming factor in making decisions. I suspect it is.",
      "However, that approach will require delicate diplomacy in the middle of a potential goods tariff war. If Trump follows through on his threat of a universal tariff then the G7 could decide to coordinate retaliatory tariffs. Does the UK join in?",
      "What if the US decides it wants its allies to help contain China's tech ascendancy? What if Trump wants to deter the UK from rebuilding free-flowing trade with the EU?",
      "The sudden emergence of China's AI expertise via DeepSeek underlines how important it is to be nimble. There was only one mention of China in the government's big AI paper earlier this month - in Science Secretary Peter Kyle's foreword.",
      "The pharma industry is lobbying the government to quietly open the door for relocation of key top talent into the UK, concerned about the Trump / Robert F Kennedy Jr approach to medicines regulation. Our leading universities are saying that for the first time since Brexit, it's easier to recruit some of the very best international scientists who are not keen to bring up their families in Trump's America.",
      "Trump's decision to abandon Biden's green subsidies also levels the playing field for net zero investment here.",
      "After a tumultuous start to the year, with the US administration threatening different tariffs almost every day, and tech giant shares falling over concerns they've been overvalued in the light of China's AI app DeepSeek, the UK remains a safe haven for investors.",
      "The self declared iron chancellor remains very attached to stability. But zero growth is a form of stability too. In choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some very tricky navigation - and it will make some big domestic political waves too.",

      "Sales of Apple iPhones dropped at the end of last year, as the tech firm's roll out of new artificial intelligence (AI) features was met with a lukewarm response.",

      "The company is also contending with other challenges, including a sales drop in China and the possibility its US sales will be hit by tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump.",
      "He has called for tariffs of up to 60% on products made in China, where Apple does much of its manufacturing.",
      "But the timing and full scope of those plans, which would put a new tax on imports into the US, remains highly uncertain.",

      "Apple has been gradually introducing AI features to its products, starting last year in the US.",
      "Investors have been hoping this will re-ignite sales, which have slowed as customers hold onto their phones and other products for longer.",
      "Mr Cook said Apple was expecting to push out the AI features to more languages in April.",
      "However, the features have not been without controversy. The AI's news roundup alerts came under fire earlier this month for making repeated mistakes in their summaries of news headlines - including ones from the BBC.",
      "The feature was eventually suspended following over a week of criticism.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr Cook said on Thursday Apple had seen a record number of purchases of new iPhones from people who already own older iPhones.",

    "summary": "The commodities giant went on trial in Switzerland over attempts to gain access to Angola's oil market.",
    "story": [
      "Switzerland's highest court has convicted the commodities trading giant Trafigura and one of its senior executives of bribery over payments made by the firm to gain access to Angola's lucrative oil market.",
      "In a landmark case, the court handed the company's British former chief operating officer Mike Wainwright, who has also competed as a racing driver, a 32-month jail sentence and fined the company $148m (\u00a3119m).",
      "This is the first time an entire company has been charged by Switzerland's highest court, and bribery convictions of senior staff are rare.",
      "Trafigura's lawyers said the company and Wainwright intended to appeal against the verdict, so the former executive was not jailed immediately.",
      "The case against Trafigura has had all the elements of a financial thriller: millions of dollars, shady middlemen and a chain of shell companies located in offshore havens like the Virgin Islands.",
      "Trafigura's strategy, the court heard, was to set up a complex payment web, through which an official with Angola's state oil company was paid almost $5m (\u00a34.02m; \u20ac4.81) between 2009 and 2011.",
      "Documents presented to the court by Swiss prosecutors showed payments authorised on Trafigura's own headed notepaper.",
      "The strategy appeared to work: over the next few years, the court heard, Angola signed contracts with Trafigura worth almost $144m (\u00a3115.93; \u20ac138.56).",
      "Trafigura, whose lawyers appeared bullish before the verdict, denied bribery. The company said its own compliance and anti-corruption measures had been independently assessed and found to be excellent.",
      "But the sheer weight of the evidence - which included dozens of documents, emails and memos - revealed a different picture: strict anti-corruption measures on paper but an intricate structure set up to evade those measures in reality. At the heart of it sat a middleman named \"Mr Non-Compliant\" in an anonymous Geneva office.",
      "The case will send a chill through commodity brokers worldwide but especially in Geneva, where Trafigura and many other commodity trading houses are headquartered.",
      "In an eerie coincidence, the night before the verdict was delivered, a fire broke out at the five star Hotel des Bergues - where, court documents showed, an Angolan official stayed at the expense of Trafigura in 2008.",
      "Swiss federal prosecutors hope the case will be a symbol that the old ways of doing business are finally over.",
      "They brought the charges to Switzerland's highest court, reserved for the worst crimes, such as terrorist offences.",
      "Trafigura now faces a large fine and Wainwright, who was in court for the verdict and denied the charges, was told he must serve at least one year of his 32 month sentence in jail.",
      "However, he was not immediately detained, pending the appeal he intends to lodge."

      "Twelve years later he would buy the platform for $44bn (\u00a338.1bn), reshape the algorithm, reinstate banned accounts, repurpose the policy around \"free speech\", and rename it X.",
      "He also fired thousands of staff - around 80% of the workforce.",
      "Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed \"the great X-odus\".",
      "One of their main concerns was the content that would be seen around their posts that users could screengrab and share.",
      "For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.",
      "More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy.",
      "In particular, his posts on the subject of grooming gangs put pressure on the government, which announced a review of the issue.",
      "\"There is no doubt that Musk's ownership of X is having an impact on public opinion in the UK,\" Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common tells BBC News.",
      "However, according to More In Common, only 16% of Brits believe his interventions are designed to achieve justice for victims, whereas 44% think he is doing it for attention, and his approval rating with the British public sits at -35.",
      "The changing tone of X and the controversy surrounding its owner have spurred some firms to leave the platform and others have pulled their advertising as well.",
      "At the end of 2023 firms including Apple, IBM and Disney paused advertisement on the platform.",
      "Others brands including Unilever and Mars were sued by Mr Musk, who accused them of unlawfully agreeing to boycott the site.",

      "One of the most recent departures from X was by the UK arm of BMW. In late January it announced it was no longer posting on X and directed people to its posts on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "There's no definitive way to know how many brands are choosing to leave or reduce their posts on the platform.",
      "When approached, X did not respond to the points raised in this article. But last year Mr Musk claimed X had 600 million monthly active users, and said the platform maintains its \"purpose is to serve the public conversation\".",
      "Mr Musk \"has been clear that X is willing to make trade-offs to adopt a more open, less moderated approach compared to Twitter\", says Goran Calic, visiting scholar at Harvard Business School.",
      "But leaving X can have negative consequences for organisations and their relationships with customers.",
      "\"When users leave, the impact depends on who is leaving and why. A local authority posting news provides significant value to the network. If such an account leaves, it can hurt both the platform and its users,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"Users protesting by leaving should weigh the broader social implications of staying versus exiting.\"",
      "For some organisations who need to get their message out quickly, X still has value that other competitors simply can't offer.",

    "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce expansion plans but some question the short-term benefits.",
    "story": [
      "The expansion of Heathrow Airport has been backed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is hoping investment in a third runway, along with a series of other transport projects, will drive economic growth in the UK.",
      "Reeves has said expansion of the UK's biggest airport is \"badly needed\" and could lead to 100,000 jobs.",
      "However opponents claim expanding the airport would lead to higher emissions and blight local communities with extra noise and pollution. Friends of the Earth has said it would be \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\".",
      "So is a third runway at Heathrow the right way to bring an immediate boost to the economy in any case?",
      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and - the airport's owner would argue - provides a vital avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",
      "Expanding the airport would, in theory, provide an avenue for growth that simply isn't there at the moment.",
      "The construction project itself - the biggest privately-funded infrastructure scheme in Europe - would create thousands of jobs.",
      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

      "However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"a third runway is badly needed\", adding the government \"cannot duck the decision any longer\".",
      "How would Heathrow Airport be expanded?",
      "Heathrow is already the UK's busiest airport, serving more than 80 million travellers a year with its four passenger terminals and two runways.",
      "A third runway would mean demolishing hundreds of homes, diverting rivers, and rerouting the M25 motorway between junctions 14 and 15 through a tunnel under the new runway.",
      "The number of flights, currently capped at 480,000 a year, could go up to 720,000 - or nearly 2,000 a day on average.",
      "Heathrow told the BBC that it would eventually be able to serve up to 140 million passengers a year once the third runway is in operation.",
      "The airport's owners, who include Saudi Arabia and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds and private equity firm Ardian, said the costs of expansion would be met by charging airlines for use of the larger airport.",
      "But after years of wrangling over the original plans, the initial cost estimate of \u00a314bn will need to be revised.",
      "When could a third runway open?",
      "Even with government backing, the formal planning process could take up to two years.",

      "Reeves has told the BBC she wants to see \"spades in the ground\" in the current Parliament and planes to start using the runway by 2035.",
      "Does Labour support a third runway?",
      "A third runway was first proposed by Gordon Brown's Labour government in 2009 but was only finally given the go-ahead by the Supreme Court in 2020.",
      "Several members of the current government - including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - voted against a Heathrow expansion when in opposition.",

      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Any aviation expansion will only be able to go ahead if it is consistent with our carbon budgets.\"",

      "Heathrow's boss, Thomas Woldbye, said in December he was waiting for a \"clear steer\" from the government before he could take plans forward.",
      "Could an extra runway help the economy?",
      "Some arguments for investing in the UK's transport infrastructure include a boost in growth, more jobs, and help for UK exports.",
      "Other European cities boast hub airports with more runways, including Amsterdam which serves fewer passengers than Heathrow but has five runways. Paris Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt have four.",
      "Currently, over \u00a3200bn of British trade passes through Heathrow annually. Heathrow has not devised figures on how much trade is expected to increase after a third runway, which it will do when it arrives at planning stage.",
      "The Airport Commission, an independent panel that examines the need for additional UK airport capacity, looked into the likely impact of Heathrow expansion and reported in 2015 that there would be benefits to the tune of \u00a361bn over 60 years.",
      "It said that included reduced fares, fewer delays, greater resilience, and the creation of up to 77,000 jobs.",
      "Forging ahead with Heathrow expansion would also send a clear message to foreign investors that the government means what it says about making growth its priority.",
      "However, some critics, including think tank the New Economics Foundation say the impact on growth is exaggerated, arguing more capacity in the south of England might simply displace activity from other regions.",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "What would the environmental impact be?",
      "Aviation is one source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and the industry is under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.",
      "Reeves pointed to progress on creating sustainable fuels, and electric planes. A third runway at Heathrow would also mean \"that instead of circling London, flights can land\" she added, meaning less fuel is used.",
      "But it is far from clear that those technologies will be enough to make up for the growing demand for air travel. Heathrow will have to prove that its plan meets the governments net-zero by 2050 targets in any planning application.",
      "Last year the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions, the Climate Change Committee, warned that the UK should not go ahead with airport expansion without a framework in place to manage capacity across the country.",

      "It\u2019s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system \u2013 and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free.",
      "The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today\u2019s technology landscape.",
      "In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master\u2019s thesis. \u201cMy concern was graduating,\u201d he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project.",
      "Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark.",
      "\u201cWe're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,\u201d he says.",
      "While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That\u2019s not just because they\u2019ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.",
      "But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.",
      "Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work after all.",
      "Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the \u201ckernel maintainers are aging\u201d.",
      "Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK\u2019s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades.",
      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",
      "This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it\u2019s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to help STEM talent flight,\u201d Miss Brock adds. \u201cBecause people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they\u2019re in.\u201d",
      "Degioanni is more sanguine. Even if there\u2019s \u201cprobably less visceral enthusiasm\u201d for the concept of open source, he says, the fundamental idea of being able to modify software is now a given.",
      "And, he continues, \u201cI've worked with open source my whole life. I've created my own projects. I've seen people join the projects that I created. I've seen people start their own open source projects.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, he says, there is a \u201cjoy, especially for a young person\u201d in creating software, seeing it being used and sparking a community.",
      "\u201cThat feeling doesn't get old,\u201d he says. Even if the pioneers who popularized the earliest open source projects do.",

      "President Donald Trump has said he thinks the US will gain control of Greenland, underlining his persistent claim on the Arctic island, on one occasion pointing to \"economic security\" as the reason. While the autonomous Danish territory has been quick to say it isn't for sale, its vast and mostly untapped mineral resources are in great demand.",

      "\"Those very high pointy mountains, it's basically a gold belt,\" gestures Eldur Olafsson, the chief executive of mining company Amaroq Minerals.",
      "After sailing for two hours we stepped ashore at a remote valley beneath Nalunaq mountain, where the firm is drilling for gold.",
      "It's also scouring the surrounding mountain range and valleys, hunting for other valuable minerals, having snapped up exploration licences spanning over 10,000 sq km (3,861 sq miles).",
      "\"We're looking for copper, nickel, and rare earths,\" says the Icelandic boss. \"This is uncharted, and still has the potential to have multiple big deposits.\"",
      "The base camp is a cluster of mobile buildings and bright orange accommodation tents housing more than 100 staff, including Greenlanders, Australians, and British former coal miners. From there a road climbs up the valley, and we drive by car into the gold mine, following a dark tunnel upwards inside the mountain.",
      "\"See here!\" says Mr Olafsson pointing to a seam of white quartz and a thin dark line. \"Gold, gold, gold. All the way over. Isn't that extraordinary?\"",

      "The mine, which Amaroq bought in 2015, had operated for most of the preceding decade, but closed due to then falling gold prices, and high operating costs.",
      "Amaroq is confident that the mine will now be profitable. And it plans to ramp up production this year, where it has built a brand new processing plant to crush the ore and refine the precious metal into gold bars.",
      "\"We can either walk off site every month with a suitcase of gold, versus a 30,000 tonne ship [carrying the ore],\" explains Mr Olafsson.",
      "He says that Greenland presents an unrivalled opportunity because its huge mineral reserves are largely untouched.",
      "\"It can be the supplier of all the minerals the Western world will need for decades,\" adds Mr Olafsson. \"And that is a very unique position.\"",
      "Yet currently there are just two active mines on the entire island.",
      "Greenland is a self-governing territory that is part of Denmark, but controls its own natural resources.",
      "It's endowed with the eighth largest reserves of so-called rare earth elements, which are vital for making everything from mobile phones to batteries and electric motors. It also has large amounts of other key metals, such as lithium and cobalt.",
      "There is oil and gas too, but new drilling is banned, while deep-sea mining has also been ruled out.",
      "Christian Kjeldsen, director of Greenland's Business Association, says that the global \"geopolitical situation right now is driving interest in the world's biggest island\".",
      "He points to China having the world's largest reserves of rare earth metals, while the West wants to secure alternative supplies.",

      "Up to Greenland to decide its future, Danish PM tells Trump",
      "Trump ramps up threats to gain control of Greenland and Panama Canal",
      "That has fuelled a growing focus among Western nations to get access to Greenland's minerals. China has also been keen to get involved, but its presence is limited.",
      "Reuters recently reported that the US lobbied an Australian mining firm not to sell Greenland's biggest rare earth project to potential Chinese buyers.",
      "Greenland's Minister for Business, Trade and Raw Materials, Naaja Nathanielsen, says that interest in the territory's minerals has \"absolutely increased within the last five years or so\".",
      "She adds: \"We're used to being a hotspot for the climate crisis. We want to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Permits have now been given for 100 blocs across Greenland, where companies are searching for viable deposits. British, Canadian and Australian mining firms are the biggest foreign licence holders, while Americans hold just one.",
      "But there are many more steps before these sites become potential mines.",
      "Yet while Greenland may be sitting on mineral riches, any \"gold rush\" continues to be slow to materialise.",
      "The economy, which has an annual GDP of just over $3bn (\u00a32.4bn), is still driven by the public sector and fishing. And the territory also relies on an annual $600m subsidy from Denmark.",
      "Greenland's politicians hope that mining revenues will reduce reliance on the annual $600m subsidy from Denmark, and help boost independence efforts. But in the meantime Greenland is making more money from tourism.",
      "Officially mining is still important for independence, says Javier Arnaut, head of Arctic Social Sciences at Greenland University. \"But in practical terms, you can see that there are very few mining licenses awarded.\"",
      "Ms Nathanielsen concedes that while there are partnerships being developed with the US and EU, \"we still have not seen large amounts of money flowing into this sector\". She hopes that there will be another three to five mines operating within the next decade.",
      "However mining is not easy in Greenland because of its remote geography and weather. It's the world's largest island and 80% of it is covered by an ice sheet. It has rugged mountains and no roads between settlements.",
      "\"It's an arctic terrain,\" says Jakob Kl\u00f8ve Keiding, from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, which has mapped the territory's deposits. \"We have problems with harsh conditions in terms of the climate and limited infrastructure. So it's quite expensive to open a mine.\"",
      "Those high costs, coupled with low global metal prices, have held back investors.",
      "Others blame red tape for the sector's slow growth. The territory has strict environmental regulations and social impact requirements, and getting permits can take time.",
      "Ms Nathanielsen maintains that most communities do support mining, and that it boosts local economies. \"They [overseas miners] are shopping in the local shop. They're employing local employees. They're chartering a local boat or helicopter,\" she says.",
      "Yet in the south's biggest town, Qaqortoq, resident Heidi Mortensen M\u00f8ller is sceptical whether new mines will lead to employment for locals. \"When they say they're going to add jobs, who are they talking about?\"",
      "Jess Berthelsen, head of local labour union, SIK, says that many people think mining income \"will leave the country\", and not benefit Greenland. But he supports the growth of the sector. \"Greenland needs more income and to earn money from other ways than fishing.\"",
      "It's unclear how Trump's latest gambit on Greenland will play out. However, the territory's prime minister Mute Egede said earlier this month that \"we need to do business with the US\" and that it was \"doors open in terms of mining\".",
      "Mr Kjeldsen from the business association, hopes it will be bring \"much needed investment\" to the sector. \"On the other hand, if the uncertainty surrounding the signals from Trump drag on for a longer period, there is a risk that this might impact the investment environment negatively.\"",

    "story": [
      "Cardiff University has confirmed plans to cut 400 full-time jobs amid a funding shortfall.",
      "The cost-cutting proposals could also involve course closures, as well as department mergers, with nursing, music and modern languages among the subjects facing cuts.",
      "The Cardiff University and College Union (UCU) called the measures \"cruel and unnecessary\" and said it would fight plans for compulsory redundancies.",
      "The university said it would only make compulsory redundancies \"if absolutely necessary\".",
      "Fears for hundreds of uni jobs due to funding gap",
      "Drop in foreign student visas worrying for UK universities",
      "Why are university tuition fees going up?",
      "Vice-Chancellor Professor Wendy Larner defended the decision to cut  jobs, saying the university would have become \"untenable\" without drastic reforms.",
      "The job role cuts are only a proposal, she said, but insisted the university needed to \"take difficult decisions\" due to the declining international student applications and increasing cost pressures.",
      "Prof Larner said the university is not alone in its financial struggles, with most UK universities grappling with the \"broken\" funding system.",
      "She acknowledged that the news would have been \"challenging and difficult\" for staff to hear, but added that all students on current degrees at the university would be able to complete their degrees.",
      "Dr Joey Whitfield from Cardiff UCU said they were \"absolutely shell shocked\" by the \"cruel and unnecessary\" cuts.",
      "\"I've had colleagues in tears. They'll damage our members, our students, the city, and Wales as a whole,\" he added.",
      "He said union members \"are prepared to fight any compulsory redundancies tooth and nail\".",
      "A Welsh government spokesperson said they were \"very disappointed that nursing courses form part of these proposals\" and that it was \"working urgently\" to ensure the same number of nurses are trained in Wales.",
      "They said they understood \"the serious concern\" the announcement will cause.",
      "\"Universities across the UK are facing a challenging financial period due to a range of factors and we expect all institutions to work with trade unions, staff and students on any proposals,\" they added.",
      "The Royal College of Nursing said the proposal to shut the school of nursing \"has the potential to threaten the pipeline of registered nurses into the largest health board in Wales\".",
      "Ruth Jones MP, Chair of the Welsh Affairs Committee, compared the job cuts to a \"canary in a coalmine\" for the severe financial pressures facing universities across the UK.",
      "\"It is not only academics and students who will suffer from these cuts, but the wider community in south Wales,\" Ms Jones added.",
      "Conservative Senedd member Natasha Asghar MS, said she feared \"that these concerns will be repeated across our universities in Wales\".",
      "Plaid Cymru's education spokesperson, Cefin Campbell MS said the job losses would have \"a devastating impact\", damaging Wales' \"reputation as a nation of learning\".",
      "Madison Hutchinson, Cardiff University Student Union president, said they \"want to express our unwavering support with all students, and solidarity to staff who may be impacted\".",
      "\"We have had a commitment from the university that all impacted students will be communicated with tomorrow,\" she added.",
      "The subjects and programmes being cut also include ancient history and religion and theology.",
      "The university said the proposals would also include the following subject mergers:",
      "Chemistry, earth sciences and physics being merged to create the School of Natural SciencesComputer science and maths merging to become the School of Data ScienceSocial sciences, geography and planning merged to become the School of Human and Social SciencesEnglish, communication and philosophy, Welsh and remaining elements of history, archaeology and religion and modern languages merged into the School of Global Humanities",

      "The consultation will run for three months, with final plans for approval expected to be considered by University Council in June 2025.",
      "Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones, 57, professor of ancient history at Cardiff University, said the news was \"devastating\" and \"shocking\".",
      "He said \"major sections of our teaching\" in the College of Humanity would be lost, with his own department being \"taught out so it won't exist any longer\".",
      "\"How on earth are we to continue trying to teach over the next few years, with a sword of Damocles hanging over our heads?\" he added.",
      "Kristin Milward, from London, studies criminology and sociology, and said hearing the announcement was \"scary\".",
      "\"My lecturer just now was saying he's not sure about his job security - regardless of not being one of the university courses on the chopping block, it is very scary knowing I could be gone at any moment,\" she said.",
      "\"You don't expect to enrol, pay all this money and have this happen to you,\" she added.",
      "The 20-year-old said her housemate studies nursing and does not know what she will do afterwards, but they are all worried about their future.",
      "\"Cardiff is a really great place to be for uni, I really enjoy it and it would be a shame to have people not be able to stay here anymore,\" she said.",
      "The university had previously said it had to take action to address a \u00a330m black hole in its budget with the pressure of increased costs and falling international student numbers affecting the whole higher education sector.",
      "An offer of voluntary severance between June and September 2024 was taken up and approved for 155 staff and a second round closed earlier this month.",
      "The Welsh government has said that university tuition fees will rise to \u00a39,535 a year from September 2025, in line with an increase in fees for English universities announced by the UK government.",

      "Cardiff University is far from alone - Newcastle University, the University of East Anglia and the University of Kent are just some of the institutions looking at how to deal with their multi-million pound financial deficits.",
      "Almost three quarters of universities could be spending more money than they have coming in next year \u2013 with a total deficit of \u00a31.6bn predicted -  according to the regulator of higher education in England.",
      "There are many reasons behind the increasing black holes, including the fact that international student numbers are down, partly due changes in visa rules.",
      "Tuition fees increased in England in September and for the last two years in Wales, but this followed years of frozen fees.",
      "Further fee increases remain uncertain, but even if tuition fees continue to rise, there is concern it isn't enough to stop universities falling into their overdrafts.",

    "summary": "The children's commissioner says children often made impulsive decisions to become involved in the riots.",
    "story": [
      "Children who took part in riots last summer were primarily driven by curiosity and the \"thrill of the moment\", rather than far-right ideology and social media misinformation, the children's commissioner for England has said.",
      "Deep distrust in the police and a lack of opportunities were also behind some children's decisions to take part, a new report suggests.",
      "Violence broke out across the country in the days and weeks following the murders of three children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport in July 2024.",
      "A government spokesperson said the mobilisation of the police and criminal justice system to bring perpetrators of all ages to justice was vital in restoring order.",
      "But Dame Rachel de Souza told BBC Radio 5 Live that judges should have the power to wipe criminal records clean where youths had \"done their time for some very silly things\".",
      "Her report said her interviews with children charged over the disorder \"paints a more complex picture\" about why they had become involved.",
      "'Real regret'",
      "Dame Rachel told BBC One's Breakfast programme children who had turned up after hearing about the riots had been \"egged on\" by \"adults who were extremist and were really there to do terrible things\".",
      "Many of the children she had spoken to had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and felt they had acted impulsively.",
      "\"One little boy said, 'I broke windows. The next day, I drove past those windows on the bus and I felt terrible.' There was real regret,\" she said.",
      "The children's commissioner's findings come a week after Axel Rudakubana pleaded guilty to the murders of Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe.",
      "He was sentenced to 52 years in prison for the \"meticulously planned rampage\" in which 10 other people, mostly children, were also stabbed on 29 July last year.",
      "False rumours had spread online in the hours after the attack that the perpetrator had been a migrant, and a violent protest took place close to the scene the following day.",
      "Riots in which mosques and hotels housing migrants were attacked soon spread to many other towns and cities across England and Northern Ireland.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the violence at the time as \"far-right thuggery\" and promised that those involved would \"face the full force of the law\".",
      "The children's commissioner's report said at least 147 children had been arrested and 84 charged since the riots, with some as young as 12 sentenced over their involvement.",
      "Dame Rachel said her interviews with 14 of those \"unheard and overlooked\" children \"raise some really serious questions about childhood in England and why our children feel so disaffected and disempowered\".",
      "However, she said her report \"does not excuse criminality\".",
      "\"As children's commissioner, it's my duty to listen to children, regardless of their circumstances,\" she said.",
      "\"The harm caused by these children's actions is undeniable. Many \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the children acknowledged the need for accountability and consequences for their actions.",
      "\"Today's findings offer no simple solutions but paints a more complex picture than has been debated following the riots. However, it is one that we must grapple with in order to create a more positive experience of childhood.\"",
      "Her report suggested that previous negative interactions and a deep-seated mistrust of the police had fuelled the actions of children, who viewed the riots as an opportunity to retaliate against the police.",
      "Poverty and a lack of opportunities in their communities also formed the background of their involvement, the report said.",
      "Dame Rachel criticised the \"unusually severe and swift\" charges which followed the riots, which she said overlooked children's potential for rehabilitation.",
      "She added that variation between regions in terms of children's outcomes amounted to a \"postcode lottery\" for those who became involved with the youth justice system.",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"The senseless violence we saw on our streets after the tragic loss of Bebe, Elsie and Alice brought shame to our nation, and the mobilisation of our police and entire criminal justice system to bring perpetrators of all ages to justice was vital in restoring order. There is no justification for the violence which they endured last year.",
      "\"More widely, work is taking place across government \u2013 underscored by our Plan for Change \u2013 to break down the barriers to opportunity and ensure that every child has the best start in life.\""

    "story": [
      "A group of 49 schools in a borough of the West Midlands have sent letters to parents asking them to \"pause\" before buying smartphones for their children.",
      "It is being led by Tom Beveridge, the headteacher of Alderbrook School in Solihull, which has recently introduced a voluntary phone hand-in scheme for Year 7s.",
      "More than half the year group have handed in their phones, with some pupils telling the BBC they already felt \"less stressed\".",
      "By the age of 12, 97% of children have their own phone, according to the regulator Ofcom.",
      "Mr Beveridge said in recent years the school had seen some of the harms from excessive smartphone use and wanted to take action.",
      "\"When we do see incidents of students being unkind or even bullying it is almost always invariably linked to some form of online activity\", he said.",
      "He added that phones had an impact on the mental health of pupils and were a \"distraction from learning\" even when kept in a bag or a pocket.",
      "The school has bought mobile phone storage lockers so Year 7 students can safely store their phones during the day.",
      "Mr Beveridge said when they introduced the scheme just before Christmas, 10 pupils handed in their phones.",
      "Within a month more than half the year group had chosen to drop them off at the start of the day.",
      "Among them is Mila, who said she \"felt better\" and \"less stressed\" without the worry of it going off in class.",
      "Another pupil, Elliot, said his phone was a \"really big distraction\" and he had chosen to hand it in so he did not have to \"think about it all day\".",
      "At the start of the next school year, the scheme will be compulsory for Year 7s and it may be rolled out to older year groups as well.",
      "Mr Beveridge said headteachers across Solihull wanted to take \"collective action\" on the issue, which is why they had written a letter to parents.",
      "It is not about being negative about technology, he added, but about making sure that everyone was aware of the risks.",
      "\"The hope is that sooner or later it will be the social norm not to buy a smartphone until young people are at least 14, maybe older.",
      "\"Then parents won't feel so much pressure,\" he said.",
      "But at the moment parents, like Afifa Tufail, do feel a lot of pressure.",
      "The mother has a son and daughter at Alderbrook School in Year 7 and Year 9.",
      "They have \"dumb\" phones but she said she worried about them being \"left out or standing out\" for not having a smartphone.",
      "She said the letter from Mr Beveridge had been \"really reassuring\".",
      "On Tuesday night the school is hosting an information evening for 300 parents, where a panel of experts will explain the risks of overuse of smartphones.",
      "Among those speaking will be Harriet, who is in Year 13 at Alderbrook Sixth Form.",
      "She said she had had a phone since she was 11 years old, describing it as a \"necessity\".",
      "But the 17-year-old said they were a \"huge distraction\" and said it was \"crazy\" that she had to use an app to lock her phone and all her apps when she was revising.",
      "She said she had also experienced the \"darker side\" of the technology when last year a man had airdropped inappropriate photos to her at a bus stop.",
      "\"As girls you have to deal with that added pressure,\" she said.",
      "The event had been partly organised by Claire Smith, the principal of nearby Tudor Grange Academy, which has been a phone-free school for many years.",
      "The policy ensured students were safe, that they could socialise and play and that they were not distracted from learning, said Mrs Smith.",
      "She added that she wanted to be involved in the event to open up the conversation beyond schools to families and the community.",
      "She said parents felt peer pressure to buy smartphones for their children because it was becoming the norm for them to have one.",

    "story": [
      "The Grammys are music's biggest night, both literally and figuratively.",
      "The ceremony, which takes place in LA on Sunday night, runs for a staggering eight hours, attracting the biggest stars in pop, rock, country and hip-hop.",
      "Organisers will hand out 94 awards, recognising everything from best pop album to best choral performance.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift have both confirmed their attendance, as they square off in the album of the year category for the first time since 2010 (Swift won on that occasion, fact fans).",
      "There'll also be performances from Charli XCX, Sabrina Carpenter, Benson Boone, Shakira, Stevie Wonder, Teddy Swims and Raye - and an in memoriam tribute to Thriller producer Quincy Jones.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about the ceremony.",
      "1) Who's going to win album of the year?",
      "The big question of the night is whether Beyonc\u00e9 will finally win album of the year, after four previous losses in the category?",
      "During last year's ceremony, her husband Jay-Z addressed the oversight, telling the audience: \"I don't want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn't work.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's latest record, Cowboy Carter, is a wildly ambitious attempt to contextualise and commemorate the black roots of country music. It's the sort of thing that delights Grammy voters, who traditionally prefer albums that elevate America's musical history over contemporary, cutting-edge productions.",
      "But the album's excessive length - including a few weaker tracks in its latter half - could count against it.",
      "Billie Eilish is currently the bookmakers' favourite with her third album Hit Me Hard and Soft. Mixing passionate power ballads with violent electronic shifts and hip-hop swagger, it marks a new evolution in the star's songwriting partnership with her brother, Finneas.",
      "Charli XCX's Brat is a career-defining pop record that became a cultural phenomenon. The best-reviewed album of 2024, it's probably too abrasive for the Grammys' more conservative voters, but that's their loss.",
      "And you'd have to be crazy to ignore Taylor Swift. Her 11th album, The Tortured Poets Department, was the biggest-seller of last year; a fact that will undoubtedly be taken into account, even if the record is one of her weaker efforts.",
      "If she wins, Swift will collect her fifth album of the year trophy - more than any other artist in Grammy history.",
      "2) What about the other big prizes?",
      "One of the year's most stacked categories is record of the year - better understood as \"best single\".",
      "Aside from a rogue nomination for The Beatles (see below), the shortlist reflects a stellar year for pop music, with Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso and Charli XCX's 360 up against Beyonc\u00e9's Texas Hold 'Em and Billie Eilish's Birds Of A Feather.",
      "But the front-runner is Kendrick Lamar's Not Like Us. A furious take-down of his rap nemesis, Drake, it's as catchy as it is legally contentious. If it wins, it would be only the second hip-hop single to win the category, following Childish Gambino's This Is America in 2019.",
      "In the parallel song of the year prize - which recognises achievement in songwriting - the smart money is on Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga's Die With A Smile.",
      "Both artists are perennial Grammy favourites, and their virtuoso ballad will be catnip to voters.",
      "Their competition includes Shaboozey's A Bar Song (Tipsy), which was America's longest-running number one single of 2024. However, the fact that it's based on a previous hit (J-Kwon's Tipsy) is likely to count against it.",
      "Chappell Roan's breakout single Good Luck Babe is another strong contender, notable for its soaring high notes and a piercing lyric that skewers internalised homophobia. Billie Eilish's gossamer ballad Birds of a Feather is a similar masterclass in songcraft - making this category one of the hardest to predict.",
      "By contrast, the coveted best new artist prize is pretty much a two-way split between Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter, both of whom established a dominant chart presence in 2024 after years on the pop sidelines.",
      "That's bad news for the sole British nominee, six-time Brit Award winner Raye. But at least she's in good company, alongside breakout rap star Doechii and big-hearted pop singer Teddy Swims.",

      "The record is currently held by Santana, who got nine trophies for his album Supernatural in 2000 (coincidentally, the same year that Beyonc\u00e9 received her first Grammy nomination, as part of Destiny's Child).",
      "And if Cowboy Carter doesn't take home best album, Beyonc\u00e9 still breaks a record, for the most nominations in that category without a win.",

      "The current record holders, in case you were wondering, are Oklahoma band The Flaming Lips. In 2007, they won best rock instrumental performance for the magnificently-titled The Wizard Turns on the Giant Silver Flashlight and Puts On His Werewolf Moccasins.",
      "4) Who votes for the Grammys?",
      "More than 13,000 members of the Recording Academy vote for the Grammys every year - including musicians, producers, lyricists, and even the people who write CD liner notes.",
      "To qualify, they must be currently working in the music industry, and pay an annual subscription of $150 (\u00a3120). All former winners are also eligible to vote.",
      "Every member is allowed to vote in up to 10 categories across three fields, such as rock, classical and R&B. They are encouraged only to vote in genres where their expertise lies.",
      "Additionally, every member, regardless of their background, gets to vote for the six biggest awards of the night. Those are: album of the year, record of the year, song of the year, best new artist, songwriter of the year and producer of the year.",
      "The 2025 awards recognise music released between 16 September 2023 and 30 August, 2024. The winners are not revealed until the ceremony.",
      "5) How did The Beatles get nominated?",
      "The Beatles might have broken up 55 years ago, but they're up for two prizes on Sunday: record of the year and best rock performance.",
      "Both nominations recognise Now and Then, a song that John Lennon demoed in the 1970s, and which was finally completed by his surviving bandmates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr last year.",
      "Grammy voters, with their eyes firmly trained on the past, rarely miss an opportunity to reward the Beatles. Eight years ago, for example, the band's documentary Eight Days a Week: The Touring Years beat Beyonc\u00e9's groundbreaking Lemonade for best music film.",
      "In some ways, that's correcting an historic wrong. In their prime, the Beatles were nominated for record of the year four times - for I Want to Hold Your Hand, Yesterday, Hey Jude and Let It Be - but lost every time.",
      "A win in 2025 would prove that Beatlemania never fades - but voters may be put off by The Beatles' use of machine learning (a form of artificial intelligence), which was used to clean up Lennon's scratchy old cassette recordings.",
      "The Recording Academy's rules on AI say that \"only human creators\" can win Grammys, and that \"the human authorship component of the work submitted must be meaningful\".",
      "That's true in the case of Now And Then, but many creators remain sceptical of the technology.",
      "6) How will the California wildfires affect the ceremony?",
      "Quite a lot.",
      "All the hoopla surrounding the Grammys has gone. No pre-parties, no after-parties. Everything except the ceremony itself has been cancelled. All the money that would have been spent on champagne and vol au vents is being funnelled into relief efforts.",
      "The Recording Academy and its affiliated MusiCares charity have also set up a Fire Relief fund, which has so far pledged more than $3.2 million (\u00a32.6 million) in emergency aid to assist music professionals affected by the fires.",
      "And the telecast itself will reflect the devastation, with segments honouring the first responders who risked their lives to tackle the inferno and protect the vulnerable.",
      "\"We'll still have performances, we'll still have awards and honour music,\" Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason, Jr told Variety magazine.",
      "\"But you'll know that something's happened, and you'll know that we're using music to do good.\"",
      "As part of that effort, Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga will \u201ca special tribute to the city of Los Angeles and those affected by the wildfires,\u201d the Grammys announced on Saturday.",
      "7) Is there a list of Grammy performers?",
      "You betcha. So far, the list includes:",

      "Lainey Wilson",
      "Stevie Wonder",
      "St. Vincent",
      "8) How can I watch in the UK?",
      "The ceremony is split into two parts, with the first 80 awards distributed during what's called the \"premiere ceremony\" at 12:30 in Los Angeles / 20:30 in London on Sunday.",
      "It's often worth tuning in. The winners in the more obscure categories are less polished and more excited about winning, and the performances are looser and, dare I say it, more musical than the grandiose set pieces you'll see later.",
      "You can watch the whole thing on the Recording Academy's YouTube channel, and on live.grammy.com.",
      "That's also where you want to go to watch red carpet coverage, which kicks off at 15:00 in Los Angeles / 23:00  in the UK.",
      "Finally, the main show kicks off at 17:00 Los Angeles / 01:00 Monday in the UK. It's  broadcast live in the US on CBS and streamed internationally on Paramount Plus. Speeches and select performances are usually uploaded to YouTube the following day.",
      "9) Does any of this really matter?",
      "Of course not! But have you seen what's going on everywhere else in the world?",
      "Musicians, however take the Grammys very seriously indeed. A big win can boost album sales and bump you up festival bills.",
      "That said, the awards themselves are notoriously ridiculous. According to legend, they were created in 1959 as a panicked reaction to the popularity of rock 'n' roll. Record companies hoped that by highlighting \"good\" music, they'd steer the public away from Elvis's swivelling hips.",
      "As if to illustrate that point, they didn't hand Mr Presley a trophy until 1968, and even that was for \"best sacred performance\", recognising his first gospel album, How Great Thou Art.",
      "Since then, the awards have remained wilfully arbitrary, woefully out of touch, or a combination of the two.",
      "Famously, The Beatles won more awards after they split up than they did together; and there were no rap categories until 1989.",
      "And if anyone still thinks that Herbie Hancock's jazz tribute to Joni Mitchell was the best album of 2008 - the year of Amy Winehouse's Back To Black and Kanye West's Graduation - I'd be interested to hear your arguments.",
      "So if Beyonc\u00e9 doesn't win on Sunday (or even if she does) don't let it affect your enjoyment of her music."

      "Combs has been in jail since September after an initial indictment charged him with racketeering, sex trafficking by force, and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "On Thursday, the indictment was updated to add two more victims, although no new charges were added to the case.",
      "The musician, 55, has strenuously denied all the accusations against him, including the federal criminal case and more than 30 separate civil lawsuits.",
      "In response to the superseding indictment, his lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said the prosecution's case \"remains flawed\".",

      "In the new filing, prosecutors allege that Combs \"used force, threats of force, and coercion, to cause victims, including but not limited to three female victims\" to engage in commercial sex acts.",

      "They have also expanded the list of narcotics the musician allegedly used to keep his victims \"obedient and silent\" - adding methamphetamine and psychedelic mushrooms to the previously cited cocaine, oxycodone and ketamine.",

      "Born in Hampstead in December 1946, she was known for hits like As Tears Go By, which reached the UK top 10 in 1964, and for starring roles in films including 1968's The Girl On A Motorcycle.",
      "She was also famously the girlfriend of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger in the 1960s, inspiring songs such as Wild Horses and You Can't Always Get What You Want. After a period of heroin addiction in the 70s, she resurrected her career with the classic album Broken English.",

      "Her story is a remarkable portrait of the rock and roll era.",

      "An international hit, her version was light and breathy, delivered in a folk-pop style that was to become her trademark during the swinging 60s.",
      "With her eponymous debut album and 1966's North Country Maid, she became part of the \"British Invasion\" of the US pop charts.",

      "She also played God in two episodes of the sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, and the devil in William Burroughs' and Tom Waits' musical, The Black Rider.",
      "But music was where her heart lay. Her penultimate album, 2018's Negative Capabilty, was a meditation on ageing, loneliness and grief \u2013 inspired partly by the death of her old friend, and fellow Rolling Stones' paramour Anita Pallenberg; and partly by the terror attacks on the Bataclan nightclub in her adopted home of Paris.",
      "Taking her full circle, the album included a raw and emotional re-recording of As Tears Go By that reduced everyone in the studio to tears, according to producer Rob Ellis.",
      "Faithfull received the World Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 Women's World Awards, and was made a commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the government of France.",
      "Faithfull's long-time friend, the BBC Radio 2 presenter Bob Harris, called her an \"encapsulation of the sixties\".",

    "story": [
      "The BBC has apologised to staff who felt they could not speak up with concerns about Russell Brand's behaviour because he was seen as \"too influential\" and they felt he \"would always get his way and therefore they stayed silent\".",
      "The apology came as the BBC published the findings of an internal review into Brand's time as a presenter for BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music between 2006 and 2008.",
      "The investigation considered eight complaints, two of which were made while he worked for the corporation.",
      "One of those, which related to him urinating into a cup and behaving aggressively during his Radio 2 show, was registered formally at the time, and the BBC has now admitted it was \"not dealt with effectively\".",
      "The BBC launched the investigation after separate allegations in 2023 from several women who accused the 49-year-old actor and comedian of rape, sexual assaults and emotional abuse.",
      "Brand has denied all allegations and said his relationships were \"always consensual\".",
      "'Stayed silent'",
      "Thursday's report found that \"only one formal complaint was made about Brand's inappropriate conduct in the workplace\" during his stint on air, and beyond that there was \"no evidence that his behaviour was raised with management formally at the time\".",
      "But the BBC acknowledged that Brand was \"perceived to be too influential\" for staff to complain about.",
      "Many of those interviewed for the internal investigation \"believed, rightly or wrongly, that Russell Brand would always get his way and therefore they stayed silent\", the report said. They also believed he \"had the support of the station management\".",
      "While one informal complaint was also made, the report said \"it is clear that there were other concerns but those involved felt unable or unwilling to raise these at the time as they felt the concerns would not be taken seriously and the systems for making complaints were not as clear as they are now\".",
      "Competition winner",
      "Commenting on the report, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the complaints were \"horrendous\".",
      "\"As is the fact that staff felt unable to raise concerns because they did not think that they would be believed or taken seriously,\" she said.",
      "She added that the BBC must \"take action to reassure its staff and the wider public that it takes these issues seriously\".",
      "\"For too long, there has been a culture of silence in the media industry where inappropriate behaviour like Brand's has been tolerated or downplayed. Power imbalances and a perception that certain stars cannot be challenged are sadly not unique to this case.\"",
      "The review also found that Brand had consensual sex with a competition winner from his 6 Music show on BBC premises.",
      "Speaking to the review team, that person said that while what happened was consensual, they now felt \"Brand had abused his position and taken advantage of them\".",
      "The report added that there were \"management failings\" and \"there should have been better systems in place to ensure that Brand's unacceptable behaviour was promptly picked up and addressed\".",
      "Channel 4, where Brand also worked as a presenter, released its own internal review findings in March 2024. Its boss apologised to a former employee after the probe found it had not investigated a \"serious\" complaint made against the star in 2009.",
      "Brand has been interviewed three times by police since September 2023.",
      "In November 2024, the Metropolitan Police sent the Crown Prosecution Service a file of evidence, but prosecutors have not yet decided whether to bring charges.",
      "'Not taken seriously'",
      "A BBC employee made a formal complaint to a manager in 2007 after Brand urinated into a cup in the Radio 2 studio, and then threw objects in anger when one of the production team made a mistake during a second show.",
      "The report said it was likely that this was then raised verbally with the Radio 2 controller at the time, Lesley Douglas, although she does \"not recall these concerns ever being raised with her\".",
      "Douglas denied that Brand ever sought to exercise any influence over her, and said her relationship with him was similar to that she had with other presenters on the station.",
      "The BBC made light of the 2007 incident in a press response at the time, the report said, when a spokesperson told the Independent that Brand had urinated in a cup \"and someone has shown him where the toilet is\".",
      "\"Regrettably this incident was not taken seriously at this time,\" the report said.",
      "Another staff member said they had raised concerns informally about Brand's conduct in 2006 and 2007, the report said.",
      "Someone else alleged that Brand \"tucked his fingers down their trousers and underwear and pulled them towards him\" in a corridor while on set of a BBC radio production, but did not complain at the time.",
      "Staff members who were \"most closely\" involved in his shows described his behaviour in general as \"promiscuous or out-of-control\", but said they did not \"witness anything non-consensual or potentially illegal\".",
      "'Inadequate' complaint handling",
      "Another complaint was made to the BBC about an incident in Los Angeles in 2008.",
      "Brand is alleged to have followed \"Olivia\" into a bathroom and shown his penis to her moments before he began pre-recording his radio show.",
      "The woman, who was not a BBC employee but worked in the same building, did not complain at the time, thinking \"she would not be believed\".",
      "The report found no evidence of anyone in BBC management being aware of Olivia's experience at the time.",
      "In 2019, a BBC News staff member raised the incident with their line manager after Olivia confirmed she wanted to take the matter further.",
      "\"It is likely those involved in escalating the complaint in 2019 felt that there was nothing that could be done as it was over ten years later,\" the report said.",
      "It concluded that the complaint process was \"inadequate\", as was the handling of the 2019 complaint, and the BBC has apologised to Olivia.",
      "Another of the complaints in the report was made by a woman named Alice, who said a car provided by the BBC for Brand collected her and took her to his house when he was in his 30s and she was a 16-year-old schoolgirl.",
      "The report concluded that it was not able to verify these claims but it was \"unlikely that the cars described by Alice were chauffeur-driven BBC cars or BBC management cars\".",
      "The report, and Alice, agree that if Brand did \"persuade a taxi or mini-cab pre-booked on his behalf by the BBC to make these journeys, it's likely to have been done without the knowledge of the BBC staff who booked his cars for him in advance\".",
      "The review cost \u00a3662,062 and was conducted by the BBC's director of editorial complaints and reviews, Peter Johnston.",

      "What is A$AP Rocky charged with?",
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in Hollywood.",
      "Authorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.",
      "Who is the accuser Terell Ephron?",
      "The victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors",
      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",
      "It all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.",
      "Mr Ephron took the stand this week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is then alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna appear in court again?",
      "It's unclear if Rihanna will continue appearing for the trial. Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court this week that Mr Mayers has tried to keep his family away from all of this.",
      "Media reports indicate that on Wednesday she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom. The couple's two children did not appear.",
      "Rihanna's presence sparked intense media and fan interest outside the courthouse, but she entered through a non-public entrance used by judges, and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence did attract attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",
      "Rocky's trial is being televised, but Rihanna sat out of view of the cameras in the courtroom.",

      "The Royal Ballet School (RBS) has reached a financial settlement with a former student, who said the body-shaming she experienced while at the elite institution has left her with lifelong psychological damage.",
      "Ellen Elphick, 31, had claimed the London-based school breached its duty of care when she attended between 2009 and 2012.",
      "The school said it accepted no liability for the former dancer's case and has not issued an apology.",
      "\"We are pleased that both parties were able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement in this way and we wish Ellen and her family well for the future,\" said an RBS spokesperson - adding that the school \"continues to take the welfare of its students very seriously\".",
      "Last year, when Ellen spoke to the BBC she described how, as a 16-year-old, just two weeks into her training, a teacher publicly humiliated her by tracing a line around her body in front of a mirror.",
      "\"If I had a knife, this is what I would cut off,\" Ellen says the teacher said.",
      "The comment plunged Ellen into shame, she says, and exacerbated her struggles with disordered eating. She later received a diagnosis of atypical anorexia and body dysmorphia",
      "She said there was a pattern of similar comments from multiple teachers at the school, that further eroded her confidence and intensified her eating disorder.",

      "\"It wasn't about the money,\" she said.",
      "\"It was about making people aware of what being a ballerina is really like and showing that what happened to me was unacceptable.\"",
      "Although she says she feels some validation from the settlement, Ellen expressed disappointment at the lack of an apology from RBS. \"That they couldn't even say 'sorry' shows there is so much more to do,\" she said.",
      "Now a mother, she said she wanted to shield her daughter from the ballet world and would \"never\" send her to ballet classes.",
      "However, she hopes her case could lead to meaningful reform and that ballet schools will prioritise students' mental health and train teachers to understand the impact of their words.",

      "The game requires players to navigate a large, complex map, often revisiting areas much later on in their playthrough.",

      "She says the progress could have looked \"slower\" over the past 12 months, but games take time to make and developers are working on new things.",
      "\"The important thing is that we are seeing something new, in hardware, features, in games adopting their first accessibility features,\" says Cari.",
      "\"And we're seeing the quality of these features improve as well, which is fantastic.\"",

      "'In a relatively stable place'",
      "GAConf co-director Ian Hamilton told BBC Newsbeat that \"whittling down the longlist into the finalists for each category was by far the hardest yet\" in the history of the ceremony.",
      "Ian, who's worked in the accessibility field since 2006, says the \"landscape is really unrecognisable compared to even just five years ago, let alone ten\".",
      "He said awareness of different players' needs and the number of specialist roles in the games industry had vastly increased, and a number of mainstream game awards now have an accessibility category.",

      "Late last year the company also said it had disbanded the team behind award winner The Lost Crown after reports suggested it did not hit sales targets.",
      "The publisher, which employs 18,500 people worldwide, has also delayed the upcoming game in its flagship Assassin's Creed series twice.",
      "But they are far from the only company affected.",

      "But 10 years on, industry insiders tell us things have shifted. Was body positivity a flash-in-the-pan trend? And with help with weight loss medication such as Ozempic, is skinny back for good?",
      "We speak to designers, casting agents and models at Paris Fashion Week to investigate what is happening.",
      "The 2010s: The era of body positivity",
      "The body positivity movement finds its origins in the hazy days of the 1960s and was helped by icons like Marilyn Monroe who broadened Hollywood's rigid beauty standard.",
      "It was brought to the forefront again in the 2010s, when Instagram was launched and influencers began to highlight fashion and beauty outside of the glossy magazines and runways.",
      "Helping this was the celebrity Kardashian family, whose curves triggered BBLs  (Brazilian butt lift surgery) around the world.",
      "Enrika, a 28-year-old plus-sized model, said: \"When the body positivity movement emerged, it felt incredibly empowering and liberating.\"",
      "\"It felt like an act of rebellion - what had always been criticised was now being appreciated. It was as if we had finally had enough of being judged.\"",
      "Plus-size models were being booked for big brands, including Rihanna's highly coveted lingerie label, 'Savage x Fenty' which launched in 2018.",
      "The brand, valued at $1bn, became known for its runway extravaganzas, reminiscent of a modern alternative to the iconic Victoria's Secret shows, but this time with every body type on display.",

      "\"When I got that call from my first modelling agency Storm - who discovered Kate Moss - I thought I was being punk'd,\" she said.",
      "\"Before the 2010s, attitudes around bigger bodies weren't positive and I never thought being a plus-size model was a possibility.",
      "\"Seeing that narrative change over the last decade and a half has been life changing both emotionally, physically and financially.\"",
      "The 2020s: The era of Ozempic",
      "But then around 2020, progress started to slow. And come the autumn and winter of 2024, of the 8,800 looks across 230 shows, just 0.8 per cent were on plus-size models, Vogue reports.",
      "At the same time, a new weight loss drug used to treat diabetes came onto the market and skyrocketed in popularity.  Semaglutide, also known as Ozempic and Wegovy, curbs the appetite of users, and was approved by the NHS for weight loss in 2023.",
      "Celebrities including Elon Musk started crediting the drug for their newly slim frame and it was only a matter of time before that trickled down to consumers.",
      "As Ozempic and its counterparts become more commercially available for aesthetic purposes, industry insiders claim it has affected the body positivity movement.",
      "A former model, Moya, said: \"We've seen how quickly the narrative shifted, with celebrities and influencers using surgeries or medication like Ozempic to chase what's considered 'in Vogue'.\"",

      "\"But I've realised it means now I have to keep up. Now I have to be the skinniest.\"",

      "\"We're in this moment where we're seeing the pendulum sort of swing back to skinny being 'in' and often these things are treated like a trend and we don't want them to be.\"",

      "\"The 'I love Ozempic' tee really hit a nerve,\" laughed Nan Li, the brand's creative director who claims the T-shirt was satire.",

      "Fast-forward to January, when Men's AW25 Fashion Week lands in Paris and audiences get a litmus test in real-time of exactly where brands stand.",
      "Aside from a selection of designers, including Rick Owens, LGN and Charles Jeffrey LOVERBOY, I can count on two hands how many plus-sized models I saw at a week of shows.",
      "Nan Li said: \"Paris celebrates elitism, and elitism means skinny and white.\"",
      "\"There's a handful of plus-sized models [at the shows] but they're not really plus - they're normal-sized. They are cast in every show to make the brand appear body positive.\"",
      "Amidst the hustle and bustle of fashion week, Shaun Beyen, casting director for iconic French brand Fursac, told the BBC: \"The only motivation for a brand is to sell clothes - that's it. I don't think we need to lie about this.",
      "\"Brands adopted body positivity in the 2010s because in part they saw it as a commercial opportunity, and when they saw it was no longer performing as they would hope in 2020, they hopped off.\"",
      "Beyen added: \"Full transparency - I don't really want to see clothes on someone like me. I want to see it on somebody I aspire to look like.\"",
      "Gauthier Borsarello, Fursac's creative director, laughed in agreement and said: \"I hate my body. I don't want to see clothes on people like me.\"",
      "On the other hand, designers like Charles Jeffrey believe brands have a moral imperative to cast inclusively. \"Body positivity was never a trend for me,\" he said. \"It was an opportunity to start being responsible.\"",
      "Body positivity is knitted into the very fabric of Charles' brand, which takes inspiration from the queer nightlife scene. This is readily apparent throughout his Paris Fashion Week show.",
      "The designer explained: \"The people in my shows are people I was clubbing with. It was never about models, it was my friends and their different body shapes. It was about the community I surrounded myself with.\"",
      "Body positivity 'taken a backseat now'",
      "It seem the reality is that designers like Charles are the exception to the rule. As much as activists resist it, industry insiders confirm that body positivity is behind us.",
      "Daniel Mitchell-Jones, co-founder of modelling agency Chapter Management, said: \"Yes, things have shifted. In 2020 and 2021, we saw so much more diversity and inclusion on the runways - but body-wise, that's taken a backseat now.\"",
      "Daniel said when he sends his curve models to castings, they're always pushed, but is often told the brand isn't interested this season.",
      "Plus-size model Enrika told the BBC that not only are plus-sized models being booked less, their agents are actively struggling to secure work for them.",
      "She explained: \"It's not unusual to see campaigns featuring four sample-size models and only one plus-size model. This can make you feel like you're just a token.\"",
      "Enrika said these brands sometimes often use tactics in campaigns to virtue-signal being inclusive - such as highlighting stretch marks on plus-sized models, whilst airbrushing them on others.",
      "She said: \"It sends the message that 'We don't actually think you look as good as the slim models in our skirt. But we accept you because we are such kind-hearted good people, so please give us your hard-earned money', it's nasty work and I don't support it.\"",
      "If you want change, change your buying habits. At least, that's what Shaun Beyen, believes: \"Everything is consumer-driven\".",
      "\"It's this kind of vicious circle. Every fashion house gives their version of what they know the customer wants, it's their interpretation and it's up to the consumer.\"",
      "Gauthier Borsarello said: \"There's a famous French saying: 'If people stop producing, people will stop buying.' But the inverse is true. If people stop buying, we stop producing.",
      "\"No-one is forcing you to do anything. It's an education of the customer: In a polite way - educate yourself.\"",
      "And the one benefit of bodies as trends is that the pendulum will eventually swing back. Beyen said: \"Nothing is ever gone, especially not in fashion.\"",

      "The UK government is considering an overhaul of the law that would allow AI developers to use creators' content on the internet to help develop their models, unless the rights holders opt out.",
      "Ed Newton Rex describes this as \"insanity\".",
      "He points out that AI can make advances in areas like defence, healthcare and logistics without trawling the work of authors, journalists and artists.",
      "\"All of these things work without going and changing copyright law and ruining the livelihoods of the country's creatives,\" he argues.",
      "Baroness Kidron, a crossbench peer in the House of Lords, is also strongly against removing copyright law for AI.",
      "\"Creative industries are wealth creators, 2.4 million jobs and a whole lot of joy,\" says the Baroness, who is also an advisor to the Institute for Ethics in AI at Oxford University.",
      "\"The government is undermining one of its best performing industries on the vague promise of growth.\"",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"No move will be made until we are absolutely confident we have a practical plan that delivers each of our objectives: increased control for right holders to help them license their content, access to high-quality material to train leading AI models in the UK, and more transparency for right holders from AI developers.\"",
      "Under the UK government's new AI plan, a national data library containing public data from a wide range of sources will also be made available to AI researchers.",
      "In the US the future of federal rules to control AI is now up in the air following President Trump's return to the presidency.",
      "In 2023 Biden signed an executive order that aimed to boost the safety of AI with, among other things, firms in the sector required to share details of the workings of their systems with the US government before they are released.",
      "But this has now been repealed by Trump. It remains to be seen what Trump will do instead, but he is said to want the AI sector to face less regulation.",
      "This comes as a number of lawsuits against AI firms, and particularly against OpenAI, continue in the US. They have been taken out by everyone from the New York Times to authors, music labels, and even a comedian.",
      "They claim that the AI firms broke the law when they took their content from the internet without their consent, and used it to train their systems.",
      "The AI companies argue that their actions fall under \"fair use\" and are therefore exempt. There are a number of factors which can constitute fair use \u2013 it's not a straight-forward definition. But the AI sector is under increasing scrutiny over how it gathers training data and whether it should be paying for it.",
      "If this wasn't all enough to ponder, Chinese AI firm DeepSeek has shaken the sector over the past week. It became the most downloaded free app on Apple's US App Store.",
      "DeepSeek claims that it developed its technology for a fraction of the price of the likes of OpenAI. Its success has raised security concerns in the US, and threatens American's current dominance of the sector.",
      "As for me and a career as an author, I think that at the moment, if I really want a \"bestseller\" I'll still have to write it myself. If anything, Tech-Splaining for Dummies highlights the current weakness in generative AI tools for bigger projects. It is full of inaccuracies and hallucinations, and it can be quite difficult to read in parts because it's so long-winded.",
      "But given how quickly the tech is evolving, I'm not sure how long I can remain confident that my considerably slower human writing and editing skills, are better.",

      "Brands including Dior, Chanel and Armani Priv\u00e9 showcased their new collections at a high-profile Haute Couture Week in Paris, with their shows attracting a host of global celebrities.",
      "Chanel's show was unsurprisingly star-studded, with Dua Lipa, Lily-Rose Depp and Kylie Jenner dressed in signature styles from the fashion house's archives.",
      "Blackpink's Jennie Kim was among the other A-list onlookers at the Grand Palais.",
      "Over on the runway, the offering was a perfect spring palette of creams and pinks, with plenty of nods to classic Chanel tweed.",
      "The show was a celebration of the fashion house's 110 years in haute couture, using huge ramps that aerially displayed the double C motif of the brand.",
      "Created by Chanel's in-house team of designers (new creative director Matthieu Blazy won't be exhibiting his first collection until later this year), it took inspiration from Coco Chanel's 1980s colour palette.",
      "Megan's space queen",
      "Megan Thee Stallion had one of the week's most eye-catching looks, a retrofuturistic fusion she described as \"primitive space Cleopatra\".",
      "Her outfit was made from cascading silver chains, which WWD said were inspired by \"payals\", a type of ankle jewellery traditionally worn to ward off evil spirits. Designer Gaurav Gupta said the US rapper's outfit \"embodies the spirit of tribal India\".",
      "Dior's fairytale fantasy",
      "At Christian Dior's show, Anya Taylor-Joy and Jenna Ortega opted for gothic but daring looks.",
      "Artistic vision and craftsmanship are what separate haute couture from high fashion, and both were on display on the Christian Dior runway.",
      "Maria Grazia Chiuri's collection was said to draw inspiration from Alice in Wonderland, with much of the designs looking like they belonged to the fantasy world.",
      "The show was described by many as dramatic - with dresses that more closely resembled lampshades, complete with delightful feathers, tassels and tulle.",
      "Chiuri said the collection was a result of her recent research into historical fashion.",
      "Valentino's jesters get serious",
      "Also borrowing from history was Valentino's haute couture show, which was one of the most anticipated events of the week.",
      "Away from the from springtime pastels and prints, Alessandro Michele's debut couture collection was full of clashing colours and harlequin print fit for a court jester.",
      "Michele, whose prominence grew after a stint designing for Gucci, is known for his love of accessories - whether hats, bows or out-there embroidery.",
      "The stand-out design was a chiffon ballgown that reportedly took the fashion house 54 days to make.",
      "To add to the spectacle, half of the models were over 50. \"Time provides grace and it multiplies beauty,\" Michele said of the decision.",
      "Armani still on top at 90",
      "Age was also no barrier for 90-year-old Giorgio Armani, who walked the runway in a black velvet tuxedo to celebrate the 20 year anniversary of his haute couture atelier Armani Priv\u00e9.",
      "The show's main guest was Oscar best actress nominee Demi Moore, who collected her Golden Globe award in a dress by the designer last month.",
      "Armani's show followed on from the feeling of the fantastical that's been present across much of this week, with embellishments aplenty.",
      "Trouser suits were donned with sequins, while glittery beanies and diamond-encrusted clutch bags were also a highlight.",
      "Armani said the collection was for \"a modern woman who has travelled widely and internalised her experiences\"."

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 18:54:39 GMT",
    "summary": "After fame and infamy in the Swinging 60s, she hit rock bottom before re-emerging as a respected artist.",
    "story": [
      "By her own admission, Marianne Faithfull, who has died aged 78, \"didn't do conventional\".",
      "She was the convent-educated teenager who abandoned school after meeting the Rolling Stones.",
      "A delicate-featured picture of innocence, she inhaled the highs of chart success, before falling victim to alcohol and hard drugs.",
      "After splitting up with Mick Jagger, Faithfull spent years living as a heroin addict on the streets of Soho.",
      "Given the chance to restart her singing career, she went on to make more than 20 albums.",
      "Her whisky-soaked voice, turned cracked and dusky, conveyed the inner torments of her painful life-experiences.",
      "Marianne Evelyn Gabriel Faithfull was born in Hampstead on 29 December 1946.",
      "Her mother was Baroness Eva Sacher-Masoch, a Hungarian, half-Jewish former ballet dancer who had fled the Nazis in World War II.",
      "Her father was Major Glyn Faithfull, an eccentric British MI6 agent turned professor of Italian literature.",
      "The stage was set for an unusual childhood.",
      "Marianne spent her early years at Braziers Park, an upmarket commune founded by her father in an Oxfordshire country house.",
      "In her autobiography, she described it as a \"mixture of high utopian thoughts and randy sex\".",
      "After divorcing, Lady Sacher-Masoch spirited her six-year-old daughter to a terraced house in Reading, discouraging further contact with Major Faithfull.",
      "According to Marianne, she was raised like \"one of her mother's cats\".",
      "She had regular bouts of tuberculosis and was sent to St Joseph's Roman Catholic boarding school, despite her father's complaints that the nuns would \"give her a problem with sex for the rest of her life\".",
      "While still at school, Marianne began singing folk songs a cappella in Reading coffee-houses - and, before long, her exquisite looks and obvious talent saw her sucked into the vortex of Swinging 60s London.",
      "In 1964, she attended a Rolling Stones launch party, on the arm of British artist John Dunbar, and was spotted by the flamboyant record producer Andrew Loog Oldham.",
      "Famously, he described her as an \"angel\" with impressive vital statistics.",
      "Oldham was the Rolling Stones' manager and felt he could package his new discovery as a pop star.",
      "She would, he thought, be a useful vehicle for songs that weren't quite a fit for his more important act.",
      "The Rolling Stones were a rhythm and blues band. When singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards wrote a gentle ballad, When Tears Go By, they dismissed it as a \"piece of tripe\".",
      "So Oldham gave it to Marianne Faithfull.",
      "The song had not been written for her but, she said, \"fitted me so perfectly it might as well had been\".",
      "The melancholy classic, sung in her detached, wintry voice, reached the UK Top 10.",
      "The Stones were so disappointed they had missed a hit, they recorded their own version a year later.",
      "Faithfull followed up with a series of singles, including Summer Nights, This Little Bird and - her highest chart success - Come and Stay with Me.",
      "She caught Bob Dylan's eye when he came to town.",
      "Inspired by her doe-eyed looks, the American singer-songwriter wrote her a poem - but tore it up when she turned him down.",
      "In 1965, she married John Dunbar and gave birth to their son. Soon afterwards, she left the family home and moved in with Mick Jagger.",
      "He was not Faithfull's first Rolling Stone. \"I slept with three of them,\" she later admitted, \"and then I decided the lead singer was the best bet.\"",
      "Her influence on the band was significant.",
      "Let's Spend the Night Together, You Can't Always Get What You Want and Wild Horses were all songs said to have been written about her.",
      "And Sympathy for the Devil was inspired by The Master and Margarita, a Russian novel Faithfull introduced to Jagger.",
      "As one of the faces of the 1960s, Faithfull carved out a side-career as an actor.",
      "She appeared at London's Royal Court in an adaptation of Chekhov's Three Sisters, alongside Glenda Jackson.",
      "She became the first person ever to utter the F-word in a mainstream film, I'll Never Forget What'sisname, in 1967.",
      "A year later, she starred opposite Alain Delon, as a doomed, leather-clad beauty in The Girl on a Motorcycle.",
      "Her character's psychedelic and erotic fantasies saw the film win the first ever X-rating in the United States.",
      "Of course, there were a lot of drugs.",
      "During a police raid on Keith Richards' house in Sussex, Faithfull was discovered naked, draped in a fur rug - which she took indecent pleasure in occasionally letting slip.",
      "Allegations involving a Mars bar, she insisted, were entirely made up. But the drugs bust took a toll on her reputation. \"It destroyed me,\" she later said.",
      "\"To be a male drug addict and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorising, she explained.",
      "\"A woman in that situation becomes a slut and a bad mother.\"",
      "Faithfull co-wrote Sister Morphine with Jagger and Richards and released the song in 1969.",
      "The lyrics - the authorship of which were later the subject of a legal dispute with the band - are a terrifying insight into the effect of heroin and cocaine addiction: \"The scream of the ambulance is sounding in my ears. Tell me, Sister Morphine, how long have I been lying here?\"",
      "The relationship with Jagger - whom she accused of having a misogynistic streak - fell apart at the turn of the decade.",
      "At the same time, Faithfull lost custody of her son and her life began to spiral out of control.",
      "A suicide attempt left her in a coma, and she ended up an alcoholic, anorexic heroin addict living in a bomb-damaged building in London's Soho.",
      "She looked back on these years in a BBC interview in 2002, describing her addiction as a kind of brutal therapy.",
      "\"I was in agony and I healed myself as best I could,\" she said. \"One of the ways was with drugs, because they are painkillers.",
      "\"It was all too much for me,\" she explained. \"I really didn't like my gilded cage.\"",
      "Occasional attempts to emerge from her squat in Chelsea failed.",
      "Her voice - affected by drug abuse and laryngitis - had become permanently rough and lower in pitch.",
      "But, a decade after her split with Jagger, Faithfull made Broken English - her most critically acclaimed album.",
      "Gone was the innocence of the 1960s - and in its place, a post-punk performer of depth and world-weary experience.",
      "The album's final track, Why'd Ya Do It?, is the rasping rant of a woman reacting to a man's infidelity - set to a riff inspired by Jimi Hendrix.",
      "It was a moment of metamorphosis: the Rolling Stone party-girl had become a gravel-voiced, truth-telling sophisticate.",
      "The album's critical success was not matched commercially. It did well in France and Germany but reached just number 57 in the UK charts.",
      "But it did earn Faithfull a Grammy nomination in 1981, for best female rock vocal performance.",
      "She moved to America, where Island Records put her into rehab.",
      "Still suffering from alcohol and drug addiction, she had a string of mishaps - including breaking her jaw on the stairs. On one occasion, her heart actually stopped.",
      "But she held it together, and released more than a dozen albums over the next three decades.",
      "She also wrote an autobiography, Faithfull - looking back on the 1960s and 70s with a notable absence of self-pity.",
      "Constantly worried about money, she auctioned off much of her 1960s memorabilia in 2024 - saying that she preferred gardening to looking back.",
      "Now in her late 70s, she had inherited her mother's ancient title and - technically a baroness - was living in Paris.",
      "In the last decade of her life, Faithfull had to cancel concert tours after being diagnosed first with breast cancer and then hepatitis C.",
      "She was also troubled by the complications of a broken back and hip, and thought she would never sing again after weeks in hospital with the coronavirus.",
      "But she never quite lost the creative spark.",
      "In recent years, she published a record that put the words of Keats and Wordsworth to music.",
      "And Negative Capability, her 21st album, was described by the Guardian as a \"masterly mediation on ageing and death\".",
      "It was notable for They Come at Night, her furious response to the Bataclan terror in Paris.",
      "\"They come at night,\" she sang, \"and the world goes blind with fear. Terror in Paris, the future is here.\"",
      "It also dealt with Faithfull's own increasing frailty and loneliness, as well as the loss of close friends, including fellow Rolling Stones muse Anita Pallenberg.",
      "\"I know I'm not young and I'm damaged,\" she wrote defiantly. \"But I'm still pretty kind of funny.\"",
      "Marianne Faithfull will in part be remembered for being Mick Jagger's girlfriend and surviving the horrors of drink and drug addiction.",
      "But her resurrection proved - if proof were needed - a rock star's muse can become a fully fledged, respected artist in her own right.",

      "As they prepared to record the follow-up to As The Love Continues, keyboardist Barry Burns received the news every parent dreads: His daughter might die.",
      "Doctors had diagnosed her with aplastic anaemia, also known as bone marrow failure, where the body stops producing enough blood cells.",
      "\"She had blood coming out of her gums and bruises all over,\" he recalls. \"It was extremely stressful.\"",
      "The condition is exceptionally rare, with only 30 to 40 children diagnosed in the UK per year, but Burns had first-hand experience of how serious it could be.",
      "\"The weird thing was that my neighbour when I was a kid had it and, sadly, she died,\" he says.",
      "\"So obviously, I really panicked because I thought I knew the outcome \u2013 but thankfully the treatment is completely different now.\"",
      "After a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, his daughter recovered.",
      "\"She's going to be fine, but I've had an awful two years.\"",
      "Opaque and impressionistic",
      "It wasn't the only trauma the band experienced while making the record.",
      "Live agent Mick Griffiths, who had worked with them since the start of their career, died of cancer, while bassist Dominic Aitchison lost his father.",
      "Even Braithwaite's pet dog, Prince, had problems that caused turmoil. \"He got cancer and had to have his leg amputated two weeks before we started recording,\" he recalls.",
      "Appropriately enough, the album's title, The Bad Fire, is a Glaswegian term for hell. But anyone expecting an outpouring of grief or a reckoning with mortality is in for disappointment.",
      "\"If anything weighty happens in my life, the last thing I want to do is write a song about it,\" Braithwaite told The Herald newspaper in 2003, an ethos that holds true today.",
      "Largely instrumental, their songs are deliberately left open to interpretation. The band christen their compositions with nonsense titles and in-jokes (You're Lionel Richie, Secret Pint, Simon Ferocious) to avoid the imposition of meaning.",
      "The new album continues that tradition, with deliciously-titled tracks like Pale Vegan Hip Pain and Fanzine Made Of Flesh (although Lion Rumpus may be the most self-descriptive entry in the band's discography).",
      "When lyrics appear, they're opaque and impressionistic. The only hint of the turbulence Mogwai experienced comes on the groggy, distortion-washed 18 Volcanoes, where Braithwaite quietly sings: \"Hope has come another day/Hold me close in every way.\"",
      "\"Some journalists in France said the album was really cathartic, and I can kind of see that,\" he says. \"But I don't think its maudlin at all.",
      "\"It's vaguely upbeat, by our standards.\"",
      "Released last Friday, The Bad Fire is heading for the top five of the UK albums chart amid stiff competition from Central Cee and Teddy Swims.",
      "Again, physical sales will give The Bad Fire an advantage over streaming hits, a situation Braithwaite is pretty happy about.",
      "\"The streaming world is very murky and hard to understand,\" he says.",
      "\"It does make a lot of money, but it makes a lot of money for old music and artists with popular back catalogues, and I think that's really discouraged a lot of big labels from investing in new music.\"",
      "He adds that Spotify is filled with \"fake bands making generic music\" for its curated playlists, especially in genres like chill-out, lo-fi and relaxation.",
      "It's an accusation that's been repeatedly levelled against the streaming service, and which it has called \"categorically untrue\". But Braithwaite is sceptical.",
      "\"You absolutely know that if anyone's going to be making generic AI music, it's going to be the streaming services, just so they don't have to pay humans.\"",
      "Streaming isn't entirely bad for Mogwai, however. Over on YouTube, their crepuscular 2005 album track Take Me Somewhere Nice has been streamed 85 million times.",
      "The video isn't even official. Uploaded by a fan, it's illustrated by a drawing of a girl with her head in an upturned goldfish bowl.",
      "Originally drawn by video game designer Ken Wong, the picture's aura of disconnection and alienation has become so synonymous with Mogwai's song that some fans have turned it into tattoos.",
      "\"I almost want to go, 'Mate, you know, that's not the cover of the record',\" laughs Braithwaite. \"But it's cool.",
      "\"And the comments under the video are a sort of endless message board of young kids who are going through a hard time supporting each other. There's an agony aunt vibe about it.",
      "\"That's one thing I do like about the digital world, that music has these other lives.\"",
      "For Braithwaite, who read a lot of William Blake's poetry during the recording of The Bad Fire, there's something alluring about the prospect of art outliving its creator.",
      "\"I'm kind of obsessed with the concept of eternity within culture,\" he says.",
      "\"William Blake was kind of laughed out of society for his ideas but hundreds of years later, his paintings were projected onto the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, and Jerusalem is the unofficial English national anthem. It's incredible.",
      "\"I like the idea of, when we're long gone, having made some kind of mark.\"",
      "The concept has extra resonance this year, as Mogwai celebrate their 30th anniversary. They've come a long way, from gobby young upstarts who sold T-shirts slagging off their rivals to respected stalwarts of the British rock scene.",
      "So how does it feel to have reached this stage? Was it something they ever anticipated at their first practice, the first Tuesday after Glastonbury, in the front room of his parents' house?",
      "\"Well, I thought we'd have flying cars by this point,\" laughs Braithwaite. \"So any joy at the fact I was still eking out a living as a musician would probably be tempered by the lack of jet packs.\"",
      "To put it another way, it simply feels weird."

      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting is being threatened with legal action if he does not ban the private sale of cross-sex hormones such as testosterone to under 18s.",
      "Lawyers acting for three people - including campaigner Keira Bell - have written to Streeting urging him to introduce a ban as he has done for puberty blockers for children questioning their gender identity.",
      "Ms Bell says her life has been \"flipped upside down\" by taking the drugs that have some irreversible effects. The other two people involved are parents and wish to remain anonymous.",
      "Cross-sex hormone therapy is used to help people transition to a different gender from the one they were born into.",
      "In December the health secretary announced an indefinite ban on puberty-suppressing drugs for gender dysphoria.",

      "The lawyers said private clinics are providing these to under 18s, despite the fact that they pose at least an equal risk as puberty blockers.",
      "The letter, seen by the BBC, points to potential health risks to children's developing brains, bones and reproductive system.",
      "Keira Bell has previously taken legal action against the NHS - after her treatment when she was a teenager more than a decade ago at what was then the only NHS gender clinic.",
      "She was given puberty blockers at 16 and then the male hormone testosterone at 17 before having surgery to remove her breasts.",
      "Ms Bell, 28, told BBC News: \"I was very vulnerable and was dealing with a lot of issues.",
      "\"With cross-sex hormones... it changes not only your physical and mental state, but also your social state, especially for females who are taking testosterone. I'm one of those people.\"",

      "Paul Conrathe, the lawyer who is representing Ms Bell and the two other individuals, said: \"Given what we know about the unscrupulous and harmful practices of unregulated overseas gender clinics it is remarkable that the secretary of state has not banned the prescription of cross-sex hormones.",
      "\"He banned puberty blockers, but failed to ban even more harmful cross-sex hormones that expose children to irreversible lifelong changes.",
      "\"This harmful trade continues unashamed and emboldened at the failure of the government to protect vulnerable children.\"",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care did not respond directly to the threat of a judicial review, but said it was working with regulators to tighten up rules around private provision of cross-sex hormones.",
      "A spokeswoman pointed out that the landmark Cass Review into gender care published last year did not call for a ban of cross-sex hormones for those aged 16 to 18.",

      "The NHS can prescribe cross-sex hormones to under 18s.",
      "But the Cass Review found that there was a lack of research and \"weak evidence\" for medical interventions.",
      "As a result, NHS England wrote to all NHS gender clinics saying \"extreme caution\" should be exercised before recommending cross-sex hormones for under 18s.",
      "Changes are being made to the way NHS gender services for children are run with a move away from medical interventions and a greater focus on wider needs, including with mental health. Puberty blockers are no longer used by them at all - except in clinical trials.",
      "The legal move comes as the courts continue to hear the case involving a mother who is trying to stop her 16-year-old being given cross-sex hormones to change their gender.",
      "The case will return to the High Court on Friday.",

    "story": [
      "A gene-editing therapy for sickle cell disease, with a price tag of \u00a31.65m, is to be offered to patients on the NHS in England.",
      "About 50 people a year with the inherited blood disorder are likely to receive it, experts say.",
      "Prof Bola Owolabi, of NHS England, called it a \"monumental step forward\", and said the one-off treatment Casgevy, also known as Exa-cel, \"holds a very real prospect of  a cure\".",
      "A confidential agreement has been made with manufacturer Vertex on how much the NHS will pay.",
      "Campaigners have described the treatment as \"groundbreaking\" and its availability on the NHS as a \"milestone\".",
      "Sickle cell disease can be life-threatening and cause recurring intense pain, when blood vessels become blocked by misshapen red cells.",
      "About 15,000 people in England live with the condition, which mainly affects people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage.",
      "It is caused by genetic change that means people make haemoglobin - a key protein in red blood cells - that doesn't work properly.",
      "This results in red blood cells becoming sickle in shape and stiff and sticky - rather than flexible smooth discs.",
      "These sickle cells do not live as long as healthy red blood cells and can clump as they travel around blood vessels - reducing oxygen to vital parts of the body.",
      "This puts people at risk of organ damage, stroke, heart failure and a greatly  reduced quality of life.",
      "In trials all patients who received the therapy - which tweaks a specific gene and allows the body to make more healthy red blood cells - avoided stays in hospital for a year after treatment and most for three-and-a-half years. Further data is still being studied.",
      "NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the therapy \"could be absolutely transformative \u2013 it could enable patients to live free from the fear of sickle cell crises hanging over them\".",
      "Asiawu Imam, 26, lives in London, where she works as a nurse looking after people who have sickle cell disorder. She also lives with the condition.",
      "When she was younger she was in and out of hospital three to four times a year with painful sickle cell crises.",
      "\"It feels like a stabbing pain, like someone is stabbing you form the inside outwards. It can last anything from half an hour to four days. It is excruciating,\" she said.",
      "The therapy being made available on the NHS gives her hope, and a sense to the community that people with the condition are being taken seriously.",
      "\"This is going to be a life-changing moment for many of my patients.\"",
      "How the gene therapy works",
      "It is a multi-step process.",
      "First, blood stem cells from a patient's bone marrow (where all blood cells originate) are removed from the body.",
      "In the laboratory, a gene-editing tool called Crispr is used.",
      "This allows a specific gene to be pinpointed and very precise editing to take place.",
      "However, instead of directly editing a faulty gene, Casgevy instead takes advantage of a process that happens when babies are in the womb, where they make red blood cells with foetal haemoglobin (a key protein that carries oxygen). This switches to the adult form once they are born.",
      "Crucially foetal haemoglobin is not affected by sickle cell disease, so Crispr acts by dampening down the \"switch\" that makes the body produce the adult form.",
      "Patients have to undergo \"conditioning\" chemotherapy to make sure their bodies are ready to accept the edited stem cells.",
      "Modified stem cells are then transfused back into the body, where they multiply and increase the production of stable, well-functioning red cells.",
      "The full treatment must be considered carefully - it can involve lengthy stays in hospital and may have side effects, including headaches and bleeding problems.",
      "UK approves gene-edit drug for sickle cell disease",
      "First gene-editing therapy may cure blood disorder",
      "The only other current option for a cure is a stem cell transplant - but this can only happen if a closely matched donor is available. There is also a risk of the transplant being rejected.",
      "The gene therapy will be available in specialist centres in London, Manchester and Birmingham to people aged 12 and over who get recurrent sickle cell crises and who cannot find a donor for a stem cell transplant.",
      "John James, chief executive of the Sickle Cell Society, said: \"We are absolutely thrilled to see this groundbreaking gene therapy treatment available on the NHS\", adding \"the significance of this milestone for the sickle cell community could not be understated\".",
      "He said the news would \"give hope to many\" and was \"incredible\".",
      "However, he added: \"We remain acutely aware that not everyone with sickle cell will be eligible for the potentially life-changing benefits of Casgevy.",
      "\"There is still much work ahead to ensure that everyone living with sickle cell has access to the care, treatments, and support they deserve.\"",
      "The therapy has already been approved for another inherited blood disorder, transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.",
      "It is already being given to patients in other countries such as France, Germany and Italy.",
      "Wales is also expected to provide it in the next few months."

      "Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which makes Ploom, said the 2002 law defines a tobacco product as something that is \"smoked, sniffed, sucked or chewed\", and because heated tobacco products do not produce smoke, they aren't covered by that definition.",
      "Morrisons cited the same argument. \"On that basis, we are comfortable that it is legal for heated tobacco products to be advertised in store,\" it said.",

      "Vaccinating poultry against avian influenza is currently not allowed in the UK. The government says that strong biosecurity measures and culling are the most effective ways of fighting it. Meanwhile, there are concerns that poultry vaccinations might be linked to the virus evolving.",
      "Overall levels of the virus have not yet reached the peak of recent years.",
      "But one farmer, who has previously lost 30% of his flock because of bird flu, told the BBC that, without a vaccine, it was only a matter of time before \"it all kicks off again\".",

      "Currently, they are offered regular checks for pre-cancerous growths in their gut, which, if detected, indicate about a 30% chance of bowel cancer developing over 10 years.",

      "Prof Trevor Graham, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said: \"Most people with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease won't develop bowel cancer.",
      "\"But for those that have these conditions and are showing signs of pre-cancer in their colon, there are some tough decisions to make.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 02:42:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The government is not just looking at reforming the benefits system - it is preparing to put it at the heart of its economic agenda.",
    "story": [
      "When Sir Keir Starmer was preparing to run for the Labour leadership in 2020, his campaign director told the future prime minister what mattered to the party.",
      "Morgan McSweeney emphasised that whatever their faction, Labour members shared certain core principles - and top of the list was a commitment to combatting poverty and defending the welfare state.",
      "That is why any Labour politician treads carefully when looking at welfare reform.",
      "This government, though, is not just looking at reforming welfare  - it is preparing to put it at the heart of its economic agenda.",
      "In Rachel Reeves's big speech on growth this week, she vowed that to achieve \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system, the government would look at areas that have been \"ducked for too long, like the rising cost of health and disability benefits\".",
      "What did that mean?",
      "The question is being frantically addressed between the Treasury and the Department of Work of Pensions (DWP) right now.",
      "Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, will present a \"green paper\" - or policy proposals - on welfare reform in just over a month, designed to demonstrate how serious the government is about finding ways to get more people into work - and save money from the welfare budget.",
      "That dual motive explains why this is being treated as such an urgent issue at the top of government.",
      "Ministers are concerned by a situation in which the amount of people who are in receipt of certain benefits has surged. Meanwhile, the Treasury needs to ensure that it is not on course to break its own self-imposed fiscal rules.",
      "\"It's high up the agenda for us because of the cost implications but also the broader economic problem of having so many people economically inactive,\" a Treasury source said.",
      "And in 10 Downing Street, aides say that tackling this issue would be the clearest sign yet that Sir Keir is truly serious about reforming public services.",
      "Last year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around \u00a3100bn before the next general election.",
      "Some of this is the legacy of Covid. But the chancellor has made clear her view that another reason for this surge is the \"perverse incentives\" wired into the system.",
      "Again and again, ministers and officials complain of a system where those on universal credit are required to display evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work.",
      "Ministers believe that this encourages some people to \"game the system\". Some Labour advisers fear this issue is being exacerbated, especially among young people, by videos on TikTok and other platforms which explain to claimants the best ways to fill out questionnaires in order to get sickness benefits.",
      "One option officials are examining is whether there should be \u2013 as in the past - a third path whereby some people on sickness benefits are required to seek work - but without the risk that they lose their sickness benefits.",
      "\"Lots of people tell us they're scared to go to work in case it doesn't work out and they then can't go back to the safety net,\" a senior government source said.",
      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "Labour says it will cut benefits bill in its own way",
      "DWP must focus on work not welfare, says minister",
      "Some in government say this may need more frequent assessments of claimants' health, but those involved in discussions acknowledge that being required to explain their condition to the DWP can often be \"traumatic\", \"humiliating\" and \"terrifying\" for vulnerable claimants.",
      "Better training and coaching can help, but the amount of money involved may not sit well with a Treasury that's in savings mode.",
      "That's complicated enough - and that's before you even get to the finances and the politics.",
      "On the finances, this round of welfare reform is designed to generate savings that can be \"scored\", in other words accounted for, by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the next Budget in the autumn.",
      "But those involved in past Budgets caution that it is \"basically impossible\" to persuade the OBR that the savings will actually happen.",
      "And then there's the politics.",
      "As McSweeney, now Sir Keir's chief of staff, found - the Labour Party is deeply committed to the welfare state and deeply anxious about anything which looks like the safety net is fraying.",
      "That's not just true of party members but MPs too. Among the vast 2024 intake of Labour MPs, one of their most common reasons for getting involved in the Labour Party was opposition to Conservative austerity and welfare cuts.",
      "That means that even some of those most loyal to Starmer and Reeves are privately expressing significant anxiety about the direction of travel.",
      "Some of these tensions are beginning to spill into public view.",
      "At PMQs this week Debbie Abrahams, the Labour chair of the work and pensions select committee, said that \"speculation\" about billions of pounds of savings to be found from the social security budget had left \"many vulnerable claimants [feeling] worried\".",
      "She warned the prime minister that \"language matters\".",
      "Senior Labour figures involved in the discussions are adamant that it is Reeves and Starmer who are in line with public opinion, not concerned Labour MPs.",
      "One complained: \"If you ask Labour MPs whether they'd rather be on the side of the public or on the side of a lot of the Labour movement and vocal disability campaigners - well, for some of them that's a marginal call.\"",
      "Others caution about public opinion on this issue though: \"The public think they support welfare cuts until they hear a story about someone they feel sympathy for losing money. Then they don't.\"",
      "Some older hands warn of how quickly the government could be left out of step with its base, pointing to the party's decision to abstain on a Conservative welfare bill in July 2015.",
      "Such was the scale of Labour members' fury that Conservative welfare cuts were not being opposed, it is seen by many as the main reason that Jeremy Corbyn's longshot leadership campaign took off.",
      "Jon Ashworth, a former shadow cabinet minister who is still close to top party figures, urged the government to put \"helping people move into good, well-paid jobs\" at the heart of their arguments for reform.",
      "He said: \"The welfare system as currently designed traps people out of work and actively denies people who want to work real, genuine help.\"",
      "These political considerations are not new territory for Reeves. She was shadow work and pensions secretary for two years before the 2015 general election.",
      "Her vow that Labour would be \"tougher than the Tories on benefits\" made her deeply controversial with the party's grassroots for years afterwards. Speaking to the New Statesman in 2021, Reeves acknowledged she may have made her point \"badly\", but insisted that \"spending more on benefits wasn't always a sign of success. And actually the benefits bill goes up when society fails.\"",
      "These dilemmas may not be new for Reeves, but they have left some of her colleagues feeling uneasy at best.",
      "\"Of course I'm worried about the politics of this,\" one minister said.",
      "\"Anyone with a brain would worry about this.\"",

      "A Home Office spokesperson said the report had looked at the previous government's \"failure to deliver systemic change\", and that Labour was \"delivering a step-change in the government's response\".",

      "The NAO also found \"little evidence\" that the Home Office had improved on earlier strategies, while the department and the wider government had \"a poor understanding of what works to prevent and tackle VAWG\".",
      "The report added that as part of the 2021 strategy, at least \u00a34.2m had been spent on research into preventing VAWG, but the projects it funded were \"yet to provide insights to inform any future interventions\".",
      "The report noted that \"low charge rate and long wait times\" contributed to a considerable number of rape victims dropping out before cases reached a conviction.",

      "In 2021, under the previous Conservative government, the department created a dedicated team to lead VAWG strategy.",
      "The NAO said the Home Office \"found it challenging to get buy-in from other government departments\" and had a \"limited understanding\" of the extent of resources devoted to addressing VAWG across government.",

    "story": [
      "A court has ruled that consent for two new Scottish oil and gas fields was granted unlawfully and their owners must seek fresh approval from the UK government before production can begin.",
      "The written judgement on the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields came after a case brought by environmental campaigners, Uplift and Greenpeace, at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.",
      "In his judgement, Lord Ericht said a more detailed assessment of the fields' environmental impact was required, taking into account the effect on the climate of burning any fossil fuels extracted.",
      "He said work on both fields could continue while the new information was gathered but no oil and gas could be extracted unless fresh approval was granted.",
      "Shell's Jackdaw gas field in the North Sea was originally approved by the previous UK Conservative government, and the industry regulator, in summer 2022.",
      "Permission for the Rosebank oil development, 80 miles west of Shetland in the North Atlantic, was granted in autumn 2023.",
      "In a 57-page judgement, Lord Ericht wrote that there was a public interest in having the decision \"remade on a lawful basis\" because of the effects of climate change - which he said outweighed the interests of the developers.",
      "Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, welcomed the ruling as \"common sense\" and said the government should now refuse approval for both projects.",
      "\"The climate science is crystal clear that we can't create new oil and gas fields if we're going to stay within safe climate thresholds,\" she said.",
      "The companies involved insist their projects are vital for UK energy security and should be allowed to proceed.",

      "The plan was for oil to be taken off by tanker and sold on the international market, with some gas being piped to Shetland.",
      "Production was scheduled to begin at Jackdaw in 2026 and at Rosebank in 2026/27.",
      "As part of the original consenting process, environmental impact assessments were carried out to identify, describe and assess \"the direct and indirect effects\" of the projects.",
      "Those assessments took into account emissions generated by the process of extracting oil and gas but not the greenhouse gases which would be released when those fossil fuels were eventually burned - known as \"downstream\" or \"Scope 3\" emissions.",
      "But last June, in a dispute about oil wells near London's Gatwick Airport, the UK Supreme Court ruled that environmental impact assessments must also include downstream emissions.",
      "Now Lord Ericht has ruled that the decision in that case \u2013 Finch v Surrey County Council \u2013 should apply retrospectively to Rosebank and Jackdaw.",
      "As a result, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband and the regulator, the North Sea Transition Authority (formerly known as the Oil and Gas Authority), must reconsider whether or not to grant consent, taking into account those downstream emissions.",

      "The UK government has been considering how to calculate downstream emissions, and a consultation on the subject had been due to conclude in the spring.",
      "Downing Street said it \"worked at speed to consult on updated environmental guidance so we can provide certainty to industry\" since the autumn.",
      "The prime minister's official spokesperson told reporters at a daily Downing Street briefing that: \"This will help provide stability for industry, support our environmental goals and investment, protect jobs and deliver economic growth\".",
      "The spokesperson added: \"Oil and gas will be with us for decades to come, but diversifying the North Sea industries is also key to protecting jobs and investments in the long term, alongside our commitment to manage existing fields for the duration of their lifespan.\"",

      "He told reporters the judgement highlighted the significance of climate implications being considered in any consenting decisions. He said that had always been an \"essential part\" of the Scottish government's stance.",
      "A spokesperson for Shell said swift action was needed from the government to grant fresh approval for Jackdaw, adding: \"Today's ruling rightly allows work to progress on this nationally-important energy project while new consents are sought.\"",

      "\"Rosebank is critical for the UK's economic growth,\" a spokesperson said, adding that it was investing \u00a32.2bn in the project and a pause would have meant job losses and a cut in tax income for the Treasury.",
      "In court, counsel for Shell had argued that quashing consent could threaten the overall viability of Jackdaw, not just costing the company and its partners huge sums of money but also impacting UK energy security, the transition to renewable energy and the wider economy.",
      "However, Lord Ericht concluded that these were not matters for him, writing: \"The question for me is not whether the projects should go ahead, but whether the unlawful decisions should be retaken in a lawful manner.\"",
      "He also rejected arguments from the companies that they had acted in good faith because the UK government had told them there was no need to include downstream emissions in their environmental assessments.",

      "However, she added, \"whether, how and to what extent\" any individual project contributed to climate change was \"a complex one.\"",
      "In his judgment, Lord Ericht wrote: \"The effect of the burning of fossil fuels on climate change and the lives of individual persons is now well recognised in law.\"",

    "story": [
      "Heathrow's third runway can be built and operating in a decade's time, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said.",
      "Reeves told the BBC she wanted to see \"spades in the ground\" in the current Parliament and planes to start using the runway by 2035.",
      "She also said that Sadiq Khan, the Labour Mayor of London who is opposed to Heathrow's expansion, could not stop the new runway.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives were in favour of a third runway at Heathrow \"in principle\" but \"it remains to be seen\" whether it can be built in a decade.",
      "The extra runway at Heathrow was one of a number of infrastructure projects announced by the chancellor on Wednesday as part of the government's plans to boost economic growth.",
      "\"We think that we can get flights off within a decade,\" Reeves told the BBC.",
      "\"I say that because we're not just announcing that we back it, we are changing the way that our planning system works to make it easier to deliver projects like the third runway at Heathrow.\"",
      "When asked if Sadiq Khan could stop the expansion the chancellor said \"no\".",
      "\"There can be judicial reviews but we are confident that this airport expansion will happen, that we will get the third runway built,\" she said.",
      "Some have argued that it will take much longer than a decade for a third runway at Heathrow to become reality.",
      "A formal planning process has to take place, which could take between 18 months and two years. Any judicial review of the plan could take another year and a half, while actually building the runway could take about seven years.",
      "The airport's expansion is highly controversial - facing opposition from environmental groups, local authorities and nearby residents.",
      "Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has called the plan \"a dead cat\".",

      "What's the plan for a third runway at Heathrow Airport?",
      "The Green Party has called Heathrow's expansion the \"definition of irresponsible\", with the party's co-leader, Adrian Ramsay, saying it was a \"fantasy\" that the projects could be done without environmental damage.",
      "Reeves was questioned over her previous opposition to the expansion of Leeds-Bradford airport over air and noise pollution grounds.",
      "\"If Leeds-Bradford came back with plans to expand I would support these because I think things have changed significantly in the past few years,\" she said.",
      "She said there were now more efficient plane engines and the use of sustainable aviation fuel was a \"game changer\".",
      "However, supplies of this fuel are currently very low. According to the European regulator EASA, they made up just 0.05% of the fuel used in the EU in 2020. It also costs much more than regular jet fuel.",
      "The UK government has introduced a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate which stipulates that 2% of all jet fuel supplied this year must be SAF, increasing to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040.",
      "The director-general of the International Air Transport Association, Willie Walsh,  has cast doubt on how quickly this can be achieved.",
      "\"Sustainable fuel is a real thing, but we need it in significantly greater volumes than are available today,\" he told LBC on Wednesday.",
      "\"Mandating airlines to use a fuel source that doesn't exist today doesn't make an awful lot of sense.\"",
      "Stride said that while the Conservatives backed the third runway in principle, \"it will take some considerable time\".",
      "\"If the government keeps pushing on this it will be maybe the 2040s or the 2050s or who knows before it comes off.\"",
      "Despite broadly backing plans to boost the UK's infrastructure, the Conservatives have argued tax rises in the Budget and planned changes to employment rights will damage growth.",

      "How will the UK's growth plans affect me?",
      "Reeves's growth plan comes under scrutiny from her own side",
      "As well as announcing backing for a third runway at Heathrow, the chancellor also said on Wednesday that other projects would be supported to try to boost growth in the economy.",
      "Expansions at Luton and Gatwick airports are being backed, as well as a \"growth corridor\" between Oxford and Cambridge, which she claimed could be \"Europe's Silicon Valley\".",
      "Reeves also told the BBC that when it came to planning and decision making over infrastructure projects \"we need to do things differently\".",
      "It emerged last year that the HS2 rail line was spending \u00a3100m on a shield to protect bats in ancient woodland in Buckinghamshire.",
      "The chancellor said: \"There are trade-offs and the balance has gone too far in the direction of always protecting every bat and every newt.\"",
      "The government is setting up a fund which builders can pay into to help nature restoration, \"but not necessarily in the place the development is happening\", Reeves said.",
      "\"So builders can get on and build, and that money can be used for nature restoration projects elsewhere.\"",

    "title": "Five key impacts of Brexit five years on",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:41:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.",
      "On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.",
      "Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement.",
      "Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.",
      "Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.",
      "1) Trade",
      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "EU citizens can stay in the UK for up to six months without needing a visa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20.",
      "Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.",
      "Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.",
      "The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country,",
      "So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.",
      "The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years.",
      "Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.",
      "However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.",
      "After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.",
      "However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.",
      "The future",
      "There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.",

    "title": "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:00:14 GMT",
    "summary": "In choppy global seas, going for growth will require tricky navigation",
    "story": [
      "It has been a wild January for Rachel Reeves and frankly for economics in the UK and the world.",
      "When Labour swept to victory last summer, Reeves pledged she would be an \"iron\" chancellor, reining in public spending and improving the lives of working people through growing the economy. Without solid public finances, she argued, the government couldn't achieve any of its other aims.",
      "This month has tested that plan.",
      "It started off with a global bond market tantrum - UK borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years and the pound fell sharply.",
      "Some argued that Reeves's Budget decisions had made the UK more vulnerable to such shocks. The prime minister was forced to confirm Reeves had his backing after political opponents called for her resignation.",
      "The market turbulence sparked concerns that a verdict of sorts was being made on the chancellor.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this Parliament. That meant, the rise in global and UK debt interest costs would require some spending cuts.",
      "The message was sent out that the government, with its massive majority, could do and would do what it takes to keep to the self-imposed rules, which it said were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The markets have now recovered all their negative moves. Short term and long term government borrowing costs are all lower than at the beginning of the year.",
      "While the \"gilt crisis\" hyperbole was overdone, there have been consequences.",
      "From doom to promises of a boom",
      "The chancellor sped up an already planned \"drumbeat\" of pro-growth measures, culminating in this week's speech. Reeves's counsel of doom and warnings about black holes and pain has been replaced by a promise of an investment boom.",
      "She has vowed a new runway at Heathrow, visas for those with AI and life science skills and said she would ease the non-dom ban to allow a more generous phase out of tax benefits.",
      "Alongside this are plans to make it easier to build, delays to new rules on banks and the ousting of the boss of the competition regulator, which shows she's serious on growth. As Meatloaf might have scripted for her: \"I would do anything for growth\".",
      "But Reeves's plans are not yet a fully fledged growth plan. Her announcements signal that she is willing to take a series of political hits to foster long term growth.",
      "The chancellor will deploy the near total executive power from her party's commons majority to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Some outside advisers who support the chancellor say that stability is not enough, and nor is planning, and nor is deregulation.",
      "Reeves has not pledged any allocation of public money to these grand projects.",
      "Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye sounded a little coy after plans for a third runway were confirmed, saying they would not spend more money on it unless they really believed it was going to happen.",
      "\"This will take years, it will take what I call Churchillian resolve and lots of ingenuity but we can trust a government that will be with us for many years to deliver this,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Reeves's UK growth mission",
      "Reeves is focusing on a very specific type of growth - increasing the supply of goods and services. She believes a lack of this supply side growth has held back the UK, and she is on a mission to remove barriers, and open new markets.",
      "For example, Reeves is very concerned about small businesses who have told her they have given up on exporting to the EU, because post Brexit it is now easier to export to the US.",
      "At a meeting last week, one business told the chancellor that exports to Europe meant for Christmas, had only just arrived.",
      "The problem is that while the chancellor awaits a long term growth spurt, she has prioritised stabilising public finances through significant tax rises.",
      "In April, employers will be hit with an increase in national insurance payments and a higher minimum wage. These costs could be passed on in price rises meaning inflation - already higher than target at 2.5%, could remain sticky.",
      "Reeves would have preferred employers to squeeze pay settlements rather than raise prices or cut staff.",
      "Retail and hospitality businesses using low wage labour will be most impacted by the bumper rise in minimum wages. Downing Street insiders acknowledge that many domestic business bosses are \"grumpy\" as they put it.",
      "The concern is whether the impact will show up in higher unemployment. At last October's Budget, the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted extra government spending would help boost the economy and bring unemployment down to 4% this year. Some outside forecasters now think it will top 5%.",
      "It is a critical few months for the animal spirits in the economy to reignite.",
      "How far will she go?",
      "But how far is Rachel Reeves willing to push this pro-growth agenda?",
      "Will she follow the US away from the decarbonisation path to benefit from cheaper hydrocarbon prices promised by President Trump? Will she accede to construction industry requests to import foreign workers to meet the target to build 1.5 million homes?",
      "Will she push the Brexit reset to remove all the barriers to UK-EU trade in food and farm products, and many goods too? Will she offer Britain to the global tech and pharma industries as a deregulatory haven from the EU and US respectively?",
      "Taken at face value, she will do most of this, with big political consequences. Take the Brexit reset. Cabinet ministers at The World Economic Forum were delighted with the tone of the EU's new trade chief Maros Sefcovic in his interview with me, saying he was open to Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "The arrangement allows for tariff-free trade of some goods from across dozens of countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.",
      "But if the UK demanded effective single market treatment in certain sectors, it would need to follow the EU rule book in those areas. There would be counter asks, such as extending EU fishing arrangements in UK waters, and some sort of youth cultural exchange scheme.",
      "The need for delicate diplomacy",
      "Push is coming to shove on these issues, and the question is whether the chancellor's pro growth agenda is the overwhelming factor in making decisions. I suspect it is.",
      "However, that approach will require delicate diplomacy in the middle of a potential goods tariff war. If Trump follows through on his threat of a universal tariff then the G7 could decide to coordinate retaliatory tariffs. Does the UK join in?",
      "What if the US decides it wants its allies to help contain China's tech ascendancy? What if Trump wants to deter the UK from rebuilding free-flowing trade with the EU?",
      "The sudden emergence of China's AI expertise via DeepSeek underlines how important it is to be nimble. There was only one mention of China in the government's big AI paper earlier this month - in Science Secretary Peter Kyle's foreword.",
      "The pharma industry is lobbying the government to quietly open the door for relocation of key top talent into the UK, concerned about the Trump / Robert F Kennedy Jr approach to medicines regulation. Our leading universities are saying that for the first time since Brexit, it's easier to recruit some of the very best international scientists who are not keen to bring up their families in Trump's America.",
      "Trump's decision to abandon Biden's green subsidies also levels the playing field for net zero investment here.",
      "After a tumultuous start to the year, with the US administration threatening different tariffs almost every day, and tech giant shares falling over concerns they've been overvalued in the light of China's AI app DeepSeek, the UK remains a safe haven for investors.",
      "The self declared iron chancellor remains very attached to stability. But zero growth is a form of stability too. In choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some very tricky navigation - and it will make some big domestic political waves too.",

    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said on Wednesday that \"economic growth is the number one mission of this government\" as she unveiled a series of proposals to boost the UK's economy.",
      "But how quickly could the government get growth from the plans she announced?",
      "Critics have argued some of the projects - such as expanding Heathrow  - would not help in the near term.",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers and claims.",
      "How slow is the UK's growth?",
      "The most recent official data shows there was virtually no growth in GDP - the overall size of the UK economy - between the July 2024 election and November 2024.",
      "And the latest medium term official growth forecast from the Office for Budget Responsiblity, the government's official forecaster, is for 1.6% GDP growth in 2029, which would be well below the pre-2008 financial crisis average growth of 2.8% a year.",
      "However, the International Monetary Fund has forecast that the UK's growth rate for 2025 and 2026 will be higher than in France and Germany.",
      "Lower rates of GDP growth would translate into slower growth in our wages and incomes and general living standards.",
      "Heathrow expansion",
      "The chancellor said that allowing Heathrow to build a third runway would \"create 100,000 jobs\", boost investment and exports and \"unlock futher growth\".",
      "She cited a new report by the consultancy Frontier Economics which found it could increase the UK's potential GDP by 2050 by 0.43%, around \u00a317bn.",
      "That is broadly in line with the findings of an independent commission by Sir Howard Davies in 2015, which concluded a third runway at Heathrow would support UK trade and enhance productivity and push up GDP by 0.65-0.75% by 2050 relative to otherwise.",
      "However, most analysts believe it would likely take many years before shovels went into the ground to start building a new runway, even with new reforms to speed up the planning process.",
      "And the government will have a difficult balancing act to both expand Heathrow and meet its climate goals.",
      "BBC Verify asked the Treasury for its source for the 100,000 jobs figure and it pointed to a 2017 report by the Department for Transport estimating that a new runway at Heathrow could add between 57,000 and 114,000 additional local jobs. Though that report added that \"these jobs are not additional at the national level, as some jobs may have been displaced from other airports or other sectors.\"",
      "Oxford-Cambridge Growth Corridor",
      "The chancellor in her speech claimed an Oxford and Cambridge Growth Corridor \"could add up to \u00a378bn to the UK economy by 2035\".",
      "This corridor is a resurrection of the previous government's plans to join Oxford and Cambridge with new transport links and allow those two university and research hubs to expand.",
      "In support of the chancellor's figure, the Treasury has cited research by an industry group called the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster.",
      "This research shows that this \u00a378bn is a \"cumulative figure\" over 10 years, not the boost in a given year.",
      "The analysis suggests the project could add \u00a325bn in Gross Value Added (GVA) a year to the UK economy by 2035.",
      "That would constitute roughly a permanent 1% boost to UK GDP by that date.",
      "Estimates of the impacts of an infrastructure project on growth are inherently uncertain and very sensitive to the assumptions of researchers about what would have happened to growth if it had never been built.",
      "Yet most economists do believe infrastructure projects, especially those that allow already productive places to expand, will ultimately help the UK economy grow more rapidly than otherwise.",
      "Ben Caswell, a senior economist at The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), said: \"Big infrastructure projects typically deliver growth over the long term, approximately 10 to 20 years.\"",
      "\"There may be a small demand side boost in the short term when shovels are in the ground, but nothing so significant that you would see it in headline GDP growth figures.",
      "\"However, after the project is complete, the supply capacity of the economy is permanently enhanced, and, all other things equal, that delivers higher sustained GDP growth than would have otherwise been.\"",
      "Pensions reform",
      "Another reform the chancellor says will be pro-growth is enabling UK companies to access the funds from their \"defined benefit pension\" pots, held on behalf of their workforces to fund their retirement.",
      "Defined benefit pension schemes guarantee an annual pension payment to retired workers, based on their salary while they were in work.",
      "Many of these defined benefit pension pots have moved into surplus in recent years due to the rise in interest rates since the pandemic, meaning their financial assets (their investments) are greater than their financial liabilities (what they have to pay out to pensioners).",
      "The Treasury has said that approximately 75% of schemes are now in surplus and that the total surplus adds up to \u00a3160bn.",
      "The chancellor wants to legislate to allow the firms to use these funds to invest, while keeping safeguards to protect and guarantee workers' pension pay-outs.",
      "Pension shake-up plan aims to boost growthWhat's the plan for a third runway at Heathrow Airport?At a glance: What was in Rachel Reeves's speech?",
      "Pension shake-up plan aims to boost growth",
      "What's the plan for a third runway at Heathrow Airport?",
      "At a glance: What was in Rachel Reeves's speech?",
      "Measuring the size of the surplus of defined benefit scheme depends on various complex assumptions about the scheme and its relationship to the employer.",
      "The official Pension Regulator estimates that on one measurement the size in September 2024 was \u00a3207bn, but \u00a3137bn on a different measurement.",
      "The Treasury's estimate is roughly midway between the two.",
      "If such sums were deployed that could, in theory, make a positive difference to overall UK business investment, which is regarded by economists as both a short term and a long term driver of GDP growth.",
      "Total business investment in 2023, according to official data, was \u00a3258bn.",
      "But the size of any boost from this pension reform would depend on companies being willing to invest their surpluses, which is subject to great uncertainty as many firms have been looking to offload their defined benefit pension schemes to insurance companies in recent years.",

      "A Labour government gives the green light to a third runway at Heathrow.",
      "The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, and other cabinet ministers are reportedly uneasy about the environmental implications but bite their tongues publicly.",
      "Green-minded Labour MPs or those with constituencies under the flight path are furious.",
      "Those sentences were as true in January 2009 as they are in January 2025.",
      "In the event the third runway was dropped, then fitfully revived, by the Conservatives.",
      "You could be forgiven for thinking this is just the same debate all over again.",
      "Reeves backs third Heathrow runway in growth push",
      "Faisal Islam: Reeves plans will boost UK but it will take time",
      "Will London's MPs have a change of heart over third runway?",
      "Yet ask Labour MPs - and only 33 are still around now who were in parliament back in 2009 - and many are adamant that there is a very big difference.",
      "Like Rachel Reeves, these MPs believe the parlous state of the economy requires this project to finally get going, and to get going quickly.",
      "Many of those Labour MPs most in favour of what the chancellor has said in her speech on economic growth are part of the Labour Growth Group, a new alliance formed last year to push the government to deliver major infrastructure projects and housebuilding as fast as possible.",
      "MP Chris Curtis, the group's co-chair, told the BBC: \"Anyone worrying about the opposition the Chancellor will face should know there's more than 100 MPs in the Labour Growth Group who are ready to back her every step of the way in bringing this bold vision to life.\"",
      "He added: \"This speech was bullish and that's exactly what it needed to be \u2013 bullish on the potential of our economy and in taking on those who will stand in the way of realising that potential.\"",
      "It is clear this afternoon that one person determined to stand in the way of Heathrow expansion is Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London. His instant restatement of his opposition to the scheme  - because of its \"severe impact\" on noise, air pollution and climate change  - may well embolden Labour critics in the House of Commons, including within the government.",
      "One senior government source insisted this morning that Reeves's decision to publicly invite Heathrow to submit an application should be seen as just that - an invitation that will kick off a long process with plenty more opportunities for internal opponents to make their case.",
      "Some inside Labour argue that there is a generational divide within the party on many controversial growth issues, including this one.",
      "One member of the 2024 Labour intake told me this afternoon that they expected opposition to Heathrow expansion among Labour MPs to be limited mostly to \"nimby boomers\".",
      "Opponents of the runway insist the generational split will prove to be the other way round, citing the concerns of young voters about the environment.",
      "Of course, Heathrow was not the only meaty part of the chancellor's speech. There is some private unease among Labour MPs who represent seats in the Midlands and the north of England that the projects are mostly, but not all, located in the south.",
      "Even one Labour MP for a seat in the south of England urged the government to talk not only about the benefits of the developments to Oxford and Cambridge, but also to stress the benefits for the communities in between the two cities  - noting acidly that Reeves, Sir Keir Starmer and all the previous five Conservative prime ministers went to Oxford University.",
      "While the response of Labour MPs will play a big role in determining how Reeves's speech is assessed in Westminster, the actual delivery of her plans will rely in large part on private finance and local government.",
      "The entire speech was designed to boost business confidence in Britain's prospects. The decisions firms make over the coming weeks, months and years will help to show whether that was a success.",
      "When it comes to local government, some of the signs are not auspicious.",
      "The BBC revealed last month that local councils, many of them Labour-led, had told the government its housebuilding plans were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "Ministers are eager to strike devolution deals across the country but in some areas on the growth corridor this is proving complicated.",
      "More housebuilding will also require new Labour MPs, many of whom claimed long-term Conservative seats in last year's election landslide, to face down local campaigners arguing against development and argue for prioritising growth instead.",
      "It was striking this afternoon how many centre-right think tanks, disappointed by the pace of building projects under the Conservatives, praised Reeves's approach this afternoon.",
      "Even among those most supportive of Reeves's agenda, some argue that plans for long-term growth need to be accompanied by short-term ways to boost Britons' living standards.",
      "The prime minister's \"plan for change\" shift at the end of last year was in part an attempt to move the main focus of the government away from targeting GDP and towards \"milestones\" tangible to people's everyday lives.",
      "One Labour adviser said: \"We need to do what we did today, but that's not about winning the next election. For that we need to give the voters we need to keep what they want and need.\""

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 00:45:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Some scientists fear the risk of a collapse to warm Atlantic currents has not been taken seriously.",
    "story": [
      "Of all the possible climate futures, there's a scenario where the United Kingdom and north-west Europe buck the trend of global warming and instead face plunging temperatures and freezing winters.",
      "It's not the most likely outcome, but a number of scientists fear that the chance of it happening is growing, and that the consequences would be so great that it deserves proper consideration.",
      "They are concerned that the ocean currents that bring warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic could weaken - or even collapse - in response to climate change.",
      "Huge uncertainties remain about when - or even whether - a collapse could happen. So, how likely is it, and what would it mean?",
      "The system of Atlantic currents, called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), is a key reason why the UK is warmer than Moscow, despite being a similar distance from the Equator.",
      "Forming a vital part of our climate system, this conveyor belt distributes energy around the planet, bringing warm, salty water from the tropical Atlantic to cooler regions south of Greenland and Iceland, and also the Nordic Seas.",
      "The warmth from the ocean is transferred to the air above it, helping keep temperatures milder than they otherwise would be.",
      "As this salty water cools, it becomes denser, and sinks, before flowing back towards the southern hemisphere as a deep ocean current. This water eventually gets pulled back up to the surface, and the circulation continues.",
      "But Amoc appears to be getting weaker.",
      "We don't know for sure, because direct and continuous measurements of Amoc strength have only been taken since 2004. That's not long enough to be able to identify a definite change.",
      "But indirect evidence suggests it could have already slowed by around 15% over the last couple of centuries, although not all scientists agree.",
      "One indication is the sediments on the ocean floor. Larger grains indicate a stronger current. By measuring the size of the grains and calculating their age, scientists can estimate how much Amoc has slowed over time.",
      "Another piece of evidence is the so-called 'cold blob' or 'warming hole' in the north Atlantic. This describes a region which appears to have cooled in recent decades, unlike the vast majority of the world.",
      "A slowdown in Amoc - meaning less warmer water would be transported to this region - is seen as a possible culprit.",
      "This is \"a very clear signature and footprint of a classic Amoc slowdown\" says Matthew England, professor of oceanography at the University of New South Wales.",
      "The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects Amoc to weaken this century. But the major concern is that Amoc could suddenly \"switch off\", as appears to have happened repeatedly in the Earth's past.",
      "Today, global warming appears to be making the water in the north Atlantic less salty, due to extra freshwater from a melting Greenland ice sheet and more rainfall.",
      "As fresher water doesn't sink as easily, this is expected to slow the circulation and so bring less saltwater northwards from the tropics.",
      "Beyond a \"tipping point\", this loop could lead Amoc to runaway collapse.",
      "\"We really want to avoid a tipping point because then there's nothing we can do about it,\" warns David Thornalley, professor of ocean and climate science at University College London.",
      "Where might the tipping point be?",
      "No one really knows how close it may be.",
      "In 2021, the IPCC said it had \"medium confidence\" that Amoc would not collapse abruptly this century, although it expected it to weaken.",
      "But some more recent studies have pointed to a growing possibility of Amoc passing a tipping point in the coming decades, beyond which full collapse would be inevitable.",
      "Each study comes with various caveats and uncertainties, and different climate models can give different results for a system as complex as Amoc.",
      "\"We don't believe the idea of an Amoc collapse this century has substantially changed because of these new results,\" cautions Dr Laura Jackson, oceanographer at the Met Office.",
      "But many scientists are growing increasingly concerned. Prof Thornalley argues that, whatever the imperfections of individual studies, taken together they \"lead to a conclusion that we maybe need to be worried\".",
      "Following the new evidence, more than 40 leading ocean and climate scientists signed an open letter last October calling for wider recognition of the \"greatly underestimated\" risks.",
      "That is not to say the signatories believe Amoc will pass a tipping point this century. But they warn it is now enough of a possibility to warrant proper consideration.",
      "\"I'd say you're looking at a risk of reaching a tipping point in the coming decades that could be at the 10 or 20% level even if we hold the line at 2C warming [above temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate],\" warns Tim Lenton, professor of Earth system science at the University of Exeter.",
      "Given the magnitude of the consequences from Amoc collapse, these probabilities \"are not trivial,\" he adds.",
      "What would happen if Amoc collapsed?",
      "Even the most likely scenario - where Amoc continues to weaken this century - could have serious effects.",
      "\"If the Amoc gradually weakens over the next century, you're going to get global warming but less warming over Europe,\" says Dr Jackson.",
      "That would still mean the UK getting hotter summers with climate change, but a weaker Amoc could also fuel more winter storms as regional temperature patterns change.",
      "A full-scale collapse, meanwhile, would be \"like a war situation [\u2026] something almost unimaginable,\" says Prof Lenton.",
      "While it could take a century or more for impacts to play out, temperatures in northern Europe could fall by a couple of degrees a decade.",
      "In the UK, it could \"become horribly, horribly cold \u2026 like living in northern Norway,\" Prof Thornalley warns.",
      "\"Our infrastructure is not set up for that.\"",
      "There could be global consequences too, such as shifts to the tropical rain belts.",
      "\"That's a big story,\" warns Prof Lenton.",
      "\"If you lost the monsoon or seriously disrupted it, you'd have humanitarian catastrophes, in simple terms, in west Africa [and] probably in India.\"",
      "How we prepare for this alternative future poses challenges for governments.",
      "Prof Lenton draws parallels with preparations for the Covid-19 pandemic - another major event which scientists had warned about, but had no way of knowing when it might occur.",
      "But a recent report warned the UK has a \"glaring national security blind spot for climate threats\" such as those posed by Amoc collapse. The government admitted last year that it \"has not assessed the effect of any [Amoc] slowing or collapse\" on economic planning.",
      "Scientists are clear that the fundamental way to reduce these risks is to cut the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change.",
      "\"We're playing a bit of a Russian roulette game,\" warns Prof England.",
      "\"The more we stack up the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, the more we warm the system, the more chance we have of an Amoc slowdown and collapse.",
      "\"And so I think people need to not give up, because there's so much to be gained by reducing emissions.",

      "While they found that infections occurred more often in unvaccinated birds, they also found that in countries with high vaccination rates, there was a higher rate of change in the virus itself.",
      "They said such evolution could, in theory, lead to vaccines needing to be updated frequently to remain effective and to the virus spilling over into unvaccinated populations. They acknowledged that more research was needed to establish whether there was a direct causal link between vaccination and virus evolution.",

    "story": [
      "If you have ever struggled with the sudden shift in routine imposed by the seasonal \"springing forward\" and \"falling backward\" of the clocks, spare a thought for the sled dogs of Ontario, Canada.",
      "Researchers say the time shift is measurably unsettling for those working dogs, whose days are dictated by strict schedules.",
      "When scientists from the University of Toronto put movement sensors on a group of Canadian sled dogs, they saw that the animals were active and moving around almost exactly an hour early - the morning after the clocks went back.",
      "In contrast, pet dogs of the same breeds as the working dogs showed no measurable effect - apparently resting peacefully during their extra hour in bed.",
      "\"I wasn't expecting any differences between the two groups [of dogs],\" said Lavania Nagendran, one of the lead researchers.",
      "\"So it was interesting to see that the dogs were so aligned to their routine.\"",
      "The study, published in the journal PLoS One, is part of a wider project investigating the differences in behaviour between wolves and domestic dogs.",
      "\"Not all animals can just switch up their schedule based on human influences, [like changing the clocks]\" said Ming Fei Li, the co-lead researcher.",
      "She explained that she and her colleagues hoped to learn whether wolves are also able to adjust their activity patterns \u2013 and whether this flexibility evolved naturally in canines, or if it was imposed on dogs when we domesticated them.",
      "Much of the research into the impact of changing the clocks -  on health and sleep - is focused on humans. Previous studies have suggested that the time shift causes disrupted, or fragmented, sleep and that this can last up to a week. Research has even found an increase in fatal traffic accidents immediately after the clocks go back or forward.",
      "This is the first study to investigate its effect in domestic dogs.",
      "The researchers put their motion trackers on 25 sled dogs and 29 pets \u2013 all of which were in or near Ontario, in Canada.",
      "For the sled dogs, the time change was a sudden shift in a strict daily routine. Prior to the clocks going back, handlers would arrive at their kennels at sunrise. The morning when the clocks went back, those sled dogs were up, active and moving around an hour before the handlers appeared.",
      "For most of those working dogs, however, the disruption lasted just a day. The following morning, the majority of the dogs' activity again aligned with the arrival of their human handlers.",
      "However, for pet dogs there was no measurable disruption. After the clocks went back, their activity in the morning seemed to adjust to this new, human-imposed schedule.",
      "\"When we've spoken to pet owners, everyone comments that \u2013 with that hour change - their dog or cat is up in the morning, going crazy, waiting to be fed.",
      "\"But we didn't really find that in pet dogs in our study.\"",
      "The team carried out their research in 2021, when Covid lockdown restrictions were in place in Canada. So they advertised for pet-owning participants, who had huskies or malamutes, to join their study remotely.",
      "\"They were amazing,\" recalled Li. \"They'd ask us questions, put the trackers we sent them by post on their dogs' [collars], most of them kept really good notes.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 22:11:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Scientists say the fires that engulfed Los Angeles were made 35% more likely due to climate warming.",
    "story": [
      "Climate change was a major factor behind the hot, dry weather that gave rise to the devastating LA fires, a scientific study has confirmed.",
      "It made those weather conditions about 35% more likely, according to World Weather Attribution - globally recognised for their studies linking extreme weather to climate change.",
      "The authors noted that the LA wildfire season is getting longer while the rains that normally put out the blazes have reduced.",
      "The scientists highlight that these wildfires are highly complex with multiple factors playing a role, but they are confident that a warming climate is making LA more prone to intense fire events.",
      "\"Climate change increased the risk of the devastating LA wildfires,\" said Dr Clair Barnes, from Imperial College London, the study's lead author.",
      "\"Drought conditions are more frequently pushing into winter, increasing the chance a fire will break out during strong Santa Ana winds that can turn small ignitions into deadly infernos.\"",
      "The Santa Ana winds are strong and gusty east or north-easterly winds that blow from inland California towards the coast.",
      "What are Santa Ana winds and how are they fuelling LA wildfires?",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Four ways climate change worsens extreme weather",
      "Around 30 people have died and more than 10,000 homes have been destroyed in the fast-spreading, destructive fires that broke out in early January.",
      "This new study looks at what are termed the fire-prone conditions that can lead to dangerous conflagrations.",
      "It's been carried out by a team of researchers from World Weather Attribution (WWA), a global group that publishes rapid analyses of climate-related weather events.",
      "They use climate models to simulate how the warming that has occurred since the middle of the 19th century is influencing heatwaves, droughts, floods and fires.",
      "The widespread burning of coal, oil and gas in the wake of the industrial revolution has driven billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere.",
      "Acting like a blanket, these gases have driven up temperatures by around 1.2C since then.",
      "By using climate models and statistical methods along with real world observations, the WWA group have been able to show how much of an influence climate warming has had on extreme events.",
      "In the case of the LA fires, they found that the hot, dry conditions that drove them are expected to occur once every 17 years.",
      "This is an increase in likelihood of around 35% compared to a world that hadn't experienced warming.",
      "\"We actually see that the models show very much the same results that the [real world] observations have,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, the head of World Weather Attribution.",
      "\"So there, in this combined index, we are quite confident about the result... we have actually a signal that we can say that we definitely can attribute that, also quantitatively.\"",
      "The researchers also examined other important variables that can lead to wildfire including the length of the fire season.",
      "By analysing weather observations, the scientists found that this has increased by around 23 days since the world began warming, around 1850.",
      "The team say that this means the dry conditions and the Santa Ana winds that are crucial for the spread of fires, are increasingly overlapping.",
      "Another key element is drought.",
      "Dry conditions in the LA area over the October to December period are now about 2.4 times more likely than before humans starting using fossil fuels on a large scale.",
      "The researchers are clear that climate change increased the probability of the hot, dry conditions that gave rise to the fires.",
      "However, the authors are more cautious about the link between rising temperatures and the longer fire season or decreased rainfall, saying that the models did not show a significant connection.",
      "Despite these reservations, the conclusion is that a warmer world increased the chances of the devastating wildfires occurring - as more fossil fuels continue to be burnt, those chances will continue to rise.",
      "\"Overall the paper finds that climate change has made the Los Angeles fires more likely despite some statistical uncertainty,\" said Prof Gabi Hegerl, from the University of Edinburgh, who was not part of the study team.",
      "\"This is a carefully researched result that should be taken seriously,\" she said in a statement.",
      "The new work builds on research that was published while the fires were still burning fiercely.",
      "That study linked the wildfires to what's termed \"climate whiplash.\"",
      "The idea is that very wet years are followed almost immediately by very dry ones, which increases the risk of fires.",
      "This is what happened in LA, when two wet winters were followed by an extremely dry autumn and winter this year \u2013 the wet weather promoted the growth of grass and shrubs that became the fuel for the fires that took off in the gusting Santa Ana winds.",

    "summary": "Yvette Cooper says the UK will make it illegal to own AI tools to make images of child sexual abuse.",
    "story": [
      "Four new laws will tackle the threat of child sexual abuse images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), the government has announced.",
      "The Home Office says that, to better protect children, the UK will be the first country in the world to make it illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to create child sexual abuse material (CSAM), with a punishment of up to five years in prison.",
      "Possessing AI paeodophile manuals will also be made illegal, and offenders will get up to three years in prison. These manuals teach people how to use AI to sexually abuse young people.",
      "\"We know that sick predators' activities online often lead to them carrying out the most horrific abuse in person,\" said Home Secretary Yvette Cooper.",
      "\"This government will not hesitate to act to ensure the safety of children online by ensuring our laws keep pace with the latest threats.\"",
      "The other laws include making it an offence to run websites where paedophiles can share child sexual abuse content or provide advice on how to groom children. That would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "And the Border Force will be given powers to instruct individuals who they suspect of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection when they attempt to enter the UK, as CSAM is often filmed abroad. Depending on the severity of the images, this will be punishable by up to three years in prison.",
      "Artificially generated CSAM involves images that are either partly or completely computer generated. Software can \"nudify\" real images and replace the face of one child with another, creating a realistic image.",
      "In some cases, the real-life voices of children are also used, meaning innocent survivors of abuse are being re-victimised.",
      "Fake images are also being used to blackmail children and force victims into further abuse.",
      "The National Crime Agency (NCA) said it makes around 800 arrests each month relating to threats posed to children online. It said 840,000 adults are a threat to children nationwide - both online and offline - which makes up 1.6% of the adult population.",
      "Cooper said: \"These four new laws are bold measures designed to keep our children safe online as technologies evolve.",
      "\"It is vital that we tackle child sexual abuse online as well as offline so we can better protect the public,\" she added.",

      "Prof Clare McGlynn, an expert in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and online abuse, said the changes were \"welcome\" but that there were \"significant gaps\".",
      "The government should ban \"nudify\" apps and tackle the \"normalisation of sexual activity with young-looking girls on the mainstream porn sites\", she said, describing these videos as \"simulated child sexual abuse videos\".",
      "These videos \"involve adult actors but they look very young and are shown in children's bedrooms, with toys, pigtails, braces and other markers of childhood,\" she said. \"This material can be found with the most obvious search terms and legitimises and normalises child sexual abuse. Unlike in many other countries, this material remains lawful in the UK.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) warns that more sexual abuse AI images of children are being produced, with them becoming more prevalent on the open web.",
      "The charity's latest data shows reports of CSAM have risen 380% with 245 confirmed reports in 2024 compared with 51 in 2023. Each report can contain thousands of images.",
      "In research last year it found that over a one-month period, 3,512 AI child sexual abuse and exploitation images were discovered on one dark website. Compared with a month in the previous year, the number of the most severe category images (Category A) had risen by 10%.",
      "Experts say AI CSAM can often look incredibly realistic, making it difficult to tell the real from the fake.",
      "The interim chief executive of the IWF, Derek Ray-Hill, said: \"The availability of this AI content further fuels sexual violence against children.",
      "\"It emboldens and encourages abusers, and it makes real children less safe. There is certainly more to be done to prevent AI technology from being exploited, but we welcome [the] announcement, and believe these measures are a vital starting point.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 00:18:27 GMT",
    "summary": "Many companies have left X but it's not always a simple decision.",
    "story": [
      "On March 21, 2006 the first ever tweet was posted by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey: \"Just setting up my twttr\". It was a simple introduction to a brand new platform.",
      "Backed by celebrities, it was different to other social media sites, like MySpace or Facebook, because you could interact with any user without them having to approve a request. Companies rushed to join the service, hoping to get closer to their customers.",
      "\"If you were a brand that wanted to be part of any cultural moments that were happening, Twitter was a great place to be,\" Alex Wilson, a senior strategist at the marketing agency Pitch tells BBC News.",
      "On June 4, 2010 Elon Musk, the owner of Space X, logged on for the first time: \"Please ignore prior tweets, as that was someone pretending to be me :) This is actually me.\"",
      "Twelve years later he would buy the platform for $44bn (\u00a338.1bn), reshape the algorithm, reinstate banned accounts, repurpose the policy around \"free speech\", and rename it X.",
      "He also fired thousands of staff - around 80% of the workforce.",
      "Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed \"the great X-odus\".",
      "One of their main concerns was the content that would be seen around their posts that users could screengrab and share.",
      "For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.",
      "More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy.",
      "In particular, his posts on the subject of grooming gangs put pressure on the government, which announced a review of the issue.",
      "\"There is no doubt that Musk's ownership of X is having an impact on public opinion in the UK,\" Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common tells BBC News.",
      "However, according to More In Common, only 16% of Brits believe his interventions are designed to achieve justice for victims, whereas 44% think he is doing it for attention, and his approval rating with the British public sits at -35.",
      "The changing tone of X and the controversy surrounding its owner have spurred some firms to leave the platform and others have pulled their advertising as well.",
      "At the end of 2023 firms including Apple, IBM and Disney paused advertisement on the platform.",
      "Others brands including Unilever and Mars were sued by Mr Musk, who accused them of unlawfully agreeing to boycott the site.",
      "\"It's broadly fair to say Twitter is becoming less relevant across the world,\" Mr Wilson says in the Pitch office in central London, with posters of clients ranging from charities, telecommunications, and sports leagues.",
      "\"It's been a very long time since clients came to us and say: 'Twitter's fun and exciting. We want to be in that space'.",
      "\"Unless you are targeting specific audiences, maybe certain political audiences or sports  - football is still big on Twitter - it's hard to see the value in it.\"",
      "Trump's election victory has prompted other organisations to leave X, with others considering their positions as Mr Musk's influence in the White House grows.",
      "Beginning in 2013, German football team FC St Pauli, which plays in Germany's top league, the Bundesliga, posted more than 60,000 times, racking up nearly 250,000 followers.",
      "But less than 10 days after Trump's return to the White House was confirmed, the club posted: \"You can find our statement about saying goodbye to X on BlueSky. Feel free to follow us there. We're out of here.\"",
      "\"We discussed the decision for a year. We were mostly posting content with counter speech to hate. We had a lot of content for diversity, anti-racism, and anti-sexism,\" club spokesperson, Patrick Gensing told the BBC.",
      "\"We have seen assaults on X, antisemitism, conspiracy theories,\" he says.",
      "The argument that such posts are justified by freedom of speech, does not convince him.",
      "\"We don't think racism is freedom of speech,\" says Mr Gensing.",
      "One of the most recent departures from X was by the UK arm of BMW. In late January it announced it was no longer posting on X and directed people to its posts on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "There's no definitive way to know how many brands are choosing to leave or reduce their posts on the platform.",
      "When approached, X did not respond to the points raised in this article. But last year Mr Musk claimed X had 600 million monthly active users, and said the platform maintains its \"purpose is to serve the public conversation\".",
      "Mr Musk \"has been clear that X is willing to make trade-offs to adopt a more open, less moderated approach compared to Twitter\", says Goran Calic, visiting scholar at Harvard Business School.",
      "But leaving X can have negative consequences for organisations and their relationships with customers.",
      "\"When users leave, the impact depends on who is leaving and why. A local authority posting news provides significant value to the network. If such an account leaves, it can hurt both the platform and its users,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"Users protesting by leaving should weigh the broader social implications of staying versus exiting.\"",
      "For some organisations who need to get their message out quickly, X still has value that other competitors simply can't offer.",
      "\"For us there is still that value [on being on X],\" says Andrew Cassidy, senior director of digital strategy and engagement at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).",
      "\"We try to match where our riders are. When people are tweeting at the MBTA someone can provide a definitive answer in the moment. Our broadcasting system is exclusively tied into our X account, but we still field customer service questions across other platforms.\"",
      "\"Our focus is providing customer service to the largest number of riders that we possibly can,\" Mr Cassidy says.",
      "\"With the current landscape being what it is, X still feeds that need.\"",
      "It's \"unthinkable\", Mr Gensing explains, not to have a presence on social media in 2025.",
      "\"We have to view all the platforms critically, it's not only X. The companies behind them set up the rules of the game and they can change them.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:01:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The founders of important open source software are getting older, who will take over?",
    "story": [
      "Many of us have prepared instructions and critical information for our family in the event of our sudden demise. For Daniel Stenberg, that includes passwords for his Google and GitHub accounts.",
      "That\u2019s because he\u2019s the founder of curl, an open source internet transfer engine that has been downloaded billions of times and is used to transfer data to and from computer servers.",
      "It was first released by Mr Stenberg in 1996 and is now used by millions every day.",
      "It's important that someone is able to maintain curl when he steps away.",
      "\u201cI just want to make sure that everything is there so the day I go away, someone can take over,\u201d Mr Stenberg says.",
      "It\u2019s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system \u2013 and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free.",
      "The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today\u2019s technology landscape.",
      "In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master\u2019s thesis. \u201cMy concern was graduating,\u201d he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project.",
      "Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark.",
      "\u201cWe're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,\u201d he says.",
      "While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That\u2019s not just because they\u2019ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.",
      "But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.",
      "Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work after all.",
      "Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the \u201ckernel maintainers are aging\u201d.",
      "Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK\u2019s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades.",
      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",
      "This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it\u2019s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to help STEM talent flight,\u201d Miss Brock adds. \u201cBecause people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they\u2019re in.\u201d",
      "Degioanni is more sanguine. Even if there\u2019s \u201cprobably less visceral enthusiasm\u201d for the concept of open source, he says, the fundamental idea of being able to modify software is now a given.",
      "And, he continues, \u201cI've worked with open source my whole life. I've created my own projects. I've seen people join the projects that I created. I've seen people start their own open source projects.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, he says, there is a \u201cjoy, especially for a young person\u201d in creating software, seeing it being used and sparking a community.",
      "\u201cThat feeling doesn't get old,\u201d he says. Even if the pioneers who popularized the earliest open source projects do.",

      "\"Today's tariff announcement is necessary to hold China, Mexico, and Canada accountable for their promises to halt the flood of poisonous drugs into the United States,\" the White House said in a statement on X on Saturday.",
      "Trump posted on his Truth Social platform: \"This was done through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.\"",
      "In practical terms, a tariff is a domestic tax levied on goods as they enter the country, proportional to the value of the import.",

      "The BBC could not independently verify reports of casualties.",
      "Trump did not name any of the people targeted in strikes.",
      "The president ended the post with: \"The message to ISIS and all others who would attack Americans is that \"WE WILL FIND YOU, AND WE WILL KILL YOU!\"",

      "The post also said the latest operation \"reinforces the strong security partnership between Somalia and the United States in combating extremist threats\".",
      "In a statement, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said \"our initial assessment is that multiple operatives were killed in the airstrikes and no civilians were harmed\".",
      "Hegseth said the strikes \"further degrade\" the ability of IS \"to plot and conduct terrorist attacks\" and \"sends a clear signal that the United States always stands ready to find and eliminate terrorists\".",
      "He said the strikes were carried out in the Golis mountains, in north-east Somalia.",
      "The government of Puntland, a region of north-east Somalia, thanked \"international friends\" who participated in the airstrikes that \"killed high-ranking members\" of IS.",
      "IS rose to international prominence in the 2010s, particularly in Syria and Iraq, but now its presence is mainly restricted to parts of Africa.",
      "The Somali branch of IS was formed in 2015 by a group of defectors from the al-Qaeda affiliated al-Shabab group - the largest jihadist group in Somalia.",
      "IS in Somalia is notorious for extorting locals and mainly carries out small-scale, sporadic attacks, according to the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "Trump in his statement on Saturday also took a swipe at the former administration, stating the US military had targeted this particular IS planner for years, but accused Joe Biden \"and his cronies\" of not acting quickly enough \"to get the job done. I did!\"",
      "US forces killed IS leader, Bilal al-Sudani, and 10 of his operatives in a remote mountainous cave in northern Somalia in 2023, in an operation ordered by Biden.",
      "One of the last actions Trump took when he left the White House in 2020 was to pull hundreds of US troops out of Somalia. He has now ordered the first attacks on the nation less than two weeks after his return.",
      "Trump maintains he does not want the US involved in other countries' conflicts, while Biden had wanted to wind down America's involvement in post 9/11 conflicts.",
      "But Somalia is seen differently by Washington. The US has invested massively in the country for decades, to contain the threat posed by al-Shabab.",
      "Trump ordered strikes in his first term, despite pulling troops out in the eleventh hour of his presidency. Biden reversed that decision when he took over in 2021 in order to keep a continuous US presence. So far in his second term, Trump has kept troops there.",
      "But it is likely he may eventually take a different approach, not just on Somalia but the African continent as a whole. His former defence secretary, Mark Esper, said in his memoir that Trump \"didn't see much value\" in having any Americans \u2013 military personnel or diplomats \u2013 anywhere on the continent.",
      "This may be more so the case with Somalia where al-Shabab are seemingly growing more resilient, and the US may decide it is not worth it.",
      "Trump 1.0 saw him de-prioritising US outreach to Africa - he hosted two Sub-Saharan African leaders but never visited the continent.",

    "summary": "The success of SpaceX and other private-sector space firms is throwing up hard questions about America's \"great national treasure\".",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire businessman Jared Isaacman has a big vision for the future of humanity.",
      "He set off on his first mission to space in 2021 \u2013 a private journey he paid an estimated $200m (\u00a3160m) for \u2013 and announced that he wanted space travel to be for the masses, not only for the 600 who have experienced it to date \u2013 most of them professional astronauts employed by Nasa and the wealthy.",
      "\"We want it to be 600,000,\" he told reporters.",
      "Later, he added: \"I drank the Kool-Aid in terms of the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species\u2026 I think that we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft.\"",
      "Mr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (\u00a31.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fuelled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space.",
      "Since then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule and performing the first commercial spacewalk.",
      "During the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock.",
      "The photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic \u2013 it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology.",
      "And yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still \u2013 being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa.",
      "The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do \u2013 especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX owner Elon Musk to a government role to cut $2 trillion (\u00a31.6 trillion) off the Federal budget.",
      "The Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses \u2013 but also the implications for the space agency if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa's greater use of the private sector.",
      "Brink of a second space age?",
      "In the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs.",
      "Despite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values.",
      "And yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space.",
      "They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.",
      "On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. \"This second space age has only just begun,\" he wrote.",
      "\"There will inevitably be a thriving space economy \u2013 one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space\u2026 At Nasa, we will\u2026 usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.\"",
      "Many presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, but Trump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan.",
      "But since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets.",
      "That is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank.",
      "\"You have a government looking to slash,\" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. \"If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget\u2026",
      "\"This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table.\"",
      "Future of Nasa's moon rocket",
      "One of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (\u00a33.3bn) for each and every launch.",
      "By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (\u00a380m) per launch \u2013 and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (\u00a38m) as he develops his system.",
      "Bezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (\u00a354.5m).",
      "Competition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further.",
      "Starship and New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But \"that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs\", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University.",
      "\"SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,\" he continues. \"They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs.",
      "\"A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way.",
      "\"There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future.\"",
      "Questions around spiralling costs",
      "The OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: \"Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs.",
      "\"Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (\u00a320bn) for key activities\".",
      "Nasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration \u2013 some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (\u00a3800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 \u2013 but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of \"the telescope that ate astronomy\".",
      "(Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.)",
      "It was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s.",
      "Nasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US.",
      "But the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. \"Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue.\"",
      "New light on the 'old way of doing things'",
      "The current model is to give so-called \"cost-plus\" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit.",
      "The model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that took Apollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns.",
      "Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things.",
      "\"We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things.\"",
      "Moves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget.",
      "Among those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo.",
      "The heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job.",
      "SpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years \u2013 only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station.",
      "The ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule.",
      "\"Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,\" says Prof Logsdon. \"So, shaking up the system is very positive.\"",
      "On the brink of a big shakeup?",
      "Prof Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS \"outrageously expensive\" and said that the major aerospace contractors are \"incentivised to be economically inefficient\".",
      "But changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (\u00a320bn) annual budget.",
      "\"Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,\" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress.",
      "Although Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.",
      "The creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt.",
      "\"The old way of doing things gave us a lot of success, so you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There will be significant change, but not the radical change that Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman want to see,\" argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"There is a delicate balance between the interests of Nasa, Congress and the White House.\"",
      "Where that balance will fall will emerge in the coming months: some are speculating that the return-to-the-Moon programme might be scrapped altogether in favour of going straight to Mars, as President Trump alluded to during his inauguration, with the greatest proponent of that policy \u2013 Musk \u2013 seated nearby.",
      "Others fear cuts in Nasa's Earth Observation programmes, which monitor and model environmental changes from space, and include the impact of climate change; and some worry that the robotic scientific missions to other planets might be cut back to boost efforts for the human spaceflight programme.",
      "Where SpaceX fits in",
      "There is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (\u00a316bn) in contracts from government since 2008.",
      "But if SLS is scrapped, and SpaceX were to receive the lion's share of Nasa's Moon programme work, Mr Musk's firm stands to receive contracts that might be ten or even a hundred times greater, possibly at the expense of other private-sector players.",
      "And there are many innovative US start-up companies hoping to build parts for spacecraft and infrastructure in Nasa's return-to-the-Moon programme, including Texas-based Firefly, which has a spacecraft on its way to land on the Moon in March.",
      "But industry analysts say that the US government has a long tradition of breaking up monopolies so that they don't stifle innovation. And in any case, just because Mr Isaacman has worked with Mr Musk, it does not mean that any outcome is inevitable, argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"Isaacman is his own man,\" he adds. \"He is not a disciple of Elon Musk.\"",
      "Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution",
      "Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this time",
      "Future of space travel: Could robots really replace human astronauts?",
      "Ultimately, however, it has become painfully clear, even to Nasa's most ardent supporters, that it needs saving from itself. And the need for Nasa reform is not a partisan issue \u2013 Democrat and Republican presidents alike have set the wheels in motion.",
      "But the coincidental timing of the success of SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private-sector space firms with a new administration impatient to cut costs and energise the private sector means that Mr Isaacman has a unique opportunity to make some of the biggest changes to Nasa since its inception.",
      "\"Nasa truly is a crown jewel, and we aren't doing what we should be doing on behalf of the American people,\" argued former deputy head of Nasa Lori Garver during the Space News webinar. \"That is frustrating for all of us.\"",
      "Asked if a private sector billionaire was the right person to be entrusted with one of America's greatest national treasures, Ms Garver responded: \"Jared is a patriot, and he is doing this for public service.",
      "\"The truth of Jared agreeing has something to do with him willing to take on these hard things \u2013 and there are so many hard things\".",

      "Some of the children who were adopted within the church have told us they were then subjected to abuse and neglect in their adoptive families.",
      "The claims follow a BBC investigation last year into allegations of child sexual abuse spanning decades within the church, which is believed to have up to 100,000 members worldwide and is often referred to as The Truth or the Two by Twos. The FBI has since launched an investigation.",
      "Warning: this story contains details some may find distressing.",

    "story": [
      "There is a good chance that inside your mobile phone is a miniscule amount of a metal that started its journey buried in the earth of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where a war is currently raging.",
      "It may even be directly connected to the M23 rebel group that made global headlines this week.",
      "The tantalum within your device weighs less than half of the average garden pea but is essential for the efficient functioning of a smartphone, and almost all other sophisticated electronic devices.",
      "The unique properties of this rare, blue-grey, lustrous metal \u2013 including being able to hold a high charge compared to its size, while operating in a range of temperatures - make it an ideal material for tiny capacitors, which temporarily store energy.",
      "It is also mined in Rwanda, Brazil and Nigeria but at least 40% - and maybe more \u2013 of the element's global supply comes from DR Congo and some of the key mining areas are now under the control of the M23.",
      "The current wave of fighting has been going on for months, but the rebels grabbed attention with Sunday's assault on the vital trading and transport hub of Goma. The city, bordering Rwanda, is a regional centre for the mining business",
      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?",
      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?",
      "Over the past year, the M23 has made rapid advances across the mineral-rich east of DR Congo, taking areas where coltan \u2013 the ore from which tantalum is extracted \u2013 is mined.",
      "Like scores of other armed groups operating in the area, the M23 began as an outfit defending the rights of an ethnic group perceived to be under threat. But as its territory has expanded, mining has become a crucial source of income, paying for fighters and weapons.",
      "Last April, it seized Rubaya, the town at the heart of the country's coltan industry.",
      "Mineral extraction in this region is not in the hands of multinational conglomerates - instead thousands of individuals toil in open pits that honeycomb the landscape, or underground, in extremely unsafe and unhealthy conditions.",
      "They are part of a complex, and yet informal, network that sees the rocks removed from the ground using shovels, brought to the surface, crushed, washed, taxed, sold and then exported to be further purified and eventually smelted.",
      "Once the M23 moved into Rubaya, the rebels established what a UN group of experts described as a \"state-like administration\", issuing permits to the diggers and traders and demanding an annual fee of $25 (\u00a320) and $250 respectively. The M23 doubled the diggers' wages to ensure they would carry on working.",
      "It runs the area as a monopoly making sure \u2013 through the threat of arrest and detention \u2013 that only its authorised traders are able to do business.",
      "The M23 also charges a levy of $7 on each kilogramme of coltan. The UN group of experts estimated that as a result the M23 earns about $800,000 a month from coltan taxation in Rubaya. That money is almost certainly then used to fund the rebellion.",
      "There is a question mark hanging over how the ore extracted from M23-controlled areas gets into the global supply chain.",
      "Neighbouring Rwanda, which is seen as backing the M23, is at the centre of the answer, the UN experts say.",
      "Theoretically, a certification scheme - known as the Innovative Tin Supply Chain Initiative (Itsci) - should mean that what goes into a phone handset and other electronics does not come from areas of conflict where it could be used to fund armed groups responsible for carrying out atrocities.",
      "The US' Dodd-Frank Act passed in 2010, and a similar piece of EU legislation, is aimed at ensuring that companies purchasing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold \u2013 so-called \"conflict minerals\" \u2013 are not inadvertently funding violence.",
      "But Itsci has come under some criticism.",
      "Ken Matthysen, a security and resource management expert with independent research group Ipis, highlights that the dispersed nature of a lot of small-scale mines make it difficult for the local authorities to monitor exactly what is going on everywhere.",
      "Itsci tags should be put on bags at the mine itself, to prove the origin of the minerals inside, but often they get transported to a collection point where it becomes harder to trace where the ore actually came from, Mr Matthysen said.",
      "He added that there is also a possible issue with corruption.",
      "\"There is even an accusation of the state agents selling tags to traders, because they don't make a good living. So the traders then go around eastern DR Congo and they tag the bags themselves.\"",
      "Itsci did not respond to a BBC request for comment, but has in the past defended its record saying that the scheme has been subjected to a rigorous independent audit. It has also been praised for bringing \"prosperity for hundreds of thousands of small-scale miners\".",
      "The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo",
      "The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo",
      "In the case of Rubaya, Itsci suspended its operations there soon after the M23 entered the town.",
      "Nevertheless, the group has managed to continue exporting coltan.",
      "The UN experts map a circuitous route showing how it is transported to close to the Rwandan border. It is then transferred to \"heavy-duty trucks\" that needed the road to be widened in order to accommodate them.",
      "Rwanda has its own coltan mines but the experts say that the uncertified coltan is  mixed with Rwandan production leading to a \"significant contamination of supply chains\".",
      "The M23 was already involved in the coltan business before the capture of Rubaya -  setting up roadblocks and charging fees to cross them, according to Mr Matthysen.",
      "\"A lot of the trade of these minerals went through M23-controlled area towards Rwanda. So even then, Rwanda was profiting from the instability in eastern DR Congo and we saw the export volumes to Rwanda were already increasing,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Figures from the US Geological Survey show that Rwanda's coltan exports rose by 50% between 2022 and 2023. Mr Matthysen said this could not have all come from Rwanda.",
      "In a robust defence of Rwanda's position, government spokesperson Yolande Makolo reiterated to the BBC that there were minerals and refining capacity in her own country.",
      "\"It's very cynical to take an issue like what's happening in eastern DRC, where a persecuted community is fighting for its rights... and turning [it] into an issue of material benefit,\" she added.",
      "Rwandan President Paul Kagame has also dismissed the UN experts' reports, pouring scorn on their \"expertise\".",
      "Much of the east of DR Congo has been blighted by conflict for many years, raising questions about who has been benefitting and whether armed groups are profiting from what is dug out of the ground there.",
      "In order to highlight the issue and its connection to the smartphone industry, the Congolese government filed criminal complaints in France and Belgium at the end of last year against subsidiaries of the tech giant Apple, accusing it of using \"conflict minerals\".",
      "Apple has disputed the allegation and pointed out that since early 2024, because of the escalating conflict and the difficulties of certification, it stopped sourcing tantalum, among other metals, from both DR Congo and Rwanda.",
      "Other companies have not been so clear, which means that as the M23 seizes more territory those small bits of tantalum from the mines that they control could still make their way into the devices that we have come to rely on.",

    "story": [
      "No one at the Skating Club of Boston had any doubt that 13-year-old Jinna Han and 16-year-old Spencer Lane would go far in a sport they had fallen in love with.",
      "Even at a club that has produced countless elite-level skaters - where the competition is as tough as it gets - the two stood out.",
      "\"They had been sought out and identified as the future of the sport,\" the club's CEO Doug Zeghibe told me while standing alongside the rink where the two athletes trained day in and day out.",
      "\"So, to see such promising talents snuffed out, it's hard. They really, truly were on the cusp of greatness and really, finally hitting their goals of representing not just the Skating Club of Boston but representing their country.\"",
      "That talent, on full display in videos that show them both performing with a strength and maturity beyond their ages,  was why they were invited to the High Performance Camp that followed the US National Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, this week.",
      "After the camp, they boarded an American Airlines regional jet on Wednesday evening, planning to fly home to Massachusetts via Washington DC.  They were among the 60 passengers killed when the jet had a mid-air collision with a helicopter and fell into the Potomac River.",
      "Their mothers, Christine Lane and Jin Han, and the club's star coaches Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, were also on board, meaning that six of the crash victims were all connected to the world-renowned skating club.",
      "Skating at such a high level demands a huge commitment, with schoolwork being carried out online after hours on the ice each day.",
      "Inevitably, close relationships develop among coaches and club members alike and, in the face of such a disaster, the clubhouse is a natural place to gather.",
      "Just a few days ago, club members Alisa Efimova and Misha Mitrofanov won the US pairs title in Wichita before taking an earlier flight home.",
      "\"They were just two sunshines that you get the energy from as soon as you see them,\" Efimova told me.",
      "\"Every time I would walk into this ice rink, I would see them in the morning tying their skates, saying, just saying 'hello,' seeing their faces lit up.\"",
      "\"Spencer was a firecracker, that's the best way to put it,\" Mitrofanov added.",
      "\"He started skating fairly later than other skaters, but because of his amazing talent, he progressed so quickly.\"",
      "At the end of a hard day's training, they told me, the two would take their skates off and head upstairs to begin catching up on academic work.",
      "Now, in the club's entrance, photographs capturing them in motion on the ice are surrounded by tributes and flowers. Jinna has her arms outstretched.  Spencer maintains a look of deep focus on his face.",
      "\"You don't expect it,\" Mitrofanov said. \"And when it happens, it breaks you.\"",
      "Coaches Naumov and Shishkova, originally from Russia, were the 1994 world pairs skating champions. They leave a 23-year-old son, Maxim, another promising talent from Boston who finished fourth in the men's competition in Wichita.",
      "In its more than 100 years of history, the club has seen before how success can be quickly overshadowed by tragedy.",
      "It was home to 10 of the 18 members of the US figure skating team killed in a plane crash on the way to the 1961 world championships in Prague.",
      "CEO Zeghibe immediately thought of that crash as he watched the unfolding news on Wednesday night.",

      "The event will be a chance to honour the lives lost, not only from this club. A total of 14 members of the figure skating community were killed in the crash.",
      "\"I think looking to the future is part of the emotional healing process,\" he said, \"and it's good to have things to focus on that are positive for the sport.\"",

      "The helicopter was asked if it had the passenger plane \"in sight\" and to \"pass behind\" it. In the audio that follows, controllers appear to realise there has been a collision and can be heard directing other planes in the air to neighbouring airports.",
      "Mr Butterworth-Hayes said an in-air collision like this requires a number of things going wrong.",
      "He said that in order to fly in civilian airspace, the military helicopter would have needed to be fitted with a transponder alerting surrounding aircraft to its position.",

      "Faithfull was born in Hampstead, London, in December 1946. She was a folk singer who, one day, met with the manager of the Rolling Stones at a party, which led to her recording \"As Tears Go By\" by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in 1964. She was just 17 years old when she recorded the hit single.",

That's why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients. It's more critical than ever for states to step up and protect reproductive freedom \u2014 and I'll never back down from this fight,\" Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Hochul signed the bill protecting doctors from out-of-state lawsuits\u00a0in 2023.",

      "\"Abortion care is health care. The criminalization of abortion care is a direct and brazen attack on Americans' bodily autonomy and their right to reproductive freedom. This cowardly attempt out of Louisiana to weaponize the law against out-of-state providers is unjust and un-American. We will not allow bad actors to undermine our providers' ability to deliver critical care. Medication abortion is safe, effective, and necessary, and New York will ensure that it remains available to all Americans who need it.\"",

      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They're also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \"controlled dangerous substances.\" The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",

      "Washington \u2014 Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' pill, Journavx, for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries.",
      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",
      "Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain.",
      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",
      "Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

    "story": [
      "At Market Basket locations in some parts of Massachusetts, customers are being asked to limit their egg purchases\u00a0to two cartons per family. Another shopper on the hunt for eggs, this one in Las Vegas, reported finding\u00a0empty shelves\u00a0at a local grocery store. On social media, a consumer\u00a0accustomed to paying around $2 for a dozen eggs expressed shock over now having to pay more than double that amount.",
      "Egg restrictions, shortages and record-high prices are ruffling feathers at supermarkets across the U.S. as a deadly strain of avian flu\u00a0continues to decimate\u00a0the country's poultry flocks. To the dismay of consumers still struggling to digest soaring food costs, that likely means even higher egg prices in 2025.",
      "\"I think eggs have felt relatively extreme over the past few months,\" Kip Green, co-owner and general manager of Montague Diner in Brooklyn, New York, told CBS News. \"We're fortunate though, we have a great relationships with our purveyors, with farmers. So everybody is trying to help each other out, which is lovely.\"",
      "Like many diners, Montague uses hundreds of eggs a day said Green. Whether served as part of a classic breakfast plate alongside potatoes and toast, or an egg salad sandwich, eggs comprise 40% to 50% of the restaurant's menu, she said.",
      "\"I mean, it's even like, there's some things that you might not even think about, like in our pancake batter or like in our French toast batter, like just things like that. We still use so many eggs.\"",
      "Even so, Green said that she and her team are \"aligned on keeping guests at the forefront,\" which means shielding them from price hikes on eggs.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it's challenging. Like we, we have to figure out how to make it work,\" she said. \"Eggs are central to us, we are a diner. You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Devastating for farmers",
      "The bird flu outbreaks disrupting the nation's egg supplies are a dealing a serious blow to affected farmers. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. Replenishing supplies is yet another challenge.",
      "\"It takes approximately 19-20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs in newly repopulated barns, and that is but one element of a lengthy recovery process,\" a spokesperson for the American Egg Board said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Bird flu is absolutely devastating to an egg farm. When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "Other factors",
      "Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.",
      "As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",
      "Correction:\u00a0This story has been revised because it mistakenly reported that it takes less than six weeks for commercial hens to produce eggs. This is incorrect. It takes 19 to 20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs, according to the American Egg Board. The trade group also notes that it can take more than a year for farms suffering a bird flu outbreak to secure the required government clearance to resume operations.",

      "Abortion opponents praised Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday, after he vowed at a Senate hearing to implement \"whatever\" position President Trump takes on regulating abortion pills, if confirmed as the next secretary of health and human services.",
      "Kennedy's pledge comes as conservatives have stepped up pressure on the Trump administration to force the Food and Drug Administration to roll back decisions that eased restrictions on the abortion pill mifepristone, also known as Mifeprex.",
      "If confirmed as head of the department that oversees the FDA, Kennedy would have broad authority over how the pills are regulated, among a number of powers that HHS has to affect access to abortion nationwide.",
      "\"Today, we received clear signals that the prolife movement can work with RFK Junior. Acknowledging that every abortion is a tragedy left my team applauding,\" John Mize, head of the conservative group Americans United for Life, said in a statement.",
      "Mize's group led a \"coalition of leading pro-life organizations\" ahead of the hearing that called on the Trump administration to step up restrictions on the abortion pill or pull it from the U.S. market altogether, ending access to the medication abortion option, even in states where abortion is legal.",
      "\"President Trump has asked me to study the safety of mifepristone. He has not yet taken a stand on how to regulate it. Whatever he does, I will implement those policies and I will work with this committee, make those policies make sense,\" Kennedy told the Senate Committee on Finance.",
      "Kennedy also told the committeee that the president had \"made it clear to me that he wants me to look at safety issues, and I'll ask NIH and FDA to do that.\"",
      "Democrats on the Senate panel expressed alarm about Kennedy's apparent openness to restricting mifepristone.",
      "\"Women deserve to know if Mr. Kennedy will abuse his power as our country's chief health officer to essentially implement a national abortion ban by restricting access to the safe and legal medication,\" said Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member on the committee.",
      "After the hearing, a spokesperson for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America said the group was looking forward to Kennedy's second round Thursday before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.",
      "\"We were encouraged by the questions asked and the answers given,\" said Kelsey Pritchard, the group's political communications director, in an email.",
      "Not all conservative organizations were persuaded by Kennedy's answers at the hearing. The group Advancing American Freedom, backed by former Vice President Mike Pence, doubled down Wednesday on calls for senators to reject Kennedy's nomination.",
      "\"The American people deserve an HHS Secretary with a firm commitment to protecting life, who doesn't fall for or promote health-related misinformation,\" the group said on X.",
      "Democrats also pointed to Kennedy's long record of voicing support for abortion, including a previous statement that he supported abortion up to full term.",
      "\"You have clearly stated in the past that bodily autonomy is one of your core values. The question is, do you stand for that value or not? When was it that you decided to sell out the values you've had your whole life in order to be given power by President Trump,\" New Hampshire Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan asked Kennedy at the hearing.",
      "Kennedy said multiple times during the hearing that he now agrees \"with President Trump that every abortion is a tragedy\" and serves \"at the pleasure of the president.\"",
      "\"President Trump has told me that he wants to end late-term abortions. And that he wants to protect conscience exemptions and that he wants to end federal funding for abortions here or abroad,\" he said.",

      "Beyond the FDA's regulation on mifepristone, it would be up to Kennedy to sign off on other changes called for by conservatives around abortion policy, including limits on how money is used under the so-called Title X funding for family planning clinics.",
      "He pledged at the hearing to \"support President Trump's policies on Title X.\"",
      "Under the first Trump administration, rules levied by HHS on Title X resulted in Planned Parenthood's departure from the funding program, decrying the rules as a \"gag order\" on providers referring patients to abortion services.",
      "Another major way the department has wielded its authority in the past on abortion has been through the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA.",
      "The\u00a0 Biden administration used the law to sue states with sweeping abortion bans, saying the laws were blocking doctors from offering care to stabilize pregnant patients in emergencies.",

He must receive a majority of senators to be confirmed to head HHS, which encompasses America's federal health agencies.",

      "Advisers have been huddling with Kennedy for months behind closed doors, multiple advisers say, hashing out how and whether to implement dramatic changes he has sought to the federal government's health bureaucracy.",
      "Kennedy's supporters say many of his stances, like questioning ultra-processed foods and the risks of synthetic food additives and dyes, have hit on broad appeal among both Republicans and some Democrats that could buoy his chances to clear the Senate.",
      "Through the FDA, Kennedy would be able to exercise substantial authority on how foods are regulated, labeled and recommended by the federal government.",
      "But Kennedy is also facing criticism from both sides of the aisle, setting up a confirmation battle that multiple allies say he has privately acknowledged will be an uphill fight.",

      "The issue is expected to be a large focus of Kennedy's hearings: as secretary, he would have authority over how the FDA regulates medications used for abortions.",
      "Kennedy has reassured conservative groups and lawmakers that he would hew closely to Mr. Trump's campaign trail promise to defer the issue to the states.",
      "But Kennedy and the Trump administration will have little room to avoid the issue, given an ongoing federal court case against the FDA. Conservatives have called on the Trump administration's FDA to roll back moves made since 2016 to ease access to abortion pills.",

      "Many Democrats, nonprofits and health experts have also blasted Kennedy over his record of misleading and unfounded health claims, in addition to work by him and his allies opposing the approvals and authorizations of a range of vaccines, including COVID-19 and polio shots.",

      "Who is RFK Jr?",
      "When Kennedy first announced his campaign as a Democratic presidential candidate in April 2023, he touted his decades-long record as an environmental lawyer.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 whose father, Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign \u2014 says he did not want to immediately enter politics, and instead \"carried on his family's legacy by devoting himself to environmental causes and children's welfare.\"",
      "That followed a struggle with substance abuse when he was younger, which he says spanned 14 years after he started using heroin at 15 years old.",
      "Kennedy made headlines for his environmental work was as founder and president of the nonprofit Waterkeeper Alliance from the 1980s until 2020, ranging from local efforts to clean up the Hudson River to campaigning against an oil pipeline in North Dakota.",
      "What Kennedy has described as his \"reluctant entrance into the vaccine debate\" dates back to 2005, when he wrote an article in Rolling Stone exploring supposed evidence for a link between autism and an ingredient that had formerly been used in some vaccines. The article contained numerous scientific and factual errors and was eventually retracted. Decades of research has established there is no such link.",
      "In 2016, Kennedy joined a nonprofit focused on mercury, which later broadened its focus and rebranded to Children's Health Defense. Kennedy chaired the group and served as one of its loudest voices raising doubts about vaccines and fighting against vaccine requirements and approvals.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, they clashed with federal health agencies over use of ivermectin and the federal mask mandate in travel. In 2021, the FDA denied their petition asking to revoke all COVID-19 vaccine authorizations and ban studies of the shots for children.",
      "As a candidate, Kennedy continued to say that he thought vaccines as well as \"a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods\" were to blame for rising rates of autism and other chronic diseases in U.S. children. Experts have attributed the global rise in autism prevalence in part to broader awareness and changes to how the disorder is classified and diagnosed.",
      "Kennedy's longshot bid to challenge President Joe Biden in the Democratic primary ended in October 2023, when he switched his campaign to an independent presidential bid. He dropped out of the campaign and endorsed Mr. Trump in August 2024.",

      "Multiple state Medicaid programs reported late Tuesday they have been able to resume accessing their payment systems after the nationwide lockout.",
      "The interruption had sparked outcry from state governments, nonprofits and lawmakers in the wake of the Trump administration's\u00a0move to freeze spending\u00a0across the federal government. After legal challenges were filed against the funding freeze, a federal judge issued a stay\u00a0temporarily halting\u00a0the move until she can hear arguments in the case.",
      "State Medicaid agencies, federally funded\u00a0Head Start\u00a0early education programs and\u00a0community health centers\u00a0had been among those cut off from access to the\u00a0Payment Management Services\u00a0web portal, or PMS, run by the Department of Health and Human Services, which handles billions of dollars of payments every year.",
      "\"We have confirmed no payments have been affected \u2014 they are still being processed and sent. We expect the portal will be back online shortly,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt   said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",
      "Confusion after Medicaid programs locked out",
      "There was widespread confusion after Medicaid and other programs discovered they were locked out of the federal health payment system. Spokespeople for HHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have not responded to requests for comment, amid the ongoing\u00a0communications \"pause\"\u00a0imposed by the Trump administration at the department.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Association of Medicaid Directors said they had also sought an explanation.",
      "\"My staff has confirmed reports that Medicaid portals are down in all 50 states following last night's federal funding freeze. This is a blatant attempt to rip away health care from millions of Americans overnight and will get people killed,\" Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden\u00a0posted\u00a0on X.",

      "Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said he was assured Medicaid would not be affected.",
      "\"What the White House has told us just now is that Medicaid is not, categorically not, covered by this,\" Hawley said. \"In other words, there will be no interruption to Medicaid or Medicare or any grant that floats to individuals.\"",
      "Joann Alker of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families had\u00a0called on\u00a0the administration to issue a statement clarifying that\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0should not be affected after its initial memo ordering the spending freeze late Monday, warning it is a\u00a0\"major crisis\"\u00a0as states look to draw down funding for the month.",
      "\"Any pause in federal funding of Medicaid \u2014 the largest source of federal funding received by states \u2014 would be disastrous for states as they need to draw down federal funds to meet their financial obligations to the health care providers and health plans serving Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries,\" Alker said.",
      "Health centers warn of \"irreversible\" consequences",
      "Even as the payment systems come back online, those who rely on the grants say they worry that new \"delays\" on payments imposed by the Trump administration could inflict permanent damage on stretched-thin health care systems.",
      "The HHS website currently warns that due \"to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "In a statement ahead of the lockout, HHS\u00a0announced\u00a0it would be reevaluating \"all programs, regulations, and guidance to ensure Federal taxpayer dollars are not being used to pay for or promote elective abortion\" following a previous\u00a0executive order.",
      "\"Even with the best of intentions, these types of funding freezes can do tremendous harm. And could be irreversible to some communities. What we're really talking about is a health center's ability to pay salaries,\" said Amanda Pears Kelly, CEO of the group Advocates for Community Health.",
      "The group lobbies on behalf of community health centers, which are subsidized by the federal government to offer health care to low-income communities.",
      "Pears Kelly said that health centers often rely on being able to request money every-other-week through the system, drawing down their grant to pay bills and make payroll for their staff. Without the money, she warned many health centers facing already slim margins could be forced to trim staff or close their doors.",
      "\"When the system's down, and there's no one to talk to to understand what they need to do, and then on top of that there's an uncertain time to the delay, it's paralyzing,\" said Pears Kelly.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association warned that health centers could face \"significant disruption\" to operations even with a \"temporary funding pause.\"",
      "\"For many patients, Title X-funded health centers serve as their sole source of health care. The Title X family planning program is already chronically underfunded, and this executive action risks destabilizing a health provider network that is already operating under immense strain,\" said Clare Coleman, president and CEO of the association.",
      "School lunches, other programs worry about impact",
      "The implications of the federal grant pause go beyond HHS, but the full effects are still unknown.",
      "It's unclear whether the National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools and school districts each month for the meals they serve children, will still receive funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture if the freeze takes effect. The program feeds about 28 million American schoolchildren each month.",

      "\"If in fact this order includes the Older Americans Act, this would presumably halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" a Meals on Wheels spokesperson said. \"And the lack of clarity and uncertainty right now is creating chaos for local Meals on Wheels providers not knowing for sure whether they should be serving meals today, which unfortunately means seniors will panic not knowing where their next meals will come from.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:28:23 -0500",
    "summary": "A different strain of H5N9 has shown up in U.S. birds before.",
    "story": [
      "A California duck farm made headlines this week after the World Organization of Animal Health published a report by U.S. authorities that a strain of bird flu that scientists call H5N9 had been found among sick birds in the flock.",
      "This is far from the first time that H5N9 has been found in birds around the country. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was the first time that H5N9 had been found in American poultry sick with \"highly pathogenic avian influenza,\" meaning it caused severe disease.",
      "\"Clinical signs included increased mortality. State officials have quarantined the affected premises,\" the USDA said of the flock.",
      "What is H5N9 and how is it different from H5N1?",
      "Scientists classify bird flu viruses by which kind of two key proteins are inside of them: the hemagglutinin, like H5 or H3, and the neuraminidase, like N1 or N9.",
      "Different blends of those two proteins alongside many other mutations elsewhere in the virus can affect how sick people and animals get and how it spreads.",
      "H5N1 has been the dominant grouping of strains fueling this past year's outbreaks in the U.S., with different variants of that virus spreading in wild birds, poultry flocks, dairy cattle, pets and into at least 67 confirmed human cases.",
      "A spokesperson for the department said that scientists believe the H5N9 was the result of a \"reassortment,\" where H5N1 was able to\u00a0genetically mix\u00a0with other influenza viruses inside of a duck.",
      "\"The finding was not unexpected, as it is not uncommon to see reassortments and ducks are reservoir hosts for influenza A viruses,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Both H5N9 and H5N1 were found to be infecting ducks at the farm, the USDA said.",
      "\"The H5N1 virus is widely circulating across North America, and these viruses can reassort in species that are susceptible to influenza viruses,\" said S. Mark Tompkins, director of the Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research at the University of Georgia. He agreed that it would not be \"terribly surprising\" to see a reassortment emerge to infect poultry.",
      "\"H5N1 reassorts with other avian influenza viruses quite frequently and even the current H5 HA protein that is infecting dairy cows and commercial poultry farms in the US has been shown to reassort,\"\u00a0Andy Pekosz, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an email.",
      "Has H5N9 been seen in the U.S. before?",
      "H5N9 has been seen before in U.S. birds, but often it results in less severe symptoms, called \"low pathogenic avian influenza\" by veterinarians.",
      "\"H5N9 viruses have been detected in North American wild birds in 2023 and 2024, and before the current outbreak,\" said Tompkins.",
      "Some of the\u00a0earliest records\u00a0of H5N9 around the world date back to turkeys infected in Wisconsin in the 1960s, which U.S. officials\u00a0reported had\u00a0\"mild respiratory symptoms and a severe drop in egg production.\"",
      "The California duck farm's strain of H5N9 is different from those earlier cases because this time it is closely related to a newer variant of the H5N1 virus. That variant is called H5N1 D1.1, the USDA spokesperson said, which has emerged over the past year to dominate U.S. cases in wild birds and poultry.",
      "\"The combination H5N9 is not new and other versions, like H5N5 also exist. Just because this was now detected, doesn't mean trouble necessarily,\" said virologist Florian Krammer, professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in an email.",
      "Krammer pointed to recent detections of the H5N5\u00a0strain spreading from Europe, and then jumping from birds to be able to infect mammals across Canada as prompting more worry for him.",
      "\"It's not really surprising, because we have a history of three years of H5N1 undergoing reassortments that would typically burn out and not emerge as a major one,\" said David Swayne, a private veterinarian and former director of the USDA's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory.",
      "Swayne said that past H5N9 outbreaks have been dead ends, in the handful of times they have been found to be causing severe disease in ducks.",
      "\"So far, I have not heard of any evidence to say this H5N9 has some kind of fitness that is better than the H5N1. If it doesn't have that, it can't outcompete,\" said Swayne.",
      "Is H5N9 a bigger risk to humans than H5N1?",
      "As with H5N1, H5N9 in birds would still need to achieve some key mutations before it is able to spread efficiently among humans.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the U.S. to date. Most cases were blamed on direct contact with sick animals, except for three that have befuddled investigators who failed to identify a likely source.",
      "It is unclear whether authorities followed up with workers at the Merced County farm about potential human infections. A spokesperson for the county did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "If H5N9 gains a foothold in humans, people may possibly have less immunity to the virus than they do to H5N1.",
      "\"The seasonal, human H1N1 virus has an NA protein that is related, but different from the bovine H5N1 NA protein. There is some cross-recognition of avian H5N1 NA in the human population because of this,\" said Pekosz.",
      "Where was the California H5N9 outbreak?",
      "The USDA said the virus was detected at a \"commercial duck meat\" farm in California's Merced County, in an outbreak that started on Nov. 23, 2024.",
      "A total of 118,954 birds were culled at the duck farm by Dec. 2 to stamp out the virus, in an effort to curb the risk of further bird flu spread.",
      "More than 3 million birds have been culled at farms in this California county over the past year due to bird flu outbreaks, the most of any county in the state. California has been hit hard by this past year's bird flu outbreaks, which have resulted in record cullings across the egg industry.",
      "Scientists say ducks are especially susceptible to harboring influenza viruses without being sick, making them common mixing vessels for bird flu strains.",
      "\"Unless you have very tight biosecurity, it is very hard to raise ducks without many low path influenza viruses,\" said Swayne.",
      "Swayne said ducks often need the lowest dose of virus to be infected with bird flu viruses, compared to other poultry, like chickens. One way the virus can spread onto farms is when they are raised outside, mixing with wild ducks.",
      "\"If you look at the natural history, wild ducks are the reservoir of genes for all influenza virus. There's probably an adaptation with the virus. These viruses infect without showing overt clinical disease, they spread very rapidly between the adults to the juveniles,\" said Swayne.",

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s cousin urged senators to reject his nomination as health and human services secretary.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Caroline Kennedy, the cousin of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., sent a blistering letter to senators on Tuesday \u2014 a day before his confirmation hearings \u2014 that described him as a \"predator\" whose actions \"have cost lives.\"",
      "In the letter to committee leaders, the former ambassador to Australia urged senators to reject his nomination as health and human services secretary, alleging that he \"preys on the desperation of parents and sick children,\" as well as his own family members.",
      "\"It's no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator,\" the two-page letter said. \"His basement, his garage, and his dorm room were the centers of the action where drugs were available, and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks. It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence.\"",
      "Family members who followed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. down the path of substance abuse, Caroline Kennedy wrote, \"suffered addiction, illness and death, while Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.\"",
      "She also said that while her cousin has discouraged parents from vaccinating their children, he has vaccinated his own.",
      "\"Even before he fills this job, his constant denigration of our health care system and the conspiratorial half-truths he has told about vaccines, including in connection with Samoa's deadly 2019 measles outbreak, have cost lives,\" Caroline Kennedy wrote.",
      "She also read her letter to the senators in a social media post on X.",
      "His \"crusade against vaccination\" serves to enrich him financially, she said. His financial disclosures\u00a0showed\u00a0RFK Jr. still intends to receive legal fees from Wisner Baum, a firm suing the maker of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil over its alleged failure to warn consumers about its risks.",
      "\"In other words,\" she said, \"he is willing to enrich himself by denying access to a vaccine that can prevent almost all forms of cervical cancer and which has been safely administered to millions of boys and girls.\" She went on to say that while she was ambassador to Australia, she learned it was one of the top three cancers afflicting women in a majority of countries.",
      "Caroline Kennedy also excoriated RFK Jr. over his presidential campaign: \"It also wasn't easy to remain silent last year when Bobby expropriated my father's image and distorted President Kennedy's legacy to advance his own failed presidential campaign \u2014 and then groveled to Donald Trump for a job. Bobby continues to grandstand off my father's assassination, and that of his own father. It is incomprehensible that someone who is willing to exploit their own painful family tragedies for publicity would be in charge of American life-and-death situations.\"",
      "Her cousin, she said, is \"addicted to attention and power.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's controversial pick is set to appear Wednesday before the Senate Committee on Finance, which will decide whether to advance his nomination. On Thursday, he is scheduled to testify before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faces opposition from both sides of the aisle. Conservatives groups have expressed concern about his past statements in support of abortion rights, though he has reassured them that he would follow Mr. Trump's promise to defer the issue to states. Democrats and vaccine experts have condemned him for spreading misleading claims on a range of vaccines, including the COVID-19 and polio shots.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 19:29:54 -0500",
    "summary": "New tariffs of 25% of imports from Canada and Mexico go into effect today, as well as a 10% tariff on Chinese imports.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday signed an executive order that imposes 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, while adding an additional 10% levy on goods from China. The salvo, which President Trump had threatened even before returning to power earlier this month, underlines his willingness to use trade policy even against some of the U.S.' largest economic allies.",
      "The tariffs take effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. The order imposes 25% tariffs on goods from Canada except for \"energy resources\" such as oil and gas, which are only hit with a 10% tariff.",
      "The order notes that should any of the three nations \"retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on United States exports to Canada or similar measures, the President may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.\"",
      "According to the White House, the salvo is aimed at curbing the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.; spurring a resurgence in domestic manufacturing; and raising federal revenue.",
      "Experts warn that the impact of the tariffs could affect the economies of Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 the nation's three biggest trading partners \u2014 as well as the U.S. itself. Canada's economy could shrink by 3.6%, while Mexico could take a 2% hit, according to Cornell University economics professor Wendong Zhang.",
      "At the same time, inflation in the U.S. could rise by as much as 1 percentage point, pushing it as high as 4% on an annual basis, or double the Federal Reserve's goal for a 2% annual rate, Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 research note.",
      "\"We have stressed that steep tariff increases against U.S. trading partners could create a stagflationary shock \u2014 a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse \u2014 while also triggering financial market volatility,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in a Jan. 31 report.",
      "Daco added, \"These tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China would mark the first major wave of trade levies in Trump's new term, with effects rippling far beyond those economies, as other nations brace for potential targeting and U.S. businesses navigate supply chain disruptions and retaliation risks.\"",
      "American consumers have been bracing for the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, telling pollsters that they expected to see higher prices if the president followed through on his plans to enact them. Those expectations may have prompted some consumers to purchase goods before Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists say.",
      "\"The mere prospect of tariffs appears to be influencing the behavior of consumers and businesses,\" analysts with Oxford Economics in a research note. \"Imports surged in December, likely an attempt to front-run any tariffs, while consumers may be bringing forward spending in anticipation of tariff-related price hikes.\"",
      "U.S. consumers could see higher prices\u00a0for produce and agricultural products imported from Canada and Mexico, including beef from the former and avocados and strawberries from the latter. Automobiles could see an average price increase of $3,000 each due to the tariffs, given the huge volume of cars now being built in Canada and Mexico, according to TD Economics.",

    "summary": "The White House levied new import duties on its three closest trading partners.",
    "story": [
      "Americans could soon be paying more for everything from automobiles to avocados after the Trump administration levied\u00a0stiff new tariffs\u00a0on the nation's three largest trading partners.",
      "President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Saturday, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China.",
      "While Mr. Trump describes tariffs as import duties that are paid by foreign countries, they are in fact paid directly to the federal government by U.S. businesses,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank. Rather than swallowing the costs, corporations typically hike their prices for those imported goods to recoup all or some of the expense.",
      "Who pays the cost?",
      "\"If there is a significant increase in tariffs ... those costs will likely be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses,\" Brian Peck, executive director of University of Southern California's Center for Transnational Law and Business, told CBS Los Angeles.",
      "\"From Canada, we import oil, lumber, wood and cement,\" he added. \"Over 20% of the agriculture products we bring into the U.S. come from Mexico.\"",
      "One unknown is whether the Trump administration will carve out some exceptions, such as for oil and gas products. Canada provides about 20% of the oil used in the U.S., which means that a 25% tariff on Canadian imports could add 30 to 40 cents a gallon at the pump within days of the new duties taking effect, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has said.",
      "As painful as higher costs might be to U.S. consumers, the biggest impacts would likely be felt by the Canadian and Mexican economies, according to Wendong Zhang, assistant professor of applied economics and policy at Cornell University. A 25% tariff could cause Canada and Mexico to lose 3.6% and 2% of real GDP,\u00a0 respectively, versus a decline of 0.3% for the U.S., Zhang estimated.",
      "Here's what could get pricier for American shoppers if the Trump administration's tariffs take effect.",
      "Avocados, beef and other foods",
      "Inflation-pinched consumers may face a surge in prices for fruits, vegetables and nuts imported from Mexico, including avocados \u2014 just in time for the Super Bowl on Feb. 9.",
      "The U.S. imported more than $45 billion in agricultural products from Mexico in 2023, including fresh strawberries, raspberries, tomatoes and beef, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. also imports Mexican beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. imported about $40 billion of Canadian agricultural products that same year, including beef, pork, grains, potatoes and canola oil, the USDA notes.",
      "A 25% tariff could push prices up for all those products.",
      "\"Grocery stores operate on really tiny margins,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute. \"They can't eat the tariffs ... especially when you talk about things like avocados that basically all of them \u2014 90% \u2014 come from Mexico. You're talking about guacamole tariffs right before the Super Bowl.\"",
      "Cars",
      "American consumers are increasingly buying cars that are either built in Canada or Mexico or that use parts imported from those nations. The U.S. imported $69 billion of cars and light trucks from Mexico in 2023, and another $37 billion from Canada, according to S&P Global Mobility.",
      "On top of that, about $78 billion in auto parts stemmed from Mexico and $20 billion from Canada. For instance, the engines used in Ford's F-series pickup trucks come from Canada.",
      "Because U.S. importers are expected to roll any added tariff costs into vehicle sticker prices, the average U.S. automobile price could jump by about $3,000, TD Economics estimates. That would come at a time when the average new car already sells for $50,000 and the average used car for $26,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Lumber",
      "About one-third of softwood lumber used in the U.S. is imported from Canada each year, according to Rajan Parajuli, an associate professor of forest economics and policy at North Carolina State University.",
      "Tacking a 25% tariff on Canadian lumber could cause a \"supply shock,\" the Forest Resources Association, a trade group, wrote in a December blog post. \"Regarding lumber, the U.S. still needs Canadian supplies to meet its domestic consumption demand,\" the group said.",
      "Still, the slow U.S. housing market, dampened by mortgage rates that remain close to 7%, could make it hard for companies to pass on the new tariffs through higher lumber prices, some economists said.",
      "\"Lumber prices are expected to rise, although a slower U.S. housing recovery, burdened by higher prices, will limit the extent to which exporters will be able to pass on price increases,\" Oxford Economics noted in a Jan. 31 research note.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 17:38:52 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump is an avowed supporter of tariffs, but many experts say such trade measures can boost inflation.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, an avowed fan of tariffs, imposed a\u00a0wave of new import duties\u00a0Saturday on America's three closest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Although tariffs are a bane to most economists, they are a widely used as a tool for regulating international trade and for shielding domestic industries from foreign competition. At the simplest level, tariffs are taxes placed on goods made overseas that are imported into the country. Notably, foreign companies aren't responsible for paying the duties. Instead, U.S. businesses directly pay the tariffs on their imported goods to the federal government, according to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank.",
      "Because American businesses are on the hook for paying the tariffs on imports, they historically have passed on some or all of those costs to consumers. At the same time, tariff proponents like Mr. Trump argue that such levies can help protect manufacturers here at home. For instance, consumers may opt to buy U.S.-made products rather than newly pricier imports, while companies may choose to avoid tariffs by opening new plants in the U.S.",
      "\"Come make your product in America,\" Mr. Trump said last week at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland. \"But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff.\"",
      "Many economists and other trade experts say tariffs are not beneficial. The Peterson Institute for International Economics points out that tariffs \"have a poor record\" of sparking a resurgence in manufacturing.",
      "On Friday, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump on Saturday will imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canadian imports and an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods entering the U.S. She cited \"illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country\" as the reason for the tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also floated the possibility of additional tariffs, such as an across-the-board duty of 10% on all goods imported into the U.S. Here's what to know about tariffs.",
      "What exactly are tariffs?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S..",
      "The most common type are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value, which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of the imports. These are the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed as a 25% import tax on goods shipped from Mexico or Canada, such as avocados or lumber.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, such as if the U.S. were to propose a $1 tariff on each imported Mexican avocado.",
      "Another such type of levy are \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold. For instance, this type of quota was used by the first Trump administration in 2018 on\u00a0washing machines, when the first 1.2 million imported units faced a 20% duty, while units above that number were taxed at a 50% rate, according to the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which advocates for more restrictive trade policies.",
      "Who pays for tariffs?",
      "Companies that import the goods from abroad pay the tariffs to their own nation. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection collects tariffs from importers \u2014 say, Walmart or Target \u2014 and then deposits the money into the General Fund of the United States.",
      "Mr. Trump has\u00a0claimed\u00a0that foreign countries pay the duties. As part of his campaign, he vowed that tariffs would help raise \"trillions and trillions of dollars\" from foreign governments.",
      "In fact, American consumers would likely bear the brunt of the cost, as big U.S. importers are likely to pass on the tariffs they pay to the customs department to consumers, economists say. In some cases, foreign manufacturers may also choose to lower their prices to offset the impact of those tariffs in order to maintain their sales. And some U.S. businesses could absorb some of the tariff costs to avoid driving away consumers and potentially losing market share to competitors.",
      "If Mr. Trump enacts all the tariffs he's vowed to levy on imports, the typical U.S. consumer could face up to $2,400 in increased costs for every year the tariffs remain in force, according to an estimate from financial services firm ING.",
      "Could tariffs boost inflation?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs would sharply push the current effective U.S. tariff rate from 2.4% to 31%. That would be a historic high and surpass those seen under President McKinley in the 1890s, when U.S. trade policies were far more protectionist, and during the 1930s under the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, according to Capital Economics.",
      "As a result, inflation would likely jump, rising from an annual rate of about 2.9% currently to as high as 4%, or about double the Federal Reserve's 2% target, Capital Economics noted. That would put inflation back to its mid-2023 levels, when the Fed was keeping interest rates near a two-decade as it tried bring inflation under control.",
      "\"[I]mposing any of these suggested tariffs would generate a rebound in consumer price inflation this year, taking it further above target and making it harder for the Fed to resume loosening monetary policy,\" Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "Why does Trump support tariffs?",
      "President Trump cites tariffs as a way to accomplish several policy goals, including raising more money to fund the government and protecting domestic industries.",
      "Both he and his allies, including his new Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0contend that tariffs enacted during the first Trump administration didn't boost inflation. But those tariffs, which applied to only some Chinese imports, \"were too small to matter\" and so didn't have an inflationary impact, Capital Economics said in its research note.",
      "Mr. Trump has also cited the need to boost U.S. manufacturing, saying in an October interview at the Economic Club of Chicago, \"No. 1 is for protection of the companies that we have here, and the new companies that will move in because we're going to have thousands of companies coming into this country.\"",
      "The data to support that claim is mixed. The tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in 2018-19 achieved that goal to some extent, with the Brookings Institution\u00a0noting\u00a0that jobs in a few industries may have rebounded, such as adding 1,800 new U.S. jobs at Whirlpool and other washing machine manufacturers.",
      "Overall, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs fell slightly during Trump's first term, from about 12.4 million to 12.2 million workers. A range of factors could account for that decline, such as the impact of the pandemic and broader economic issues facing manufacturing.",

      "President Trump has fired the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra, in the latest purge of a Biden Administrator holdover.",
      "Chopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. In a letter to the president shared on social media, Chopra said it was an \"extraordinary privilege\" to serve as director of the CFPB.",
      "\"With so much power concentrated in the hands of a few, agencies like the CFPB have never been more critical,\" he wrote. \"I'm proud that the CFPB has done so much to restore the rule of law.\"",

      "In Bill Gates' new autobiography, \"Source Code: My Beginnings\" (published February 4 by Knopf), the computer pioneer and philanthropist writes of his formative years, and the experiences that led him to the then-burgeoning world of computers.",
      "Read an excerpt below about how, in eighth grade, he discovered BASIC, which introduced him to the elegance and exacting demands of computer code; and don't miss Lee Cowan's interview with Bill Gates on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" February 2!",
      "\"Source Code: My Beginnings\" by Bill Gates",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "All these years later it still amazes me how so many disparate things had to come together for me to use a computer in 1968. Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",
      "The page included a sample program written in BASIC telling the computer how to add two numbers.",
      "Ready . . .",
      "10 INPUT X,Y",
      "20 LET A=X+Y",
      "30 PRINT A",
      "40 END",
      "That was probably the first computer program I ever typed in. The elegance of the four lines of code appealed to my sense of order. Its instantaneous answer was like a jolt of electricity. From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

    "title": "Trump to enact tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China starting Feb. 1",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 17:15:59 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump will enact 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada starting Saturday, as well as a 10% tariff on China.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump will enact 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1, as well as a 10% tariff on imports from China, according to White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.",
      "\"The president will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada and a 10% tariff on China, for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,\" Leavitt said at a White House briefing on Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he's\u00a0targeting Canada and Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the nation's biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S. The president has also said tariffs will generate money for the federal government, although the import duties are paid by U.S. importers. Companies such as Walmart, Target and other U.S. importers typically pass tariff-related costs onto American consumers.",
      "Asked whether Mr. Trump's new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China would include any exemptions, Leavitt said she didn't have information about that issue.",
      "Mr. Trump's goals include narrowing the trade surplus between those nations and the U.S. The U.S. trade deficit with Canada has surged from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023, largely reflecting growing American imports of Canadian energy. Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Experts warn that steep new tariffs on imports could cause U.S. economic growth to slow and inflation to flare, noting that companies in the U.S. are likely to pass on the added costs to consumers. A sustained burst of inflation, in turn, could also deter the Federal Reserve from pushing down borrowing costs, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Even the prospect of higher import duties is influencing spending by consumers and businesses, according to Oxford Economics. Analysts with the investment adviser note that U.S. imports surged in December, a sign Americans are buying appliances, furniture and other goods now to get ahead of possible price increases.",
      "Retaliation risks",
      "A volley of new U.S. tariffs is likely to invite swift retaliation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that his country is prepared to fire back if Mr. Trump proceeds with his plan, but he did not give details.",
      "\"We're ready with a response, a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,\" he said. \"It's not what we want, but if he moves forward, we will also act.\"",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that Mexico has conferred with Trump's team since before he returned to the White House, but she emphasized that Mexico has a \"Plan A, Plan B, Plan C for what the United States government decides.\"",
      "\"Now it is very important that the Mexican people know that we are always going to defend the dignity of our people, we are always going to defend the respect of our sovereignty and a dialogue between equals, as we have always said, without subordination,\" she said.",
      "The ultimate economic damage from the U.S. tariffs would hinge on how long they are in place, Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator, told the Associated Press.",
      "If it's just a few days, \"that's one thing. If they are in place for weeks onto months, we're going to see supply chain disruptions, higher costs for U.S. manufacturers, leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers,\" said Cutler, now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \"It could have macroeconomic impacts. It could affect the stock market. Then internationally it could lead to more tension with our trading partners and make it harder for us to work with them.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 15:44:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, faces scrutiny for fees he may earn from lawsuits against Merck.",
    "story": [
      "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation hearings to serve as the nation's top health official play out on Capitol Hill, President Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services is facing scrutiny not only for his anti-vaccine views, but whether he profits from them.",
      "If confirmed, Kennedy would wield control over federal vaccine policy and the regulation of drugmakers, even as he stands to potentially profit from vaccine-related litigation.",
      "How Kennedy made money from lawsuits",
      "Kennedy for years has earned referral fees from Wisner Baum, a Los Angeles personal injury law firm that is currently suing Merck, alleging the pharmaceutical giant failed to properly warn the public about risks from its vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV), Gardasil, according to financial disclosure documents filed by Kennedy with the Office of Government Ethics.",
      "Wisner Baum is representing a plaintiff in a trial against Merck and other lawsuits are in the works in North Carolina.",
      "\"An overwhelming body of scientific evidence, including more than 30 years of research and development along with real world evidence generated by Merck and by independent investigators, continues to support the safety and efficacy profiles of our HPV vaccines,\" Rahway, New Jersey-based Merck said Tuesday in a\u00a0statement on the litigation. \"The plaintiff's allegations have no merit, and we remain committed to vigorously defending against these claims in the upcoming trial.\"",
      "In a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, repeatedly asked Kennedy if he would agree to forgo payments stemming from litigation against drugmakers after disclosing in Ethics Office filings that he might collect legal fees for referring potential plaintiffs in Wisner Baum's suits against Merck over its HPV vaccine, which is to prevent cervical cancer.",
      "Kennedy has made about $2.5 million since 2022 in his work with the law firm, including $850,000 last year, public records show. Kennedy, himself a longtime personal injury lawyer, could earn even more if the litigation against Merck prevails given that he is opting to keep his stake in the pending court case, according to ethics documents filed before his confirmation hearings.",
      "Kennedy has a consulting arrangement to refer cases to Wisner Baum, which is pursuing cases related to the HPV vaccine Gardasil. If Kennedy is confirmed, he said he would resign from that arrangement.",
      "\"I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,\" Kennedy stated in his ethics pledge. According to the document, Kennedy will retain an interest in cases that do not involve the U.S. as a party and in which the U.S. does not have a \"direct and substantial interest.\"",
      "At the same time, Kennedy vowed to divest his rights to payment in contingency fee cases in which the U.S. is a party or has a direct or large interest to a \"non-dependent, adult family member.\"",
      "Financial conflict of interest?",
      "Kennedy's plan to continue collecting contingency fees while serving as Health and Human Services secretary raises questions as a matter of ethics and policy, according to Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, \"It's very unusual for a cabinet secretary to retain an interest in contingency fee litigation,\" Clark told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's troubling.\"",
      "For example, if Kennedy stands to financially gain in lawsuits against Merck or other drugmakers, his impartiality as HHS secretary could face scrutiny if the companies faced a federal enforcement action or submitted a drug for government approval, Clark added.",
      "Wisner Baum said it hasn't paid Kennedy for his work linked to the firm's suits against Merck, which is just getting started in California.",
      "The firm \"has only compensated Mr. Kennedy for Monsanto Roundup-induced non-Hodgkins lymphoma cases, Woolsey Fire cases and Paradise/Camp Fire cases. All of these cases alleged corporate wrongdoing that caused life-changing harm to victims,\" Wisner Baum said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We are currently in trial in the first Gardasil case in Los Angeles. We hope, like in Roundup, soundbites take a backseat to truth, take a backseat to actual evidence, and a jury returns a verdict sending the same message multiple juries did in Roundup \u2014 consumers deserve to know the truth, and politics has nothing to do with it,\" said Wisner Baum's managing partner, R. Brent Wisner, alluding to long-running ligation against Monsanto, now owned by Germany's Bayner, over a weedkiller alleged to cause cancer.",
      "Kennedy also made another $326,056 in salary and benefits from the Children's Health Defense, which he founded and formerly chaired, according to his ethics filings. The nonprofit has filed dozens of state and federal lawsuits challenging vaccine and public health mandates. Its targets include the federal agencies that Kennedy would run at HHS.",
      "During the hearing, Warren pointed to several changes Kennedy could make that might enrich him in connection with such lawsuits if he is approved as health secretary. That includes appointing anti-vaccine advocates to vaccine advisory panels, removing vaccines from recommendations or changing the way the vaccine injury compensation program works.",
      "Kennedy would not commit to Warren's request to forgo contingency fees while serving as HHS secretary. However, in written responses\u00a0to Warren on Friday, Kennedy agreed to amend his ethics agreement, a document that should be \"thoroughly reviewed\" before the Senate moves forward on Kennedy's nominatioin, the senator's office stated.",
      "\"It would be insufficient for RFK Jr. to only divest his interest in the Gardasil case while leaving the window open to profit from other anti-vax lawsuits, including future cases he could bring after leaving office,\" Warren said in a statement on Friday.",
      "A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a phone message requesting comment. Representatives for the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "MAHA trademark pending",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican of Idaho, asked Kennedy if there was \"anything that you are aware of in your background that might present a conflict of interest within the duties of the office to which you have been nominated?\"",
      "Kennedy replied \"No, Mr. Chairman.\"",
      "As part of the confirmation proceedings, Kennedy in December disclosed earning $100,000 from variations of his slogan, \"Make America Healthy Again\" and its abbreviation \u2014 MAHA \u2014 on stickers, hats and hoodies. Kennedy had in recent months applied for trademark protection for the phrase, setting the stage for marketing supplements, vitamins, essential oils and cryptocurrency, according to documents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.",
      "Kennedy has since transferred ownership of the trademark application to a limited liability company managed by Del Gibtree, a longtime anti-vaccine activist.",

    "summary": "Less than two weeks into his second term, President Trump is poised to deploy steep tariffs against key U.S. trading partners.",
    "story": [
      "On the day of his inauguration, President Trump threatened steep new tariffs against key U.S. trading partners. Now he is primed to deliver.",
      "\"The president will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada and a 10% tariff on China, for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said at a Jan. 31 press briefing.",
      "Leavitt's confirmation of the tariffs comes after Trump on Thursday reiterated his earlier threat this month that he could announce 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1, telling reporters from the Oval Office that the duties \"may or may not rise with time.\" He had previously warned China could face a 10% tariff.",
      "Economists have warned that stiff tariffs\u00a0could reawaken U.S. inflation on a range of consumer goods and slow economic growth. Here's what experts have to say.",
      "Why is Trump threatening to hit countries with tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened tariffs against multiple nations for a range of reasons. He said he is specifically\u00a0targeting Canada, Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the U.S.' biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S., as well as to narrow their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "The U.S. trade deficit with Canada has surged from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023, largely reflecting growing American imports of Canadian energy. Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Before Mr. Trump returned to power, he also had threatened tariffs of up to\u00a060% on Chinese goods\u00a0imported into the U.S., a measure experts say is intended to advance American interests in negotiating better trade terms with Beijing, as well as throttle the illegal entry of fentanyl into the country.",
      "In a show of how his administration uses tariff threats to pressure countries on other issues, Mr. Trump last week proposed potential 25% levies against Colombia unless it agreed to receive deportations of unauthorized immigrants. Colombia ultimately agreed to receive the immigrants,\u00a0and the tariffs were withheld.",
      "Colombia's about-face suggests that Canada and Mexico could also reach agreement with the U.S. and avert a painful trade war. To that end, Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, said at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that Canada and Mexico could avoid tariffs by closing their borders to fentanyl.",
      "\"As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,\" Lutnick told senators.",
      "Even so, Mr. Trump's brandishing of potential tariffs \u2014 even if they are never imposed \u2014 highlights his willingness to use tough trade measures to punish even the country's closest allies unless they make concessions.",
      "\"As we have previously noted, trade policy will be transactional over the next four years with protectionist measures used to extort trade, immigration and other political concessions,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "What exactly is Trump planning?",
      "Along with targeting Canada and Mexico, the Trump administration has floated the possibility of a blanket tariff on a range of countries in Asia, South America, Europe and other regions.",
      "\"I think we have to proceed on the assumption that some kinds of tariffs are going to be imposed on the United States' major trading partners,\" Brett House, professor of economics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In the end, there is a lot that gets announced by the president on social media that does not come to pass. I don't take it as bluffing, so much as a storm of possibilities, and it's hard to tell which bit of that storm is going to be pursued most aggressively, and most immediately.\"",
      "What's clear, by contrast, is that the new administration is picking up where Mr. Trump left off in his first term in using trade policy as an instrument of both economic and foreign policy. That is likely to lead to a period of uncertainty and volatility, said John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at supply-chain software firm E2open.",
      "\"A lot of alternatives are still possible,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch in an interview. \"We don't know, but game theory would suggest the president would implement tariffs in some form against Mexico and Canada \u2014 not blanket tariffs, but on a select number of imports from both nations... because otherwise his bluff is going to be called.\"",
      "On how soon any tariffs could take effect, Daco notes that Mr. Trump could move quickly by claiming authority under a 1977 law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "\"When he said he'll impose tariffs on Feb. 1, it is still an open question as to what means would be used. Do you want to implement tariffs immediately, as threatened against Colombia over the weekend, or are you threatening with a deadline to obtain concessions?\" Daco said.",
      "Would the U.S. face retaliation?",
      "Almost certainly, economists say. If Trump officials move ahead with tariffs on its northern neighbor, \"We anticipate Canada would then respond in kind by also implementing a 25% across-the-board tariff on U.S. imports,\" Satyam Panday, chief U.S. and Canada economist with S&P Global Ratings, said in an email.",
      "Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, previously vowed to remove U.S.-made alcoholic beverages from stores in the Canadian province, according to the Associated Press. Canada is the world's second-largest market for America's distilled spirits, behind European Union.",
      "Elijah Oliveros-Rosen, chief emerging markets economist at S&P Global Ratings, predicted Mexico also would fire back with targeted tariffs. \"In the case of Mexico, we think it's very unlikely the government would place tariffs on U.S.-manufactured imports, given most are intermediate goods eventually exported to the U.S. Therefore, we expect the Mexican government could impose tariffs on agricultural and food imports, but not manufacturing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that strengthening the U.S.' stance on trade issues will help protect American workers and lead to a resurgence of domestic manufacturing. Yet such policies could come at the cost of damaging critical relationships with other nations around the world, said Douglas Irwin, a U.S. trade policy expert and professor of economics at Dartmouth College.",
      "What is the risk to American consumers?",
      "Irwin and other economists say tariffs are all but certain to lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. That's because companies that end up on the hook typically pass added costs along to consumers in order to protect their bottom lines.",
      "\"The notion this administration has been adhering to is somewhat surprising \u2014 the idea that if you implement gradual tariffs over time, such as in 5% increments, that these are less inflationary,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This idea is misguided, because if you have incremental price increases month after month, if anything that leads to higher inflation expectations. It leads to higher inflation on a month-to-month basis.\"",
      "If Mr. Trump's tariffs are implemented in full, including a universal 10% tax on all goods, consumer price inflation could rise to between 3% and 4%, according to an analysis this week from Capital Economics. To be sure, analysts with the investment advisory firm expect Mr. Trump to stop short of imposing a blanket tariff and instead pick his targets.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, suggested that a volley of tariffs between the countries would also impact U.S. consumers.",
      "\"From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose,\" he said in an email.",

      "The company announced on Jan. 24 that it would end its DEI goals that were previously set to increase Black employees' representation and advancement, improve Black shoppers' experiences and promote Black-owned businesses. They are also pulling back on efforts to include hiring and promoting women, minorities, LGBTQ+ people and veterans.",
      "Activists held a press conference at Target headquarters in downtown Minneapolis Thursday morning.",
      "\"For decades, Target has benefitted from nearly unfettered support from Minnesota residents, families and consumers all around the country. In the past, Target was known for its diversity initiatives and reputation for supporting diverse communities,\" said civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. \"Now Target has shown its true face by deciding to roll back its focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion by putting profits and politics over people.\"",
      "Armstrong encouraged Minnesotans to start boycotting Target stores indefinitely starting Saturday, Feb. 1.",
      "\"We do not believe it is a coincidence that Target made this decision after the holiday shopping season and roughly one week before the start of Black History Month,\" said Monique Cullars-Doty, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Minnesota.",
      "Speakers at Thursday's event made two requests: for employees to speak up and for shoppers to shop elsewhere.",

      "\"If you would have told me in those summers and months to come here today, talking about Target reversing its decision, I would personally say I couldn't believe it,\" said Hussein.",
      "He speculated that Target would reverse course by the end of February. On the other side of the boycott, Black business owners like Tabitha Brown \u2014 who sells kitchenware and has had her products highlighted in Target stores under the company's previous DEI initiatives \u2014 said in an Instagram video that she understands the anger. However, she asked for those who may consider a boycott to reconsider.",
      "\"If we all decide to boycott and be like, 'No, we're not spending no money at these organizations,' so many of us will be affected and our sales would drop our business would be hurt,\" said Brown.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' pill, Journavx, for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries.",
      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",
      "Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain.",
      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",
      "Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 16:55:32 -0500",
    "summary": "The humble egg is now a source of frustration for millions of shoppers around the U.S, who face soaring prices and shortages. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "At Market Basket locations in some parts of Massachusetts, customers are being asked to limit their egg purchases\u00a0to two cartons per family. Another shopper on the hunt for eggs, this one in Las Vegas, reported finding\u00a0empty shelves\u00a0at a local grocery store. On social media, a consumer\u00a0accustomed to paying around $2 for a dozen eggs expressed shock over now having to pay more than double that amount.",
      "Egg restrictions, shortages and record-high prices are ruffling feathers at supermarkets across the U.S. as a deadly strain of avian flu\u00a0continues to decimate\u00a0the country's poultry flocks. To the dismay of consumers still struggling to digest soaring food costs, that likely means even higher egg prices in 2025.",
      "\"I think eggs have felt relatively extreme over the past few months,\" Kip Green, co-owner and general manager of Montague Diner in Brooklyn, New York, told CBS News. \"We're fortunate though, we have a great relationships with our purveyors, with farmers. So everybody is trying to help each other out, which is lovely.\"",
      "Like many diners, Montague uses hundreds of eggs a day said Green. Whether served as part of a classic breakfast plate alongside potatoes and toast, or an egg salad sandwich, eggs comprise 40% to 50% of the restaurant's menu, she said.",
      "\"I mean, it's even like, there's some things that you might not even think about, like in our pancake batter or like in our French toast batter, like just things like that. We still use so many eggs.\"",
      "Even so, Green said that she and her team are \"aligned on keeping guests at the forefront,\" which means shielding them from price hikes on eggs.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it's challenging. Like we, we have to figure out how to make it work,\" she said. \"Eggs are central to us, we are a diner. You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Devastating for farmers",
      "The bird flu outbreaks disrupting the nation's egg supplies are a dealing a serious blow to affected farmers. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. Replenishing supplies is yet another challenge.",
      "\"It takes approximately 19-20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs in newly repopulated barns, and that is but one element of a lengthy recovery process,\" a spokesperson for the American Egg Board said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Bird flu is absolutely devastating to an egg farm. When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "Other factors",
      "Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.",
      "As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",
      "Correction:\u00a0This story has been revised because it mistakenly reported that it takes less than six weeks for commercial hens to produce eggs. This is incorrect. It takes 19 to 20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs, according to the American Egg Board. The trade group also notes that it can take more than a year for farms suffering a bird flu outbreak to secure the required government clearance to resume operations.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 12:48:00 -0500",
    "summary": "With tax season underway, here's what you need to know about tracking your tax refund and your new 2025 tax brackets.",
    "story": [
      "Tax season is now underway, with the IRS accepting returns for all taxpayers as of Jan. 27. That's prompting many people to turn to the \"Where's my refund?\" app from the tax agency to track when they'll get their check.",
      "Americans are expected to file about 140 million returns before the April 15 deadline. Last year, about two-thirds of taxpayers got a refund, with the average check at about $3,100,\u00a0according\u00a0to IRS data.",
      "A household's tax refund may represent their biggest check for the entire year, with many consumers planning to use the money for debt repayment, emergency savings or a big purchase. To be sure, while a large refund may feel like a financial windfall, it actually represents income that taxpayers have overpaid to the IRS throughout the year.",
      "That's why some financial experts describe refund checks as tax-free loans to the U.S. government. Yet other experts note that tax refunds can act as a form of forced savings that a household might not otherwise be able to accomplish, allowing those taxpayers to reap the benefit in their annual refund.",
      "Whatever the case might be, tracking your refund can be done through the IRS' \"Where's my refund\" app, which the agency has sought to improve over the last few years. Here's what to know.",
      "How does \"Where's my refund?\" work?",
      "The IRS operates the \"Where's my refund?\" service on its website, but taxpayers can also use a mobile app called IRS2Go\u00a0on their phones or other devices. Both services will provide information about your 2024 return about 24 hours after you e-file, the IRS says.",
      "However, people who file paper returns will need to wait about 4 weeks for their information to appear on \"Where's my refund?\" or the IRS2Go app.",
      "Both services require taxpayers to enter information to be able to track their refunds:",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification numberFiling status, such as single filer or married filing jointly\u00a0The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification number",
      "Filing status, such as single filer or married filing jointly",
      "The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "The IRS tracking services will then show you information on whether the agency has received your tax return, if the refund has been approved and when the money is scheduled to land in your account.",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "That depends on whether you've file electronically or sent in a paper tax return, as well as if the IRS identifies any problems with your return.",
      "People who e-filed their returns typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days. In other words, a taxpayer who filed their 1040 on Jan. 27 could receive their payment by Feb. 17, if all goes smoothly.",
      "However, the IRS opened its Free File service on Jan. 10, which is a program offered through tax software companies for taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024. Those using Free File could be on tap to receive their refunds by Jan. 31.",
      "What can delay your tax refund?",
      "Filing a paper return can delay your refund because it requires IRS employees to process them, which takes more time than e-filed returns, which are largely handled by computers.",
      "Claiming either the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) can also slow down a tax refund. That's because, by law, the IRS can't issue refunds for returns that have claimed those tax credits before mid-February.",
      "\"The IRS expects most EITC/ACTC-related refunds to be available in taxpayer bank accounts or on debit cards by March 3 if they chose direct deposit and there are no other issues with their tax return,\" the agency said on Monday.",
      "Some issues can also trip up tax refunds, such as if there are math errors on your return, missing or incorrect Social Security numbers or misspelled names, according to the IRS. While these might be innocent mistakes, it can cause the IRS to flag your return and delay your refund.",
      "What's my new 2025 tax bracket?",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it will leave its benchmark rate unchanged, hitting the brakes on lowering borrowing costs for individuals and businesses after a flurry of rate cuts starting last fall.",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The decision comes after the central bank trimmed rates three times starting in September 2024, which has pushed down the federal funds rate \u2014 the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one percentage point.",
      "The pause, the Fed's first rate decision since President Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, comes as economists predict the central bank is likely to take a wait-and-see approach to the president's economic policies, given that some, such as higher tariffs, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Fed's decision to keep rates steady reflects stubborn U.S. inflation, which remains close to 3% on an annual basis. That has fueled concerns that additional rate cuts could reignite price increases, making it more difficult to get to the Fed's 2% target. Notably, the Fed removed a line from its December statement expressing its belief that inflation \"has made progress\" toward its goal. Yet Powell struck a more dovish tone in a press conference to discuss the Fed's decision.",
      "\"Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well-anchored, as reflected in a broad, broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets,\" he said.",
      "Powell also described the economy as \"in quite a good place,\" citing growing GDP, solid job gains and a low unemployment rate, as well as signs of inflationary pressures easing. \"We don't need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,\" he added.",

With the Fed hitting the pause button, it's unlikely that consumers will see lower borrowing costs on credit cards or other forms of debt, even as more households struggle to pay their bills.",
      "\"[L]ower- and middle-income households are facing mounting pressure, as evidenced by an increase in credit card and auto loan delinquencies,\" Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual of America Capital Management, said in an email.",
      "When will the Fed cut rates?",
      "The Fed may hold off on cutting rates until its May 7 meeting, according to economists polled by financial-data firm FactSet. That means the central bank is expected to hold rates steady at its next meeting on March 19.",
      "\"If the Fed doesn't resume cutting in the next few months, however, we suspect the window will have closed,\" Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said in a report. \"While markets are still pricing in second half rate cuts, our view is that a flurry of tariffs will put a stop to that, as inflation rebounds to 3%.\"",
      "Asked about the possible impact of Mr. Trump's economic plans, Powell demurred, noting that while the Fed is monitoring the new administration's policies, it's too early for the central bank to make an assessment of their possible impact. Mr. Trump has vowed to enact a broad tariff of 10% on all imports, as well as to imposed\u00a025% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1.",
      "\"We need to let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make that a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be,\" he said. \"We don't know what's going to be tariffed, we don't know for how long or how much, what countries, we don't know about retaliation.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News' Richard Escobedo about economic uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's plan to deport undocumented immigrants, Powell responded that the administration's efforts are not yet showing up in economic data.",
      "\"Businesses that are dependent on immigrant labor are saying that it's suddenly gotten harder to get people,\" the Fed chair said. \"But again, you don't see that in the aggregate data, but yes, you hear it anecdotally.\"",
      "While inflation has subsided from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, it\u00a0rose 2.9% in December on a year-over-year basis due to higher prices on gasoline, which rose 4.4% from the prior month, as well as food and housing.",
      "In its statement, the Fed described the labor market as \"solid,\" with an unemployment rate that has \"stabilized at a low level in recent months.\" Even so, the Fed is closely monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness, with the central bank pointing to a rise in the jobless rate last fall as one reason why it opted to cut rates at the time.",
      "\"The Fed will keep their options open in case a sudden weakening materializes in the months to come\" in the labor market, noted Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride in an email.",

      "Borrowers hoping for more financial relief from the Federal Reserve may have a wait on their hands, as the central bank is hit the pause button on additional rate cuts at its Jan. 29 meeting.",
      "The Fed held its benchmark rate steady on Wednesday at its current range between 4.25% to 4.5%, a move that was forecast by a majority of economists polled by FactSet. Most economists also predict the Fed will hold off on cutting at its March 19 meeting, which means the next rate cut might not occur until the central bank's May 7 meeting, FactSet data shows.",
      "The January pause marks an end, at least temporarily, to the Fed's flurry of rate cuts that started in September 2024 which have pushed down the federal funds rate by one percentage point. That's helped trim borrowing costs for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other debt, providing some respite to inflation-pinched consumers and businesses.",
      "But in December, the Fed had signaled that it expected fewer cuts\u00a0in 2025 than it had earlier projected, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointing to inflation that remains above the central bank's goal of an annual 2% rate. Economists say it's likely the Fed wants to take a wait-and-see approach to the Trump administration's policies such as adding new tariffs and widespread deportations of immigrants, which could both prove inflationary.",
      "\"The reason why the Fed isn't jumping the gun at lowering the rates faster and further is that, on one hand, inflation is not gone. They looked carefully at the data, and it is still stubbornly above target, so there is concern if you lower rates further, inflation would tick up again,\" Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Secondly, he added, \"Tariffs or mass deportations are expected to be inflationary. For that reason, the Fed is also right to be careful about lowering rates.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the rate pause by the fed.",
      "When did the Fed make its rate decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve announced its rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Jan. 29. It will be followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. EST.",
      "How will a pause on rate cuts impact my money?",
      "The Fed cut its benchmark rate three times last year, kicking off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September. That was followed by two consecutive\u00a00.25 percentage point cuts: one at its November meeting and a second at its December meeting.",
      "The pause in early 2025 means that consumers can't expect additional near-term relief on borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"Anyone hoping for the Fed to ride in as the cavalry and rescue you from high interest rates anytime soon is going to be really disappointed,\" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, in an email. \"That's true whether you're talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards or most anything else.\"",
      "Because credit card rates and other borrowing costs aren't likely to change, consumers should work on getting their higher-interest debt under control, Schulz added. Turning to a 0% balance transfer credit card or consolidating credit card debt with a personal loan can prove helpful with lowering interest payments, he noted.",
      "If there's a bright side, it's for savers, given that they should still be able to find solid rates on high-yield savings accounts, even though they've declined since the Fed began trimming its benchmark rate last year, Schulz said. Some savings accounts are still paying above 4%, down from about 5% a year ago.",
      "\"Returns on high-yield savings accounts have fallen from their record levels as the Fed has moved to lower rates. However, as the Fed pauses, that decline should slow as well,\" he said.",
      "When will mortgage rates come down?",
      "One of the disappointments for house hunters, as well as homeowners who want to refinance into lower rates, has been stubbornly high mortgage rates. Despite the Fed's three rate cuts last year, the average 30-year home loan remains near 7%, near 25-year highs.",
      "Mortgage rates haven't declined despite the Fed's cuts because home loans are based on a number of factors besides the federal funds rate, including broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "Given concerns from economists that President Trump's plans could prove inflationary, mortgage rates might not come down anytime soon, experts said.",
      "\"The general consensus is that rates will likely remain unchanged until the market has more clarity around potential policy impacts as it relates to immigration, taxes and tariffs,\" noted Austin Walker, CEO of A. Walker & Co., a housing finance company.",
      "Will interest rates go down under President Trump?",
      "Last week at the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would \"demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world.\"",
      "It's unlikely that Mr. Trump could influence the Fed to lower rates, as the central bank is an independent institution that bases its decisions on economic data, rather than orders from elected officials, experts say.",
      "Rates are set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which consists of 12 members \u2014 seven members come from the Fed's Board of Governors; four stem from the eleven Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis, and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Powell, meanwhile, has said he won't step down if Mr. Trump, who has previously criticized Powell's performance, asks him to resign, adding that the president doesn't have the power to fire or demote the Fed chair. His term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "At the same time, economists are forecasting more rate cuts in 2025, but not until May or even later, according to FactSet polling. But one wild card is whether inflation could tick higher in early 2025 due to the Trump administration's policies.",
      "\"Importantly, the outlook is clouded by heightened policy uncertainty as a new administration takes office,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in an email. Daco added he is forecasting three 0.25 percentage point cuts this year \u2014 in March, June and September. \"This year, we expect the Fed will tread carefully.\"",

      "From meat inspectors to border patrol officers, many Americans who work for the federal government could soon see their jobs reclassified into at-will positions, meaning they can be dismissed for nearly any reason.",
      "In a related development, the White House expects up to 10% of federal employees to quit in September in a program meant to\u00a0end work-from-home practices, senior administration officials told CBS News.",
      "Depending on future court rulings and how effective the Trump administration proves to be in overriding existing federal regulations, an executive order signed by President Trump revives a policy from his first administration known as Schedule F. The Jan. 20\u00a0directive\u00a0creates a new employment classification for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of job protections.",
      "Likely to impact tens of thousands of civil servants, and potentially more, the order defines policymaking positions to include mundane tasks such as viewing and circulating proposed government regulations.",
      "\"We think this order affects at least 50,000 people who are currently protected, but the number could be much bigger,\" Nick Bednar, a University of Minnesota Law School associate professor, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Some scholars think it could reach into the hundreds of thousands. At the end of the first term, when the Trump administration sought to reclassify positions, it included executive assistants, toxicologists and scientists \u2014 it's not clear who this doesn't reach.\"",
      "\"Individuals in these policymaking positions don't have the same due process protections as other employees. They can be more easily removed,\" Bednar added. \"There are 2.8 million civilian employees in the federal government. Most, or the vast majority, enjoy some kind of protection from removal.\"",
      "For now, it remains unclear how far the Trump administration plans to go in implementing the order, said Steve Lenkart, executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE-IAM), a union representing 100,000 government workers.",
      "\"Technically, if you're a maintenance person pushing a broom on the floor, you are executing a policy,\" said Lenkart in offering an example of how virtually any government worker could be defined as being engaged in work that falls under Schedule F.",
      "\"President Trump has the executive power to make decisions to implement a government that reflects the will of the American people,\" Harrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary at the White House, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"If an individual in the administration is working on policy, then they should align with President Trump's mission of putting America first.\"",
      "Hit to morale?",
      "President Trump is not unique in looking to have a stronger hand over the federal workforce, according to Bednar.",
      "\"A common strategy of presidents is trying to politicize federal employment positions so they have greater control over executive branch hiring and firing,\" said Bednar, who lists Dwight Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter among previous presidents who have sought to exert such influence. Still, he noted \"we haven't seen something that tries to reach this deep into the career staff.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump's Schedule F plan and other administration orders aimed a reshaping the federal workplace are being challenged in court, the Trump administration may succeed in its goal of downsizing government, regardless of whether it wins on the legal front, Bednar said.",
      "\"Even if the lawsuits slow down this process, there are many civil servants who might leave government fearing continuing to work in the Trump administration \u2014 employee moral is really affected,\" he said. \"They want a smaller government, and they view this as an opportunity to pursue that.\"",
      "Bednar also cautions that a smaller government workforce could hinder some Trump administration policy goals, including fewer agents to patrol U.S. borders and reduced staffing in immigration courts, adding to the current backlog.",
      "The case for and against Schedule F",
      "Mr. Trump originally implemented the Schedule F policy in 2020 as his first term was nearing an end, but it was repealed after former President Joe Biden took office. Mr. Trump said last week that the revived order is necessary to ensure that federal workers in roles that affect government policy remain accountable to the public.",
      "\"In recent years ... there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership,\" Mr. Trump's order states. \"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character.\"",
      "But critics of Schedule F argue it undermines the traditional principles behind civil service, which emphasize hiring based on professional qualifications. Should Schedule F survive legal challenges, they say, millions of government workers hired based on merit could be fired at will, including if they are deemed insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Is this really about making government more efficient and smaller, or targeting regulatory and law enforcement people?\" asked Lenkart, who noted that the number of workers employed in the executive branch has remained roughly the same for more than 70 years even as the nation's population has doubled.",
      "Unions representing public workers have blasted Schedule F. The policy is among a slew of executive orders \"designed to intimidate and attack nonpartisan civil servants under the guise of increasing efficiency,\" Randy Erwin, national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0last week. \"However, these orders will do the exact opposite.\"",
      "Members of the 100-year-old NFFE are employed\u00a0by\u00a0dozens of federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration and Social Security Administration.",
      "On Wednesday, the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) filed suit against the Trump administration, saying it was exceeding its authority in rolling back protections for workers.",
      "\"We can stop the efforts to fire hundreds of thousands of experienced, hard-working Americans who have dedicated their careers to serving their country and prevent these career civil servants from being replaced with unqualified political flunkies loyal to the president, but not the law or Constitution,\" AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union also filed a suit to block Schedule F, calling it \"contrary to congressional intent.\" The\u00a0complaint, filed Jan. 20 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, argues that Mr. Trump's order reinstating Schedule F \"wrongly applies employment rules for political appointees to career staff, deprives federal employees of due process rights that they were promised when they were hired, and ignores Office of Personnel Management regulations.\"",
      "NTEU represents about 150,000 workers in 37 federal agencies and departments, including staff at the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Health and Human Services.",

    "title": "What does Trump's federal funding freeze mean for people who get aid?",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 14:36:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Many are unclear on how sweeping the federal funding freeze is intended to be. Here are programs it could affect.",
    "story": [
      "Update: The White House Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday, Jan. 29, rescinded a memo ordering a federal funding freeze less than two days after it caused chaos and stoked fear that the directive could adversely affect millions of Americans.",
      "A White House memo ordering a broad freeze on federal grants and loans by 5 p.m. Tuesday left ordinary Americans who depend on such aid, as well as seasoned budget experts, scratching their heads.",
      "The memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) suspending the federal funding was vague in its wording, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. Adding to the whiplash, a federal judge on Tuesday\u00a0temporarily blocked the freeze, and the Trump administration walked back the memo on Wednesday.",
      "\"In light of the injunction, OMB has rescinded the memo to end any confusion on federal policy created by the court ruling and the dishonest media coverage,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday. \"The executive orders issued by the president on funding reviews remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by all agencies and departments. This action should effectively end the court case and allow the government to focus on enforcing the president's orders on controlling federal spending.\"",
      "Trump administration rescinds federal funding freeze memo after chaos",
      "Trump administration rescinds federal funding freeze memo after chaos",
      "Before OMB abruptly reversed course, experts had questioned the policy, saying it was poorly thought out and implemented.",
      "\"If this was being undertaken pursuant to the executive orders on [diversity, equity and inclusion], why would the administration issue such broad, unclear and confusing directions?\" Tad DeHaven, a policy analyst focusing on economic and fiscal policy issues at the libertarian Cato Institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I don't really understand it, and I think even people who are in positions of power don't really understand it,\" added Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at Brookings, a liberal-leaning public policy research group.",
      "What programs aren't affected by the funding freeze?",
      "The memo, from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), indicated that Social Security and Medicare programs would be exempt from the suspension in federal funding. Additional guidance released Tuesday further specified that \"any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the updated guidance said.",
      "The memo adds that funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance and other similar programs are also exempt.",
      "But even if the order ends up being more narrowly tailored, it could still have serious financial implications for the millions of Americans who receive federal assistance, experts said.",
      "\"If it's resolved quickly, the aggregate economic effects for the first quarter will be modest, but it will matter a whole lot to people on the other side of these expected payments,\" Edelberg said. \"It could be the difference between having a job and not, getting evicted or affording food \u2014 and the economic numbers won't fully reflect how individuals are going to feel this.\"",
      "Here's what to know about who may be affected by the proposed pause in federal funding.",
      "Will I still get SNAP benefits?",
      "The freeze does not apply to all federal financial assistance, according to an Office of Management and Budget memo on Tuesday. The agency indicates that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, better known as food stamps, are excluded, specifying that \"... any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the memo reads.",
      "SNAP serves roughly 41 million low-income Americans.",
      "Yet while the program appears to be exempt from the freeze, \"You are still going to be really worried in the near term whether the federal government is going to make good on those promises,\" Edelberg said. \"And that kind of uncertainty is not good for the economy.\"",
      "Are meals for seniors affected?",
      "The Older Americans Act Nutrition Program, a federal initiative that supports community-based senior nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels, could be affected by the proposed funding pause.",
      "If the order includes the Older Americans Act, it \"would halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" Meals on Wheels said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lack of clarity is creating chaos for Meals on Wheels providers not knowing whether they should be serving meals today.\"",
      "Is housing assistance at risk?",
      "The OMB memo added that rental assistance and other similar programs will not be paused. Still, the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) expressed concern that Department of Housing and Urban Development programs could be covered by the freeze.",
      "\"Even a short pause in funding could cause significant harm to low-income families and their communities,\" NLIHC Interim President and CEO Renee Willis said in a\u00a0statement. \"The longer the freeze continues, the greater the risk that low-income households receiving federal rental assistance could face eviction, and in the worst cases, homelessness \u2014 homeless shelters may be forced to close their doors, and nonprofit organizations may have to lay off staff.\"",
      "Are student loans affected?",
      "The federal funding freeze does not apply to student loans and Pell grants, according to the Department of Education. The funding pause \"only applies to discretionary grants at the Department of Education,\" DOE spokesperson Madi Biedermann said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, an advocate for students with government loans said they are worried about the impact of the freeze.",
      "\"Any kind of freeze to federal financial aid across the board is incredibly harmful to working families just trying to pay for college,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that \"Lots of questions remain about what the freeze applies to and what programs it does not,\"",
      "Meanwhile, many student borrowers rely on different kinds of government assistance to cover costs beyond tuition, Ba\u00f1ez noted.",
      "\"There are other types of federal work-study grants that go directly to colleges and universities, and supplemental education opportunities that go to some of the lowest-income students. People really rely on federal financial aid, and you could see families having to drop out of college or figure out how they will cover this gap,\" she said.",
      "The OMB memo also indicated that Head Start, a preschool program serving nearly 800,000 low-income children that receives federal health funds, is not impacted by the pause.",
      "But the National Head Start Association (NHSA) said that the OMB memo has already \"created panic among Head Start grant recipients who are currently not able to draw down any funds.\"",
      "\"While we understand that this is an evolving story, this disruption, at best, will slow down Head Start agencies' ability to pay hundreds of thousands of staff, contractors, and small businesses who support Head Start operations in every corner of the country,\" NHSA Executive Director Yasmina Vinci said in a statement. \"At worst, this means that hundreds of thousands of families will not be able to depend on the critical services and likely will not be able to work.\"",
      "Medicaid systems go down",
      "Despite the updated guidance issued Tuesday stating that programs including Medicaid were excluded from the funding pause, state Medicaid programs on Tuesday\u00a0said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "The White House late Tuesday pointed to an \"outage\" for blocking a range of organizations and agencies from accessing the online systems responsible for tapping federal health dollars.",
      "The Payment Management Services web portal displayed a message reading: \"Due to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "The National Association of Medicaid Directors is seeking clarification on the interruption from the White House, according to a spokesperson.",
      "By Wednesday, multiple state Medicaid programs had reported that they were able to resume accessing their payment systems after the nationwide lockout.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump had a message last week for the Federal Reserve while at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland: He plans to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump may be in for disappointment. The Federal Reserve widely expected to keep its benchmark rate steady when it announces its latest interest rate decision today at 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Economists aren't penciling in a 2025 reduction until at least May, according to economists polled by financial data service FactSet.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has over the years steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. Most recently, he underlined at a New York Times event in December that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials. The Fed's independence allows it to pursue its dual mandate \u2014 to keep inflation low and the labor market at full employment \u2014 without political pressure, economists concur.",
      "\"We know monetary policy needs to be enacted with a democratic mandate underpinning it, with a day-to-day remove from politics,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Interest rates may need to be raised but it may be inconvenient for political interests, and [the central bank] may need to move quickly to lower rates\" in case of an economic downturn.",
      "While the Fed is an independent agency, it is accountable to Congress and the public, with its chair and other officials testifying before Congress regularly. Its dual mandate was also established by Congress, as well as its structure of staggered appointments for Fed officials, designed to make the agency less vulnerable to pressures \"that could lead to undesirable outcomes,\" according to the Fed.",
      "What happens when a central bank isn't independent?",
      "Those \"undesirable outcomes\" can be seen in nations where central bankers are more vulnerable to political influence, economists say.",
      "That's because interest rates remain the most potent weapon that a central bank can wield against surging inflation \u2014 a tool that the Federal Reserve turned to in 2022 to tame the hottest U.S. inflation in 40 years. But elected officials sometimes decide that higher borrowing costs are politically inconvenient, because they make it more expensive for businesses to expand or for consumers to make purchases.",
      "In cases where a central bank isn't independent, officials may succeed in pressuring a central bank to keep a lid on rates.",
      "Experts point to Turkey as an example of what can occur when political interests dictate a central bank's monetary policies. Since 2010, its central bank has increasingly come under pressure from President Erdo\u011fan to keep its interest rates low, even as inflation surged during the pandemic, according to the non-partisan Centre for Economic Policy Research.",
      "Instead of hiking rates as Turkey's inflation rate topped 80% in October 2022 on an annual basis, the nation's central bank cut its benchmark rate several times in 2022 and 2023. While the bank reversed course and hiked rates starting in mid-2023, inflation there has proved tough to tame, with prices rising by 44% in December 2024.",
      "By comparison, the highest U.S. inflation rate during the post-pandemic period was in June 2022, when inflation hit 9.1% on an annual basis in June 2022. In the face of the Fed's rate hikes, inflation has cooled since then, deflating to 2.9% on an annual basis last month.",
      "\"The Fed has done really well \u2014 they have raised the rates enough to try to slowly squeeze inflation out of the market,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University. The Fed has \"done all that while avoiding a recession \u2014 that is a delicate needle to thread.\"",
      "Could Mr. Trump influence the Fed?",
      "Questions about Mr. Trump's ability to influence the Federal Reserve or shake up its leadership are intensifying amid the president's statements about his desire for lower interest rates. During his 2024 election campaign, Mr. Trump had insisted that as president he should have a \"say\" in the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in August.",
      "For his part, Powell said last year that he would not resign\u00a0even if asked to do so by Mr. Trump, adding that under the law presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "However, Mr. Trump has recently fired several government officials in ways that critics say violate the law, such as his administration's firing of more than a dozen federal inspectors general on Friday. Federal law requires the White House to give Congress a full month of warning and case-specific details before firing a federal inspector general.",
      "Removing Powell wouldn't necessarily change the Fed's monetary policy decisions, given that rates are set by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Seven members are from the Fed's Board of Governors; four are assigned from the 11 Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis; and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",

      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 17:19:32 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has painted a bullseye on diversity, equity and inclusion. But what exactly is DEI, and what has it achieved?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government is renewing debate over what DEI is and whether it has benefited workers and companies.",
      "DEI has its roots in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which barred employment discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion and other criteria. In the following decades, a range of policies have sought to root out bias in hiring, promote fairness in the workplace and open career pathways for people of color and for women, while also expanding to include sexual orientation and gender identity.",
      "This push gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, as politicians and social activists pressed companies to do their part in confronting systemic racism. But Mr. Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0order, issued on his first day back in office, criticized DEI as \"illegal and immoral,\" while the following day a memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave.",
      "What is DEI in the workplace?",
      "DEI is often misperceived as focusing only on race, according to DEI experts. But such initiatives comprise many practices that aim to uplift different marginalized groups in the workplace. For example, a policy that accommodates working parents, such as flexible work hours, could qualify as DEI. So could establishing affinity groups based on shared identities, like sexual orientation.",
      "Many critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. Other opponents of the policies go further, arguing that DEI itself promotes racism.",
      "But DEI defenders say that policies that seek to foster diversity and inclusion within organizations aren't in conflict with those that seek to reward the most talented or hardest-working employees.",
      "\"DEI enhances merit by saying, 'How do we find the best people for the job or make sure we are promoting the best people?'\" David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And that means thinking about barriers and biases that might be getting in the way of considering the full talent pool.\"",
      "In defining DEI, Glasgow described \"diversity\" as a commitment to diversifying personnel within an institution so that U.S. workplaces better represent the population at large. \"It's about engaging in effective outreach to places that might be overlooked and making sure hiring and promotion systems aren't screening out women or people of color from being considered,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, when designed and implemented effectively, DEI programs are not discriminatory, according to Jessica Fulton, vice president of Policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit that aims to improve African-Americans' socioeconomic status.",
      "\"These policies don't actually dictate who gets hired. They are ways to open doors to people who might not have access or aren't as well-connected in an industry or occupation,\" she explained.",
      "The equity piece of DEI seeks to level the playing field for groups of workers who have historically been underrepresented in a given field or who, compared with their white or male peers, are underpaid for doing the same work.",
      "\"It could mean making sure women are able to enter traditionally male-dominated occupations, like construction or technology,\" Fulton said. \"It's about addressing issues around equal pay for equal work, making sure people feel safe in the workplace so they don't feel discrimination when they come to work, because workers who don't feel safe are not the most productive.\"",
      "Corporations also commonly aim to develop inclusion policies that help people from diverse backgrounds feel safe within a given workplace and its culture, she explained. They are intended to be, and often are, inclusive of everyone and not just members of marginalized communities, according to Fulton.",
      "\"It is also making sure they can put certain policies in place to make sure their workers stick around and keep working. It is about building a great team and being able to treat that team well and retain the folks they hire,\" Fulton said.",
      "Given the recent backlash against DEI, though, a number of corporations are moving away from such inclusion policies, noting that they could pose a legal risk. That's after many major U.S. employers already ditched their DEI programs in response to pressure from anti-diversity activists. Among them are Ford,\u00a0Harley Davidson,\u00a0McDonald's, Meta and more.",
      "How is success measured?",
      "Many corporate executives have soured on DEI in recent years because of the perception that such policies don't enhance a company's performance, said Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture. Other leaders, while recognizing the value of promoting diversity and inclusion, argue that DEI is inadequate for redressing what are at bottom much broader socioeconomic issues.",
      "Glasgow of NYU Law concedes that it can be hard to determine if DEI programs are succeeding or otherwise clearly assess their outcomes. \"It's difficult to measure certain DEI interventions, like the effectiveness of implicit bias training in the workplace,\" he said. \"It also depends on what you are trying to achieve.\"",
      "One tool employers use to try to gauge the efficacy of DEI policies are internal surveys that ask workers whether they feel like they can be themselves in the office, believe they are respected by their peers, and feel that their opinions matter. When it comes to a company's mentorship and promotion policies, employers will also monitor if members of a particular group of workers, such as veterans and Black employees, are quitting shortly after being hired \u2014 patterns that can yield insights into a workplace's equity and inclusiveness.",
      "By contrast, if over time more women or people of color ascend to leadership positions, that could be viewed as a company achieving its goal of building a workplace that's more representative of its job applicant pool.",
      "Corporate DEI programs aren't altruistic, experts emphasize, pointing to at least some empirical evidence showing that such efforts can help companies adapt to change, support innovation and even boost the bottom line.",
      "\"The point of diversity and inclusion is that companies, the government, universities, all do better when there are diverse participants in management and throughout the enterprise,\" said Michael Posner, director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"The objective of this is not to set quotas or say we are going to take unqualified people because they fit a certain characteristic, like gender or race, but to create opportunity and try to overcome historic barriers to entry.\"",
      "In one noted study, McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for the gender diversity of their boards of director are 27% more likely to outperform financially than those in the bottom quartile. In separate research, the consulting firm in 2024 found that women's representation at work over the past decade has increased at every level of corporate management \u2014 women today make up 29% of C-suite level positions, up from 17% in 2015.",
      "\"[A] lot of the language and framing right now of DEI as illegal and discriminatory obscures who it's really for, which is all of us, and to the benefit of companies,\" Fulton told CBS MoneyWatch.",

According to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election, 100 workers rejected the motion.",
      "\"This fight is far from over, but today's victory is an important step forward,\" said Wendell Young IV, the president of UFCW Local 1776. \"We are ready to bring Whole Foods to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair first contract that reflects the workers' needs and priorities.\"",
      "The results mark the first successful entry of organized labor into Amazon's grocery business, which includes Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and the Amazon Go convenience stores. Amazon, which purchased Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion, has tried to fend off organizing efforts in its stores as well as by delivery drivers and warehouse workers.",
      "Nearly three years ago, Amazon warehouse workers in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to be represented in labor negotiations by a fledgling union that has since affiliated with the Teamsters. But Amazon has refused to come to the bargaining table.",
      "Employees at the Whole Foods store, located in the center of Philadelphia, started organizing early last year, Young said. They teamed up with UFCW Local 1776 in the late summer, and in November petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold an official election.",
      "The local union said the store workers hoped a successful vote would help them secure higher wages, more affordable health care coverage, child care support, greater work-life balance and better working conditions.",

      "The company said it provides store employees with a competitive average hourly wage and other benefits, such as 401(k) plans and \"on-demand\" mental health support. It did not disclose its average hourly rate, but some online job postings show store employees can earn $16 per hour or higher.",
      "After the union filed the election petition, workers at the Philadelphia store were given free snacks, and the company repainted their break rooms, according to Young.",
      "Earlier this month, UFCW Local 1776 filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against the company, accusing it of firing one worker in retaliation for union activities and alleging that supervisors told employees they would get paid more if they rejected the union bid.

      "The company acknowledges it did not offer wage increases to workers at the store, even though it did so at a number of other stores as part of a quarterly review. Whole Foods maintains it would have been illegal to make wage adjustments in the lead-up to the union election, an argument Young disputed.",

      "A decision by the acting leadership at the U.S. Justice Department to delete its public webpages and case summaries of the Jan. 6 siege at the Capitol prosecution has triggered a legal challenge from a watchdog group and blowback from a federal judge who oversaw some of the cases.",
      "The controversial decision has also drawn the ire of one of the rioters who pleaded guilty.",
      "The Justice Department had built a comprehensive database of the approximately 1,600 defendants from the U.S. Capitol attack and had produced a monthly set of reports updating the prosecution, which was the largest in the agency's long history.

      "BATON ROUGE, La.\u00a0\u2014 A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the U.S.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "Prosecutors in Louisiana say a mother ordered the pill online and gave it to her child.",
      "\"The young child was told by the mother that she had to take the pill or else, and the child took the pill,\" District Attorney Tony Clayton said.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "\"To ship a pill from another state is equivalent to me of shipping fentanyl or any other type of drugs over here that end up in the mouths and stomachs of our minor kids,\" Clayton said.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "CBS News New York reached out to Carpenter, but has not heard back yet.",
      "Testing New York's shield laws",
      "The indictment could be the first direct test of New York's shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\"Earlier today, a New York doctor was indicted in Louisiana for using telemedicine to prescribe abortion medication to a patient. That's right: a doctor is being prosecuted for providing basic health care to her patient. We always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn't the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That's why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients. It's more critical than ever for states to step up and protect reproductive freedom \u2014 and I'll never back down from this fight,\" Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Hochul signed the bill protecting doctors from out-of-state lawsuits\u00a0in 2023.",
      "\"I will never under any circumstances turn this doctor over to the state of Louisiana under any extradition request,\" Hochul said in a video posted to social media. \"I will do everything I can to protect this doctor and allow her to continue the work that she's doing that is so essential.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, said in a statement:",
      "\"Abortion care is health care. The criminalization of abortion care is a direct and brazen attack on Americans' bodily autonomy and their right to reproductive freedom. This cowardly attempt out of Louisiana to weaponize the law against out-of-state providers is unjust and un-American. We will not allow bad actors to undermine our providers' ability to deliver critical care. Medication abortion is safe, effective, and necessary, and New York will ensure that it remains available to all Americans who need it.\"",
      "Legal experts say Carpenter may still face some hurdles.",
      "\"What happens when she tries to renew her medical license and she has a pending felony indictment in Louisiana? What happens to the doctor when she tries to fly somewhere and TSA says, hey, you have an active warrant?\" attorney Franz Borghardt said.",
      "Louisiana classifies abortion pills as \"controlled dangerous substances\"",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They're also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \"controlled dangerous substances.\" The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\"Make no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we've witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women's rights,\" the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \"It's no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\"",
      "Dr. Dara Kass, an emergency medicine physician in New York, said abortion bans are making it more dangerous for young girls and women.",
      "\"It's making it less safe to be pregnant, and it's increasing things like infant mortality and maternal mortality in states where abortions are restricted,\" she said.",

I've been with the agency for over 33 years and I've never seen anything like this.\"",
      "Starting Wednesday morning, more than 1,100 employees at the EPA received an email, which has been viewed by CBS News, warning they could be immediately fired because of their probationary status as an employee with less than a year in their current role.",
      "\"As a probationary/trial period employee, the agency has the right to immediately terminate you pursuant to 5 CFR \u00a7 315.804,\" read the email, which was sent to employees by Kimberly Patrick, principal deputy assistant administrator for mission support of the EPA.",
      "According to Owens-Powell, employees with a range of experience received the emails \u2014 some with less than a year at the EPA, as well as tenured employees who recently moved into new positions inside the agency.",
      "\"As far as we can tell, EPA workers were the only ones to receive a notice from their agency, intended to go to probationary employees to terrorize and scare them into thinking they were on their way out,\" she said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, an EPA spokesperson said the department is \"working to diligently implement President Trump's executive orders as well as subsequent associated implementation memos.\"",
      "\"President Trump was elected with a mandate from the American people, and he is following through on his promises. On Administrator Zeldin's first day in the office, he met with tons of career staff throughout EPA's headquarters spanning two city blocks in downtown D.C. and took to heart their advice as we work together to advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment,\" the EPA statement said.",
      "Owens-Powell says she was on a national call with other union leaders who represent workers at various government agencies, and no one else said their probationary employees received such an email.",
      "\"Every day, folks are afraid to turn their computers on,\" said Owens-Powell, \"They don't know what message will be coming out next.\"",
      "In addition to the concerns over their jobs, there is also stress and confusion over the Office of Management and Budget's temporary pause on government funds.",
      "\"Hundreds of EPA grantees are completely locked out of the grant system,\" says Michelle Roos, president of the Environmental Protection Network, a nonprofit formed in 2017 by hundreds of former EPA employees who work to maintain the integrity of the agency. \"They are unable to process payroll, they are unable to pay invoices, they're unable to do the critical work that they were granted to do.\"",
      "Even though the OMB memorandum was rescinded, agency employees still lack clarity and are being told not to communicate with grant recipients until new guidance is issued, says Roos.",
      "\"Most folks are terrified to speak to grantees beyond, 'I'm so sorry, I can't talk to you,'\" she said.",
      "There is a growing concern among grant recipients that if they are unable to receive certain approvals for required plans and goals, they will fall out of compliance and lose funding.",
      "\"These actions are unconstitutional and are unauthorized by law,\" said Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice for Lawyers For Good Government, a nonprofit of thousands of pro-bono lawyers across the country that is working with the unions to help protect government employees and their jobs.",
      "\"Ninety-five percent of the funding going to EPA has not only been appropriated, but is locked in, legally obligated grant funding. The Constitution does not give the president a line item veto over Congress's spending decisions,\" said Blanchard.",
      "While the mood inside the EPA appears grim, Owens-Powell and Blanchard both say they have seen a surge of new membership and participation in their organizations, as EPA workers contend with the flurry of executive orders and emails that have left many on edge about their futures.",
      "On a\u00a0Reddit page dedicated to discussing the buyout offer for federal workers, one poster wrote, \"I was looking for any way to get out of this fresh hell. But now I am fired up to make these goons as frustrated as possible.\" Another wrote, \"I'll continue to do my job and fight for the position I've earned. It took me 10 years of applying and 20 years experience in my field to get here.\"",
      "\"It's backfired and people are furious,\" says Owens-Powell. More than 4,000 employees tried to access town hall meetings the union organized this week to address their concerns, she says. \"We're just trying to help them channel that energy.\"",

      "The proposal by the Department of Homeland Security, spelled out in an unpublished notice, would fully terminate a Biden administration program that allowed more than 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to fly to the U.S. if American sponsors agreed to help them financially.",
      "The Biden administration argued the policy, known as CHNV, discouraged illegal immigration by people from these four Latin American countries by offering them legal means to come to the U.S., but President Trump froze the initiative hours after being inaugurated. Trump officials have specifically argued the program was a misuse of immigration parole, the legal authority which the Biden administration used to admit those under the sponsorship initiative, and to allow them to apply for work permits.",
      "Under the new move, the Trump administration would revoke the parole status of those allowed into the U.S. under the\u00a0CHNV policy and place them in deportation proceedings if they have failed to apply for, or obtain, another immigration benefit, like asylum, a green card, or Temporary Protected Status, the internal proposal shows.",

      "Cubans with parole status have unique access to a process to become legal permanent residents due to a Cold War-era law. All nationalities can also apply for asylum, but that requires applicants to prove they are fleeing persecution based on certain factors, like their politics or religion \u2014 a high legal threshold.",

      "The Trump administration has also taken steps to restrict legal immigration, pausing arrivals of refugees, or people fleeing persecution overseas who are allowed to come to the U.S. lawfully after security and medical checks.",
      "A key component of Mr. Trump's moves has\u00a0centered on dismantling the Biden administration's immigration legacy. Beyond the CHNV program, the Trump administration has shut down other Biden-era initiatives, including a phone app that allowed migrants in Mexico to schedule a time to enter the U.S. at official border entry points to start their asylum cases.",

      "The FBI's acting director, Brian Driscoll, sent a letter to all FBI employees in which he detailed the directive, which also included an order to fire eight current FBI executives. As CBS News previously reported, many Executive Assistant Directors, including those who headed up the critical national security, cyber and criminal divisions, are being forced to resign, retire or face termination.",
      "According to a copy of Driscoll's letter also reviewed by CBS News, the Acting Director said of the Jan. 6-related agent lists, \"We understand this request encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have supported these investigations. I am one of those employees, as is acting Deputy Director Kissane.\"",
      "Bove's memo ordered the eight executives to be terminated by Feb. 3 and the list of employees who work on the more than 1,500 Jan. 6 be compiled by Feb. 4. The head of the Washington, D.C. Field Office is also expected to be removed from his post by Feb. 10, according to the sources.",
      "Driscoll \u2014 who assumed the top job after former FBI Director Christopher Wray resigned \u2014 told the bureau's employees, \"We are going to follow the law, follow FBI policy, and do what's in the best interest of the workforce and the American people.\"",
      "Bove's memo said he was directing the firings and other personnel review to take on allegations of weaponization within the Justice Department.",
      "\"I do not believe that the current leadership of the Justice Department can trust these FBI employees to assist in implementing the President's agenda faithfully,\" Bove wrote of the FBI executives.",
      "Bove's memo also said agents who worked on a case in which the Justice Department charged senior leaders of Hamas with terrorism, murder conspiracy and sanctions-evasion should also be reviewed.",
      "The moves would expand an ongoing purge of employees within the Justice Department and the FBI, where top officials have been told to retire, resign or be fired by Monday. Government officials are reviewing lists of FBI agents who worked on the probes to determine who should be fired and the numbers of agents affected could grow, two of the sources said.",
      "The senior FBI officials receiving notice to resign or be fired include those at the executive assistant director level at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., and numerous heads of FBI field offices across the country. The special agents in charge of Miami and Las Vegas offices, as well as the assistant director in charge of the Washington field offices have also received notice, three people familiar with the moves told CBS News. These agents are expected to accept retirement.",
      "The top officials at the executive assistant director level being instructed to retire manage the FBI's criminal, national security and cyber investigations. There may be more changes throughout the FBI, too, sources said.",
      "Some were notified while Kash Patel, President Trump's pick to lead the FBI, faced questions by senators at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday. The panel has not yet voted on his confirmation.",
      "While the number of agents affected by the latest changes remains unclear, the decision to include those who worked on the complex probe into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot could reverberate across the country, since agents from a number of FBI field offices participated in what became the largest investigation in Justice Department history. More than 1,500 defendants were charged in nearly every state, and FBI personnel played critical roles in each case. On his first day in office, Mr. Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of all Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "The investigation into the Capitol breach has been closed, but multiple people familiar with the matter previously told CBS News that Acting U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C., Edward Martin, initiated a review previous charging decisions behind hundreds of cases. That review is ongoing.",
      "FBI agents also worked with federal prosecutors as they investigated and later charged Mr. Trump in two cases brought by former special counsel Jack Smith, one tied to the president's handling of classified records and the other related to his conduct after the 2020 presidential election. Those agents are expected to be removed from their positions. The charges against Mr. Trump were dropped before his inauguration and the special counsel resigned.",
      "The FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment when contacted by CBS News. However, Patel was asked during his confirmation hearing specifically about the firing of FBI agents who worked on the Trump cases.",
      "\"Every FBI employee will be held to the absolute same standard and no one will be terminated for case assignments,\" Patel said. He later added that \"all FBI employees will be protected from political retribution.\"",
      "In a statement, the FBI Agents Association, which represents active and former FBI personnel, said, \"If true, these outrageous actions by acting officials are fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by President Trump and his support for FBI Agents. Dismissing potentially hundreds of Agents would severely weaken the Bureau's ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the Bureau and its new leadership for failure.",
      "\"These actions also contradict the commitments that Attorney General-nominee Pam Bondi and Director-nominee Kash Patel made during their nomination hearings before the United States Senate,\" the association continued. \"They also run counter to the commitment that Director-nominee Patel made to the FBI Agents Association, where during our meeting he said that Agents would be afforded appropriate process and review and not face retribution based solely on the cases to which they were assigned.\"",
      "Last week, CBS News reported that more than a dozen federal prosecutors who worked on Smith's team to charge Mr. Trump were fired by the Justice Department.",
      "The federal prosecutors were informed of the decision to terminate their positions by a letter sent over email after Justice Department leadership determined they were unable to carry out Mr. Trump's agenda, according to two sources.",
      "\"Acting Attorney General James McHenry made this decision because he did not believe these officials could be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president,\" a Justice Department official told CBS News at the time.",
      "In all, the moves make good on a Trump campaign promise to clean house at the Justice Department. Earlier this month, the president signed an executive order to take on the \"weaponization of the federal government,\" a characterization he has applied to the special counsel's prosecutions.",

    "story": [
      "In a Thursday press briefing, President Trump criticized his predecessor for his management of the Federal Aviation Administration and suggested, without evidence, that diversity initiatives at the agency could be to blame for a deadly crash between a passenger plane and an Army helicopter in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"I put safety first. Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first,\" Mr. Trump said. \"The FAA's website states they include hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability, and dwarfism.\" Mr. Trump added that people in those categories would be \"qualified\" for controller positions, even though the agency's statement does not say that.",
      "The president continued, \"Brilliant people have to be in those positions.\"",
      "It has been longstanding FAA policy \u2014 including before, during and after Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 to include people with disabilities in recruitment. However, there is no evidence that these initiatives have compromised air safety or had any relation to the crash Wednesday night. The cause of the collision remains under investigation.",
      "Air traffic controllers must undergo extensive training and meet rigorous standards, including physical and mental fitness tests. They cannot have a history of mental disorders or physical conditions that could interfere with their duties, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which is the chief human resources agency for the federal government.",
      "People with disabilities have to meet the same rigorous standards as other applicants, according to Chai Feldblum, a former commissioner of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during both the Obama and first Trump administrations.",
      "\"Obviously you only hire a person with a disability to do a job for which they're qualified,\" Feldblum said. \"I've seen no evidence that there are people with intellectual disabilities that have been hired to be air traffic controllers.\"",

      "Since 1973,\u00a0federal law\u00a0has required federal agencies to take steps to hire people with disabilities.",
      "\"The thing [President Trump] got wrong legally was that somehow this would be just a Democratic administration that had suddenly out of the blue decided to try to find and hire people with disabilities. That's simply not grounded in reality,\" Feldblum said.",
      "When asked by a reporter how he could come to the conclusion that diversity had something to do with the crash, Mr. Trump replied, \"Because I have common sense.\"",
      "The head of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, which is the controllers' union, said in a letter to its members that at this time it would be \"premature to speculate on the root cause of this accident.\"",
      "Federal investigators have also said it is too early to determine the cause or what factors may have contributed to the crash. It was the first major commercial airline crash in the United States since 2009.",
      "Mr. Trump was also asked why the \"Diversity and Inclusion\" policy was not changed on the FAA's website throughout his first administration. He said, \"I did change it. I changed the Obama policy, and we had a very good policy. And then Biden came in and he changed it.\" It's unclear precisely what policy he was referring to.",
      "Records show that initiatives aimed at expanding the workforce existed under President Trump's first term, including a program launched in 2019 that aimed to recruit and train qualified individuals with disabilities, including veterans, for careers in air traffic operations.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 16:59:45 -0500",
    "summary": "A memo from the Office of Management and Budget ordering a freeze on federal assistance sparked confusion across the country earlier this week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the Trump administration from freezing federal assistance\u00a0after a group of 22 states and the District of Columbia challenged a memo from the White House budget office ordering a pause of federal funding.",
      "U.S. District Chief Judge John McConnell of Rhode Island on Friday\u00a0granted the request for a temporary restraining order sought by the Democrat-led states, which had argued that the actions from the Office of Management and Budget violated federal law and the Constitution.",
      "McConnell's order was expected, as he had signaled following a hearing Wednesday that he was inclined to issue the temporary pause of the Trump administration's directive. The judge said in his decision that the Office of Management and Budget's actions are likely unconstitutional and violate federal law.",
      "\"Are there some aspects of the pause that might be legal and appropriate constitutionally for the Executive to take? The court imagines there are, but it is equally sure that there are many instances in the Executive Orders' wide-ranging, all-encompassing, and ambiguous 'pause' of critical funding that are not,\" McConnell found.",
      "The judge wrote that the budget office did not cite any legal authority that allowed it to unilaterally suspend the flow of federal funds to states and other entities and said \"no federal law would authorize the executive's unilateral action here.\"",
      "\"The states have set forth facts showing that the executive's abrupt 'pause' in potentially trillions of dollars of federal funding will cause a ripple effect that would directly impact the states and other's ability to provide and administer vital services and relief to their citizens,\" McConnell wrote.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is part of the lawsuit, cheered the court's order and said the president cannot unilaterally stop congressional spending commitments.",
      "\"This administration's reckless plan to block federal funding has already caused chaos, confusion, and conflict throughout our country,\" she said in a statement. \"In the short time since this policy was announced, families have been cut off from childcare services, essential Medicaid funds were disrupted, and critical law enforcement efforts were put in jeopardy.\"",
      "The Democrat-led states filed their lawsuit earlier this week in response to a memo from the Office of Management and Budget that ordered agencies to temporarily pause \"to the extent permitted by law\" grant, loan or federal financial assistance programs that were implicated by Mr. Trump's executive orders. The executive orders listed include those involving immigration, energy, diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs, and gender ideology.",
      "The memo was issued by Matthew Vaeth, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, who said the freeze was set to take effect by 5 p.m. Tuesday. Its full scope was not clear and sparked confusion and chaos around the country as states and nonprofits scrambled to determine whether they would be affected. Lawmakers, too, fielded calls from constituents and organizations in their states seeking answers about whether they would be cut off from federal dollars.",
      "The memo also prompted immediate legal action from the Democrat-led states and a group of nonprofit organizations, who filed a separate challenge in Washington, D.C. A federal judge there swiftly convened a hearing on a request from the nonprofits to temporarily block enforcement of the freeze, and agreed Tuesday to issue a brief pause to fully consider the matter.",
      "One day later, the Office of Management and Budget issued a new, two-line memo saying that the earlier directive had been rescinded.",
      "But questions continued to arise after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that only the budget office's memo had been walked back and the broader halting of federal assistance would remain in effect.",
      "\"This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze. It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo,\" she wrote on social media\u00a0Wednesday. \"Why? To end any confusion created by the court's injunction. The president's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented.\"",
      "Following Leavitt's post, the Justice Department argued that the matter before McConnell was moot. But the judge said in his order that \"the evidence shows that the alleged rescission of the OMB Directive was in name-only and may have been issued simply to defeat the jurisdiction of the court.\"",
      "\"The substantive effect of the directive carries on,\" he wrote. \"Messaging from the White House and agencies proves this point.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 14:13:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Less than two weeks into his second term, President Trump is poised to deploy steep tariffs against key U.S. trading partners.",
    "story": [
      "On the day of his inauguration, President Trump threatened steep new tariffs against key U.S. trading partners. Now he is primed to deliver.",
      "\"The president will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada and a 10% tariff on China, for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said at a Jan. 31 press briefing.",
      "Leavitt's confirmation of the tariffs comes after Trump on Thursday reiterated his earlier threat this month that he could announce 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1, telling reporters from the Oval Office that the duties \"may or may not rise with time.\" He had previously warned China could face a 10% tariff.",
      "Economists have warned that stiff tariffs\u00a0could reawaken U.S. inflation on a range of consumer goods and slow economic growth. Here's what experts have to say.",
      "Why is Trump threatening to hit countries with tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened tariffs against multiple nations for a range of reasons. He said he is specifically\u00a0targeting Canada, Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the U.S.' biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S., as well as to narrow their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "The U.S. trade deficit with Canada has surged from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023, largely reflecting growing American imports of Canadian energy. Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Before Mr. Trump returned to power, he also had threatened tariffs of up to\u00a060% on Chinese goods\u00a0imported into the U.S., a measure experts say is intended to advance American interests in negotiating better trade terms with Beijing, as well as throttle the illegal entry of fentanyl into the country.",
      "In a show of how his administration uses tariff threats to pressure countries on other issues, Mr. Trump last week proposed potential 25% levies against Colombia unless it agreed to receive deportations of unauthorized immigrants. Colombia ultimately agreed to receive the immigrants,\u00a0and the tariffs were withheld.",
      "Colombia's about-face suggests that Canada and Mexico could also reach agreement with the U.S. and avert a painful trade war. To that end, Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, said at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that Canada and Mexico could avoid tariffs by closing their borders to fentanyl.",
      "\"As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,\" Lutnick told senators.",
      "Even so, Mr. Trump's brandishing of potential tariffs \u2014 even if they are never imposed \u2014 highlights his willingness to use tough trade measures to punish even the country's closest allies unless they make concessions.",
      "\"As we have previously noted, trade policy will be transactional over the next four years with protectionist measures used to extort trade, immigration and other political concessions,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "What exactly is Trump planning?",
      "Along with targeting Canada and Mexico, the Trump administration has floated the possibility of a blanket tariff on a range of countries in Asia, South America, Europe and other regions.",
      "\"I think we have to proceed on the assumption that some kinds of tariffs are going to be imposed on the United States' major trading partners,\" Brett House, professor of economics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In the end, there is a lot that gets announced by the president on social media that does not come to pass. I don't take it as bluffing, so much as a storm of possibilities, and it's hard to tell which bit of that storm is going to be pursued most aggressively, and most immediately.\"",
      "What's clear, by contrast, is that the new administration is picking up where Mr. Trump left off in his first term in using trade policy as an instrument of both economic and foreign policy. That is likely to lead to a period of uncertainty and volatility, said John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at supply-chain software firm E2open.",
      "\"A lot of alternatives are still possible,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch in an interview. \"We don't know, but game theory would suggest the president would implement tariffs in some form against Mexico and Canada \u2014 not blanket tariffs, but on a select number of imports from both nations... because otherwise his bluff is going to be called.\"",
      "On how soon any tariffs could take effect, Daco notes that Mr. Trump could move quickly by claiming authority under a 1977 law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "\"When he said he'll impose tariffs on Feb. 1, it is still an open question as to what means would be used. Do you want to implement tariffs immediately, as threatened against Colombia over the weekend, or are you threatening with a deadline to obtain concessions?\" Daco said.",
      "Would the U.S. face retaliation?",
      "Almost certainly, economists say. If Trump officials move ahead with tariffs on its northern neighbor, \"We anticipate Canada would then respond in kind by also implementing a 25% across-the-board tariff on U.S. imports,\" Satyam Panday, chief U.S. and Canada economist with S&P Global Ratings, said in an email.",
      "Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, previously vowed to remove U.S.-made alcoholic beverages from stores in the Canadian province, according to the Associated Press. Canada is the world's second-largest market for America's distilled spirits, behind European Union.",
      "Elijah Oliveros-Rosen, chief emerging markets economist at S&P Global Ratings, predicted Mexico also would fire back with targeted tariffs. \"In the case of Mexico, we think it's very unlikely the government would place tariffs on U.S.-manufactured imports, given most are intermediate goods eventually exported to the U.S. Therefore, we expect the Mexican government could impose tariffs on agricultural and food imports, but not manufacturing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that strengthening the U.S.' stance on trade issues will help protect American workers and lead to a resurgence of domestic manufacturing. Yet such policies could come at the cost of damaging critical relationships with other nations around the world, said Douglas Irwin, a U.S. trade policy expert and professor of economics at Dartmouth College.",
      "What is the risk to American consumers?",
      "Irwin and other economists say tariffs are all but certain to lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. That's because companies that end up on the hook typically pass added costs along to consumers in order to protect their bottom lines.",
      "\"The notion this administration has been adhering to is somewhat surprising \u2014 the idea that if you implement gradual tariffs over time, such as in 5% increments, that these are less inflationary,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This idea is misguided, because if you have incremental price increases month after month, if anything that leads to higher inflation expectations. It leads to higher inflation on a month-to-month basis.\"",
      "If Mr. Trump's tariffs are implemented in full, including a universal 10% tax on all goods, consumer price inflation could rise to between 3% and 4%, according to an analysis this week from Capital Economics. To be sure, analysts with the investment advisory firm expect Mr. Trump to stop short of imposing a blanket tariff and instead pick his targets.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, suggested that a volley of tariffs between the countries would also impact U.S. consumers.",
      "\"From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose,\" he said in an email.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "As his time as chairman of Democratic National Committee comes to a close after a difficult election cycle, Jaime Harrison hopes people in his party come to \"understand that you've got to be more elastic than rigid.\"",
      "Harrison, who was picked by then-President Joe Biden to take over the role in 2021, said \"Sometimes, we got folks that are very rigid. If you don't have the right job, if you didn't come from the right community, if you don't say the right word, and then therefore you are x-ed out or you're castigated.\"",
      "\"We need to pause on that. Let's be a big tent, and let's be an open tent and embrace more diversity, in terms of thought,\" Harrison said.",
      "Harrison's comments come as party leaders prepare to pick his successor Saturday during a meeting in Maryland.",
      "In a conversation ahead of the election to replace him, Harrison strongly defended Biden and stood by the lightning-fast process that saw then-Vice President Kamala Harris receive the support of DNC delegates and become the party's new nominee after Biden ended his reelection bid last summer.",
      "Conscious that some in the party might consider a snap White House bid, Harrison said he had checked in with some of the \"people who had expressed some interest down the road for running,\" including governors.",
      "\"Every single one of them said, 'I'm not going to run. I'm supporting Kamala Harris.' And it was almost like I was chasing the Kamala Harris calls, because they all said, 'I just talked to the VP, and I have pledged my support to her,'\" he said.",
      "Besides, Harrison believes party rules made any discussion of a short primary in the run-up to the Chicago convention impossible.",
      "\"So you're saying ... after the primaries were done, then we should restart another primary process,\" Harrison said. \"How do you do that? Who's going to pay for those primaries? Is the DNC supposed to pay for those primaries? Because, you know, primaries cost money, right?\"",
      "When asked about Harris, the party's 2024 nominee, Harrison said the former vice president should run again for the White House if she wants to.",
      "\"If I didn't believe Kamala Harris could win, I wouldn't have worked as hard as I did to help her win this last time around,\" he said. \"When you look at politics, Donald Trump and Barack Obama are just enigmas in politics. I think they do something different to the electorate every time they run that you can't counter, but then when they are not on the ballot, it's almost like you go back to \u2014 the political gravity pulls people right back into it. That's part of\u2026how well we did in the [2022] midterms.\"",
      "The party's struggles in 2024, when enough voters sided with President Donald Trump and his far different vision for the country than the one espoused by Democrats, has created major questions about the path forward for the party.",
      "\"I know in a 176-year history, people have written the epitaph of the Democratic Party a lot of times, and people are trying to write it again. But don't sleep on this Democratic Party. What we have to do is to build on the infrastructure that we have built,\" Harrison said.",
      "And while Democrats' soul searching continues, Republicans in Washington have been taking a victory lap in the early days of Trump's return to power.",
      "\"We have seen the greatest political comeback in American history play out before our eyes. We needed to win four out of seven swing states. President Trump won all seven,\" Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley said earlier this month at a party event. \"We needed to keep the popular vote close. President Trump won it by millions of votes. We needed to drive turnout with low propensity voters and engage with communities that Democrats have taken for granted for decades. We shattered every record, and we got our people to the polls.\"",
      "Harrison led the DNC through a turbulent time in American politics. The party that holds the White House typically struggles in the midterms, but the move by the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade and end the federal right to an abortion became a catalyzing issue for Democrats in 2022. That year, Democrats were able to add to their narrow Senate majority while narrowly losing the House, despite GOP hopes for a major \"red wave.\"",
      "The 2024 election cycle was filled with far starker challenges for Democrats. The party was defending Senate seats in the Republican-dominated states of Montana and Ohio while incumbents in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada were also on the ballot. Concerns about Biden's age had been building, though the overhauled slate of early primary states ushered in by Harrison and Biden, starting with Harrison's home state of South Carolina holding the first national party sanctioned Democratic primary, helped insulate the incumbent from a major challenge.",
      "Yet concerns broke through in a major way after Biden's disastrous June debate performance against Trump, leading to public calls within the party from elected leaders for Biden to end his reelection bid. After building pressure, Biden withdrew from the race and quickly endorsed Harris. Democrats rallied around Harris, who only had around 107 days between her entry into the race and Election Day.",
      "The verdict from voters in November 2024 was a stinging setback for Democrats, who not only lost the White House to Trump once again and control of the Senate, but also failed to win back control of the House. That outcome left some congressional Democrats saying after the election that they should have called on Biden to leave the race sooner.",
      "\"President Biden, as far as legacy, has many successes to point to,\" Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett told CBS News in November 2024 after the election. \"But the most important success would have been had he stepped aside a year ago and given us a better chance of preventing Trump from coming back.\"",
      "Looming over the contest to replace Harrison as the leader of the DNC\u00a0 is the sting from 2024's losses and a Democratic Party brand that has eroded with key segments of voters. The leading contenders to replace Harrison include former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wikler and Ken Martin, the leader of Minnesota's arm of the Democratic Party.",
      "\"The majority of Americans now believe the Republican Party best represents the interests of the working class and the poor, and the Democratic Party is the party of the wealthy and the elites,\"\u00a0 Martin wrote in his framework pitch for chair. \"It's a damning indictment on our party brand. We must be willing to dig deep and recenter the Democratic agenda to unite families across race, age, background, and class.\"",
      "Harrison has decided to not endorse in the race to replace him. But he said Martin, the Minnesota Democrat, \"would be one hell of a chair,\" before adding that \"there are a lot of good candidates who I think would do a really good job as chair, as well.\"",
      "Harrison became nationally known in 2020 for his attempt to oust Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina's Senate race. Despite losing, Harrison's run showed progress for Democrats. While Graham had coasted to reelection by around 17 points in 2014, he defeated Harrison by a little over 10 points in the red state.",
      "But Harrison indicated earlier this week he would not be vying for public office again anytime soon. He's eager to spend time with his family and also hopes to focus on rebuilding the South for the Democratic Party.",
      "But those aren't the only reasons.",
      "Harrison said that over the years he had wanted to be the heir apparent to South Carolina U.S. Rep. James Clyburn and the seat the influential leader has held for decades, the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump's supporters and its aftermath has dampened those ambitions.",
      "\"I still get goosebumps when I see that dome lit up over there,\" Harrison said, sitting in the DNC building near the U.S. Capitol. \"But to see what happened on January 6, and to see how folks have whitewashed that, particularly on the Republican side, to see the vitriol and the hatred in the body politic right now, is not something that I want to be a part of.\"",

    "story": [
      "The military Black Hawk helicopter that crashed into a passenger plane near Reagan National Airport Wednesday appears to have been flying above the permitted altitude, publicly available flight data analyzed by CBS News shows.",
      "This data point is one of several key mysteries investigators are exploring as they seek to explain what caused the nation's worst air disaster in more than a decade, aviation experts said.",
      "\"That's the $64 million question that needs to be answered,\" said Greg Feith, a former senior air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, in an interview with CBS News.",
      "The permitted flight ceiling on the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport is 200 feet \u2013 a crucial ceiling for keeping the heavy flow of military helicopters safely clear of the steady commercial aircraft traffic into and out of the nation's capital.",
      "Data from FlightRadar24, which tracks and records aircraft data for most flights across the U.S., showed the helicopter's last estimated altitude was about 400 feet when it crashed. The jet's altitude was about 375 to 400 feet, according to data from FlightAware and FlightRadar24.",
      "\"They're military pilots; they're familiar with the routes,\" Feith said. \"Why is it on this day, on that flight, they were [as much as] 150 to 200 feet higher than they knew they should be?\"",
      "Steven B. Wallace, a former director of accident investigations for the Federal Aviation Administration, told CBS News he believes investigators will direct attention to the altitude of the Black Hawk.",
      "\"I don't want to speculate on the cause, but I can speculate what's going through the mind of the investigators,\" Wallace said. \"I think that is very likely going to be the focus.\"",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said the investigation is examining if the aircraft was at the right altitude at the time. NTSB investigators have not so far disclosed the helicopter's altitude in their briefings, and said their working groups will evaluate \"pre-impact course and altitude.\"",
      "The Army helicopter's deviation above the flight ceiling is one of several similar near collisions involving helicopters at Reagan National that date back more than a decade.",
      "A near midair collision between an airplane and a helicopter in July 2015 occurred 400 feet off the ground on approach to the same runway being used in Wednesday's crash \u2013 Runway 33 \u2014 according to a CBS News Data Team review of anonymous reports to NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System.",
      "The pilot's report said the aircraft \"came within very close contact of another aircraft.\"",
      "\"This occurred about 400 feet off the ground to the point where the pilot monitoring had to take the controls to make a correction in order to prevent it from becoming a midair collision,\" the 2015 report said.",
      "Two years earlier, in May of 2013, a pilot reported problems with a helicopter while circling to land on Runway 33. That is a shorter runway intended for smaller aircraft, like American Airlines 5342. Pilots who land there told CBS News they want to be at the \"floor,\" or lowest altitude during their approach because they need to hit the beginning of the runway to have maximum distance to stop.",
      "\"As we continued our approach; Tower instructed the helicopter to 'make a right 360 for a jet on a 2 mile final for Runway 33; and to report him in sight,\" the pilot wrote.",
      "\"The Tower then asked the helicopter if he had us in sight. He replied 'yes'; and the Tower told him to maintain visual separation,\" the report said. \"As we began our turn from base to final; the helicopter made what looked like a right turn directly into our flight path.\"",
      "The pilot reported having to execute a hard right turn and abort the approach to avoid a collision. \"I'm not sure how close we came to the helicopter since it was on the left side of the aircraft; but I would guess it was only a few hundred feet,\" the report said.",
      "CBS News' review of the NASA safety data identified at least nine near midair collisions at the airport since 2005, including three involving helicopters.",
      "Feith said he believes investigators from the NTSB and the military will be examining the altimeters in the helicopter to see if they malfunctioned, checking for any wind impact that could have hindered the pilot's ability to hold the helicopter at 200 feet, and exploring whether or not the crew should have been using night vision goggles.",
      "He said the flight recorders on both aircraft will be helpful in determining what happened. Authorities reported that they had been recovered from the Potomac River on Thursday.",
      "\"If they had been at 200 feet, there wouldn't have been an issue because the plane typically would've been 400 to 500 feet off the ground,\" Feith said. \"Those two RJ [regional jet] pilots didn't know what hit them until the helicopter hit them.\"",

    "summary": "Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a former Blackhawk pilot, talked with CBS News' Nikole Killion about the midair collision of a plane and Blackhawk helicopter.",
    "story": [
      "Sen. Tammy Duckworth is calling for patience as the NTSB and FAA investigate the cause of the tragic collision of a Black Hawk helicopter and American Airlines flight Wednesday night, but she is also pursuing information about how it occurred.",
      "She told CBS News' Nikole Killion in an interview Thursday that she's requested a transcript of the air traffic control instructions and responses from the pilots.",
      "\"What I did learn was that air traffic control did contact and speak with the helicopter crew twice, and they acknowledged the instructions twice,\" Duckworth said. \"I also am asking for the flight path of both aircraft up until the moment of the impact.\"",
      "The Illinois Democrat will have more insight than many of her colleagues \u2014 she is an Iraq\u00a0War veteran and was a Black Hawk pilot before an RPG downed her helicopter during an Iraq deployment in 2004, costing Duckworth both of her legs and partial use of her right arm.",
      "Duckworth says she's certain that the soldiers who were piloting the Black Hawk Wednesday night were well trained because otherwise, \"they wouldn't be out there in this special airspace \u2014 the airspace around Washington, D.C.\" She noted that they were in the SFRA \u2014 the Washington, D.C., metropolitan Special Flight Restricted Area. It's a circular 30-nautical-mile area around Washington, D.C., which also surrounds the Flight-Restricted Zone, a smaller area encompassing Reagan National Airport.\"",
      "\"You don't get to fly in that without additional flight training,\" Duckworth said.",
      "The Illinois Democrat described what the crew would have been doing in the cockpit as the Black Hawk flew Wednesday night.",
      "\"The crew members would have split up the crew duties. One person would have been flying \u2014 actually, physically flying the aircraft, which takes, you know, all of your four limbs to do it,\" she told Killion. \"You're controlling the direction of the aircraft with your right hand, the power that's going into the engines with your left hand, you're controlling the nose and the tail of the aircraft, with your two feet.\" This pilot would have been trying to \"stick to the route,\" while the other pilot would be talking with air traffic control.",
      "\"Everybody's looking outside the aircraft to try to find that other aircraft that you are near,\" Duckworth said. \"The crew chief in the back is also doing the same thing. They're looking out of the aircraft as well, spotting any traffic that's nearby, conveying that information. So, the crew would be talking to each other while also listening to the air traffic controller.\"",
      "At the same time, the crew would also be \"listening to the air traffic controller talking to other aircraft, so that you have situational awareness of everything else that's going on,\" she said.",
      "The helicopter would have had a ceiling, what Duckworth referred to as a \"hard deck\" in the restricted area where the Black Hawk was flying.",
      "\"They're not allowed to go above 200 feet mean sea level,\" she said. \"So, they were flying pretty low above the Potomac River at the time, while looking up trying to spot out of this very busy night sky the landing airplane.\"",
      "Killion asked whether this was the kind of flight that would require night-vision goggles, or NVGs.",
      "\"My understanding is that they were not using NVGs,\" Duckworth replied. She said that in an area where there are a lot of lights, they're \"not as useful a tool,\" and are really more suited to \"a combat situation in the dark.\" Around the airport, \"with that much ambient light, they were on visual flight rules, and they were operating well within the parameters for which they have been trained, and the aircraft was designed to operate in,\" Duckworth said.",
      "She said the helicopter would have had its lights on, so the plane would have been able to see it. But airplanes that are coming in for a landing have the right of way.",
      "\"They would have been looking towards the runway and landing on the runway,\" she said. \"That's the job of the crew within the American Airlines Flight \u2026 they were on a short final to land.\"",
      "\"I'm sure they would have been looking out, but they don't have the same visibility in that aircraft \u2014 looking out those two little windows that they have \u2014 as the helicopter would have had, with plexiglass.\" She explained that the helicopter crew \"would have been basically sitting in a plexiglass bubble in the Black Hawk with plexiglass above your head, underneath your feet and out the two sides.\"",
      "\"So the helicopter \u2014 they would have had a better visual command than the American Airlines Flight, which was landing, looking to the runway,\" Duckworth said.",
      "Asked about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's description of the collision as an \"elevation\" issue, and President Trump's suggestion that the helicopter could have gone up or down to get out of the way of the plane, Duckworth responded, \"We have to let NTSB and FAA do their jobs \u2026 Neither the president nor Mr. Hegseth are pilots, as far as I know, and I think that amateur speculation is not what is needed at this point.\"",

      "Burgum, 68, is an ultra-wealthy software industry entrepreneur who came from a small North Dakota farming community, where he worked at his family's grain elevator.",
      "He served two terms as governor of the oil-rich state and launched a presidential campaign in 2023, but dropped out months later and quickly endorsed Trump.",
      "Trump also picked Burgum to chair a new National Energy Council that's tasked with achieving American \"energy dominance.\" He would have a seat on the National Security Council \u2014 a first for the interior secretary.",
      "His directive from Mr. Trump is to make it even easier for energy companies to tap fossil fuel resources, including from public lands. That raised alarms among environmentalists and some Democrats as greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels bake the planet.",
      "Burgum eagerly assisted the energy industry during his time as governor, when he was also profiting from the lease of family land to oil companies, according to records obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "During his confirmation hearing, Burgum said the U.S. can use energy development as leverage to promote peace and to lower consumer costs.",
      "He raised concerns about the reliability of renewable power sources promoted under former President Joe Biden, and said the U.S. needs to generate more electricity from sources such as coal and nuclear that can run constantly.",
      "Democrats in response accused the Trump administration of abandoning an \"all of the above\" energy policy to favor fossil fuels.",

      "The U.S. currently produces more crude oil than any nation in history, according to the Energy Information Administration. More cost-effective technology in recent decades drove drilling booms in states including New Mexico, Texas and North Dakota, where vast expanses of rural farmland have been industrialized by oil and gas companies.",
      "The booms brought billions of dollars in tax revenue to state and federal governments. But burning those fuels is also unleashing immense volumes of carbon dioxide that scientists say is warming the planet.",
      "The Interior Department has jurisdiction over a half-billion acres of federal land and vast areas offshore. Those areas produce about one-quarter of U.S. oil annually.",

Rocheleau most recently was chief operating officer of the National Business Aviation Association. Prior to that job, which he began in 2022, he was the FAA's deputy associate administrator for aviation safety. The U.S. Air Force veteran previously worked for the Transportation Security Administration.",
      "Why did Whitaker step down?",
      "Whitaker announced in December that he was stepping down. He was among many agency heads who stepped down as the new White House administration took shape, but did not publicly attribute his resignation to the incoming administration nor Elon Musk. The role of FAA administrator is a Senate-confirmed role, with a five year term. Whitaker was unanimously confirmed in October 2023, filling a role that had been run by acting administrators since March 2022,",
      "What did Musk say about Whitaker?",
      "Musk openly complained about Whitaker and the FAA, after the agency imposed $600,000 in fines on SpaceX related to missions launched with unapproved changes. Musk accused the agency of \"harassing SpaceX about nonsense.\" Musk posted on his social media site in September that Whitaker \"needs to resign.\"",
      "What is an acting administrator?",
      "Rocheleau will be the agency's fourth acting administrator since 2018, taking the helm of the agency without Senate confirmation. The last seven years have been a tumultuous time for the FAA, which faced criticism of its oversight after two Boeing crashes in 2018 and 2019, and later dealt with the rise in unruly passenger behavior amid and following COVID-19 era mask regulations, as well as airline staff shortages and technology glitches.",

    "story": [
      "Asteroid samples fetched by NASA hold not only the pristine building blocks for life but also the salty remains of an ancient water world, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The findings provide the strongest evidence yet that asteroids may have planted the seeds of life on Earth and that these ingredients were mingling with water almost right from the start.",
      "\"That's the kind of environment that could have been essential to the steps that lead from elements to life,\" said the Smithsonian Institution's Tim McCoy, one of the lead study authors.",
      "NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft returned 122 grams (4 ounces) of dust and pebbles from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, delivering the sample canister to the Utah desert in 2023 before swooping off after another space rock. It remains the biggest cosmic haul from beyond the moon. The two previous asteroid sample missions, by Japan, yielded considerably less material.",
      "Small amounts of Bennu's precious black grains \u2014 leftovers from the solar system's formation 4.5 billion years ago \u2014 were doled out to the two separate research teams whose studies appeared in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy. But it was more than enough to tease out the sodium-rich minerals and confirm the presence of amino acids, nitrogen in the form of ammonia and even parts of the genetic code.",
      "Some if not all of the delicate salts found at Bennu \u2014 similar to what's in the dry lakebeds of California's Mojave Desert and Africa's Sahara \u2014 would be stripped away if present in falling meteorites.",
      "\"This discovery was only possible by analyzing samples that were collected directly from the asteroid then carefully preserved back on Earth,\" the Institute of Science Tokyo's Yasuhito Sekine, who was not involved in the studies, said in an accompanying editorial.",
      "Combining the ingredients of life with an environment of sodium-rich salt water, or brines, \"that's really the pathway to life,\" said McCoy, the National Museum of Natural History's curator of meteorites. \"These processes probably occurred much earlier and were much more widespread than we had thought before.\"",
      "NASA's Daniel Glavin said one of the biggest surprises was the relatively high abundance of nitrogen, including ammonia. While all of the organic molecules found in the Bennu samples have been identified before in meteorites, Glavin said the ones from Bennu are valid \u2014 \"real extraterrestrial organic material formed in space and not a result of contamination from Earth.\"",
      "Bennu \u2014 a rubble pile just one-third of a mile (one-half of a kilometer) across \u2014 was originally part of a much larger asteroid that got clobbered by other space rocks. The latest results suggest this parent body had an extensive underground network of lakes or even oceans, and that the water evaporated away, leaving behind the salty clues.",
      "Sixty labs around the world are analyzing bits of Bennu as part of initial studies, said the University of Arizona's Dante Lauretta, the mission's chief scientist who took part in both studies.",
      "Most of the $1 billion mission's cache has been set aside for future analysis. Scientists stress more testing is needed to better understand the Bennu samples, as well as more asteroid and comet sample returns. China plans to launch an asteroid sample return mission this year.",
      "Many are pushing for a mission to collect rocks and dirt from the potentially waterlogged dwarf planet Ceres in the main asteroid belt. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus also beckon as enticing water worlds. Meanwhile, NASA has core samples awaiting pickup at Mars, but their delivery is on hold while the space agency studies the quickest and cheapest way to get them here.",

    "story": [
      "A palm-sized mammal that lives underground in California  has been caught alive on camera for the first time.",
      "Three undergraduate students came up with an idea to capture the elusive Mount Lyell shrew, native to the Eastern Sierra Nevada region, as part of their fall 2024 project. Vishal Subramanyan, Prakrit Jain and Harper Forbes laid out over 100 traps last November and checked them every two hours, for three days and four nights, to photograph the tiny creatures.",
      "\"The hardest part of getting the photos was one, they're incredibly fast cuz they're always running around,\" Subramanyan told CBS News.",
      "Another reason the Mount Lynell shrews had never been captured alive on camera is that they have an incredibly fast metabolism, Subramanyan said. He and Jain were already taking photos of small mammals for their mammalogy class when they learned that this particular animal had never been photographed before, so they devised a plan.",
      "Researchers have set up similar pitfall traps to capture the shrews, but if they're left in the trap for more than two hours, they'll simply starve to death. That's why Subramanyan, Jain and Forbes had to check their traps every two hours.",
      "To take the photos, the students set up a white background on the bottom of a box, using glass on the top so they could photograph through it. They also had a terrarium with soil and mealworms for the shrews.",
      "The tiny mammals are active through day and night because they have to constantly feed on insects and arachnids to survive. Another challenge in getting the photos were cold fingers, Subramanyan said.",
      "Temperatures in the mountain fell to 15 degrees during the expedition funded with the help of Cal Academy. Subramanyan was part of the organization's inaugural California Creators for Nature program that aims to engage people on social media in conversations about nature, climate and environmental justice.",

      "The world's biggest iceberg\u00a0-- three time the size of New York City -- could drift towards a remote island where a scientist warns it risks disrupting feeding for baby penguins and seals.",
      "The gigantic wall of ice is moving slowly from Antarctica on a potential collision course with South Georgia, a crucial wildlife breeding ground in the South Atlantic.",
      "Satellite imagery suggested that unlike previous \"megabergs,\" this rogue was not crumbling into smaller chunks as it plodded through the Southern Ocean, Andrew Meijers, a physical oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, told AFP on Friday.",
      "He said predicting its exact course was difficult but prevailing currents suggested the colossus would reach the shallow continental shelf around South Georgia in two to four weeks.",
      "But what might happen next is anyone's guess, he said.",
      "It could avoid the shelf and get carried into open water beyond South Georgia, a British overseas territory some 870 miles east of the Falkland Islands.",
      "Or it could strike the sloping bottom and get stuck for months or break up into pieces.",
      "Meijers said this scenario could seriously impede seals and penguins trying to feed and raise their young on the island. The island hosts 1.3 million pairs of Chinstrap penguins \u2014 one of the world's largest colonies \u2014 about 5 million seals, and 65 million breeding birds.",
      "\"Icebergs have grounded there in the past and that has caused significant mortality to penguin chicks and seal pups,\" he said.",
      "Roughly 1,550 square miles across, the world's biggest and oldest iceberg, known as A23a, calved from the Antarctic shelf in 1986. Before its calving in 1986, the colossal iceberg hosted a Soviet research station. falley",
      "It remained stuck for over 30 years before finally breaking free in 2020, its lumbering journey north sometimes delayed by ocean forces that kept it spinning in place. In 2023, the British Antarctic Survey posted a time-lapse of satellite imagery, showing the iceberg's movement.",
      "\"Game of Thrones-esque\" iceberg",
      "Meijers -- who encountered the iceberg face to face while leading a scientific mission in late 2023 -- described \"a huge white cliff, 40 or 50 meters high, that stretches from horizon to horizon\".",
      "\"It's just like this white wall. It's very sort of Game of Thrones-esque, actually,\" he said, referring to the dark fantasy series.",
      "A23a has followed roughly the same path as previous massive icebergs, passing the east side of the Antarctica Peninsula through the Weddell Sea along a route called \"iceberg alley.\" That is the same current of water that famed explorer Ernest Shackleton used in 1916 to make his storied escape from Antarctica after losing his ship, the Endurance. The legendary\u00a0shipwreck was discovered\u00a0off the coast of Antarctica in 2022.",
      "Weighing a little under a trillion tons, this monster block of freshwater was being whisked along by the world's most powerful ocean \"jet stream\" -- the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.",
      "Raul Cordero from Chile's University of Santiago, who is also part of the National Antarctic Research Committee, said he was confident the iceberg would sidestep South Georgia.",
      "\"The island acts as an obstacle for ocean currents and therefore usually diverts the water long before it reaches the island,\" he said.",
      "\"The iceberg is moved by that water flow, so the chances of it hitting are not that high,\" though chunks could, he said.",
      "Another scientist, glaciologist Soledad Tiranti currently on an Argentinian exploration voyage in the Antarctic, said that icebergs such as A23a \"are so deep that before reaching an island or mainland they generally get stuck\" on the seabed.",
      "It is summer in South Georgia and resident penguins and seals along its southern coastline are foraging in the frosty waters to bring back food to fatten their young.",
      "\"If the iceberg parks there, it'll either block physically where they feed from, or they'll have to go around it,\" said Meijers.",
      "\"That burns a huge amount of extra energy for them, so that's less energy for the pups and chicks, which causes increased mortality.\"",
      "The seal and penguin populations on South Georgia have already been having a \"bad season\" with an outbreak of bird flu \"and that (iceberg) would make it significantly worse,\" he said.",
      "As A23a ultimately melted it could seed the water with nutrients that encourage phytoplankton growth, feeding whales and other species, and allowing scientists to study how such blooms absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",
      "While icebergs are natural phenomena, Meijers said the rate at which they were being lost from Antarctica was increasing, likely due to human induced climate change.",
      "In January 2023, \u00a0a massive piece of Antarctica's Brunt Ice Shelf \u2014 a\u00a0chunk about the size of two New York Cities\u00a0\u2014 broke free.\u00a0 The Brunt Ice Shelf lies across the Weddell Sea from the site of the Larsen C ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula.

    "story": [
      "Starliner astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore took a stroll outside the International Space Station on Thursday, marking their 239th day in orbit by carrying out a task originally planned for a spacewalk last summer. In the process, Williams became the world's most experienced female spacewalker, logging more than 62 hours outside the lab over nine excursions across multiple missions.",
      "Her latest outing began at 7:43 a.m. EST when she and Wilmore switched their spacesuits to battery power and headed out to retrieve a faulty S-band antenna assembly mounted on an external storage platform. Two earlier attempts to retrieve the unit were unsuccessful.",
      "The device wasn't designed for spacewalk retrieval and it took Williams and Wilmore longer than had been planned to get the job done. But thanks to improvisation and muscle power, the third time was the charm.",
      "\"The team has just been incredible,\" Williams radioed from the Quest airlock when the five-hour 26-minute EVA came to an end. \"I know we were not the first, we weren't even the second crew to do this, but somehow, with all of their great work, we were able to get it done.\"",
      "Added Wilmore: \"This is probably the most involved spacewalk that probably every discipline in the ISS program was sweating as much as Suni and I were. Fantastic job, coming up with the next plan, and the next plan, and the next plan. And it worked! So, outstanding.\"",
      "After the antenna retrieval, Wilmore collected swabs from nearby vents to help researchers determine if any microbial life from inside the station had managed to make it outside and survive in the space environment. A third task, prepping a spare robot arm joint for possible use if arm repairs are ever needed, was deferred to a future spacewalk.",
      "Going into Thursday's spacewalk, or EVA, Williams had logged 56 hours and 40 minutes outside the station during eight previous outings while Wilmore had chalked up 25 hours and 35 minutes of EVA time during four excursions.",
      "With her latest spacewalk, Williams moved past retired astronaut Peggy Whitson's mark of 60 hours and 21 minutes of spacewalk time to become the world's most experienced female spacewalker, moving up to number four overall.",
      "Stuck aboard the station since last June because of NASA concerns about the safety of their Starliner capsule, Williams and Wilmore are now planning to return to Earth around the end of March aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship that carried two other station fliers \u2014 Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 to the lab last September.",
      "That Crew Dragon was launched with two empty seats specifically to carry Williams and Wilmore back to Earth at the end of the Crew 9 mission, originally planned for late February. But an extra month was tacked on later to give SpaceX more time to complete pre-flight checks of the Crew 10 Dragon, which will be making its maiden flight.",

    "summary": "A NASA spacecraft has returned asteroid samples that hold not only the pristine building blocks for life but also the salty remains of an ancient water world.",
    "story": [
      "Asteroid samples fetched by NASA hold not only the pristine building blocks for life but also the salty remains of an ancient water world, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The findings provide the strongest evidence yet that asteroids may have planted the seeds of life on Earth and that these ingredients were mingling with water almost right from the start.",
      "\"That's the kind of environment that could have been essential to the steps that lead from elements to life,\" said the Smithsonian Institution's Tim McCoy, one of the lead study authors.",
      "NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft returned 122 grams (4 ounces) of dust and pebbles from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, delivering the sample canister to the Utah desert in 2023 before swooping off after another space rock. It remains the biggest cosmic haul from beyond the moon. The two previous asteroid sample missions, by Japan, yielded considerably less material.",
      "Small amounts of Bennu's precious black grains \u2014 leftovers from the solar system's formation 4.5 billion years ago \u2014 were doled out to the two separate research teams whose studies appeared in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy. But it was more than enough to tease out the sodium-rich minerals and confirm the presence of amino acids, nitrogen in the form of ammonia and even parts of the genetic code.",
      "Some if not all of the delicate salts found at Bennu \u2014 similar to what's in the dry lakebeds of California's Mojave Desert and Africa's Sahara \u2014 would be stripped away if present in falling meteorites.",
      "\"This discovery was only possible by analyzing samples that were collected directly from the asteroid then carefully preserved back on Earth,\" the Institute of Science Tokyo's Yasuhito Sekine, who was not involved in the studies, said in an accompanying editorial.",
      "Combining the ingredients of life with an environment of sodium-rich salt water, or brines, \"that's really the pathway to life,\" said McCoy, the National Museum of Natural History's curator of meteorites. \"These processes probably occurred much earlier and were much more widespread than we had thought before.\"",
      "NASA's Daniel Glavin said one of the biggest surprises was the relatively high abundance of nitrogen, including ammonia. While all of the organic molecules found in the Bennu samples have been identified before in meteorites, Glavin said the ones from Bennu are valid \u2014 \"real extraterrestrial organic material formed in space and not a result of contamination from Earth.\"",
      "Bennu \u2014 a rubble pile just one-third of a mile (one-half of a kilometer) across \u2014 was originally part of a much larger asteroid that got clobbered by other space rocks. The latest results suggest this parent body had an extensive underground network of lakes or even oceans, and that the water evaporated away, leaving behind the salty clues.",
      "Sixty labs around the world are analyzing bits of Bennu as part of initial studies, said the University of Arizona's Dante Lauretta, the mission's chief scientist who took part in both studies.",
      "Most of the $1 billion mission's cache has been set aside for future analysis. Scientists stress more testing is needed to better understand the Bennu samples, as well as more asteroid and comet sample returns. China plans to launch an asteroid sample return mission this year.",
      "Many are pushing for a mission to collect rocks and dirt from the potentially waterlogged dwarf planet Ceres in the main asteroid belt. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus also beckon as enticing water worlds. Meanwhile, NASA has core samples awaiting pickup at Mars, but their delivery is on hold while the space agency studies the quickest and cheapest way to get them here.",

      "Mr. Trump's post made it sound like Musk himself would be going to space, adding to widespread confusion about what was being planned, in part because the astronauts in question, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, are not \"stranded\" in any conventional sense, and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "They could return to Earth anytime NASA so decides, riding down in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that carried two station crew members to orbit last September with two empty seats specifically for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "They blasted off aboard the Starliner capsule last June 5 for a presumed eight-to-10-day mission. It was the first piloted flight of a Starliner, a key step toward beginning service as an operational alternative to SpaceX's Crew Dragon.",
      "But the flight was marred by propellant leaks and pressurization problems with the Starliner's propulsion system.",
      "After multiple extensions to carry out tests and analyses, NASA managers decided on Aug. 24 to leave Wilmore and Williams aboard the station for an extended stay, bringing the Starliner down under remote control, without its crew, on Sept. 7. There were no major problems.",
      "The decision to keep Wilmore and Williams aloft on the station was made by NASA management based on a risk assessment and a desire to minimize long-range disruption to the carefully choreographed schedule of crew rotation and cargo delivery missions.",
      "In any case, in the wake of NASA's decision, SpaceX launched a four-seat Crew Dragon spacecraft to the space station on Sept. 28 with just two crew members aboard \u2014 NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 leaving two seats available for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "NASA opted to carry out a normal long-duration stay by Hague and Gorbunov, who launched with an expectation of returning to Earth at the end of February with Wilmore and Williams. All of that was known last September.",
      "The return flight was later delayed an additional month or so to give SpaceX more time to ready a new Crew Dragon capsule for launch on its maiden flight to ferry a replacement crew \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to the station.",
      "As it now stands, Crew 9 commander Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams are expecting to return to Earth at the end of March. By that point, the two Starliner astronauts will have logged around 300 days in space. Both astronauts have said they understood NASA's decision to extend their mission.",
      "As the founder of SpaceX, Musk was certainly aware of those decisions when they were made and the rationale behind them. There have been no reports of any direct involvement of the Biden administration in the decisions to extend the Starliner crew's stay in space, and Musk offered no criticisms of NASA's decision at the time.",
      "As for what returning the Starliner crew to Earth \"as soon as possible\" might mean, the only obvious answer would be to bring Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams down ahead of schedule. They would not need anyone to come get them.",
      "But an early departure would leave a single U.S. astronaut behind on the space station: Don Pettit, who launched to the lab last year aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "NASA would then have just one astronaut on board the station to operate the multi-module U.S. segment of the lab, likely halting research in its tracks until Crew 10 could arrive aboard the next Crew Dragon.",
      "Rumors indicate the Crew 10 Dragon could be facing additional delays. NASA could opt to move the next station crew to a Crew Dragon earmarked for a commercial trip to the station carrying a crew sponsored by Houston-based Axiom Space. That might move the Crew 9 return up a few days, but not by any significant amount.",

Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",

Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out.

And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

      "The lawsuit stemmed from Meta's suspension of his accounts after the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Facebook (which is now Meta) initially suspended and then announced in June 2021 that it would ban Mr. Trump from its platform for at least two years, after finding that his posts on Jan. 6 had stoked violence and posed a risk to public safety. Twitter, now named X and owned by Elon Musk, also barred Mr. Trump from its social media site for the same reason.",

      "In complaints filed with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Mr. Trump had asked the court to overturn Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects social media companies from liability for content posted on their platforms, and restore his accounts on the two social media sites, as well as his channel on YouTube. He also asked the courts to prevent Twitter, Facebook and YouTube from \"exercising censorship, editorial control or prior restraint in its many forms\" over the posts and uploads of the presidents.",

    "summary": "Lawmakers and experts say China's DeepSeek AI app could expose U.S. users to risks and promote censorship.",
    "story": [
      "As Chinese AI application DeepSeek attracts hordes of American users, Trump administration officials, lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are expressing concern that the technology could pose a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council (NSC) would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, technology and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "\"At the President's direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government work in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security,\" agency spokesperson Brian Hughes told CBS News in an email. \"As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\"",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

      "DeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according\u00a0to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.",
      "Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "Are there privacy issues with DeepSeek?",
      "Some experts are raising concerns about the personal data that DeepSeek is collecting, given that the company stores data from users \u2014 including their date of birth, keystrokes, text or audio inputs, uploaded files, chat history and other data \u2014 on servers located in China, according to its privacy policy.",
      "That echoes some of the issues raised with TikTok, another company with Chinese ownership that sparked worries about the supposed risks its ties to China posed to national security. Last year, Congress passed a law\u00a0banning\u00a0 TikTok in the U.S. as long as it is under Chinese ownership, although that is now in flux after President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days.",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",
      "Analysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.",
      "What is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.",
      "\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"",
      "But, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"",

      "Parent company ByteDance voluntarily shut down the TIkTok app in the U.S. Sunday, hours before a deadline to either sell the app or have it banned over concerns related to its China ties. TikTok was momentarily unavailable to U.S.-based users, before President Donald Trump on Monday paused a ban on the app operating in the U.S. from going into effect.",
      "Over the weekend, even those who had already downloaded the app to their phones were not able to use it, before it became available again. While service has since been restored for existing users, the app is still not available download in U.S.-based app stores, and so it remains unavailable to anyone who hadn't previously downloaded it.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 19:29:54 -0500",
    "summary": "New tariffs of 25% of imports from Canada and Mexico go into effect today, as well as a 10% tariff on Chinese imports.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday signed an executive order that imposes 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, while adding an additional 10% levy on goods from China. The salvo, which President Trump had threatened even before returning to power earlier this month, underlines his willingness to use trade policy even against some of the U.S.' largest economic allies.",
      "The tariffs take effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. The order imposes 25% tariffs on goods from Canada except for \"energy resources\" such as oil and gas, which are only hit with a 10% tariff.",
      "The order notes that should any of the three nations \"retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on United States exports to Canada or similar measures, the President may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.\"",
      "According to the White House, the salvo is aimed at curbing the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.; spurring a resurgence in domestic manufacturing; and raising federal revenue.",
      "Experts warn that the impact of the tariffs could affect the economies of Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 the nation's three biggest trading partners \u2014 as well as the U.S. itself. Canada's economy could shrink by 3.6%, while Mexico could take a 2% hit, according to Cornell University economics professor Wendong Zhang.",
      "At the same time, inflation in the U.S. could rise by as much as 1 percentage point, pushing it as high as 4% on an annual basis, or double the Federal Reserve's goal for a 2% annual rate, Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 research note.",
      "\"We have stressed that steep tariff increases against U.S. trading partners could create a stagflationary shock \u2014 a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse \u2014 while also triggering financial market volatility,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in a Jan. 31 report.",
      "Daco added, \"These tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China would mark the first major wave of trade levies in Trump's new term, with effects rippling far beyond those economies, as other nations brace for potential targeting and U.S. businesses navigate supply chain disruptions and retaliation risks.\"",
      "American consumers have been bracing for the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, telling pollsters that they expected to see higher prices if the president followed through on his plans to enact them. Those expectations may have prompted some consumers to purchase goods before Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists say.",
      "\"The mere prospect of tariffs appears to be influencing the behavior of consumers and businesses,\" analysts with Oxford Economics in a research note. \"Imports surged in December, likely an attempt to front-run any tariffs, while consumers may be bringing forward spending in anticipation of tariff-related price hikes.\"",
      "U.S. consumers could see higher prices\u00a0for produce and agricultural products imported from Canada and Mexico, including beef from the former and avocados and strawberries from the latter. Automobiles could see an average price increase of $3,000 each due to the tariffs, given the huge volume of cars now being built in Canada and Mexico, according to TD Economics.",

      "President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Saturday, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China.",
      "While Mr. Trump describes tariffs as import duties that are paid by foreign countries, they are in fact paid directly to the federal government by U.S. businesses,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank. Rather than swallowing the costs, corporations typically hike their prices for those imported goods to recoup all or some of the expense.",
      "Who pays the cost?",
      "\"If there is a significant increase in tariffs ... those costs will likely be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses,\" Brian Peck, executive director of University of Southern California's Center for Transnational Law and Business, told CBS Los Angeles.",
      "\"From Canada, we import oil, lumber, wood and cement,\" he added. \"Over 20% of the agriculture products we bring into the U.S. come from Mexico.\"",
      "One unknown is whether the Trump administration will carve out some exceptions, such as for oil and gas products. Canada provides about 20% of the oil used in the U.S., which means that a 25% tariff on Canadian imports could add 30 to 40 cents a gallon at the pump within days of the new duties taking effect, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has said.",
      "As painful as higher costs might be to U.S. consumers, the biggest impacts would likely be felt by the Canadian and Mexican economies, according to Wendong Zhang, assistant professor of applied economics and policy at Cornell University. A 25% tariff could cause Canada and Mexico to lose 3.6% and 2% of real GDP,\u00a0 respectively, versus a decline of 0.3% for the U.S., Zhang estimated.",
      "Here's what could get pricier for American shoppers if the Trump administration's tariffs take effect.",
      "Avocados, beef and other foods",
      "Inflation-pinched consumers may face a surge in prices for fruits, vegetables and nuts imported from Mexico, including avocados \u2014 just in time for the Super Bowl on Feb. 9.",
      "The U.S. imported more than $45 billion in agricultural products from Mexico in 2023, including fresh strawberries, raspberries, tomatoes and beef, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. also imports Mexican beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. imported about $40 billion of Canadian agricultural products that same year, including beef, pork, grains, potatoes and canola oil, the USDA notes.",
      "A 25% tariff could push prices up for all those products.",
      "\"Grocery stores operate on really tiny margins,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute. \"They can't eat the tariffs ... especially when you talk about things like avocados that basically all of them \u2014 90% \u2014 come from Mexico. You're talking about guacamole tariffs right before the Super Bowl.\"",
      "Cars",
      "American consumers are increasingly buying cars that are either built in Canada or Mexico or that use parts imported from those nations. The U.S. imported $69 billion of cars and light trucks from Mexico in 2023, and another $37 billion from Canada, according to S&P Global Mobility.",
      "On top of that, about $78 billion in auto parts stemmed from Mexico and $20 billion from Canada. For instance, the engines used in Ford's F-series pickup trucks come from Canada.",
      "Because U.S. importers are expected to roll any added tariff costs into vehicle sticker prices, the average U.S. automobile price could jump by about $3,000, TD Economics estimates. That would come at a time when the average new car already sells for $50,000 and the average used car for $26,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Lumber",
      "About one-third of softwood lumber used in the U.S. is imported from Canada each year, according to Rajan Parajuli, an associate professor of forest economics and policy at North Carolina State University.",
      "Tacking a 25% tariff on Canadian lumber could cause a \"supply shock,\" the Forest Resources Association, a trade group, wrote in a December blog post. \"Regarding lumber, the U.S. still needs Canadian supplies to meet its domestic consumption demand,\" the group said.",
      "Still, the slow U.S. housing market, dampened by mortgage rates that remain close to 7%, could make it hard for companies to pass on the new tariffs through higher lumber prices, some economists said.",
      "\"Lumber prices are expected to rise, although a slower U.S. housing recovery, burdened by higher prices, will limit the extent to which exporters will be able to pass on price increases,\" Oxford Economics noted in a Jan. 31 research note.",

      "A decision by the acting leadership at the U.S. Justice Department to delete its public webpages and case summaries of the Jan. 6 siege at the Capitol prosecution has triggered a legal challenge from a watchdog group and blowback from a federal judge who oversaw some of the cases.",
      "The controversial decision has also drawn the ire of one of the rioters who pleaded guilty.",
      "The Justice Department had built a comprehensive database of the approximately 1,600 defendants from the U.S. Capitol attack and had produced a monthly set of reports updating the prosecution, which was the largest in the agency's long history. Last week, the database and designated public web pages went dark, as the agency halted its prosecutions of the rioters, under orders from President Trump.",

Friedman included a recent version of the lengthy database in his public ruling, which can be accessed on the federal court system's website.",
      "The list in Friedman's order mirrors the purged Justice Department database, listing riot defendants in alphabetical order and noting their conviction and sentences.",
      "Friedman also blistered the proclamation by Mr. Trump that the Jan. 6 prosecutions were a \"national injustice perpetrated\" on the American people. Friedman wrote, \"The proclamation's assertion if factually incorrect. There has been no 'grave national injustice.' And just because the proclamation was signed by the President does not transform up into down or down into up as if peering through the glass in 'Alice in Wonderland.'\"",
      "Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, a D.C.-based government watchdog groups that frequently scrutinizes Mr. Trump, has issued a public letter seeking an investigation by the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General and the Archivist of the United States to determine if the deletion of the Jan. 6 public data was a violation of law.",
      "The letter said, \"The Department of Justice's removal of this vital information about its prosecutions arising from the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol is consistent with President Trump's ongoing efforts to rewrite or erase the insurrection, and also a likely violation of federal law.\"",
      "The watchdog group's letter also read, \"Despite the agency's requirement to notify the archivist of the deletion of these records, there is no indication that they reported this matter to NARA, and a list of open 'unauthorized disposition cases' on NARA's website does not reveal any such reporting. Given DOJ's apparent failure to report this matter to NARA as required by law, we are doing so now and request that NARA take appropriate action, including instructing the agency to issue a report in accordance with 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 1230.14 and \u00a7 1230.16.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's allies in Congress have been accused of their own efforts to erase the history of Jan. 6. House Republican leadership has defied a 2022 law requiring the hanging of a formal plaque on the US Capitol grounds to honor police heroes who saved the Capitol and Congress from the attack.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson has declined to specify if or when the plaque will ever be hung.",
      "Democrats also blasted Republicans for failing to acknowledge the Capitol Insurrection and its victims on the four-year mark of the attack, on Jan. 6, 2025. Republican leaders in the House and Senate did not hold a vigil or commemoration for the victims, which had previously been staged at the Capitol in prior years.",
      "Pam Hemphill, an Idaho woman who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for her role in the US Capitol breach, told CBS News that the deletion of Jan. 6 public records \"is just the latest step in rewriting history for his benefit and is more proof of his utter contempt for the Rule of Law.\"",

      "The Biden administration argued the policy, known as CHNV, discouraged illegal immigration by people from these four Latin American countries by offering them legal means to come to the U.S., but President Trump froze the initiative hours after being inaugurated. Trump officials have specifically argued the program was a misuse of immigration parole, the legal authority which the Biden administration used to admit those under the sponsorship initiative, and to allow them to apply for work permits.",

    "summary": "Large rat populations can have a damaging effect on cities. Researchers found that living with rats \" impacts people and their psyche.\"",
    "story": [
      "Urban dwellers in Washington D.C., San Francisco, Toronto, New York City, and Amsterdam might have seen rats scurrying across their cities \u2014 and they're not imagining an influx.",
      "Rat populations have spiked in cities with warming temperatures resulting from climate change or urban heat islands, found a study released Friday in the journal Science Advances. Researchers analyzed public complaint and inspection data in 16 cities worldwide to estimate trends in rat populations and connect it to global warming patterns \u2014 marking the first time these associations have been linked.",
      "\"We found these cities that have increasing warming trends over the last 50 years or so also have faster number of rats,\" Jonathan L. Richardson, an associate professor at the University of Richmond and lead study author, told CBS News.",
      "Richardson's lab tracks rats across the globe and his team conducted research in 16 cities including Oakland, Buffalo, Chicago, Boston, Kansas City, and Cincinnati for the study. Of the 16 cities analyzed 11 cities had \"significant\" increases in rat populations, while just three cities \u2013 Tokyo, Louisville, and New Orleans \u2014 had declining populations.",
      "There are a few reasons for the increase; cities with more dense human populations and more urbanization saw a jump. Increasing warmth also extended the window for foraging the rats.",
      "\"For a rat that means that they don't have to stay underground in their burrows,\" said Richardson.",
      "The frisky rodents would scamper around, and since rats' physiology is sensitive to temperature, females would reach sexual maturity earlier, get pregnant and have larger litters more frequently as it stays warmer for longer periods.",
      "Large rat populations can have a damaging effect on cities. Researchers found that living with rats \"impacts people and their psyche.\"",
      "Rats also breed disease.",
      "\"They transmit and carry more than 50 zoonotic pathogens and parasites that can make people sick,\" said Richardson.",
      "Controlling the population is increasingly difficult \u2014\u00a0 estimates say the \"war on rats\" cost $500 million every year. New York City hired its first-ever \"Rat Czar\" in 2023, and an investigation by CBS New York found rats had an increase of more than 7% since the Adams administration took office in 2022 and launched its \"war on rats.\"",
      "Richardson said there are good people hard at work in cities trying to control the rat population but rats\u00a0 are \"a very smart animal, and it is, you know it's remarkable at how good it can be at avoiding what we're using to try to control it.\"",
      "The study found that to effectively control rats cities need to dedicate bigger budgets to these groups and more personnel, specifically, on these teams doing rodent control",
      "Cities have to embrace pest management companies, and their technicians have to practice integrated pest management, said Richardson. Cities have to focus more efforts on \"actually eliminating those conducive conditions that support rats.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 10:12:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Black History Month began this year on Feb. 1, 2025. The history of the month dates back almost a century.",
    "story": [
      "Beginning Feb. 1, schools, museums and communities across the nation will mark the start of Black History Month \u2014 a celebration of Black history, culture and education.",
      "The history of the month dates back almost a century, and the way it is celebrated and evolved has created history in itself.",
      "The origins of the month",
      "Black History Month wasn't always a monthlong celebration. In February 1926, historian and author Carter G. Woodson created Negro History Week. It was a weeklong celebration in an effort to teach people about African-American history and the contributions of Black people.",
      "This effort was made under the umbrella of an organization he founded in September 1915 called the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, or ASALH.",
      "\"I think Black folks understood what they had contributed to America's historical narrative, but no one was talking about it,\" said Kaye Whitehead, the organization's president. \"No one was centralizing it until Dr. Carter G. Woodson was in 1926.\"",
      "After he passed away in 1950, the members of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity, which Dr. Woodson was a member of, did a lot of groundwork to encourage celebrating the week. The fraternity was also responsible for the push to extend the celebrations to a full month. Eventually, in 1976, President Gerald Ford became the first president to issue a message recognizing the month.",
      "Since then, presidents have made annual proclamations for National Black History Month, a tradition that President Donald Trump plans to continue, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
      "Celebrating Black history",
      "The Association for the Study of African American Life and History releases a theme for each year, which is a practice Woodson started.",
      "This year's theme is African Americans and Labor. The organization plans to use the month, and the rest of the year, focusing on the role of Black labor in building the nation through industry or community work.",
      "Black history is also celebrated within communities and families. Worth K. Hayes, an associate professor of history and Africana studies at Morehouse College, said some families may use the month to explore their genealogy, learn about their ancestors or come together to eat a meal and make family trees.",
      "\"We may be more familiar with the more public ways, but there are also a lot more intimate ways in which these messages are spread and the way that the holiday is propagated,\" Hayes said.",
      "At some schools, assemblies or gatherings are held to honor Black leaders, according to the nonpartisan organization the Center for Racial Justice in Education.",
      "\"Some schools invite elders to share their wisdom and lived experiences, allowing young people to learn from them, ask questions, and build meaningful connections across generations,\" the center said in an email to The Associated Press. \"Additionally, some communities select specific topics or principles for in-depth exploration during the month.\"",
      "Myths about Black History Month",
      "Myths around Black History Month continue, Whitehead said, including the idea that the U.S. government purposely chose the shortest month of the year. In reality, Woodson chose February because two prominent figures in the civil rights movement \u2014 Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass \u2014 had birthdays in the week he chose.",
      "Whitehead also stresses that Black history shouldn't just be taught for the month of February, but rather taught and celebrated for the entire year.",
      "Celebrities, including actor Morgan Freeman, have criticized it being just a monthlong celebration. But Hayes argued that the month isn't just about celebrating African-American history, but Black history as a whole.",
      "\"I think that there is this desire to make this point that African-American history or Black history is so integral to the American story, American history,\" Hayes said. \"But that reduces Black history to African-American history, and that's not how it is and is celebrated from its origins to this day \u2026 So if you're talking about Black History Month, you're not only talking about Nat Turner, you're also talking about Toussaint Louverture and the Haitian Revolution. You're talking about many of the women and men who led the independence movements on the African continent.\"",
      "Whitehead added that Black history is not just for Black people, it is for all people.",
      "\"If you're in an environment and everybody in the environment is white, you need Black History Month more than ever because you need to understand that the world, even though you like to believe it fits into this box, it does not,\" Whitehead said.",
      "Black history doesn't rely on a presidential proclamation, Whitehead and others said. Whitehead said Black people don't need permission to mark the month.",
      "\"It doesn't happen because we're waiting for a statement to be released. We proclaim it, We celebrate it, we uplift, we center it and we help people to understand that this is our history,\" she said.",
      "Black History Month in 2025",
      "At least one government agency has paused celebrations of cultural or historic events, including Black History Month.",
      "The Trump administration planned to scrub some federal government websites in order to remove content contrary to the president's thinking, administration officials told CBS News. There was confusion about whether sites would be entirely shut down, but federal department and agency websites remained functional Friday.",
      "But at the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, the decisions of the new Trump administration around Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives will not affect how Black History Month is celebrated.",
      "\"Negro History Week started in 1926 without any proclamation from anyone other than the people,\" said ASALH executive director Sylvia Cyrus. \"The president of the United States has his views, and certainly we assume that he understands the contributions that African Americans and other people of color have made.\"",
      "A White House spokesperson has said that they intend to celebrate the month.",
      "Some believe how Black history is taught could be affected by the new administration's outlook on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs.",
      "The Center for Racial Justice in Education said educators may be more encouraged to teach Black history in their classrooms throughout the year. \"Resistance takes many inspiring forms, and those dedicated to celebrating this essential history are employing creative and strategic approaches to share and further develop it,\" the organization said in an email.",
      "Hayes agreed and said it could encourage others to teach communities about the contributions of Black people.",
      "\"African Americans, Black folks throughout the world, just like all cultures throughout the world, have taken ownership of their history,\" he said. \"And these various political developments may shape the contours of it. But this story is going to be told regardless of the political dynamics of the particular time.\"",

      "Only one air traffic control worker was managing the helicopters and some planes from the Reagan National Airport tower at the time of the collision, a job normally done by two people, two sources told CBS News Thursday.",
      "Only about 2% of the towers met the Collaborative Resource Working Group's 2024 staffing targets for the number of fully-trained air traffic controllers. Only about 8% met the target even when including hundreds of air traffic controllers who are still in training, according to the analysis of 2023 staffing data for nearly 200 airport towers.",
      "Additionally, none of the nation's Air Route Traffic Control Centers that handled high-altitude \"en route\" traffic had enough fully-trained controllers to meet the targets either.",
      "The data, from the end of fiscal year 2023, was published in the FAA's Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan, an annual report to Congress on the status of the agency's efforts to overcome a decades-long struggle to recruit and retain enough controllers to keep Americans safe while flying. The data shows staffing at the end of fiscal year 2023.",
      "Nationwide, the working group's target for controllers was about 14,600, the report found. Counting only fully-trained controllers, the nation's air traffic system is at about 72% of that target. It's at 87% if trainees are included. That's about 3,000 to 4,000 controllers short of the targets, depending on whether the hundreds \"in training\" are counted.",
      "In the report, the FAA cites the COVID-19 pandemic as one of the reasons it has struggled to meet staff expansion goals at air traffic control facilities across the country.",
      "\"The COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial impact on the aviation industry and the FAA,\" the agency said in its report. \"At the onset of the pandemic, in order to protect employees and help ensure continuity of operations, certain activities were eliminated or significantly reduced at FAA's air traffic control (ATC) facilities.\"",
      "The agency also noted that \"on-the-job training of developmental air traffic controllers was significantly reduced,\" as well as hiring targets. The agency said that had a significant impact on its efforts to develop fully-trained controllers.",
      "The staffing targets in the report are goals based on an analysis by a group that included FAA's Air Traffic Organization as well as the controllers' labor union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.",
      "The FAA also included in the report its own internal staffing standards for each facility. Using that standard, which is lower for many facilities than the working group's targets, 45% of the airport towers met the standard, counting only fully-trained controllers. If all controllers in training are included, 59% of the airports met the lower FAA standard.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the Trump administration from freezing federal assistance\u00a0after a group of 22 states and the District of Columbia challenged a memo from the White House budget office ordering a pause of federal funding.",
      "U.S. District Chief Judge John McConnell of Rhode Island on Friday\u00a0granted the request for a temporary restraining order sought by the Democrat-led states, which had argued that the actions from the Office of Management and Budget violated federal law and the Constitution.",
      "McConnell's order was expected, as he had signaled following a hearing Wednesday that he was inclined to issue the temporary pause of the Trump administration's directive. The judge said in his decision that the Office of Management and Budget's actions are likely unconstitutional and violate federal law.",
      "\"Are there some aspects of the pause that might be legal and appropriate constitutionally for the Executive to take? The court imagines there are, but it is equally sure that there are many instances in the Executive Orders' wide-ranging, all-encompassing, and ambiguous 'pause' of critical funding that are not,\" McConnell found.",
      "The judge wrote that the budget office did not cite any legal authority that allowed it to unilaterally suspend the flow of federal funds to states and other entities and said \"no federal law would authorize the executive's unilateral action here.\"",
      "\"The states have set forth facts showing that the executive's abrupt 'pause' in potentially trillions of dollars of federal funding will cause a ripple effect that would directly impact the states and other's ability to provide and administer vital services and relief to their citizens,\" McConnell wrote.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is part of the lawsuit, cheered the court's order and said the president cannot unilaterally stop congressional spending commitments.",
      "\"This administration's reckless plan to block federal funding has already caused chaos, confusion, and conflict throughout our country,\" she said in a statement. \"In the short time since this policy was announced, families have been cut off from childcare services, essential Medicaid funds were disrupted, and critical law enforcement efforts were put in jeopardy.\"",
      "The Democrat-led states filed their lawsuit earlier this week in response to a memo from the Office of Management and Budget that ordered agencies to temporarily pause \"to the extent permitted by law\" grant, loan or federal financial assistance programs that were implicated by Mr. Trump's executive orders. The executive orders listed include those involving immigration, energy, diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs, and gender ideology.",
      "The memo was issued by Matthew Vaeth, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, who said the freeze was set to take effect by 5 p.m. Tuesday. Its full scope was not clear and sparked confusion and chaos around the country as states and nonprofits scrambled to determine whether they would be affected. Lawmakers, too, fielded calls from constituents and organizations in their states seeking answers about whether they would be cut off from federal dollars.",
      "The memo also prompted immediate legal action from the Democrat-led states and a group of nonprofit organizations, who filed a separate challenge in Washington, D.C. A federal judge there swiftly convened a hearing on a request from the nonprofits to temporarily block enforcement of the freeze, and agreed Tuesday to issue a brief pause to fully consider the matter.",
      "One day later, the Office of Management and Budget issued a new, two-line memo saying that the earlier directive had been rescinded.",
      "But questions continued to arise after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that only the budget office's memo had been walked back and the broader halting of federal assistance would remain in effect.",
      "\"This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze. It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo,\" she wrote on social media\u00a0Wednesday. \"Why? To end any confusion created by the court's injunction. The president's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented.\"",
      "Following Leavitt's post, the Justice Department argued that the matter before McConnell was moot. But the judge said in his order that \"the evidence shows that the alleged rescission of the OMB Directive was in name-only and may have been issued simply to defeat the jurisdiction of the court.\"",
      "\"The substantive effect of the directive carries on,\" he wrote. \"Messaging from the White House and agencies proves this point.\"",

Siegel was freed in Gaza City about two hours after Israelis Yarden Bibas and Ofer Calderon were released in the southern city of Khan Younis.",
      "The Israeli military confirmed that all three hostages were in its care and back in Israel after first being handed over to Red Cross personnel in Gaza. Siegel appeared to have lost weight during his captivity, but he waved and smiled as Hamas militants prepared to hand him over to Red Cross staff. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said the three freed men would be reunited with family members and taken for medical checks and care at hospitals in Israel.",
      "Both handovers were conducted quickly Saturday and without the chaos seen during the previous, third prisoner exchange, which angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who delayed the corresponding Israeli release of Palestinian prisoners by several hours.",
      "Israel was expected to free about 90 more Palestinians from its prisons on Saturday in exchange for the release of the three hostages, as stipulated in the ceasefire agreement that took effect on January 19.",
      "Keith Siegel is 1st American freed during new ceasefire",
      "Originally from North Carolina, Siegel moved to Israel four decades ago. He was among seven American citizens taken as hostages into Gaza during Hamas' unprecedented Oct. 7 attack, which saw militants kill around 1,200 people in southern Israel and take 251 others captive.",
      "Israel's military assault on Hamas in response has killed more than 47,400 people, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run Ministry of Health, left entire neighborhoods leveled and caused a humanitarian catastrophe by displacing virtually the entire enclave's population and destroying its infrastructure.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Saturday that Americans are celebrating the return of Siegel.",
      "\"President Trump and his administration have worked diligently to secure their release and are committed to freeing all remaining hostages,\" she said.",

      "Siegel's wife Aviva was also taken hostage by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, but was released in an earlier hostage and prisoner swap in November 2023.",
      "Speaking to CBS News about a year after her release, Aviva Siegel said there were moments as Hamas militants forced her and her husband through tunnels under the Gaza Strip that they felt \"sure we were going to die.\"",
      "Yarden Bibas, 35, is the husband of Shiri Bibas, who was taken from their kibbutz with her two young children Ariel and Kfir during the terrorist attack. Hamas claimed just weeks after the attack that Shiri and her two children were killed in an Israeli bombing in Gaza.",
      "In a TV interview about a year later, then-Israeli government minister Benny Gantz indicated that officials knew what had happened to the Bibas family, but said he could not provide details. The fact that, under the terms of the ceasefire deal, Hamas has released women and children before male hostages, suggested the rest of Yarden Bibas' family was indeed dead.",
      "Ofer Calderon, 54, was among five members of his family seized by Hamas militants from their kibbutz near the Gaza border on Oct. 7, 2023. His two children were released during the ceasefire in November of that year, but two of his cousins were killed.",
      "Rafah crossing into Egypt reopened",

      "Israel agreed to reopen the crossing after Hamas released the last living female hostages in Gaza.",
      "Egyptian television showed a Palestinian Red Cross ambulance pulling up to the crossing gate, and several children were brought out on stretchers and transferred to ambulances on the Egyptian side, the AP reported. Gaza's Health Ministry said around 60 family members were accompanying the children.",
      "Rafah is Gaza's only crossing that does not enter into Israel. It was closed by Israeli forces in early May after it was seized during an offensive on the southern city. Egypt shut down its side of the crossing in protest.",
      "Mohammed Zaqout, the director of hospitals in Gaza's Health Ministry, told the AP that more than 6,000 patients were ready to be evacuated abroad and more than 12,000 patients urgently needed treatment. He said the small numbers set to be evacuated will not cover the need, \"and we hope the number will increase.\"",
      "What has the ceasefire accomplished and what comes next?",
      "Hamas is expected to free a total of 33 Israeli hostages during the first, six-week phase of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, which took effect on January 19. After the release on Saturday, 18 have been freed so far. With each release of Israeli hostages, scores of Palestinians have been freed from Israeli prisons, with roughly 30 being set free for every hostage returned to Israel alive.",
      "Phase one of the deal was to see all Israeli women, children and male hostages over the age of 50 released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, in addition to a dramatically increased flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza and the partial withdrawal of Israeli forces from some areas of the territory.",
      "On the 16th day of the ceasefire, which would be Monday, negotiations to establish the steps for the second phase are meant to begin, according to a draft of the agreement shared with CBS News by a senior Hamas official.",
      "There have been a few moments where it appeared the fragile agreement could fall apart, including when hostage Arbel Yehoud was not released as Israel said she should have been in one of the first exchanges. Quick negotiations led to a resolution of the dispute, and Yehoud was among those freed by militants in Gaza in the third exchange on Thursday.",
      "\"Any deal that takes two or three months to end a war is a bad deal, because it can go off the rails at any point, and at any point either one of the sides can accuse the other of breaching,\" Israeli analyst and former hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"We've already had mutual accusations of breach. Right now, both sides are interested in at least bringing this forward to the end of the 42 days\" of phase one, Baskin said.",
      "Baskin, who has extensive experience negotiating with Hamas, cautioned that \"you couldn't have the two parties further apart\" ahead of the expected negotiations over the second phase of the deal.",
      "\"What we hear from the Israeli side is that they will not end the war or withdraw from Gaza, and what we hear from Hamas is that there is no deal unless it ends the war and brings about an Israeli withdrawal,\" he said.",
      "But Baskin added that the new Trump administration in the U.S. would likely play an integral role in determining how the negotiations actually go.",
      "\"I think it's all on the shoulders of Trump,\" Baskin told CBS News. \"If Trump is determined that this will take place, Netanyahu cannot go against him. Netanyahu may try to create some kind of provocation, leading Hamas to breach the ceasefire, in which case Israel will say to the Americans, 'They breached it and now we have to go back to war.' If Trump says yes, then that's the end. If Trump says 'no, you can't go back to war,' then we will move into phase two.\"",

      "Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela in recent months were freed by the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro after he met Friday with a Trump administration official tasked with urging the authoritarian leader to take back deported migrants who have committed crimes in the United States.",
      "President Trump and his envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, announced the release of the six men on social media. The visit by Grenell came as a shock to many Venezuelans who hoped that Mr. Trump would continue the \"maximum pressure\" campaign he pursued against Maduro during his first term.",
      "Grenell later posted a photo of the six Americans aboard a flight headed back to the U.S.",
      "Grenell's hourslong trip to Venezuela, according to the White House, was focused on Mr. Trump's efforts to deport Venezuelans back to their home country, which currently does not accept them, and on the release of the detained Americans.",
      "\"We are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens,\" Grenell posted on X along with a photo showing him and the men aboard an aircraft. \"They just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and they couldn't stop thanking him.\"",
      "The meeting in Venezuela's capital took place less than a month after Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost last year's election. The U.S. government, along with several other Western nations, does not recognize Maduro's claim to victory and instead points to tally sheets collected by the opposition coalition showing that its candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, won by a more than a two-to-one margin.",
      "Venezuelan state television aired footage of Grenell and Maduro speaking in the Miraflores Palace and said the meeting had been requested by the U.S. government.",
      "Signing an executive order in the Oval Office on Friday, Mr. Trump was asked if Grenell being filmed meeting with Maduro lent legitimacy to an administration that the Trump White House hasn't officially recognized.",
      "\"No. We want to do something with Venezuela. I've been a very big opponent of Venezuela and Maduro,\" Trump responded. \"They've treated us not so good, but they've treated, more importantly, the Venezuelan people, very badly.\"",
      "Mr. Trump added that Grenell is \"meeting with a lot of different people, but we're for the people of Venezuela.\"",
      "Some Republicans criticized the visit.",
      "\"This is terrible timing,\" said Elliott Abrams, who served as special envoy to Venezuela and Iran during the first Trump administration. \"A meeting with Maduro will be used by him to legitimize his rule and show that the Americans recognize him as president. If the purpose is to deliver a tough message about migration issues, the president could've done that himself. There was no need to send someone to Caracas.\"",
      "The dispute over the election results sparked nationwide protests. More than 2,200 people were arrested during and after the demonstrations.",
      "Among those detained are as many as 10 Americans who the government has linked to alleged plots to destabilize the country. Neither the White House nor Maduro's government immediately released the names of the six who were freed Friday.",
      "A nonprofit group that had advocated for the release of a detainee said David Estrella, a 62-yer-old who was last heard from in September, was among those on their way back to the U.S. Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello had accused Estrella of being part of an alleged plot to assassinate Maduro.",
      "The Trump administration has taken a slew of actions to make good on promises to crack down on illegal immigration and carry out the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history.",
      "Those measures include the revocation earlier this week of a Biden administration decision that would have protected roughly 600,000 people from Venezuela from deportation, putting some at risk of being removed from the country in about two months.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Friday that Mr. Trump had instructed Grenell to \"identify a place and ensure that repatriation flights\" carrying Venezuelans, including members of the Tren de Aragua criminal organization, \"land in Venezuela.\" She said Mr. Trump also ordered Grenell to \"ensure that all U.S. detainees in Venezuela are returned home.\"",
      "Trump wrote Saturday on his social media site Truth Social that he was happy to have the Americans back home.",
      "\"And very important to note, that Venezuela has agreed to receive, back into their Country, all Venezuela illegal aliens who were encamped in the U.S., including gang members of Tren de Aragua. Venezuela has further agreed to supply the transportation back,\" he wrote. \"We are in the process of removing record numbers of illegal aliens from all Countries, and all Countries have agreed to accept these illegal aliens back.\"",
      "More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left their home country since 2013, when its economy unraveled and Maduro first took office. Most settled in Latin America and the Caribbean, but after the pandemic, migrants increasingly set their sights on the U.S.",
      "Venezuelans' desire for better living conditions and their rejection of Maduro are expected to keep pushing people to emigrate.",
      "Ahead of the presidential election last year, a nationwide poll by Venezuela-based research firm Delphos showed about a quarter of the population thinking about emigrating if Maduro was re-elected.",
      "Grenell has reached out to Maduro before on Mr. Trump's behalf to secure the release of imprisoned Americans only to come home empty handed.",
      "In 2020, he traveled with Erik Prince, the founder of controversial security firm Blackwater, to Mexico City for a secret meeting with a top Maduro aide. The backchannel talks centered on Maduro's offer to swap eight Americans then imprisoned in Venezuela for businessman Alex Saab, a close ally of the president charged in the U.S. with money laundering, The Associated Press previously reported.",
      "No deal was struck and Grenell's demand that Maduro step down was dismissed by the Venezuelan president's envoy. Grenell has always denied he was negotiating a hostage swap.",
      "Later, in December 2023, the Biden administration exchanged Saab for 10 Americans as part of a policy to re-engage Maduro ahead of presidential elections.",

    "summary": "Dual U.S.-Israeli national Keith Siegel is among the 3 hostages expected to be released by Hamas in the fourth swap with Israel.",
    "story": [
      "The group representing the families of Israeli hostages confirmed Friday the names of three more captives whom Hamas is expected to hand over on Saturday, and there's a dual U.S.-Israeli national among them. Keith Siegel, 65, originally from North Carolina, moved to Israel four decades ago and was among those seized during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack.",
      "Hamas had earlier provided three names and Israeli officials confirmed receipt of the list, but it was the Hostages and Missing Families Forum that confirmed the identities, saying it welcomed \"the joyous news regarding the expected release of Keith Siegel,\" along with Israeli nationals Yarden Bibas and Ofer Calderon.",
      "Siegel's wife Aviva Siegel  was also taken during the attack, which saw militants kill some 1,200 people and take 251 others hostage, but she was released under a brief November 2023 ceasefire and prisoner swap agreement between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Speaking to CBS News about a year after her release, Siegel said there were moments as Hamas militants forced her and her husband through tunnels under the Gaza Strip that they felt \"sure we were going to die.\"",
      "Yarden Bibas, 35, is the husband of Shiri Bibas, who was taken from their kibbutz with her two young children Ariel and Kfir during the terrorist attack. Hamas claimed just weeks after the attack that Shiri and her two children were killed in an Israeli bombing in Gaza.",
      "In a TV interview about half a year later, then-Israeli government minister Benny Gantz indicated that officials knew what had happened to the Bibas family, but said it could not provide details. The fact that, under the terms of the ceasefire deal, Hamas has released women and children before male hostages, suggested the rest of Yarden Bibas' family was indeed dead.",
      "Ofer Calderon, 54, was among five members of his family seized by Hamas militants from their kibbutz near the Gaza border on Oct. 7, 2023. His two children were released during the ceasefire in November of that year, but two of his cousins were killed.",
      "Speaking to CBS Boston only two weeks ago, Calderon's cousin Jason Greenberg said he still didn't know whether Ofer was dead or alive.",
      "\"It's hard to imagine anybody being able to endure that long and even come back the same person,\" Greenberg said. \"If he comes back alive, that's a miracle.\"",
      "The other half of the exchange on Saturday will see Israel release 90 Palestinians from its prisons, Hamas' Prisoners' Media Office said Friday. Among those the group said it expected to be released are nine prisoners who have been serving life sentences and 81 others serving long sentences.",

      "3rd hostage-prisoner exchange completed, but not smoothly",
      "Eight hostages held by Hamas and its allies in Gaza were freed Thursday in exchange for the release of 110 Palestinian prisoners, in a third swap facilitated by the fragile ceasefire agreement that took effect on January 19.",
      "The exchange began smoothly with the handover of female Israeli soldier Agam Berger, 20. She was handed over in a relatively orderly fashion amid the ruins of the Jabalia Refugee Camp in northern Gaza. But the process devolved into chaos when large crowds surrounded Israelis Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Moses as they were transferred by militants to Red Cross personnel in southern Gaza about an hour later.",
      "The scenes angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who delayed the release of the Palestinian prisoners for a few hours until, his office said, mediators of the ceasefire agreement offered guarantees that precautions would be taken to ensure the safety of all further hostages released under the deal.",
      "President Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff ended a visit and left Israel Thursday after the three hostages were released. He spent much of the day visiting Gaza, where he went with members of the Israel Defense Forces, \"to inspect the implementation [of the ceasefire], because it is so important,\" he told Axios.",
      "\"How this happens will influence our ability to get to phase-two of the deal,\" Witkoff said.",

      "Israel's 15-month, blistering military offensive in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack has killed more than 47,400 people in the enclave, according to the Hamas-run ministry of health.",
      "The ministry does not distinguish between combatant and civilian casualties, and Israel disputed its figures during the course of the war, but a\u00a0study published\u00a0earlier in January in the medical journal The Lancet said the actual toll in Gaza had likely surpassed 70,000 people.",
      "Entire neighborhoods in the densely populated Palestinian territory have been leveled, and virtually all of its more than 2 million inhabitants have been displaced from their homes, many of them multiple times.",
      "Israel expected to allow medical evacuations through Gaza-Egypt crossing",
      "Under the terms of the ceasefire with Israel, according to a print draft shared with CBS News by Hamas officials before it took effect, the Israeli military was to allow limited movement of people across Gaza's southern border with Egypt once all of the living female Israeli soldiers held captive were released.",
      "With the release of Berger on Thursday, that appeared set to happen by Saturday.",
      "Both the European Union and the Palestinian Authority, which partially administers the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said Friday that they were sending staff to help facilitate the limited opening of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt's northeastern Sinai Peninsula.",

It will support Palestinian border personnel and allow the transfer of individuals out of Gaza, including those who need medical care.\"",
      "The Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza said, meanwhile, that a first group of sick and wounded Palestinians would be allowed to pass through the Rafah crossing into Egypt on Saturday, with selected patients and their companions being contacted by phone \"to arrange travel procedures after securing approvals from the relevant parties\" in coordination with the World Health Organization.",
      "In his own statement, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed \"the planned medical evacuation of 50 patients via the #Rafah crossing tomorrow \u2014 the first since the ceasefire began and the first through Rafah since its closure in May 2024.\"",
      "The WHO chief added that between 12,000 and 14,000 \"people still require medical evacuation\" from Gaza, and he called for an acceleration of those evacuations \"through all possible routes.\"",
      "Reports in Gaza suggested all 50 of the wounded Palestinians set to cross into Egypt on Saturday were members of Hamas' armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades.

    "summary": "To New Zealand's Indigenous M\u0101ori people, the mountain Taranaki Maunga \"has long been an honored ancestor.\"",
    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand\u00a0- A mountain in New Zealand considered an ancestor by Indigenous people was recognized as a legal person on Thursday after a new law granted it all the rights and responsibilities of a human being.",
      "Mount Taranaki \u2014   now known as Taranaki Maunga, its M\u0101ori name \u2014   is the latest natural feature to be granted personhood in New Zealand, which has ruled that a river and a stretch of sacred land are people before. The pristine, snow-capped dormant volcano is the second highest on New Zealand's North Island at 8,261 feet and a popular spot for tourism, hiking and snow sports.",
      "The legal recognition acknowledges the mountain's theft from the M\u0101ori of the Taranaki region after New Zealand was colonized. It fulfills an agreement of redress from the country's government to Indigenous people for harms perpetrated against the land since.",
      "The law passed Thursday gives Taranaki Maunga all the rights, powers, duties, responsibilities and liabilities of a person. Its legal personality has a name: Te K\u0101hui Tupua, which the law views as \"a living and indivisible whole.\" It includes Taranaki and its surrounding peaks and land, \"incorporating all their physical and metaphysical elements.\"",
      "A newly created entity will be \"the face and voice\" of the mountain, the law says, with four members from local M\u0101ori iwi, or tribes, and four members appointed by the country's Conservation Minister.",
      "\"The mountain has long been an honored ancestor, a source of physical, cultural and spiritual sustenance and a final resting place,\" Paul Goldsmith, the lawmaker responsible for the settlements between the government and M\u0101ori tribes, told Parliament in a speech on Thursday.",
      "But colonizers of New Zealand in the 18th and 19th centuries took first the name of Taranaki and then the mountain itself. In 1770, the British explorer Captain James Cook spotted the peak from his ship and named it Mount Egmont.",
      "In 1840, M\u0101ori tribes and representatives of the British crown signed the Treaty of Waitangi \u2014   New Zealand's founding document - in which the Crown promised M\u0101ori would retain rights to their land and resources. But the M\u0101ori and English versions of the treaty differed \u2014   and Crown breaches of both began immediately.",
      "In 1865, a vast swathe of Taranaki land, including the mountain, was confiscated to punish M\u0101ori for rebeling against the Crown. Over the next century hunting and sports groups had a say in the mountain's management - but M\u0101ori did not.",
      "\"Traditional M\u0101ori practices associated with the mountain were banned while tourism was promoted,\" Goldsmith said. But a M\u0101ori protest movement of the 1970s and '80s has led to a surge of recognition for the M\u0101ori language, culture and rights in New Zealand law.",
      "Redress has included billions of dollars in Treaty of Waitangi settlements \u2014   such as the agreement with the eight tribes of Taranaki, signed in 2023.",
      "\"Today, Taranaki, our maunga, our maunga tupuna, is released from the shackles, the shackles of injustice, of ignorance, of hate,\" said Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, a co-leader of the political party Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori and a descendant of the Taranaki tribes, using a phrase that means ancestral mountain.",
      "\"We grew up knowing there was nothing anyone could do to make us any less connected,\" she added.",
      "The mountain's legal rights are intended to uphold its health and wellbeing. They will be employed to stop forced sales, restore its traditional uses and allow conservation work to protect the native wildlife that flourishes there. Public access will remain.",
      "New Zealand was the first country in the world to recognize natural features as people when a law passed in 2014 granted personhood to Te Urewera, a vast native forest on the North Island.",
      "Government ownership of the forest ceased under the law and the tribe T\u016bhoe became its guardian.",
      "\"Te Urewera is ancient and enduring, a fortress of nature, alive with history; its scenery is abundant with mystery, adventure, and remote beauty,\" the law begins, before describing its spiritual significance to M\u0101ori. In 2017, New Zealand recognized the Whanganui River as human, as part of a settlement with its local iwi.",
      "The bill recognizing the mountain's personhood was affirmed unanimously by Parliament's 123 lawmakers. The vote was greeted by a ringing waiata \u2014 a M\u0101ori song \u2014   from the public gallery, packed with dozens who had traveled to the capital, Wellington, from Taranaki.",
      "The unity provided brief respite in a tense period for race relations in New Zealand. In November, tens of thousands of people marched to Parliament to protest a law that would reshape the Treaty of Waitangi by setting rigid legal definitions for each clause. Detractors say the law \u2014   which is not expected to pass - would strip M\u0101ori of legal rights and dramatically reverse progress from the past five decades.",

    "story": [
      "Marianne Faithfull, the British pop star who inspired and helped write some of the Rolling Stones' greatest songs\u00a0has died at the age of 78.",

      "\"It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of the singer, songwriter and actress Marianne Faithfull,\" her spokesperson said. \"Marianne passed away peacefully in London today, in the company of her loving family. She will be dearly missed.\"",
      "Faithfull was born in Hampstead, London, in December 1946. She was a folk singer who, one day, met with the manager of the Rolling Stones at a party, which led to her recording \"As Tears Go By\" by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in 1964. She was just 17 years old when she recorded the hit single.",
      "\"They came up and said to the person I was with, 'Can she sing?'\" Faithfull said to CBS Sunday Morning during a 2009 interview.",
      "The pop song ended up on the U.K. and American charts. Multiple hit singles and two debut albums followed.",
      "Jagger said on Thursday that he was \"so saddened to hear of the death\" of Faithfull.",
      "\"She was so much part of my life for so long,\" Jagger said on social media. \"She was a wonderful friend, a beautiful singer and a great actress. She will always be remembered.\"",
      "The daughter of an eccentric British professor and an Austrian baroness, Faithfull was just out of convent school when her career took off. At 18, she married a London art dealer and had a baby but later walked away from both her marriage and her career, for Jagger.",
      "She and Jagger began seeing each other in 1966 and became one of the most notorious couples of \"Swinging London,\" with Faithfull once declaring that if LSD \"wasn't meant to happen, it wouldn't have been invented.\"",
      "But in 1967 when Faithfull was at a party, police barged into a Rolling Stones party at Richards' home where drugs were found. The charges were later dropped, but her angelic image was disgraced.",
      "After Jagger and Faithfull broke up, she fell into drug addiction and was homeless by her mid-20s.",
      "In 1979, she pulled herself together to release a raw and daring comeback album, the critically acclaimed \"Broken English.\" But Faithfull was still an addict and it would be six more years before she finally cleaned herself up.",

    "summary": "2 Israeli women and an 80-year-old male hostage, along with 5 Thai nationals, were released in Gaza, but Israel delayed its part of the exchange, accusing Hamas of \"shocking scenes\" at one handover.",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv \u2014\u00a0Three more Israeli hostages \u2014 two females and an 80-year-old man \u2014 were released in Gaza Thursday as the third hostages-for-prisoners swap agreed to by\u00a0Israel and Hamas\u00a0got underway, but the chaotic nature of the handover of two of the Israelis angered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the extent that he delayed his country's part of the exchange until later in the day.",
      "Israel did start releasing Palestinian detainees from the Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank later Thursday, keeping to its part of the third exchange amid the ongoing ceasefire. Buses carrying the what was expected to be 110 prisoners freed on Thursday were seen leaving the prison about two hours after Netanyahu's spokesman said he had \"instructed to delay the release of the terrorists scheduled to be released today \u2014 until the safe exit of our hostages is guaranteed in the next few days.\"",
      "Netanyahu's office released a subsequent statement saying that, following his demand, ceasefire mediators had \"passed a commitment according to which a safe exit will be guaranteed for our abductees who will be released in the next installments. Israel insists that lessons will be learned and that in future times there will be extra care to return our abductees safely.\"",
      "There were some Palestinians among those being released Thursday who had been accused and, in some cases, convicted of serious crimes against Israelis, including murder. Most of the prisoners were being released and allowed to remain in the West Bank, but some were being sent to third countries, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The Israeli military confirmed that five Thai nationals were also released Thursday by militants in Gaza, as had been expected, as part of a separate agreement.",
      "The first Israeli released early Thursday was female soldier Agam Berger, 20. She was handed over in a relatively orderly fashion amid the ruins of the Jabalia Refugee Camp in northern Gaza. Berger was the final hostage from an unarmed, all-female Israeli military unit that had been working to surveil Gaza.",
      "Seven women from Berger's unit were taken hostage during Hamas' Oct. 7 2023 attack on Israel, which saw militants kill about 1,200 people and take a total of 251 others hostage.",
      "Israel's military response to the attack has killed more than 47,300 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, and decimated the Palestinian territory, displacing virtually all of its population and causing a wide scale humanitarian crisis.",
      "Berger was escorted by militants out of the back of a destroyed building in Jabalia. Wearing an outfit that resembled green military fatigues, she was handed over to members of the Red Cross. Photos shared later by the Israeli military showed her reunited with her parents.",
      "Two other Israeli hostages released Thursday were Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Gadi Moses, 80, who was the oldest of the hostages. All three of the freed hostages had been transferred from Red Cross care to Israeli forces on Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed.",
      "In a joint statement, the IDF and the Israeli Security Agency said Yehoud and Moses, along with the Thai nationals, had \"crossed the border into Israeli territory\" and were on their way to a reception point in southern Israel. The statement said Yehoud and Moses would be reunited with their families there, as Berger was earlier, while the five Thai nationals would be met by officials from Thailand's government.",
      "Video showed Yehoud being transferred to the Red Cross, more than an hour after Berger's release, in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis amid scenes of mayhem. Yehoud and Moses had been held by the militant group Islamic Jihad, which is allied with Hamas.",
      "A huge crowd had gathered in Khan Younis to witness the handover, which took place near the home of deceased Hamas commander Yahya Sinwar. Dozens of armed militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad paraded through the area and the handover of the prisoners was chaotic, with armed militants, photographers and civilians crowding around the hostages as they were moved to the waiting Red Cross vehicles.",
      "Netanyahu released a statement condemning the \"shocking scenes,\" calling the crush of people around the hostages \"another proof of the unimaginable cruelty of the terrorist organization Hamas.\"",
      "\"I demand from the mediators to make sure that such threats will not happen again, and to guarantee the safety of our abductees,\" said Netanyahu.",
      "In its own statement posted online, Hamas called the large crowds, \"a message of determination and defiance raised in the face of this barbaric occupier. It says our people will remain on their land, and are determined to accomplish their project of liberation, return, and self-determination.\"",
      "Hamas did not immediately react to Netanyahu's order to delay the release of 110 Palestinians from Israeli prisons.",
      "Netanyahu's order marked the second delay in the hostage and prisoner swap process laid out by the ceasefire agreement that the Israeli leader blamed on Hamas.",
      "Under to the terms of the deal, Yehoud should have been among the four women released during the second exchange, on Jan. 24. After that release last weekend, the terms of the agreement stipulated that Israel would release a number of Palestinian prisoners from jails and allow Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza, across the Netzarim Corridor, which divides the north and south of the enclave.",
      "When Yehoud wasn't among those released last weekend, Israel said it would not allow Palestinians to cross the Netzarim Corridor. After a quick negotiation process, Hamas agreed to carry out Thursday's previously unscheduled hostage release, to include Yehoud.",
      "In anticipation of the release and according to the new agreement, Israel started allowing Palestinians to cross the Netzarim Corridor into northern Gaza on Monday.",
      "Tens of thousands of people have made their way back to the north, most of them on foot, some finding the ruins of their homes and the remains of loved ones, but also reuniting with family members they haven't been able to see in months.",
      "Hamas and its allies are expected to release a total of 33 Israeli hostages during the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, which took effect on Jan. 19. It is hoped that negotiations on the far more difficult second phase of the ceasefire plan will start to yield progress soon.",
      "The next exchange, which will be the fourth, is scheduled to take place on Saturday. Netanyahu has said that will include the release of male hostages in Gaza.",
      "The release of the three people on Thursday left 82 hostages \u2014 both living and dead \u2014 still in Gaza, according to Israeli officials, including seven dual U.S. nationals: Keith Siegel, 65, from Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, who grew up in Bloomfield, Connecticut; and Edan Alexander, 19, from Tenafly, New Jersey. Four other Americans are believed to have been killed. It remains unclear when any of the Americans might be released.",
      "Senior Hamas political official Bassem Naim told CBS News on Wednesday that the group remained committed to the ceasefire agreement, \"and we will do our best to make it work and will try to overcome the obstacles and challenges, but we expect that the Israelis will keep trying to find reasons to stop implementing the deal, partly to cover up their failure in achieving any of their goals in Gaza, or due to the scenes that showed the will of the people in Gaza.\"",

    "summary": "Neither the White House nor any federal agency has provided evidence for a plan to spend $50 million on condoms for Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "Both President Trump and his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, have claimed that the administration has stopped a plan to spend $50 million on condoms for Gaza as part of the new administration's reevaluation of federal funding.",
      "\"We identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas,\" he said Wednesday. \"They've used them as a method of making bombs.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of State said in 2021 that Hamas and other militant groups have a history of launching incendiary balloons toward Israel. Previous photos taken by The Associated Press in 2020 show masked men attaching incendiary devices to gas-filled condoms and balloons.",
      "However, neither Trump nor officials in his administration have provided evidence of the program they are referring to or whether Hamas has used condoms as a weapon in its war with Israel. The Office of Management and Budget and the U.S. Agency of International Development (USAID) have not responded to questions from CBS News. Available figures from the State Department show that previous shipments for contraception, including condoms, to the Middle East cost far less than $50 million.",
      "Without specifying whether she was referring to a program that included the $50 million figure, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that a federal pause in foreign assistance included preventing $102 million in \"unjustified funding\" to a contractor in Gaza, \"including money for contraception.\"",
      "In an email to reporters, Bruce added that the administration stopped $102 million in funding to the International Medical Corps for Gaza.",
      "In a news release, the International Medical Corps, a global aid organization based in Los Angeles, responded that it has received about $68 million from USAID since Oct. 7, 2023, and has used the funding to operate two field hospitals in Gaza.",
      "\"No US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms,\" the organization's statement said.",
      "The latest available report online on contraceptives and condom shipments from USAID, from fiscal year 2023, states that the agency's only shipment of contraceptives to the Middle East since fiscal year 2019 was made to Jordan and cost $45,680. The shipment contained injectable and oral contraceptives, not condoms.",
      "According to USAID reports, shipments of contraceptives to the Middle East do not happen annually. In the decade before fiscal year 2023, there were only two shipments, including one in fiscal year 2019 and one in fiscal year 2013. In fiscal year 2019, USAID spent a total of $1.1 million on contraceptives for Yemen, with condoms comprising 4% of the total value.",
      "It is unclear whether there were any planned contraceptive shipments to Gaza for fiscal year 2025. But the total value of all contraceptives shipped from the U.S. from USAID was $60 million in fiscal year 2023, which included shipments to 23 countries.",

    "summary": "Communities across the world begin celebrating Lunar New Year on Jan. 29 \u2014 and 2025 marks the Year of the Snake.",
    "story": [
      "The Lunar New Year begins Jan. 29, and communities across the United States and worldwide are holding celebrations.",
      "China's most important holiday \u2014 the Lunar New Year is also widely celebrated in South Korea, Vietnam and other countries where Chinese residents make up significant parts of the national population,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Museum of Asian Art.",
      "In the Chinese zodiac, each new year, according to the lunar calendar, is associated with one of 12 animals, and 2025 marks the Year of the Snake. Different regions in Asia may not follow the same zodiac observed in China, and many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders do not observe the Chinese zodiac, said the art museum.",
      "What is the Lunar New Year?",
      "Lunar New Year begins on the lunar calendar's first new moon and continues through the first full moon, which falls 15 days later.",
      "The new moon usually happens at some point between mid-January and early February \u2014 so the start of the new year begins different days depending on the year.",
      "Each year in the lunar cycle is associated with a particular animal, like the ox, the tiger, the rabbit or, as it was last year, the dragon. The Year of the Snake represents a period of transformation, introspection and growth,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Chinese Language Institute.",
      "The lunar calendar, unlike the Gregorian calendar, uses the phases of the moon to delineate days, weeks and months of the year. A lunar month is the period of time from one new moon to the next \u2014 about 29.5 days \u2014 so the lunar calendar doesn't precisely align with the common one where most months span 30 or 31 days.",
      "The Chinese government\u00a0officially adopted the solar Gregorian calendar\u00a0more than a century ago to align with the rest of the world. Chinese communities have since\u00a0celebrated both the start of the Gregorian year\u00a0on Jan. 1 and then the Lunar New Year, a reflection of cultural roots, some weeks afterward.",
      "The Lunar New Year is also known as the Spring Festival in China, as a nod to the upcoming spring season. In Vietnam, the holiday is known as Tet, and, in Korea, it's called Seollal.",
      "How to celebrate Lunar New Year",
      "Commemorated through 15 days of cultural festivities, Lunar New Year activities are often centered around various forms of art and cuisine, which can be enjoyed at home and in public forums. Experts say the core focus of Lunar New Year celebrations is to bring families together.",
      "Mario Poceski, a professor of Buddhist studies and Chinese religions at the University of Florida who wrote about Lunar New Year celebrations in The Conversation last year, said holiday traditions typically involve cleaning and decorating the house, shopping for gifts and preparing food for family gatherings, like a traditional dinner held on the eve of the new year.",
      "\"Many of the dishes are assigned symbolic meanings,\" Poceski wrote. \"For instance, dumplings are given the shape of gold ingots to invoke good fortune.\"",
      "Exchanging red envelopes, which contain money, is another popular custom that's carried out each Lunar New Year. The envelopes' red color is featured prominently in decorations for the holiday and represents prosperity and good fortune, Poceski said, adding that older members of the family usually gift them to younger members.",
      "Parades, carnivals and gatherings featuring fireworks, dances and other cultural performances are often staples of Lunar New Year celebrations, as individual residences, shops and markets decorate with lanterns or dragons made from red paper in honor of the holiday.",
      "In Beijing, crowds of people filled a park for a \"temple fair\" Wednesday, with some ringing bells and tossing coins into containers shaped like gold bars for good luck, the Associated Press reported.",
      "In Malaysia, revelers rang in the new year with firecrackers in Kuala Lumpur, the capital city, while Russians cheered for a musical procession in Moscow Tuesday night that commenced a 10-day Lunar New Year festival, according to the AP.",
      "One of many U.S. cities paying homage to the holiday, businesses in Denver kicked off the Lunar New Year with spreads of traditional cuisine and merchandise.",
      "\"To celebrate the cultural side, the celebration of just welcoming in a new year, a vibrant year full of good luck and change,\" Mimi Luong, the co-owner of Denver gift shop Truong An Gifts, told CBS News Colorado this week of her family's celebrations and the store's public observance.",
      "\"Every year, we celebrate with decorating our home with lots of red and gold, and eating long noodles so we can have long life, and dumplings so we can have abundance,\" Luong said.",
      "Lunar New Year celebrations traditionally culminate in the Lantern Festival, a massive procession of lights held everywhere\u00a0from Zigong, China, to\u00a0Franklin Square in Philadelphia.",

      "Although China appears less vulnerable to U.S. strong-arming than during Mr. Trump's first term, steep new tariffs would hurt, Wall Street analysts have said.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, noted in a report to investors that the U.S. accounts for only 7% of exports to China. That would give Beijing less scope to retaliate than either Canada or Mexico, which Mr. Trump has threatened with 25% tariffs from Feb. 1, and which are more important markets for U.S. exporters.",

      "A soldier who went missing in action during an aquatic mission in World War II has been accounted for, military officials said Tuesday.",
      "U.S. Army Pfc. Robert L. Bryant, 23, was assigned to Company B, in the 4th Ranger Battalion, as part of a group known as Darby's Rangers, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said. The battalion was trained by Colonel William Darby, who also established a battalion that would later grow into the modern-day United States Army Rangers, the military said. The battalion was active in the Mediterranean Theater, which included Italy, northern Africa and the Middle East.",
      "Bryant was one of 170,000 Allied servicemen who f6participated in Operation AVALANCHE, when forces invaded Italy in a series of amphibious landings between Sept. 9 and Sept. 18, 1943. After making his way ashore, Bryant engaged in fighting near the Chiunzi Pass on the Sorrento Peninsula, the DPAA said. On Sept. 23, he was reported missing in action after encountering a four-man patrol near Pietre, Italy.",
      "Bryant's body was not recovered, and German forces never reported him as a prisoner of war, the DPAA said. The War Department declared him non-recoverable on July 19, 1949. A formal telegram informed his parents he was killed in action, according to a local newspaper clipping shared by the DPAA. He was survived by his parents, five brothers and his wife, according to the clipping. He was awarded a posthumous Purple Heart, according to another news clipping. Bryant's name was recorded on the Walls of the Missing at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery in Nettuno, Italy.",
      "After World War II, the American Graves Registration began working to recover missing American personnel from around the world. In 1947, investigators from the registration found remains in a cemetery in the Italian village of San Nicola. The remains were designated as X-152 Naples, and since the remains could not be associated with nearby casualties, they were interred under that name at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery.",
      "In 2019, a DPAA historian studying American losses during Operation AVALANCHE compiled multiple records that showed Bryant was likely lost near where the X-152 remains had been discovered. In 2022, the remains were disinterred and sent to the DPAA laboratory for identification.",
      "Scientists with the DPAA used anthropological and dental analysis to study the remains. Mitochondrial DNA analysis and circumstantial evidence were also used to confirm the remains as Bryant's. Descendants of World War II Rangers Inc., Associazione Salerno 1943, and the staff of the National Archives at College Park also provided \"research assistance,\" the DPAA said.",
      "Bryant's surviving family members were informed of his identification. A rosette will be placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery to indicate that he has been accounted for, the DPAA said, and he will be buried in April 2025.",

    "story": [
      "Two bereaved parents and 12 fellow members of a fringe Australian religious congregation accused of killing an 8-year-old girl by withholding her diabetes medication were found guilty on Wednesday of manslaughter.",
      "Elizabeth Rose Struhs died on Jan. 7, 2022 at her family's home in Toowoomba in Queensland state after six days without her prescribed insulin shots for type-1 diabetes.",
      "The congregation had prayed and sung for the girl, whose health deteriorated as she lay on a mattress at her home, the BBC reported.",
      "Her father, Jason Richard Struhs, 53, and the leader of the family's religious group called \"The Saints,\" Brendan Luke Stevens, 63, had been charged with the more serious crime of murder, but Queensland Supreme Court Justice Martin Burns found both guilty of her manslaughter.",
      "Burns also found another 12 members of the congregation, including the victim's mother, Kerrie Elizabeth Struhs, 49, and the victim's bother Zachary Alan Struhs, 22, guilty of manslaughter. No one charged escaped conviction.",
      "All 14 were remanded in custody to appear in court for sentencing on Feb. 11. Each faces a potential maximum sentence of life in prison.",
      "The victim's adult sister, Jayde Struhs, told reporters outside court that she welcomed the verdicts.",
      "\"Although we had a good outcome today, I have to acknowledge the system failed to protect Elizabeth in the first place,\" Jayde Struhs said.",
      "\"We are only here today because more wasn't done sooner to protect her or remove her from a credibly unsafe situation in her own home,\" she added.",
      "In finding the father and religious leader not guilty of murder, Burns said the prosecution had failed to prove they had shown reckless indifference to life.",
      "\"There remained a reasonable possibility that, in the cloistered atmosphere of the church which enveloped Struhs \u2026 that he (the father) never came to the full realization Elizabeth would probably die,\" Burns said.",
      "But the judge found the victim's parents had shown an \"egregious departure from the standard of care\" with the support and encouragement of the other defendants.",
      "\"It cannot be doubted that Elizabeth was lovingly cared for in almost every way,\" the judge said, according to the BBC. \"However, due to a singular belief in the healing power of God\u2026 she was deprived of the one thing that would most definitely have kept her alive.\"",
      "Speaking on behalf of all defendants at the trial's opening statements, Stevens argued they held a reasonable belief that God would heal the child. The defendants all represented themselves and each spoke on their own behalf during the closing statements.",
      "Burns urged them all to get lawyers before they are sentenced.",
      "The Saints are not affiliated with an established church in Australia and have roughly two dozen members from three families, according to the BBC.",
      "Toowoomba has long had a \"colorful array of sectarian Christian groups and independent churches of various kinds\", Bernard Doherty, who studies new religious movements, told the BBC.",
      "\"The Saints appear to be one of these small independent churches which form around a few families,\" he told the BBC, adding that little is known about the congregation.",

      "Reasons for rising cases",
      "One in 45 adults in the U.S. are diagnosed with autism, Shih noted \u2014 more than ever before.",
      "\"Autism prevalence has risen due to increased public and professional awareness of autism, broader diagnostic criteria for autism, improved screening tools like the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), and standardized screening processes,\" he stated.",

      "City Councilmember Zac Unger, who was an Oakland firefighter for 27 years, told Fox Digital that four more stations could face closures because of deficits.",
      "\"We have three firehouses currently closed and another four slated to close ... which would represent about 30% of our firefighting capacity here in Oakland, an absolutely catastrophic potential for the city of Oakland,\" Unger said. \"We simply cannot afford to lose 30% of our fire and emergency medical response.\"",

Oakland is no stranger to fire devastation itself. The Oakland firestorm of 1991 killed 25 people, injured 150 and destroyed more than 3,000 homes. Olyer said the 1991 fire fundamentally changed fire department response tactics and how fire crews cooperate with surrounding agencies.",
      "\"That fire was so massive it took a herculean effort by the Bay Area and basically fire departments from all over the western U.S. to control,\" Olyer told Fox Digital. \"You\u2019re seeing the same thing with Los Angeles.

      "7 ways to keep your iPhone safe",
      "Protecting your iPhone requires proactive security measures. By following these seven essential steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of cyber threats and keep your personal information secure.",
      "1. Keep your iPhone updated:\u00a0I can\u2019t say this enough.\u00a0Updating your iPhone regularly is one of the most effective ways to protect it from security threats. Apple frequently releases updates that fix vulnerabilities, including critical zero-day flaws.",
      "2. Download apps only from the App Store: To minimize the risk of installing malware, only download apps from the official App Store. Apple\u2019s strict app review process helps prevent malicious apps from being published, but some threats can still slip through. Always verify app details, check reviews and be cautious about app permissions before installation.",
      "3. Enable lockdown mode for extra protection: For those of you who may be at higher risk, such as journalists or executives,\u00a0Lockdown Mode provides an additional layer of security. This feature limits certain device functionalities to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks. It can be turned on via\u00a0Settings >\u00a0Privacy & Security >\u00a0Lockdown Mode and is especially useful for those concerned about targeted threats.",
      "4. Enable message filtering: Use your device's built-in filtering options to sort messages from unknown senders. This feature allows you to automatically sort messages from unknown senders, easily filter unread messages\u00a0and manage your message inbox more efficiently. Here are steps:",
      "Open\u00a0Settings.Scroll down and click\u00a0Apps.\u00a0Tap\u00a0Messages.Turn on\u00a0Filter Unknown Senders",

      "Tap\u00a0Messages.",
      "Turn on\u00a0Filter Unknown Senders",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Stay cautious of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software:\u00a0Phishing remains one of the most common tactics used by hackers. Be cautious when receiving unsolicited messages or emails on your iPhone, especially those with suspicious links or attachments. Always verify the sender before opening anything. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Review your security and privacy settings: Regularly reviewing your iPhone\u2019s security settings can help you maintain strong protection. You should also review app permissions in\u00a0Settings > Privacy & Security to restrict access to sensitive data, such as location or contacts. Enable\u00a0Face ID or Touch ID for secure access and turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) for Apple ID and other accounts.\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message or authentication app, in addition to your password. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: By reducing your online footprint, you make it harder for cybercriminals to obtain your contact information, potentially preventing them from sending you deceptive phishing texts and emails in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "This iOS vulnerability is a serious reminder of the importance of staying up to date with software updates. If you\u2019re using an iPhone from 2018 or later, make sure you\u2019ve updated to iOS 17.2 or later as soon as possible. Hackers exploited a hidden flaw for over a year, using fake media apps to gain access to devices. While Apple has now patched the issue, the fact that it remained undetected for so long is concerning.",

      "Hackers leverage the trust in Google's services to carry out their attacks. Victims receive seemingly authentic meeting invites via Google Calendar. Upon clicking links within these invites, they are taken to fake web pages that prompt them to input personal data. Once compromised, this information can be used for\u00a0identity theft, financial fraud and unauthorized access to other accounts. Security experts warn that attackers are now using AI to craft highly convincing fake invitations, making it even harder to spot the fraud.

      "The scam begins when people receive a message claiming they have unpaid tolls and may be charged fines.

The message warns about unpaid tolls and the possibility of fines, forcing recipients to act quickly.

      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Use\u00a02FA for your accounts whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of protection by requiring two forms of verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if some details are compromised.",

Include details like the sender\u2019s phone number and any links in the message. Additionally, inform your mobile carrier to help block similar scams.",
      "7) Use a personal data removal service: Employ a reputable data removal service to reduce your online footprint and minimize the risk of scammers obtaining your personal information. These services can help remove your data from various data broker sites, making it harder for scammers to target you with personalized scams.

Your most important accounts \u2013 banking, credit, Social Security \u2013 are all digital. Thieves don\u2019t need to know much about you to steal your identity, just a few pieces of personal information can be enough. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics,\u00a024 million Americans reported identity theft in the past 12 months. In their lifetime,\u00a01 in 3 Americans (more than 110 million people) have experienced identity theft. Here\u2019s the part many people don\u2019t realize: You might have already been a target.

      "\"California is a state that's known to be very soft on crime and squatting is a crime. It doesn't seem to me that much is going to change, especially after the fires, after all of these people have lost their homes. You can't just throw people out on the streets,\" Benichou said.",

      "A decades-old feud over the island nation of Cyprus between Greece and Turkey, both of which have been members of NATO since 1952, has plagued the alliance for over half a century and spill-over conflicts pushed the two countries nearly to the brink of war in the 1990s.",
      "Though relations between Greece and Turkey have become less outwardly hostile in recent years, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s pursuit of regional natural resources coupled with his controversial geopolitical actions in the Middle East and Aegean Sea have long drawn criticism that he is looking to \"recreate\" the Ottoman Empire.",

      "Erdo\u011fan, who has been president of Turkey since 2014, has long been criticized for his aggressive approach in dealing with regional nations like Iraq, Yemen, Libya and Israel, but also his oppressive practices at home that have targeted non-Sunni communities, including Shiites and Christians, journalists, women and Kurds. It's an issue that has not only blocked Turkey from joining the European Union, but has increasingly held geopolitical ramifications for the U.S.",
      "The U.S.\u2019s chief ally in the fight against ISIS in Syria, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), has found itself in Ankara\u2019s crosshairs as it views the Kurdish-affiliated force as being akin to the\u00a0terrorist network, the Kurdistan Workers Party\u00a0(PKK).",

      "\"I assume that it will not be good at all for NATO and would not be good at all for the United States of America to encourage Turkey to create a huge problem in the eastern front of NATO, taking also into account what's happening in the Middle East and what's happening between Russia and Ukraine,\" the defense minster added.",

That will make the visit simpler for those who want to see the painting and ease the experience of other visitors in the rest of the museum, he said.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron gives a speech to announce a multi-year overhaul, long-term investments to modernize the Louvre museum, next to Leonardo da Vinci's painting of the Mona Lisa, at the Louvre Museum, Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2025 in Paris.\u00a0 (Bertrand Guay, Pool via AP)",
      "\"Conditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the \u2018Mona Lisa\u2019 deserves,\" he said.",
      "Leonardo's masterpiece is now being shown behind protective glass in the museum\u2019s largest room, overcrowded with long, noisy lines of visitors eager to take a selfie with the groundbreaking portrait of the woman with the enigmatic smile. That makes some other paintings in the room by Venetian painters like Titian and Veronese go unnoticed by many.",
      "The museum\u2019s big renovation in the 1980s was designed to receive 4 million annual visitors.",
      "Last year, the Louvre received 8.7 million visitors, more than 75% being foreigners mostly from the United States, China and neighboring countries Italy, the U.K., Germany and Spain.",
      "Costly and complex overhaul",
      "Macron said that a new entrance for the Louvre will be created near the Seine by 2031, to be financed by ticket sales, patronage and licensing money from the museum's Abu Dhabi branch.",
      "A design competition will be staged in the coming months, he said. In addition, some new underground rooms will be created to expand the museum.",
      "A French top official said that the cost of the renovation is estimated at 700 to 800 million euros ($730 to 834 million) over the next decade, including half for the creation of the new entrance. The official couldn't be named in line with the French presidency\u2019s customary practices.",
      "Macron said that ticket prices would be raised for foreign visitors from outside the European Union, up from 22 euros ($23) now. He promised the museum would be safer and more comfortable for both the public and employees.",
      "Comparing the project to Notre Dame's recent reopening, Macron said that \"the redesigned Louvre, restored and expanded, will become the epicenter of art history for our country and beyond.\"",
      "Half the Louvre's budget is being financed by the French government, including the wages of the 2,200 employees.",
      "The other half is provided by private funds including ticket sales, earnings from restaurants, shops and bookings for special events, as well as patrons and other partners.",
      "Water leaks and other damage",
      "The renovation announcement came after Louvre Director Laurence des Cars expressed her concerns in a note to Culture Minister Rachida Dati earlier this month saying that the museum is threatened by \"obsolescence.\"",
      "According to the document first released by French newspaper Le Parisien, she warned about the gradual degradation of the building because of water leaks, temperature variations and other issues \"endangering the preservation of artworks.\"",

      "The pyramid that serves at the museum\u2019s entrance, unveiled in 1989 as part of late President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s project, now appears outdated. The place isn't properly insulated from the cold and the heat, and it tends to amplify noise, making the space uncomfortable for both the public and the staff, des Cars said.",
      "In addition, the museum suffers from a lack of food options and restroom facilities, she said."

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 23:42:24 GMT",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order issuing tariffs on goods coming into the U.S. from Canada, Mexico and China, raising the risk of a trade war with America\u2019s closest trading partners and threatening to drive up prices on everything from cars to avocados.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order issuing tariffs on goods coming into the U.S. from Canada, Mexico and China, raising the risk of a trade war with America\u2019s closest trading partners and threatening to drive up prices on everything from cars to avocados.",
      "The only products exempt from the tariffs are Canadian energy products, which would have a lower tariff rate of 10% to \"minimize any disruptive effects we might have on gasoline and home heating oil prices,\" said the senior administration official.",
      "The U.S. will begin collecting the tariffs on Canadian goods on Tuesday. It is unclear when the tariffs on Mexico and China would go into effect.",
      "The White House said in a statement that the tariffs were being implemented to pressure the three countries into stopping the flow of fentanyl and immigrants into the U.S. and would remain in place until \"the crisis is alleviated.\"",
      "\"We need to protect Americans, and it is my duty as President to ensure the safety of all,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social announcing he had signed the tariffs. \"I made a promise on my Campaign to stop the flood of illegal aliens and drugs from pouring across our Borders, and Americans overwhelmingly voted in favor of it.\"",
      "More than 107,000 people died from drug overdose in 2023, with nearly 70% of those deaths from opioids, including fentanyl. Nearly all of the 21,900 pounds of fentanyl seized in 2024 was at the southern border, with just 43 pounds of fentanyl seized at the northern border, according to data from Customs and Border Protection.",
      "It was unclear what specific actions the U.S. was looking for the three countries to take in order to lift the tariffs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a wide range of metrics,\u201d said a senior administration official during a Saturday call with reporters about the tariffs.",
      "\u201cIn Donald Trump\u2019s golden age, we will have only legal immigration and we will have zero Americans dying from Chinese, slash Mexican, slash Canadian fentanyl,\u201d the official said.",
      "Economists across the political spectrum expect tariffs to increase what consumers pay for a range of goods, including vehicles, electronics, produce and lumber. Tariffs are paid by companies importing goods into the U.S., similar to a tax. A range of businesses from homebuilders to alcohol producers warned of the negative economic impact the tariffs would have for businesses and consumers following the tariff announcement.",
      "\u201cImposing additional tariffs on these imports will lead to higher material costs, which will ultimately be passed on to home buyers in the form of increased housing prices,\u201d said Carl Harris, chair of the National Association of Home Builders.",
      "\u201cFurther supply chain disruptions from increased tariffs coupled with increased demand for materials could also hinder rebuilding efforts in areas affected by natural disasters, which you have pledged to help rebuild as quickly as possible,\u201d Harris added.",
      "While some businesses will look to source goods elsewhere, others with no alternatives will be forced to pay the fees. That means U.S. grocery stores will shoulder higher costs for fruits and vegetables grown in Mexico; homebuilders will pay more for Canadian lumber; and automakers will have to pay a tariff each time a component crosses the northern or southern border, which happens repeatedly during the production of a single vehicle.",
      "Companies will have to decide whether to pass these higher costs to consumers or absorb them, which would dent profits or require cuts to protect their margins. The implications could be wide-reaching across the U.S. economy, in part because American consumers and businesses imported more goods from Mexico than any other country.",
      "\"Tariffs on all imported goods from Mexico and Canada \u2014\u00a0especially on\u00a0ingredients and inputs that aren\u2019t available in the U.S. \u2014 could lead to higher consumer prices and retaliation against U.S. exporters,\" said the Consumer Brands Association, which represents makers of packaged food and health products.",
      "Trump made tariffs central to his campaign pitch for improving an economy that many voters cited as their reason for returning him to the White House. He has argued the levies would protect American industries from unfair competition by making foreign goods pricier and encouraging companies to manufacture in the U.S. He has also proposed using revenue from tariffs to pay for other policy priorities and deploying them as a negotiating tool.",
      "\"This is a beautiful, beautiful example of promises made, promises kept by President Trump,\" said the senior administration official.",
      "But economists have found the tariffs Trump imposed on China during his first term did little to accomplish those goals. Instead, they drove up prices for many imports, led to a net loss of manufacturing jobs and reduced corporate investments. Nearly all the revenue collected from Trump\u2019s previous tariffs on China went to payments he sent to American farmers to offset their losses from tariffs China imposed in response. The levies also didn\u2019t generate significant concessions from Beijing, which has failed to meet many of its commitments under a trade deal negotiated during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "The United Steelworkers International, which has pushed for trade reforms to protect U.S. steel workers, warned that the sweeping tariffs could have a negative impact on workers.",
      "\"These tariffs don\u2019t just hurt Canada. They threaten the stability of industries on both sides of the border,\" said David McCall, president of the United Steelworkers International.",
      "The president\u2019s latest tariffs on Canada and Mexico threaten to upend one of his signature trade pacts, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Trump had touted the deal as a victory, as it largely allowed products to move between the three countries tariff-free, much as they\u2019d done for decades under the NAFTA agreement that the USMCA replaced. The current trade deal isn\u2019t up for review until July 2026, but the new tariffs could throw it into jeopardy much sooner.",
      "\u201cThis is not him changing some other administration\u2019s work. This is him changing his administration\u2019s work,\u201d said Francisco Sanches, an international trade lawyer with Holland and Knight\u00a0and a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce for trade during the Obama administration.",
      "The White House said Trump would be issuing the tariffs under the the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Despite the USMCA, Trump said he has the legal authority to regulate imports during a national emergency, which he declared at the southern border on the first day of his second term.",
      "While most of Trump\u2019s tariff threats during his campaign focused on China, he has ratcheted up his focus on Canada and Mexico since he was elected. Both countries vowed to retaliate, which would make American products less competitive within their borders and hurt U.S. businesses that sell there. Cars, oil and gas, electronics, industrial equipment and agricultural products are among the top U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in these types of circumstances when the United States has put tariffs on another country is an attempt by our trading partners to target really sensitive stakeholders and locations,\u201d said Greta Peisch, a trade lawyer at Wiley Rein who was general counsel for the U.S. Trade Representative during the Biden administration.\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re very savvy and understand how our process works and what makes an impact potentially.\u201d",
      "The senior administration officials said there is a \"retaliation clause\" in the executive order issuing the tariffs where if any country chooses to retaliate the U.S. will take further action.",
      "A trade war among the three countries would reduce the economic growth for all of them but could especially impact Mexico,\u00a0according to an analysis by the Peterson Institute.",
      "\u201cFor Mexico, a 25% tariff would be catastrophic. Moreover, the economic decline caused by the tariff could increase the incentives for Mexican immigrants to cross the border illegally into the US\u2014directly contradicting another Trump administration priority,\u201d the report said.",
      "The U.S. auto industry is among the most vulnerable to tariff impacts. For decades, its supply chains have been heavily intertwined with America\u2019s neighbors to the north and south. As vehicles and components cross borders multiple times during the production process, repeated 25% levies could quickly drive up vehicle costs.",
      "The U.S. also depends on food products from Mexico, one of the top suppliers of tomatoes, avocados, berries and peppers. Rising food prices have been a top concern for consumers and voters, with grocery costs up around 25% over the past four years \u2014 an issue Trump hammered on the campaign trail. The tariffs could also drive up the prices of beer and alcohol imported from Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply concerned that U.S. tariffs on imported spirits from Canada and Mexico will significantly harm all three countries and lead to a cycle of retaliatory tariffs that negatively impacts our shared industry,\u201d the Distilled Spirts Council said in a statement.",
      "After his earlier threats, Mexico threatened retaliatory tariffs on American goods sold there, which total around $360 billion. That could hurt U.S. businesses selling to Mexican consumers.",
      "Along with immigration, Trump and lawmakers have raised concerns that China could be using Mexico as a back door into the U.S. to avoid paying tariffs. Mexico has seen a surge in manufacturers relocating there from China as a way to avoid the tariffs Trump put on China during his first term.\u00a0Investment deals announced by Chinese companies in Mexico have surged over the last few years, according to data compiled by the research firm Rhodium Group.",
      "The tariffs on Canada are expected to drive up prices of Canadian lumber, known for being lighter and easier to work with, said Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist for wood products at Fastmarkets.",
      "Canadian lumber mills have already been struggling from previous duties imposed by the U.S. in recent years and the destruction of millions of acres of forest from a pine beetle infestation. More tariffs could hobble the industry further, he said.",
      "\u201cConsumers are going to pay for that in some capacity because in the end, you have less supply available in the market, and prices are going to be somewhat higher on the margin,\u201d said Jalbert.",
      "That could keep pressure on home prices that are already far out of reach for millions of Americans, the National Association of Home Builders has warned.",
      "The tariffs could also drive up gas prices, as crude is among Canada\u2019s top exports to the U.S., hampering Trump\u2019s ambitious vow to halve energy costs in his first 12 months."

      "The sweeping tariff could make more expensive a host of items that the U.S. imports from its neighbors. Among the common Mexican imports that will now get pricier to bring into the country: fruits, vegetables, beer, liquor and electronics. And from Canada: potatoes, grains, lumber and steel.",
      "EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco said agricultural products are a major category of trade between the U.S., China, and Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe tend to think a lot about merchandise goods as being automotive goods, furniture goods and these types of heavy equipment goods. But we should not forget that we also do a lot of trade on the agricultural front,\" Daco said. \"So we could see upward pressure for meat prices, upward pressure for dairy prices. Those are the types of categories that directly hit consumers wallets.\u201d",
      "That would compound already high grocery prices, which are up 28% over the last five years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",

      "For U.S. refineries that are specifically tuned to Canadian oil, any costs associated with switching imports could lead to more expensive gas prices at the pump.",
      "Daco said imposing tariffs \"on large trading partners would have severe economic consequences\" for the U.S., Mexico and Canada, \"and could lead to an environment that is both a higher inflation environment and also a lower growth environment because of the importance of the trade with both of these economies.\""

      "Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll on Friday refused a Justice Department order that he assist in the firing of agents involved in Jan. 6 riot cases, pushing back so forcefully that some FBI officials feared he would be dismissed, multiple current and former FBI officials told NBC News.",
      "The Justice Department ultimately did not dismiss Driscoll, the head of the bureau\u2019s Newark field office who is temporarily serving as its acting director.",
      "Kash Patel, President Trump's pick for FBI director and a critic of the bureau's investigations of Trump and Jan. 6th rioters, will take over if he is confirmed by the Senate. During his confirmation hearing on Thursday, Patel testified under oath that no FBI officials would be retaliated against.",
      "\u201cAll FBI employees will be protected against political retribution,\u201d Patel told Senators.",
      "Just over twenty-four hours later, Driscoll sent a memo to the FBI workforce explaining that Emil Bove, the acting Deputy Attorney General and Trump's former defense lawyer, had ordered him to remove eight senior FBI executives. Driscoll also said he had been told to turn over the names of every FBI employee involved in investigating Jan. 6 rioters.",
      "Driscoll stated that the eight executives had been forced out but did not say in the memo whether he would turn over the broader list of Jan. 6-related FBI investigators \u2014 a list that he noted encompasses thousands of its employees, including him.",
      "\u201cAs we\u2019ve said since the moment we agreed to take on these roles, we are going to follow the law, follow FBI policy, and do what\u2019s in the best interest of the workforce and the American people \u2014 always,\u201d Driscoll, a former member of the FBI\u2019s elite hostage rescue team, wrote.",

      "It\u2019s not known whether anyone other than the eight senior FBI executives have been separated from the bureau.\u00a0One official familiar with the matter said that top Trump administration officials have made it clear that they want at least some of the FBI agents who pursued Jan. 6 cases to be fired, just as multiple DOJ prosecutors involved with the Jan. 6 prosecutions were fired.",
      "The official said the Trump administration wants this to happen quickly but has been told by FBI officials that misconduct allegations at the bureau involve a formal review process.",
      "The accounts of Driscoll\u2019s actions shed new light on a chaotic series of events over the last 48 hours that began with the news that the Trump administration was seeking to purge the top ranks of the FBI\u2019s career civil servants.",
      "\u201cLate this afternoon, I received a memo from the acting Deputy Attorney General notifying me that eight senior FBI executives are to be terminated by specific dates, unless these employees have retired beforehand,\" Driscoll wrote. \"I have been personally in touch with each of these impacted employees.\"",
      "He said in the memo that he had also been directed to provide the DOJ by noon on Tuesday a list of all FBI employees involved in Capitol riot cases, and also those involved in a case against a Hamas leader.",
      "No one contacted by NBC News had a sense of the new administration\u2019s interest in the Hamas case, but the focus on Jan. 6 was clear. The Trump administration apparently believes that all of the Jan. 6 cases should not have been brought.",
      "Since it was the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history, thousands of FBI personnel were involved, as Driscoll acknowledged in his memo.",
      "\u201cWe understand that this request encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have supported these investigative efforts,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am one of those employees, as is acting Deputy Director (Rob) Kissane.\u201d",

      "MAE SOT, Thailand \u2014 For people fleeing the conflict in Myanmar, the injuries are often more than just physical.",
      "Four years after a military coup that has morphed into a grinding civil war, experts say there is a growing mental health crisis in the Southeast Asian nation, made worse by the junta\u2019s atrocities against civilians and a humanitarian disaster that has left more than 3 million people displaced.",
      "They find some relief at the Mae Tao Clinic on the outskirts of Mae Sot, a border town in neighboring Thailand.",
      "Each morning, hundreds of Burmese arrive at the clinic, waiting to see a doctor, receive vaccinations or get a prenatal checkup. Some are living in refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, while others have jobs as migrant workers or have crossed into Thailand illegally.",
      "The donor-funded clinic, which opened in the 1980s with only four beds, has since evolved into a full-fledged primary health facility that offers a range of free services, including psychiatric care. It says its 700 doctors, nurses, medics and volunteers treat 120,000 people a year, a number that may increase after a freeze on foreign aid by the Trump administration that threatens to close U.S.-supported health care facilities treating Myanmar refugees in Thai border camps.",
      "Those who have fled Myanmar \u201chave so many traumas,\u201d said Thein, a Myanmar refugee who is one of the psychiatric care unit\u2019s two Burmese-speaking psychiatrists.",
      "On Tuesdays and Fridays, the two days the unit is open, Thein walks past the bustling outpatient wards and crosses a tranquil bamboo garden to his office. It is a single-story cement building painted light blue, with the windows and doors covered in translucent black film to protect patients\u2019 privacy.",
      "Thein, 36, sees about 10 patients a day in one-on-one sessions. They include rebel soldiers injured on the front lines as well as political refugees and migrant workers.",
      "\u201cThey have flashbacks and nightmares at night and they cannot sleep,\u201d said Thein, who has been in Mae Sot for a year and asked not to be identified by his full name to protect his safety and that of his family.",
      "While the clinic has social workers and counselors for patients with milder mental health issues, Thein works with the most serious cases.",
      "\u201cI can give counseling to them, like mindfulness or meditation or breathing,\u201d he said. But often his patients also require medication, which the clinic provides for free.",
      "Thein said he sometimes struggles with anxiety himself stemming from the abuse he received from the junta.",
      "Like most of his patients, Thein\u2019s life took a turn on Feb. 1, 2021, when the Myanmar military \u2014 which has ruled the former British colony for much of its history since it gained independence in 1948 \u2014 overthrew democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Peaceful protests broke out immediately, to which the new military government responded with deadly violence.",
      "According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a nonprofit group that has documented killings and arrests since the coup, the junta has killed at least 6,000 people and arrested more than 28,000. On Friday, Myanmar state media reported that the state of emergency that has been in place since the coup had been extended for another six months, further delaying promised elections.",
      "Though the junta remains in charge, its hold on power has slipped in the face of a coordinated offensive by ethnic rebel groups that have fought the Myanmar military for decades. In the past year the government has lost control of vast swaths of territory around the country, creating instability along Myanmar\u2019s borders with Thailand, India, China and others.",
      "\u201cI want to help my friends, but I don\u2019t want to kill people,\u201d Thein said. \u201cSo I treated the wounded people or wounded soldiers.\u201d",
      "Thein was arrested in 2022 on suspicion of helping the resistance and sent to Myanmar\u2019s notorious Insein Prison.",
      "\u201cThey tortured me with a whip. I think six people beat me during the interrogation. It was really scary,\u201d Thein recalled, as he raised his hands around his head to demonstrate how he tried to protect himself.",
      "Thein was released after a year of detention. Fearing another arrest, he left his life in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city, and fled to Thailand.",
      "Mae Sot has long been a place for Burmese to seek sanctuary, but it is an uneasy refuge. It is filled with people waiting for resettlement, living with constant anguish while facing the risk of arrest and deportation.",
      "Every month, Burmese who lack the documents needed to stay in Thailand legally have to pay local police 300 baht ($9) to obtain a card that prevents them from being detained or deported, but many find this fee unaffordable.",
      "\u201cSome patients were arrested on the way to the clinic by the Thai police because they have no documents,\u201d Thein said.",
      "The clinic\u2019s founder, Cynthia Maung, was also a doctor in Myanmar before she fled in 1988 amid a crackdown by the military government on a pro-democracy uprising.",
      "\u201cI think the struggles now and back then are very similar,\u201d she said.",
      "Mental health is often neglected in Myanmar, where Thein was trained. According to the World Health Organization, as of 2019 there were only 117 psychiatrists and two mental health hospitals in the country of 54 million people.",
      "Shwe Zin Aung is one of Thein\u2019s patients and has been struggling with bipolar disorder for a decade.",
      "The 35-year-old teacher arrived in Mae Sot from Myanmar\u2019s capital city, Naypyidaw, in early December, following in her brother\u2019s footsteps. She said that in addition to free medication, the clinic provided her with a safe place to talk about her feelings.",
      "Though she said she had not personally faced any abuse from the junta, \u201cit is so frustrating to see them brutally shoot the protesters,\u201d she said.",
      "Back home, Thein and his patients had respectable careers and stable lives, but here they are stateless \u2014 as are more than half a million people in Thailand, most of them from Myanmar.",
      "Though Bangkok has not ratified the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention and does not officially recognize refugees, Thai authorities have largely tolerated the influx of people from Myanmar, even before the coup in 2021.",
      "In October, the government of Thailand said it would grant citizenship to nearly 500,000\u00a0long-term residents as well as some children born in the country in an effort to address their legal status.",
      "Though her clinic is well known in Myanmar, Maung, 65, has not been in the country for almost four decades.",
      "When she first arrived in Thailand at the age of 28, Muang assumed she would return home in a few months once the political environment stabilized. But months soon turned into years.",
      "She felt newly hopeful in November 2020, when Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy was elected to a second consecutive term in a landslide. The military coup took place within three months, shattering Maung\u2019s dreams.",
      "Among those driven out of Myanmar by the coup, she said, were psychiatrists and psychologists who came to Mae Sot and have enabled the clinic to expand its services to help others struggling with displacement.",
      "\u201cSometimes, some people feel that this way is usual,\u201d Maung said, \u201cbut this is not normal.\u201d"

      "ASHBURN, Va. \u2014 It was the only house in the cul-de-sac with a skating rink in the backyard.",
      "When the freeze set in, Peter Livingston would anchor two-by-fours in the ground behind the house, fill the space with water and create a rink where his figure skating daughters, Alydia and Everly, could practice their jumps and lutzes, a neighbor said.",
      "But the real home ice for the girls was the Ashburn Ice House. Their mother, Donna Livingston, was a fixture at the early-morning practices where her daughters trained with world-class figure skaters like Inna Volyanskaya.",
      "They were known online as \"The Ice Skating Sisters,\" and when they crisscrossed the country for competitions and camps in places like Boston, Seattle and Austin, Texas, their parents went with them, friends and neighbors said.",
      "It was no different when Alydia and Everly were invited to participate in a prestigious training camp following the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas.",
      "For their trip home, the four boarded American Eagle Flight 5342, which collided with a Black Hawk helicopter Wednesday night over the Potomac River in Washington. Investigators are still trying to determine what caused the crash.",
      "Alydia, 11, and Everly, 14, died with their parents and 60 other people on the doomed flight. The accident also claimed the lives of three soldiers on the Army helicopter.",
      "Days later, on the Livingston's cul-de-sac, the grief was still fresh to 13-year-old Helen Li, who played with Alydia and Everly on the rare occasions they weren't training or competing. To her, the younger sister was just \"Lydia.\"",
      "Everly was shy and reserved compared to Alydia, according to a tribute posted on a Facebook page called The Skating Lesson.",
      "Yet Everly \"came alive on the ice \u2014 becoming a sectional champion at the intermediate and juvenile levels,\" it said, adding that Alydia \u201cwas the youngest skater on the airplane and a rising ice dancer.\u201d",
      "Alydia had recently teamed up with a new partner and \u201cwas known for her vivacious personality and strong desire to improve on the ice \u2014 no matter the critique,\u201d the social media post said.",
      "Her new partner, 15-year-old Matt Jacoby, released a statement through his mother, Liz Abercrombie, saying \"words cannot express\" his sorrow at the loss of his partner and friends on Flight 5342.",
      "He said Alydia's \"passion for skating and bubbly personality brightened the rink and she will be greatly missed.\"",
      "Abercrombie, in a brief telephone interview with NBC News, said the Livingstons were \"a loving family who dedicated their lives to their girls and ice skating.\u201d",
      "Donna and Peter Livingston were described in The Skating Lesson tribute as \"among the most devoted parents\" who were \"trying to manage raising two skaters.\" They had spent many nights in hotels recently while splitting time between New Jersey, Michigan and Virginia. Peter \u201cloved filming his girls anywhere and everywhere,\u201d while Donna \u201cwill be remembered for her optimistic nature,\u201d the post said.",

      "At the girls' home rink, a memorial of flowers, balloons, candles and cards continued to expand days after the tragedy, and therapy dogs were brought in to help skaters deal with the deaths of their friends.",
      "Zere Scholz, whose 8-year-old daughter skates at the rink, said that while Everly and Alydia had very different personalities, they were both hard-working. She described Alydia as \"a little firecracker\" \u2014 \"funny and full of ideas, energetic\" \u2014 while Everly was \"a little reserved,\" but kind, happy and very dedicated to ice skating.",
      "Over the summer, Everly posted online that she had surgery after injuring her right knee with a meniscus tear.

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 20:05:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Ken Martin, the longtime leader of the state Democratic Party organization in Minnesota, will be the new Democratic National Committee chair after winning Saturday\u2019s election, as his party looks to turn the page and recover from a dismal 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Ken Martin, the longtime leader of the state Democratic Party organization in Minnesota, will be the new Democratic National Committee chair after winning Saturday\u2019s election, as his party looks to turn the page and recover from a dismal 2024.",
      "Martin had been the front-runner from the beginning of the race, leveraging his relationships with the more than 400 voting members of the DNC that he forged over more than a decade of work inside the institutional Democratic Party.\u00a0And those relationships proved essential, as he clinched a majority of the voting members on the first ballot, more than 100 votes above the second place finisher, Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler.",
      "The race hinged more on the candidates\u2019 organizing and fundraising resumes than on their postures regarding the ideological soul of the party, as it did in 2017, after President Donald Trump\u2019s previous election win. Martin was the more experienced hand with deep party relationships, Wikler had been at the center of some of Democrats\u2019 highest-profile races in recent years, and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley had unique electoral and government experience.",
      "Addressing the DNC membership after his victory, Martin called for party unity after a relatively quiet race that got chippy at times, and for the party to focus on opposing President Donald Trump.",
      "\"We have one team, the Democratic Party, and we have one fight. The fight\u2019s not in here, it\u2019s out there,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe fight right now is against Donald Trump and the billionaires who bought this country.\u201d",
      "Now, Martin will be tasked with helping to pull Democrats out of the hole where they ended 2024, a devastating election cycle that left them without any of the levers of power in Washington. But while Martin will help to lead the party forward, Democrats aren\u2019t necessarily looking to him to be the party\u2019s pre-eminent leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a party out of power, so we don\u2019t have a leader. And I think broadly, philosophically, someone could say that this person would be our party leader. That\u2019s not really true,\u201d said Matt Corridoni, a veteran Democratic strategist who has worked for the committee in the past and also worked on a previous race for DNC chair.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that anyone has ever really looked to the most recent DNC chairs and said, that person was a leader of our party,\u201d Corridoni continued, before framing the role of the DNC chair as nailing down the \"nuts and bolts of operating the party.\"",
      "\u201cWhat this person will really be tasked with at the end of the day is planning a primary process, making sure that the state parties have the funding and infrastructure they need to be successful, and planning our next convention,\" he said.",
      "That notion is not lost on Martin, who framed the chair role during his campaign as doing the important party-building work that will set the foundation for the Democratic candidates to use up and down the ballot, while helping to set the message as the party takes on Trump.",
      "\"Donald Trump, the Republican Party, this is a new DNC. We are not going to sit back and not take you on when you fail the American people,\" Martin said during a session with reporters shortly after his victory.",
      "\"The role of the party is not just to go out there and build the infrastructure,\" Martin added. \"It's also to make sure we're defining them and we're out there making sure the American people know what the stakes of not only these coming elections are, but what's happening in this country.\"",
      "During that session with reporters, Martin said that his first priorities as chair will be looking \"at the state of the party, the finances,\" looking at the party's \"contracts\" and starting a \"post-election review process.\"",
      "\"We don't call it a post-mortem or an autopsy, because our party's not dead. It's still kicking right?\" Martin said.",
      "\"The reality is,\" he added, \"what we need to do right now is really start to get a handle around what happened last election cycle. We know that we lost ground with Latino voters, we know we lost ground with women and younger voters and of course working-class voters. We don't know the how and why yet.\"",
      "The front-runners were largely in agreement during the race about what the DNC needed to do to move forward: ensure the party has the resources to contest every race across every state and territory, adopt a permanent organizational posture to help build relationships between the party and its potential voters, and take a postmortem look at Democratic Party's spending, after it fell short at the presidential level despite significantly outspending Trump and Republicans. All of the candidates also talked about pushing to bring their message to new media outlets while highlighting new messengers in part as a way to fix a deeper problem \u2014 Democratic underperformance with young and Hispanic voters.",
      "Throughout the race to succeed outgoing DNC chair Jaime Harrison, Martin framed himself as the experienced choice to take the reins of the party organization. Over a decade of experience leading the Minnesota party, he has regularly touted his unbeaten record in statewide races, arguing his state has been a Democratic beacon of hope while the party has taken important losses in other Midwestern \u201cblue wall\u201d states.",
      "As head of the Association of State Democratic Chairs and a vice chair of the national party committee, combined with his record, Martin had developed relationships with party members to help him shore up the votes needed to emerge victorious despite a last-minute push from Wikler.",
      "Those relationships helped Martin amass about 200 public endorsements from the voting body of the DNC, far more than any other candidate. And while Wikler touted support from top congressional Democrats, Martin snagged high-profile endorsements of his own, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was the Democrats\u2019 2024 vice presidential nominee, and Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the powerful congressman who helped jumpstart Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential bid.",
      "During a brief address to the DNC\u2019s Poverty Council Thursday afternoon, Martin pointed to Trump\u2019s implication that a focus on diversity, equity and inclusion programs was to blame for Wednesday night\u2019s tragic aircraft collision in Washington, D.C.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to unify quickly as a party because the stakes have never been higher for this nation. What we\u2019ve seen these last two weeks is despicable. They\u2019re shattering people\u2019s lives, they\u2019re destroying communities already two weeks into it,\u201d Martin said, before going on to describe his childhood being raised by a young mother in poverty, \u201cin and out of shelters.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur fight right now is for working people throughout this country,\u201d Martin added. \u201cThink about Donald Trump\u2019s administration, their cabinet is worth $460 billion. Not the top 1%, the top 100th of 1%. You think they give a damn about people like me, people like you or working people and families like mine that are struggling? \u2026 Our fight right now is a fight for the future and it\u2019s a fight for workers and it\u2019s a fight for people who are trying to get into the middle class.\u201d",
      "Wikler fell short despite a late push and endorsements from major Democratic Party figures including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, along with governors like Kentucky\u2019s Andy Beshear, Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer and Kansas\u2019 Laura Kelly. Wikler also secured the support of major unions including the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the National Education Association, American Federation of Teachers and Service Employees International Union.",
      "In a statement congratulating Martin, Wikler called on \"everyone who supported me to join me in working with Chair Martin to ensure that the Democratic Party rises to this moment of crisis in our country.\u00a0\"",
      "The race lacked the deep ideological divide of the last competitive race for chair in 2017, when the party had to pick up the pieces of a disappointing election loss as well as a party fractured by the hacking and release of internal party emails that exacerbated the divide between progressives and establishment Democrats.",
      "Even though the race didn't have the fireworks of some other past races, Harrison took to the microphone multiple times before Martin's election to issue vague warnings against those who were bullying DNC members for their vote.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve heard over the course of the last few days, while we were here, that people have been threatened about their vote, people have been intimidated by their vote, that folks have been having donors called and say they\u2019re going to pull funding because of their vote,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFolks, in this party there will be no tolerance for that type of behavior,\u201d Harrison said.",
      "Now that Democrats have a chairman, Rev. Leah Daughtry told NBC News shortly before the vote that the new chair \"has to become the standard bearer, the visionary that can help our party move from the mat into the place we need to be to win back voters and to win elections in the days to come.\u201d",
      "\"Now we have the complete team, and I think we\u2019re ready,\" she said. She referenced Trump's posts on social media and statements after the tragic plane and helicopter crash in the Potomac River earlier this week.",
      "\"Instead of him being able to bring our country together, he created more division,\" Daughtry said of Trump, putting more \"focus\" behind Democrats' efforts to oppose him."

    "story": [
      "Nivida, an immigrant from Honduras who is in her late 20s, expects to give birth to a boy in April. What would normally be a time of excitement for her growing family is instead shadowed by a deep fear that they will be torn apart.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order restricting birthright citizenship could mean their baby would be left without the same rights as their other child, who was born in Louisiana as an American citizen.",
      "Nivida is from Honduras and her husband is from Mexico, they currently live in Louisiana. Her husband has an open application for a special visa for victims of a crime that could eventually lead to lawful permanent residency, a process that could take years, according to Nivida and court documents from the advocacy group representing her case. She had an initial asylum application in the immigration court that was recently dismissed, according to Nivida the court documents, but is still able to file another asylum case with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want them to take away the citizenship of innocent babies born here, it shouldn\u2019t matter the status of their parents, their race, their color, they shouldn\u2019t be discriminated against,\u201d said Nivida in Spanish, who asked that her full name not be used out of fear of immigration reprisal and her safety. \u201cI believe violating the protection that the Constitution gives to a child born here is violating his or her rights as an individual.\u201d",
      "Last week, the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, the immigrant services organization CASA and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown Law filed a lawsuit on behalf of five pregnant women and ASAP and CASA\u2019s members against Trump\u2019s executive order limiting birthright citizenship, which he called \u201cProtecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship.\u201d The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit.",
      "About two dozen states have also filed lawsuits against the Trump administration contesting the order, which experts say violates the 14th Amendment, which says, \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d",
      "Nivida, who is a member of ASAP, said she decided to speak out on behalf of the thousands of pregnant women and their babies who will be impacted by the order if it\u2019s allowed to take effect in late February. She and others came to the United States seeking protection and stability but now find their unborn babies\u2019 futures uncertain, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Trump\u2019s executive order attempts to limit birthright citizenship to people who have at least one parent who is a United States citizen or permanent resident. It also states that those born to parents who are in the country legally, but temporarily, will no longer be automatically guaranteed citizenship, including high-skill work visas like the H1B and student visas like the F1. But legal experts say the true scope of the order is unclear and could lead some children to be temporarily stateless.",
      "Meny, a pregnant asylum seeker from Honduras who is also a member of ASAP, said the order \u201ccreates a lot of uncertainty, a lot of fear\u201d and has taken an emotional toll on her family.",
      "She and her partner both have open asylum cases claiming political persecution before USCIS, have been legally working in California and are \u201cvery grateful to this country because really we have had so many great opportunities here,\u201d said Meny, who is in her mid-30s and asked that her full name not be used out of fear of immigration reprisal.",
      "\u201cThe news is very shocking, we really hope it doesn\u2019t come to be,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cAs moms, of course we want what\u2019s best for our children. It\u2019s a great concern.\u201d",
      "Meny, who is due in July, said she feels desperate thinking of her baby\u2019s future and the rights her child may not have as Trump enacts his anti-immigration agenda. Meny said that as an asylum seeker fleeing prosecution, returning to her home country is not an option.",
      "\u201cBeing immigrants doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re enemies of this country. The majority of us come here for reasons of survival,\u201d she said.",
      "Liza and her husband, who are Russian immigrants, are expecting their first child in May. She heard from a friend that Trump was considering restricting birthright citizenship, but thought, \u201cno, it can\u2019t be true\u201d as she understood the right to be a part of the U.S. Constitution.",
      "\u201cMy husband and I were shocked that it actually happened,\u201d said Liza, who has asked that her full name not be used for fear of immigration reprisal, adding that the two couldn\u2019t wrap their minds around the fact \u201cthat this is going to be reality.\u201d",
      "Liza, one of the five women who are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said her husband has an open asylum case because of persecution in Russia and she is currently on a student visa while getting her master\u2019s degree. Liza, who is in her late 20s, said she fears her baby will be left stateless if her child is denied birthright citizenship as they do not feel safe applying for Russian citizenship for their baby as asylum seekers fleeing Russia.

    "title": "RFK Jr.'s insistence that the government ignores chronic disease is misguided",
    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "In his confirmation hearings, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.  said infectious diseases get more funding than chronic diseases. Government records suggest the opposite.",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made clear in testimony before the Senate this week that if confirmed as Health and Human Services secretary, his focus would be on chronic diseases over infectious ones.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve devoted all of these dollars to infectious disease and to drug development and very little to chronic disease,\u201d Kennedy said Thursday before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.",
      "Kennedy described himself as uniquely positioned to \u201cend the chronic disease epidemic\u201d in the United States, which he blamed for high health care costs. His opening statements mentioned rising rates of diabetes, cancer, asthma and obesity as issues that should be prioritized, along with chronic disease rates among children. (Although Kennedy stated that 66% of kids have a chronic condition, data from the National Survey of Children\u2019s Health suggests it\u2019s around 40%.)",
      "In testimony before two Senate committees this week, Kennedy faced questions about his history of anti-vaccine rhetoric, promotion of conspiracy theories and shifting views on abortion. He was met with fierce opposition from some Democratic senators, as well as reservations from the chair of the health committee, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who is a doctor.",
      "If confirmed, Kennedy would oversee a $1.7 trillion annual budget and 13 agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prior to the hearings, Kennedy had suggested taking an eight-year break from researching infectious diseases like Covid and measles.",
      "In his statements to senators, Kennedy claimed that infectious diseases receive significantly more federal funding than chronic diseases. But government records suggest the opposite: Infectious diseases ranked ninth on the list of research subjects funded by the NIH last year, receiving $8.1 billion.",
      "Compare that to a single chronic disease \u2014 cancer \u2014 that received nearly the same amount of funding in 2024. Brain disorders received $8.9 billion.",
      "Many of the other diseases Kennedy named also receive billions in federal funding, including Alzheimer\u2019s ($3.9 billion), diabetes ($1.2 billion), and cardiovascular diseases ($2.9 billion).",
      "When it comes to autism \u2014 a chronic disease that Kennedy has falsely linked to vaccines, a stance he did not disavow in the hearings \u2014 federal funding has grown for more than a decade according to Statista, a data information group. NIH funding for autism research amounted to $305 million in 2024, the group found, compared with $169 million in 2011.",
      "Researchers have attributed much of the increase in autism rates to greater awareness and advances in diagnostic capabilities. Much of the risk of developing autism is genetic, though parents having kids later in life and environmental factors like air pollution may also play a role.",
      "Kennedy is correct that other chronic diseases are becoming more prevalent, as well. Diagnoses of prostate and pancreatic cancer are rising, as is colorectal cancer in men and women younger than age 65. The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes also rose 19% from 2012 to 2022.",
      "Joel Kaufman, a physician-epidemiologist at the University of Washington, said increases in certain chronic diseases could have to do with improvements in the prevention and treatment of infectious disease, which has in turn allowed people to survive what could otherwise have been fatal illnesses and live longer.",
      "\u201cWhat causes most disease and disability now has transitioned in wealthy economies across the world from communicable infectious diseases to chronic diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of that is just the success that we\u2019ve had in managing infectious diseases.\u201d",
      "Neither the NIH or the CDC \u2014 two major federal funders of chronic and infectious disease research \u2014 provided comment in response to Kennedy\u2019s assertions. The American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association, the leading research groups for two of the most common chronic diseases in the U.S., also declined to comment.",
      "In several of his responses to senators, Kennedy said he believes that research into the etiology, or root causes and origins, of chronic diseases is particularly lacking. Kennedy has a long-standing interest in possible connections between environmental toxins and human health.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s almost nothing at NIH, very, very little, a low percentage of its budget, a $42 billion budget, that is devoted to finding out why we\u2019re having this obesity epidemic. We know it\u2019s an environmental toxin,\u201d Kennedy said, adding: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we devoting science to finding out what those toxins are and then eliminating them?\u201d",
      "Obesity research received around $1.2 billion in NIH funding last year. Known risk factors for obesity include a lack of exercise, diets high in ultraprocessed foods and a person\u2019s genetics, though researchers increasingly suspect that exposure to certain chemicals like BPA and PFAS may play a role.",
      "Two epidemiologists agreed that research into the root causes of chronic diseases often receives less funding than studies on potential treatments. Even within the field of prevention research, studying environmental risk factors isn\u2019t as popular as studying genetics or lifestyle interventions, said Dr. Beate Ritz, an epidemiology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health.",
      "In particular, she said, chronic disease research could benefit from more studies on the effects of microplastics, flame retardants, pesticides and PFAS.",
      "\u201cChemicals that can be found in the food, in the air and in the water, they really need to be studied much more, because we know so little about what the chronic, low-dose effects are,\u201d Ritz said.",
      "However, experts also said Kennedy\u2019s notion that infectious disease research is funded at the expense of chronic disease is a false dichotomy. Many chronic diseases sprout from viral or bacterial infections, so clamping down on the research into the latter could make it harder to better understand the former.",
      "\u201cThe evidence is mounting, for many of the chronic conditions, that there is an infectious etiology,\u201d said Garth Ehrlich, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia. \u201cTo me, chronic disease and infectious disease almost go hand in hand.\u201d",
      "Recent research has suggested that multiple sclerosis, a chronic neurologic condition, may be caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Parkinson\u2019s disease, meanwhile, has been linked to infection with hepatitis C and a type of bacteria called H. pylori. And up to 30% of cancers, like cervical cancer, are driven by microbes or viruses.",
      "\u201cWe learn more and more that these bugs that don\u2019t kill us have chronic effects,\u201d Ritz said.",
      "Kennedy has frequently questioned the safety of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, which reduce the risk of cervical cancer, despite overwhelming evidence that they\u2019re safe. His former law firm is suing the pharmaceutical company Merck, alleging that it failed to warn consumers about HPV vaccine side effects. In ethics filings, Kennedy indicated that he planned to continue collecting fees from those lawsuits, but on Friday, he said he would divest those proceeds to his son.",
      "Kennedy also voiced support on Thursday for research into Lyme disease, another potentially lifelong illness that begins with an infection \u2014 in this case, from bacteria carried by ticks. The subject of Lyme disease arose multiple times during the hearings, given Kennedy\u2019s previous suggestion on a podcast that it was a military bioweapon. Kennedy attempted to distance himself from that statement, telling Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, on Thursday that he would support research into a vaccine.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had Lyme disease,\u201d Kennedy said, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s nobody who will fight harder to find a vaccine or a treatment for Lyme disease than me.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Just one week after the Trump\u00a0administration initiated a near-total freeze of U.S. foreign aid, the future of the U.S. Agency for International Development \u2014 the agency at the heart of America\u2019s humanitarian assistance operations overseas \u2014 remains uncertain.",
      "Trump administration officials are actively discussing placing USAID under the authority of the State Department, according to more than a dozen current and former officials and sources familiar with the discussions, further crippling an agency that has already been brought to its knees.",
      "In the past week, hundreds of USAID employees and contractors have been fired or furloughed, almost 60 senior career leaders at the agency have been sidelined and U.S. foreign missions have been brought to a standstill. Thousands of related jobs are also under threat of furlough or firing in the days ahead.",
      "On Friday, prominent signs in the front lobby of the agency's Washington headquarters appeared to have been removed, leaving those still employed to brace for the possibility of USAID shutting down altogether.",
      "\u201cIt is imperative that we maintain an independent development voice and capability within the U.S. government. USAID is, by statute, an independent establishment outside of the State Department,\u201d Democratic\u00a0Sens. Jeanne\u00a0Shaheen of New Hampshire and Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Democratic Reps. Gregory Meeks of New York and Lois Frankel of Florida wrote in a statement\u00a0late Friday.\u00a0\u201cAny proposal to modify that structure would require an Act of Congress.\u201d",
      "\u201cA president cannot eliminate an appropriated federal agency by executive order,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., warned in a post on X.",
      "Despite a rapid-fire social media storm naming dozens of secretaries, ambassadors, special envoys and senior advisers before taking office, President Donald Trump has yet to nominate a leader for the federal humanitarian aid agency.",
      "According to multiple sources who spoke with NBC News, the downsizing of the agency has largely been directed by Pete Marocco, who was installed by the Trump administration as the head of the State Department\u2019s Office of Bureau of Foreign Assistance. Marocco held several national security positions under the previous Trump administration, including at USAID, where his attempts to consolidate power and slash funding drove officials to write a dissent memo that ultimately pushed him out of office, the sources said.",
      "\u201cWhat he\u2019s doing now is frighteningly similar to everything he was trying to do at USAID before, but this time he\u2019s destroying it,\u201d said one USAID official familiar with his past actions.",
      "Critics of the Trump administration\u2019s decision to pause U.S. foreign aid and dramatically downsize USAID argue that the cuts under the banner of \"America First\" ultimately benefit U.S. adversaries.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s USAID purge and foreign aid pause is already hurting efforts to deliver aid and growing China\u2019s world standing at our expense,\u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said Friday.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s effectively putting the Trump and Rubio foreign policy vision at risk,\u201d another USAID official told NBC News, warning, \u201cIf you kill an institution, you are not going to revive it overnight.\u201d",
      "The State Department and USAID did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 requests for comment.",
      "Project 2025, the expansive report initiated by the Heritage Foundation and dozens of other Trump-aligned conservative organizations, foreshadowed the actions that Marocco has taken, including the decision to place almost 60 USAID policy-making career civil servants and foreign service officers on administrative leave.",
      "The\u00a0Project 2025 document\u00a0said that USAID should \u201cpilot-test\u201d the transformation of those civil servant positions into political appointee roles and outlined a broader effort to consolidate USAID."

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 23:42:24 GMT",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order issuing tariffs on goods coming into the U.S. from Canada, Mexico and China, raising the risk of a trade war with America\u2019s closest trading partners and threatening to drive up prices on everything from cars to avocados.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order issuing tariffs on goods coming into the U.S. from Canada, Mexico and China, raising the risk of a trade war with America\u2019s closest trading partners and threatening to drive up prices on everything from cars to avocados.",
      "The only products exempt from the tariffs are Canadian energy products, which would have a lower tariff rate of 10% to \"minimize any disruptive effects we might have on gasoline and home heating oil prices,\" said the senior administration official.",
      "The U.S. will begin collecting the tariffs on Canadian goods on Tuesday. It is unclear when the tariffs on Mexico and China would go into effect.",
      "The White House said in a statement that the tariffs were being implemented to pressure the three countries into stopping the flow of fentanyl and immigrants into the U.S. and would remain in place until \"the crisis is alleviated.\"",
      "\"We need to protect Americans, and it is my duty as President to ensure the safety of all,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social announcing he had signed the tariffs. \"I made a promise on my Campaign to stop the flood of illegal aliens and drugs from pouring across our Borders, and Americans overwhelmingly voted in favor of it.\"",
      "More than 107,000 people died from drug overdose in 2023, with nearly 70% of those deaths from opioids, including fentanyl. Nearly all of the 21,900 pounds of fentanyl seized in 2024 was at the southern border, with just 43 pounds of fentanyl seized at the northern border, according to data from Customs and Border Protection.",
      "It was unclear what specific actions the U.S. was looking for the three countries to take in order to lift the tariffs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a wide range of metrics,\u201d said a senior administration official during a Saturday call with reporters about the tariffs.",
      "\u201cIn Donald Trump\u2019s golden age, we will have only legal immigration and we will have zero Americans dying from Chinese, slash Mexican, slash Canadian fentanyl,\u201d the official said.",
      "Economists across the political spectrum expect tariffs to increase what consumers pay for a range of goods, including vehicles, electronics, produce and lumber. Tariffs are paid by companies importing goods into the U.S., similar to a tax. A range of businesses from homebuilders to alcohol producers warned of the negative economic impact the tariffs would have for businesses and consumers following the tariff announcement.",
      "\u201cImposing additional tariffs on these imports will lead to higher material costs, which will ultimately be passed on to home buyers in the form of increased housing prices,\u201d said Carl Harris, chair of the National Association of Home Builders.",
      "\u201cFurther supply chain disruptions from increased tariffs coupled with increased demand for materials could also hinder rebuilding efforts in areas affected by natural disasters, which you have pledged to help rebuild as quickly as possible,\u201d Harris added.",
      "While some businesses will look to source goods elsewhere, others with no alternatives will be forced to pay the fees. That means U.S. grocery stores will shoulder higher costs for fruits and vegetables grown in Mexico; homebuilders will pay more for Canadian lumber; and automakers will have to pay a tariff each time a component crosses the northern or southern border, which happens repeatedly during the production of a single vehicle.",
      "Companies will have to decide whether to pass these higher costs to consumers or absorb them, which would dent profits or require cuts to protect their margins. The implications could be wide-reaching across the U.S. economy, in part because American consumers and businesses imported more goods from Mexico than any other country.",
      "\"Tariffs on all imported goods from Mexico and Canada \u2014\u00a0especially on\u00a0ingredients and inputs that aren\u2019t available in the U.S. \u2014 could lead to higher consumer prices and retaliation against U.S. exporters,\" said the Consumer Brands Association, which represents makers of packaged food and health products.",
      "Trump made tariffs central to his campaign pitch for improving an economy that many voters cited as their reason for returning him to the White House. He has argued the levies would protect American industries from unfair competition by making foreign goods pricier and encouraging companies to manufacture in the U.S. He has also proposed using revenue from tariffs to pay for other policy priorities and deploying them as a negotiating tool.",
      "\"This is a beautiful, beautiful example of promises made, promises kept by President Trump,\" said the senior administration official.",
      "But economists have found the tariffs Trump imposed on China during his first term did little to accomplish those goals. Instead, they drove up prices for many imports, led to a net loss of manufacturing jobs and reduced corporate investments. Nearly all the revenue collected from Trump\u2019s previous tariffs on China went to payments he sent to American farmers to offset their losses from tariffs China imposed in response. The levies also didn\u2019t generate significant concessions from Beijing, which has failed to meet many of its commitments under a trade deal negotiated during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "The United Steelworkers International, which has pushed for trade reforms to protect U.S. steel workers, warned that the sweeping tariffs could have a negative impact on workers.",
      "\"These tariffs don\u2019t just hurt Canada. They threaten the stability of industries on both sides of the border,\" said David McCall, president of the United Steelworkers International.",
      "The president\u2019s latest tariffs on Canada and Mexico threaten to upend one of his signature trade pacts, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Trump had touted the deal as a victory, as it largely allowed products to move between the three countries tariff-free, much as they\u2019d done for decades under the NAFTA agreement that the USMCA replaced. The current trade deal isn\u2019t up for review until July 2026, but the new tariffs could throw it into jeopardy much sooner.",
      "\u201cThis is not him changing some other administration\u2019s work. This is him changing his administration\u2019s work,\u201d said Francisco Sanches, an international trade lawyer with Holland and Knight\u00a0and a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce for trade during the Obama administration.",
      "The White House said Trump would be issuing the tariffs under the the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Despite the USMCA, Trump said he has the legal authority to regulate imports during a national emergency, which he declared at the southern border on the first day of his second term.",
      "While most of Trump\u2019s tariff threats during his campaign focused on China, he has ratcheted up his focus on Canada and Mexico since he was elected. Both countries vowed to retaliate, which would make American products less competitive within their borders and hurt U.S. businesses that sell there. Cars, oil and gas, electronics, industrial equipment and agricultural products are among the top U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in these types of circumstances when the United States has put tariffs on another country is an attempt by our trading partners to target really sensitive stakeholders and locations,\u201d said Greta Peisch, a trade lawyer at Wiley Rein who was general counsel for the U.S. Trade Representative during the Biden administration.\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re very savvy and understand how our process works and what makes an impact potentially.\u201d",
      "The senior administration officials said there is a \"retaliation clause\" in the executive order issuing the tariffs where if any country chooses to retaliate the U.S. will take further action.",
      "A trade war among the three countries would reduce the economic growth for all of them but could especially impact Mexico,\u00a0according to an analysis by the Peterson Institute.",
      "\u201cFor Mexico, a 25% tariff would be catastrophic. Moreover, the economic decline caused by the tariff could increase the incentives for Mexican immigrants to cross the border illegally into the US\u2014directly contradicting another Trump administration priority,\u201d the report said.",
      "The U.S. auto industry is among the most vulnerable to tariff impacts. For decades, its supply chains have been heavily intertwined with America\u2019s neighbors to the north and south. As vehicles and components cross borders multiple times during the production process, repeated 25% levies could quickly drive up vehicle costs.",
      "The U.S. also depends on food products from Mexico, one of the top suppliers of tomatoes, avocados, berries and peppers. Rising food prices have been a top concern for consumers and voters, with grocery costs up around 25% over the past four years \u2014 an issue Trump hammered on the campaign trail. The tariffs could also drive up the prices of beer and alcohol imported from Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply concerned that U.S. tariffs on imported spirits from Canada and Mexico will significantly harm all three countries and lead to a cycle of retaliatory tariffs that negatively impacts our shared industry,\u201d the Distilled Spirts Council said in a statement.",
      "After his earlier threats, Mexico threatened retaliatory tariffs on American goods sold there, which total around $360 billion. That could hurt U.S. businesses selling to Mexican consumers.",
      "Along with immigration, Trump and lawmakers have raised concerns that China could be using Mexico as a back door into the U.S. to avoid paying tariffs. Mexico has seen a surge in manufacturers relocating there from China as a way to avoid the tariffs Trump put on China during his first term.\u00a0Investment deals announced by Chinese companies in Mexico have surged over the last few years, according to data compiled by the research firm Rhodium Group.",
      "The tariffs on Canada are expected to drive up prices of Canadian lumber, known for being lighter and easier to work with, said Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist for wood products at Fastmarkets.",
      "Canadian lumber mills have already been struggling from previous duties imposed by the U.S. in recent years and the destruction of millions of acres of forest from a pine beetle infestation. More tariffs could hobble the industry further, he said.",
      "\u201cConsumers are going to pay for that in some capacity because in the end, you have less supply available in the market, and prices are going to be somewhat higher on the margin,\u201d said Jalbert.",
      "That could keep pressure on home prices that are already far out of reach for millions of Americans, the National Association of Home Builders has warned.",
      "The tariffs could also drive up gas prices, as crude is among Canada\u2019s top exports to the U.S., hampering Trump\u2019s ambitious vow to halve energy costs in his first 12 months."

      "\u201cWe tend to think a lot about merchandise goods as being automotive goods, furniture goods and these types of heavy equipment goods. But we should not forget that we also do a lot of trade on the agricultural front,\" Daco said. \"So we could see upward pressure for meat prices, upward pressure for dairy prices.

      "For U.S. refineries that are specifically tuned to Canadian oil, any costs associated with switching imports could lead to more expensive gas prices at the pump.",
      "Daco said imposing tariffs \"on large trading partners would have severe economic consequences\" for the U.S., Mexico and Canada, \"and could lead to an environment that is both a higher inflation environment and also a lower growth environment because of the importance of the trade with both of these economies.\""

    "summary": "Brian Driscoll refused to assist in the firing of agents involved in January 6th riot cases, pushing back so forcefully that some feared he would be dismissed.",
    "story": [
      "Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll on Friday refused a Justice Department order that he assist in the firing of agents involved in Jan. 6 riot cases, pushing back so forcefully that some FBI officials feared he would be dismissed, multiple current and former FBI officials told NBC News.",
      "The Justice Department ultimately did not dismiss Driscoll, the head of the bureau\u2019s Newark field office who is temporarily serving as its acting director.",
      "Kash Patel, President Trump's pick for FBI director and a critic of the bureau's investigations of Trump and Jan. 6th rioters, will take over if he is confirmed by the Senate. During his confirmation hearing on Thursday, Patel testified under oath that no FBI officials would be retaliated against.",
      "\u201cAll FBI employees will be protected against political retribution,\u201d Patel told Senators.",
      "Just over twenty-four hours later, Driscoll sent a memo to the FBI workforce explaining that Emil Bove, the acting Deputy Attorney General and Trump's former defense lawyer, had ordered him to remove eight senior FBI executives. Driscoll also said he had been told to turn over the names of every FBI employee involved in investigating Jan. 6 rioters.",
      "Driscoll stated that the eight executives had been forced out but did not say in the memo whether he would turn over the broader list of Jan. 6-related FBI investigators \u2014 a list that he noted encompasses thousands of its employees, including him.",
      "\u201cAs we\u2019ve said since the moment we agreed to take on these roles, we are going to follow the law, follow FBI policy, and do what\u2019s in the best interest of the workforce and the American people \u2014 always,\u201d Driscoll, a former member of the FBI\u2019s elite hostage rescue team, wrote.",
      "In a message that circulated widely among bureau personnel, an FBI agent summarized what happened as: \u201cBottom line \u2014 DOJ came over and wanted to fire a bunch of J6 agents. Driscoll is an absolute stud. Held his ground and told WH proxy, DOJ, to F--- Off.\u201d",
      "The FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment. A senior FBI official disputed the accounts of the current and former officials saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not true.\u201d",
      "A former FBI official who knows Driscoll well said, \u201cHe pushed back hard.\u201d",
      "Agents who worked on Jan. 6 cases targeted",
      "It\u2019s not known whether anyone other than the eight senior FBI executives have been separated from the bureau.\u00a0One official familiar with the matter said that top Trump administration officials have made it clear that they want at least some of the FBI agents who pursued Jan. 6 cases to be fired, just as multiple DOJ prosecutors involved with the Jan. 6 prosecutions were fired.",
      "The official said the Trump administration wants this to happen quickly but has been told by FBI officials that misconduct allegations at the bureau involve a formal review process.",
      "The accounts of Driscoll\u2019s actions shed new light on a chaotic series of events over the last 48 hours that began with the news that the Trump administration was seeking to purge the top ranks of the FBI\u2019s career civil servants.",
      "\u201cLate this afternoon, I received a memo from the acting Deputy Attorney General notifying me that eight senior FBI executives are to be terminated by specific dates, unless these employees have retired beforehand,\" Driscoll wrote. \"I have been personally in touch with each of these impacted employees.\"",
      "He said in the memo that he had also been directed to provide the DOJ by noon on Tuesday a list of all FBI employees involved in Capitol riot cases, and also those involved in a case against a Hamas leader.",
      "No one contacted by NBC News had a sense of the new administration\u2019s interest in the Hamas case, but the focus on Jan. 6 was clear. The Trump administration apparently believes that all of the Jan. 6 cases should not have been brought.",
      "Since it was the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history, thousands of FBI personnel were involved, as Driscoll acknowledged in his memo.",
      "\u201cWe understand that this request encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have supported these investigative efforts,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am one of those employees, as is acting Deputy Director (Rob) Kissane.\u201d",
      "FBI agents encouraged",
      "FBI agents were heartened by Driscoll's memo, a source said, which many saw as an attempt by Driscoll to make the workforce and the public aware of what he was being asked to do.",
      "\u201cHe was trying to do right by the workforce,\u201d one person familiar with the thinking of agents told NBC News. \u201cHe\u2019s putting it in writing and naming names.\u201d",
      "A separate DOJ memo obtained by NBC News identified the employees who were forced out.",
      "The list included four top FBI managers: Robert Wells, who oversaw the national security branch; Ryan Young, of the intelligence branch; Robert Nordwall, of criminal and cyber response; Jackie Maguire, of science and technology. All of those people were eligible to retire and many of them did so.",
      "The memo also identified two heads of field offices, Jeffrey Veltri in Miami and David Sundberg in Washington, D.C.",
      "Also on the list was Dena Perkins, an acting section chief in the security division who was involved in a controversial disciplinary proceeding against a conservative FBI agent.",
      "The list did not include Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge in Las Vegas, who sent a message to colleagues on Friday that he was being dismissed by FBI headquarters. \u201cI was given no rationale for this decision, which, as you might imagine, has come as a shock.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether he has now been given a reprieve.",
      "Nor did the list include executive assistant director Arlene Gaylord, a 33-year FBI veteran who was not retirement-eligible and requested that she be allowed to work in another assignment until she did so.\u00a0An FBI official familiar with the matter said she had been accommodated.",
      "Experts say the firings are illegal",
      "Legal experts said that few, if any, of the firings carried out so far by the Trump administration have been legal under civil service laws because the employees were not afforded due process.",
      "The Trump White House argues, though, that the president has the absolute right to fire anyone he wishes in the executive branch.\u00a0The Supreme Court has ruled that federal employees have a right to a hearing before they are disciplined or terminated.",
      "Joyce Vance,\u00a0a former U.S. attorney and NBC News legal contributor, called the firings illegal.",
      "\u201cCareer federal employees can be fired for conduct or performance issues, not because they failed to demonstrate political loyalty to the current incumbent of the White House,\u201d said Vance. \u201cTrump ignored controlling law and regulations to do this, and unless the Supreme Court changes their interpretation, any firing of permanent members of the civil service should not stand.\u201d",
      "Even if some of the employees sue and win, they said their public service careers have been irreparably damaged, if not ended.",
      "One of the Jan. 6 prosecutors fired on Friday told NBC News that they \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d and had no regrets about their work. The person, who asked not to named due to fear of retaliation, said it was discouraging to be fired after seeing Trump pardon violent rioters who attacked police officers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all been looking over our shoulders, like, \u2018Is this the day that we\u2019re gonna get fired?\u2019 Because we were doing our jobs?\u201d the fired prosecutor told NBC News. \u201cWe\u2019ve been forced to dismiss all of the cases that we\u2019ve been working on of all these people that were very violent offenders. It\u2019s been awful.\u201d",
      "Current and former FBI agents say the purge at the bureau has had a shattering effect on the morale, sending a message that agents who work on cases that anger someone in the Trump administration could be targeted.",
      "\u201cWho right now would want to work on a case that would get them crosswise with the administration?\u201d one former FBI official asked.\u00a0\u201cThey will come after you.\u201d"

      "Nivida is from Honduras and her husband is from Mexico, they currently live in Louisiana. Her husband has an open application for a special visa for victims of a crime that could eventually lead to lawful permanent residency, a process that could take years, according to Nivida and court documents from the advocacy group representing her case. She had an initial asylum application in the immigration court that was recently dismissed, according to Nivida the court documents, but is still able to file another asylum case with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want them to take away the citizenship of innocent babies born here, it shouldn\u2019t matter the status of their parents, their race, their color, they shouldn\u2019t be discriminated against,\u201d said Nivida in Spanish, who asked that her full name not be used out of fear of immigration reprisal and her safety. \u201cI believe violating the protection that the Constitution gives to a child born here is violating his or her rights as an individual.\u201d",
      "Last week, the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, the immigrant services organization CASA and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown Law filed a lawsuit on behalf of five pregnant women and ASAP and CASA\u2019s members against Trump\u2019s executive order limiting birthright citizenship, which he called \u201cProtecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship.\u201d The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit.",

      "Nivida, who is a member of ASAP, said she decided to speak out on behalf of the thousands of pregnant women and their babies who will be impacted by the order if it\u2019s allowed to take effect in late February. She and others came to the United States seeking protection and stability but now find their unborn babies\u2019 futures uncertain, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Trump\u2019s executive order attempts to limit birthright citizenship to people who have at least one parent who is a United States citizen or permanent resident. It also states that those born to parents who are in the country legally, but temporarily, will no longer be automatically guaranteed citizenship, including high-skill work visas like the H1B and student visas like the F1. But legal experts say the true scope of the order is unclear and could lead some children to be temporarily stateless.",
      "Meny, a pregnant asylum seeker from Honduras who is also a member of ASAP, said the order \u201ccreates a lot of uncertainty, a lot of fear\u201d and has taken an emotional toll on her family.",

      "Meny, who is due in July, said she feels desperate thinking of her baby\u2019s future and the rights her child may not have as Trump enacts his anti-immigration agenda. Meny said that as an asylum seeker fleeing prosecution, returning to her home country is not an option.",
      "\u201cBeing immigrants doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re enemies of this country. The majority of us come here for reasons of survival,\u201d she said.",

      "Liza, one of the five women who are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said her husband has an open asylum case because of persecution in Russia and she is currently on a student visa while getting her master\u2019s degree. Liza, who is in her late 20s, said she fears her baby will be left stateless if her child is denied birthright citizenship as they do not feel safe applying for Russian citizenship for their baby as asylum seekers fleeing Russia. As a former independent journalist in Russia, Liza and her family are fleeing persecution and said \u201cI don\u2019t really have an option to go back there.\u201d Even though there is a Russian Embassy in the United States, she said it is not safe for her and her husband to go there as asylum seekers.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has repeatedly discussed imposing tariffs, both during the campaign and since taking office, and the first tranche, on goods from Canada, China and Mexico\u00a0will take effect Feb. 1, the White House confirmed Friday.",
      "While there are still some unknowns, one thing is clear, economists said: U.S. consumers\u00a0should brace for\u00a0a negative financial impact.",
      "It\u2019s \u201chard to find positives\u201d from tariffs, said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, whose research specializes in trade with China and global supply chains.",
      "Trump plans to put 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and a 10% duty on China, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Friday.",
      "China, Mexico and Canada are the three\u00a0largest trading partners\u00a0with the U.S., as measured by imported goods. They\u00a0supplied\u00a0about $536 billion, $455 billion, and $437 billion of goods, respectively, to the U.S. in 2022, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.",

      "What federal workers need to consider when evaluating offer to resign",

      "Concert ticket prices have soared, but music fans don\u2019t seem to care",
      "Tariffs are a tax on foreign imports. U.S. businesses that import goods pay that tax to the federal government.",
      "Many businesses will funnel those extra costs to customers \u2014 either directly or indirectly \u2014 which is why tariffs generally trigger higher prices for consumers, economists said.",
      "\u201cPart of these tariffs will be passed on to consumers,\u201d Lovely said.",
      "Americans could also find they have fewer choices for brands and products stocked on store shelves, she said.",
      "Exemptions may \u2018limit the damage\u2019 to consumers",
      "There are still many question marks over the looming tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico.",
      "For example, it\u2019s unclear if any imports will be exempt. Trump suggested Thursday night, for example, that Canadian\u00a0oil might be exempt. The White House said the tariffs will be open for public inspection on Saturday.",
      "Discussions around such specifics are \u201congoing,\u201d a White House official told CNBC on Friday morning.",
      "\u201cThere are always exemptions and carve-outs,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s.",
      "Trump might try to \u201climit the damage to the U.S. consumer\u201d via those exemptions, Zandi said. For example, he could choose not to impose duties on apparel from China, avocados from Mexico or cheese from Quebec, he said.",
      "Economic impact",
      "The White House said tariffs and Trump\u2019s broader economic agenda will benefit the U.S. economy.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said tariffs Trump imposed in his first term \u2014 along with tax cuts, deregulation and energy policy \u2014 \u201cresulted in historic job, wage, and investment growth with no inflation,\u201d and that in his second term Trump will use tariffs to \u201cusher in a new era of growth and prosperity for American industry and workers.\u201d",
      "Economists, however, disagree.",
      "A 25% Canada-Mexico tariff and 10% China tariff would raise about $1.3 trillion in revenue through 2035 on a net basis, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\u00a0estimated. That revenue may be used to partially offset the cost of tax cuts, a package that\u00a0might cost more than $5 trillion\u00a0over 10 years.",
      "However, a 10% additional tariff on China would shrink the U.S. economy by $55 billion during the Trump administration\u2019s second term, assuming China retaliates with its own tariffs, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0by Warwick McKibbin and Marcus Noland, economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "A 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada would cause a $200 billion reduction in U.S. gross domestic product, they found.",
      "Meanwhile, economists expect more tariffs in the future.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump floated a 10% or 20% universal tariff on all imports and a tariff of at least 60% on Chinese goods, for example.",
      "A 20% worldwide tariff and a 60% levy on Chinese goods would raise costs by $3,000 in 2025 for the average U.S. household, according to an October\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the Tax Policy Center.",
      "\u201cBroad-based, universal tariffs and the damage they will do is not really a debate,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cThey will do damage. It\u2019s just a question of how much and to whom.\u201d",
      "How tariffs may impact consumers",
      "Consumers could pay for tariffs both directly and indirectly, economists said.",
      "Tariffs on China\u00a0would likely have the\u00a0largest direct impact\u00a0on consumers, as the bulk of what China exports to the U.S. is consumer goods such as apparel, toys and electronics, Zandi said.",
      "China is the \u201cdominant supplier\u201d of toys and sports equipment to the U.S., and provides 40% of its footwear imports and 25% of its electronics and textiles, according to a recent\u00a0analysis\u00a0by PIIE economists.",
      "Mexico and Canada tariffs would also \u201cput upward pressure on food prices,\u201d\u00a0according\u00a0to PIIE economists.",
      "The nations are \u201cimportant sources\u201d of vegetables, accounting for 47% of total U.S. imports, and prepared foodstuffs, 42%. Transportation equipment and machinery, electronics and fuel are other sectors that stand to be most affected, they found.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. imports roughly 40% of its crude oil, with Canada as the dominant supplier,\u201d Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, a financial consulting firm, said in a written statement.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 20:05:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Ken Martin, the longtime leader of the state Democratic Party organization in Minnesota, will be the new Democratic National Committee chair after winning Saturday\u2019s election, as his party looks to turn the page and recover from a dismal 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Ken Martin, the longtime leader of the state Democratic Party organization in Minnesota, will be the new Democratic National Committee chair after winning Saturday\u2019s election, as his party looks to turn the page and recover from a dismal 2024.",
      "Martin had been the front-runner from the beginning of the race, leveraging his relationships with the more than 400 voting members of the DNC that he forged over more than a decade of work inside the institutional Democratic Party.\u00a0And those relationships proved essential, as he clinched a majority of the voting members on the first ballot, more than 100 votes above the second place finisher, Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler.",
      "The race hinged more on the candidates\u2019 organizing and fundraising resumes than on their postures regarding the ideological soul of the party, as it did in 2017, after President Donald Trump\u2019s previous election win. Martin was the more experienced hand with deep party relationships, Wikler had been at the center of some of Democrats\u2019 highest-profile races in recent years, and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley had unique electoral and government experience.",
      "Addressing the DNC membership after his victory, Martin called for party unity after a relatively quiet race that got chippy at times, and for the party to focus on opposing President Donald Trump.",
      "\"We have one team, the Democratic Party, and we have one fight. The fight\u2019s not in here, it\u2019s out there,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe fight right now is against Donald Trump and the billionaires who bought this country.\u201d",
      "Now, Martin will be tasked with helping to pull Democrats out of the hole where they ended 2024, a devastating election cycle that left them without any of the levers of power in Washington. But while Martin will help to lead the party forward, Democrats aren\u2019t necessarily looking to him to be the party\u2019s pre-eminent leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a party out of power, so we don\u2019t have a leader. And I think broadly, philosophically, someone could say that this person would be our party leader. That\u2019s not really true,\u201d said Matt Corridoni, a veteran Democratic strategist who has worked for the committee in the past and also worked on a previous race for DNC chair.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that anyone has ever really looked to the most recent DNC chairs and said, that person was a leader of our party,\u201d Corridoni continued, before framing the role of the DNC chair as nailing down the \"nuts and bolts of operating the party.\"",
      "\u201cWhat this person will really be tasked with at the end of the day is planning a primary process, making sure that the state parties have the funding and infrastructure they need to be successful, and planning our next convention,\" he said.",
      "That notion is not lost on Martin, who framed the chair role during his campaign as doing the important party-building work that will set the foundation for the Democratic candidates to use up and down the ballot, while helping to set the message as the party takes on Trump.",
      "\"Donald Trump, the Republican Party, this is a new DNC. We are not going to sit back and not take you on when you fail the American people,\" Martin said during a session with reporters shortly after his victory.",
      "\"The role of the party is not just to go out there and build the infrastructure,\" Martin added. \"It's also to make sure we're defining them and we're out there making sure the American people know what the stakes of not only these coming elections are, but what's happening in this country.\"",
      "During that session with reporters, Martin said that his first priorities as chair will be looking \"at the state of the party, the finances,\" looking at the party's \"contracts\" and starting a \"post-election review process.\"",
      "\"We don't call it a post-mortem or an autopsy, because our party's not dead. It's still kicking right?\" Martin said.",
      "\"The reality is,\" he added, \"what we need to do right now is really start to get a handle around what happened last election cycle. We know that we lost ground with Latino voters, we know we lost ground with women and younger voters and of course working-class voters. We don't know the how and why yet.\"",
      "The front-runners were largely in agreement during the race about what the DNC needed to do to move forward: ensure the party has the resources to contest every race across every state and territory, adopt a permanent organizational posture to help build relationships between the party and its potential voters, and take a postmortem look at Democratic Party's spending, after it fell short at the presidential level despite significantly outspending Trump and Republicans. All of the candidates also talked about pushing to bring their message to new media outlets while highlighting new messengers in part as a way to fix a deeper problem \u2014 Democratic underperformance with young and Hispanic voters.",
      "Throughout the race to succeed outgoing DNC chair Jaime Harrison, Martin framed himself as the experienced choice to take the reins of the party organization. Over a decade of experience leading the Minnesota party, he has regularly touted his unbeaten record in statewide races, arguing his state has been a Democratic beacon of hope while the party has taken important losses in other Midwestern \u201cblue wall\u201d states.",
      "As head of the Association of State Democratic Chairs and a vice chair of the national party committee, combined with his record, Martin had developed relationships with party members to help him shore up the votes needed to emerge victorious despite a last-minute push from Wikler.",
      "Those relationships helped Martin amass about 200 public endorsements from the voting body of the DNC, far more than any other candidate. And while Wikler touted support from top congressional Democrats, Martin snagged high-profile endorsements of his own, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was the Democrats\u2019 2024 vice presidential nominee, and Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the powerful congressman who helped jumpstart Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential bid.",
      "During a brief address to the DNC\u2019s Poverty Council Thursday afternoon, Martin pointed to Trump\u2019s implication that a focus on diversity, equity and inclusion programs was to blame for Wednesday night\u2019s tragic aircraft collision in Washington, D.C.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to unify quickly as a party because the stakes have never been higher for this nation. What we\u2019ve seen these last two weeks is despicable. They\u2019re shattering people\u2019s lives, they\u2019re destroying communities already two weeks into it,\u201d Martin said, before going on to describe his childhood being raised by a young mother in poverty, \u201cin and out of shelters.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur fight right now is for working people throughout this country,\u201d Martin added. \u201cThink about Donald Trump\u2019s administration, their cabinet is worth $460 billion. Not the top 1%, the top 100th of 1%. You think they give a damn about people like me, people like you or working people and families like mine that are struggling? \u2026 Our fight right now is a fight for the future and it\u2019s a fight for workers and it\u2019s a fight for people who are trying to get into the middle class.\u201d",
      "Wikler fell short despite a late push and endorsements from major Democratic Party figures including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, along with governors like Kentucky\u2019s Andy Beshear, Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer and Kansas\u2019 Laura Kelly. Wikler also secured the support of major unions including the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the National Education Association, American Federation of Teachers and Service Employees International Union.",
      "In a statement congratulating Martin, Wikler called on \"everyone who supported me to join me in working with Chair Martin to ensure that the Democratic Party rises to this moment of crisis in our country.\u00a0\"",
      "The race lacked the deep ideological divide of the last competitive race for chair in 2017, when the party had to pick up the pieces of a disappointing election loss as well as a party fractured by the hacking and release of internal party emails that exacerbated the divide between progressives and establishment Democrats.",
      "Even though the race didn't have the fireworks of some other past races, Harrison took to the microphone multiple times before Martin's election to issue vague warnings against those who were bullying DNC members for their vote.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve heard over the course of the last few days, while we were here, that people have been threatened about their vote, people have been intimidated by their vote, that folks have been having donors called and say they\u2019re going to pull funding because of their vote,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFolks, in this party there will be no tolerance for that type of behavior,\u201d Harrison said.",
      "Now that Democrats have a chairman, Rev. Leah Daughtry told NBC News shortly before the vote that the new chair \"has to become the standard bearer, the visionary that can help our party move from the mat into the place we need to be to win back voters and to win elections in the days to come.\u201d",
      "\"Now we have the complete team, and I think we\u2019re ready,\" she said. She referenced Trump's posts on social media and statements after the tragic plane and helicopter crash in the Potomac River earlier this week.",
      "\"Instead of him being able to bring our country together, he created more division,\" Daughtry said of Trump, putting more \"focus\" behind Democrats' efforts to oppose him."

    "story": [
      "As music fans gear up for Grammy watch parties and nominated artists plan for their big day, the appearance of one of hip-hop's elite remains uncertain. Will Drake attend this year's Grammys? The answer to that question isn't so simple.",
      "Drake and Kendrick Lamar, both Grammy-winning artists, reignited their rap beef in an explosive way in 2024, releasing multiple diss tracks about each other at breakneck speed.",
      "The vitriolic tracks, which marked the first time the dueling rappers squared off in music in years, resulted in hit singles and high-profile music awards, including an artist of the year award for Lamar at the 2024 BET Hip Hop Awards and a 2024 Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Artist award for Drake.",
      "But while Lamar was nominated for seven Grammys at the 2025 Grammy Awards \u2014\u00a0 including a whopping five nominations alone for his controversial diss track \"Not Like Us\" \u2014\u00a0Drake received zero Grammy nods this year.",
      "That's likely because the Canadian rapper, 38, has declined to submit his music for Grammy consideration for several years while also slamming the show to other musicians as something that \"doesn\u2019t dictate s---- in our world.\"",
      "Drake has also shared his opinion of the Grammys in his music, including 2023's \"First Person Shooter,\" a collaboration with J Cole. \u201cI told Jimmy Jam I use a Grammy as a door stop,\" he boasts on the track.",
      "Still, throughout his long career, Drake has received 55 nominations, taking home five. The \u201cFamily Matters\u201d rapper had also performed and presented at the show before he began criticizing it.",
      "So, even with his prickly relationship with the Grammys there still could be a chance for him to perform or at least show up to face his rap nemesis.",
      "While there's no clear answer on whether he will attend or not, it's worth revisiting what led to the unraveling of his relationship with the Grammys.",
      "What has Drake said about the Grammys?",
      "After racking up multiple Grammy nominations and several wins since 2010, Drake appeared to have become disenchanted with the Grammys around 2017.",
      "That year, the Recording Academy nominated Drake eight times, including his first album of the year nod for his album, \"Views.\"",
      "After \u201cHotline Bling,\u201d which also topped the Billboard 200 pop chart for weeks, won best rap song and best rap/sung performance in 2017 \u2014\u00a0Drake slammed the Grammys for giving him awards for a rap song and not a pop song.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a Black artist, I\u2019m apparently a rapper, even though \u2018Hotline Bling\u2019 is not a rap song,\u201d Drake said during and\u00a0interview with U.K. DJ\u00a0Semtex. \u201cThe only category that they can manage to fit me in is in a rap category, maybe because I\u2019ve rapped in the past or because I\u2019m black. I can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d",
      "During the interview, Drake also expressed frustration that his dance track \"One Dance,\" the first song to reach 1 billion streams on\u00a0Spotify, was completely shut out because it was obviously a pop song. \"But I never get any credit for that,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI won two awards but I don\u2019t even want them because it feels weird to me,\u201d Drake added, noting that he wanted to be considered a pop star like the late Michael Jackson.",
      "In 2019, Drake accepted the Grammy Award for best rap song for \u201cGod\u2019s Plan\"\u00a0by giving a pointed acceptance speech about how he and the other artists there that night \"play in an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport.\"",
      "In 2022, after his album,\u00a0\"Certified Lover Boy\" was nominated for best rap album and his single \u201cWay 2 Sexy\u201d was nominated for best rap performance, Drake asked the Recording Academy to\u00a0remove his work from the nominations. The Academy honored Drake's request and rapper didn't attend the awards show.",
      "In 2023, although Drake refused to submit his 2022 album,\u00a0\"Honestly, Nevermind,\" or any of its songs for consideration by the Grammys, he received four nominations. But once again, Drake didn't attend the awards show.",
      "In 2024, Drake received four more Grammy nominations for his joint 2022 album with 21 Savage, \"Her Loss.\" According to the Grammys, Drake \"submitted material for nomination for the 2024 GRAMMYs,\" but the rapper, who did not attend, ultimately did not take home an award.",
      "When was the last time Drake attended the Grammys?",
      "The last time Drake attended a Grammy Awards ceremony was in 2019. It was another big year for the rapper, who was nominated in seven categories, including the three most coveted categories: album of the year, for\u00a0his fifth studio album, \"Scorpion,\" and record and song of the year, for \"God\u2019s Plan.\"",
      "Drake took home just one award in the best rap song category for \"God's Plan.\"",
      "\u201cWe play an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport,\u201d Drake said during his acceptance speech. \u201cYou already won if you have people singing your songs word for word, if they\u2019re singing in your hometown. You\u2019re already winning, you don\u2019t need this right here.\u201d",
      "How many Grammys does Drake have?",
      "Drake has been nominated for 55 Grammy awards throughout his career. He's won five of those awards.",
      "Has Drake performed at the Grammys?",
      "Drake has performed at the Grammy Awards at least twice over the years. In 2010, he joined fellow rappers Eminem and Lil Wayne to perform a medley of \u201cDrop The World\u201d and \u201cForever.\u201d",
      "He joined Rihanna onstage in 2011 to perform their hit \u201cWhat\u2019s My Name.\"",
      "Did Drake's rap foe, Kendrick Lamar, earn a Grammy nomination in 2025?",
      "Kendrick Lamar earned seven Grammy nominations in 2025, five alone for \"Not Like Us,\" his controversial diss track about Drake.",
      "Lamar earned nominations in the following categories for \"Not Like Us\": song of the year; record of the year; best rap performance; best rap song and best music video.",

      "The nominations come more than a decade after the release of her debut studio album in 2013, and 10 years after she received two nominations for her feature on Iggy Azalea's hit song, \"Fancy.\"",
      "Charli XCX has questioned her lack of mainstream success over the years, especially after the release of her 2022 album, \"Crash,\" which became her first album to top the U.K. chart, and debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 chart in the U.S. \u2014 her highest charting album at the time.",
      "\"me not being nominated for a grammy for crash is like mia goth not being nominated for an oscar for pearl and only further proves that people don\u2019t wanna see hot evil girls thrive,\" Charli XCX wrote in a post on X in 2023.",
      "It was \"Brat,\" Charli XCX's neon green club record released on June 7, 2024, that finally brought the singer into the mainstream, as her longtime supporters (angels) and newfound fans (brats) came together to make \"brat summer\" inescapable in 2024. The record debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, becoming her highest charting album of all time.",

      "The film was widely panned after its release and has a 38% audience score rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Charli XCX's own 2016 \"Vroom Vroom\" EP was compared to the film in a review published by Pitchfork, which gave her EP a 4.5 out of 10 rating.",

      "\"Hi, it\u2019s me, you\u2019re all in danger/ Never get invited \u2018cause I\u2019m such a hater,\" she sings, before warning she has her finger on a detonator.",
      "\"Every time, I make it so outrageous/ Always gonna lose to people playin\u2019 safer,\" she says in the song. \"Four, three, two, one, see you later/ Crazy girl s---, gonna go spring breakers.\"",
      "In the first verse of the song, Charli XCX details how she would arrive at the ceremony, parked outside watching the nominees walk the carpet.",
      "\"Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, in a big pink truck/ February 10th, and I\u2019m gonna pull up,\" she says, in a reference to her hit song \"Vroom Vroom,\" as well as the exact date of Grammy Awards ceremonies in 2008, 2013 and 2019.",
      "\"Hey, Staples Center, what the f--- is up?/ Y\u0435ah, I\u2019m parked outside watching all the girls strut,\" she continues, referencing the former name of Crypto.com Arena.",
      "In the next few lines, the song takes a dramatic turn, as she warns the nominees not to slip on the red carpet, because she \"poured a load of gasoline on the carpet.\"",
      "\"Lit a cigarette, took a drag, then I just flicked it/ Place went boom, boom, boom, boom, clap,\" she sings, in reference to another one of her hit songs, \"Boom Clap.\"",

    "summary": "Where is Amanda Riley's ex husband Cory Riley now? Find out more about where the real person from the Scamanda podcast is now.",
    "story": [
      "Amanda Riley has made plenty of headlines for her elaborate cancer hoax. Her story was the subject of a hit 2023 podcast, \u201cScamanda,\u201d and a new ABC News docuseries of the same name.",
      "However, her husband, Cory Riley, has stayed largely out of the public eye.",
      "He did not speak at his wife\u2019s sentencing hearing in May 2022, when she was handed a 60-month sentence for wire fraud and required to pay restitution to her victims. He also does not appear to have given any media interviews about her case.",
      "Starting in 2012, and throughout much of their marriage, Amanda Riley said she was battling Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a form of blood cancer, per a sentencing from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Northern District of California.",
      "However, it later emerged that the young mom had faked having cancer. She had perpetuated the hoax for years, sharing updates about her supposed cancer journey on social media and blogs and soliciting more than $100,000 in donations from nearly 350 supporters.",
      "A court document viewed by\u00a0TODAY.com\u00a0revealed that Cory Riley filed for divorce from Amanda Riley in 2024 and was living in Texas.",
      "The couple met when Cory Riley was still married to his first wife, Aletta Souza. He and Souza shared a daughter, Jessa.\u00a0Cory Riley was also a stepdad to Souza\u2019s older daughter, Jaymie, from Souza\u2019s first marriage.",
      "Souza recounted how Amanda Riley came into the family\u2019s lives during her May 2022 sentencing hearing.",
      "Her daughter Jaymie was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in 2002.",
      "\u201cShe was unable to be out in public or attend school because she was immunocompromised,\u201d Souza said. \u201cTherefore my husband at the time, Cory Riley, and myself, did our best to accommodate Jaymie\u2019s needs from home.\u201d",
      "Amanda Riley, then 17, was hired to teach Jaymie cheerleading, Souza said at the hearing.",
      "A few years later, Cory Riley and Souza divorced, and Cory Riley ended up marrying Amanda Riley in 2011. Amanda Riley became a stepmother to Jessa and she seemed to embrace the role, calling Jessa her \u201cbonus daughter.\u201d",
      "\u201cAmanda was a big part of Jessa\u2019s life because we had shared custody,\u201d Souza said at the sentencing hearing. \u201cCo-parenting can be tricky, and adding a stepmom to the mix, even more difficult, but we managed for a bit, and then things changed.\u201d",
      "Amanda Riley spoke about her husband at the sentencing hearing.",
      "\u201cI want to apologize to my family. Cory, my husband, my parents, my brothers, our best friends that we consider family, and our kids,\u201d she said. \u201cOur lives will never be the same because of my choices, and I\u2019m so sorry for that.\u201d",
      "She also mentioned their sons, Carter and Connor.",
      "\u201cOur two young boys were babies when this started, so they were too little to be affected by my bad choices,\u201d she said. \u201cNow to see them as big boys who are going to see their mom go through this process, is going to flip their world upside down.\u201d",
      "Amanda Riley is serving a five-year sentence at the Federal Medical Center Carswell, a federal prison in Ft. Worth, Texas. Her release date is Dec. 4, 2025, according to her inmate record."

      "While interviewing each other for People, Witherspoon asked her \u201cYou're Cordially Invited\u201d co-star Will Ferrell if he\u2019s ever given a speech he\u2019s regretted.",
      "Ferrell said he didn't think so, but the Oscar winner clearly had a story to share. Witherspoon explained that years ago while introducing a \u201cvery serious, proper actress\u201d at a British event, she accidentally roasted her, which led to a falling out.",
      "\u201cSo this friend of mine, who I didn\u2019t really know that well, but she was a very serious, proper actress, and she asked me to give her an award, but I had never been to this award ceremony, so I thought it was like a roast,\" Witherspoon said. \"So I got up, and I roasted her.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut that was not the tone,\u201d Ferrell clarified.",
      "\u201cNo, the tone was British, elegant, classy, and I was like, \u2018Remember the time we got laser hair removal?\u2019\u201d she recalled with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m still embarrassed about it. We\u2019re not friends anymore. I\u2019m not even kidding \u2014 we\u2019re not friends anymore. I think she doesn\u2019t like me anymore.\u201d",

      "As for the right audience, Witherspoon and Ferrell are making people laugh with their new comedy, \u201cYou're Cordially Invited, out now. In it, they play two people who discover that their family members' weddings were booked at the same venue on the same day. The movie also co-stars Nick Jonas as a \u201chot pastor,\u201d they teased.",
      "The actors began their joint interview by reminiscing about the first time they worked together on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2001. Witherspoon shared that she\u2019s a big fan of the comedian and that his film \u201cTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\u201d is her family\u2019s favorite, along with \u201cElf.\u201d"

      "\u201cLove Me\u201d is described as a sci-fi romance that takes place after the end of humanity. It follows Buoy (Stewart) and Satellite (Yeun), two robots on Earth that have access to the internet and learn what it means to be alive and in love. The film \u2014 which only features the two characters \u2014 is unlike any other. \u201cLove Me\u201d explores artificial intelligence and one\u2019s identity with the use of live-action, animatronics and animation.",
      "\u201cWe wrote it during the pandemic, so it was the two of us ... adults, going around and around and around, doing the same thing every day,\u201d co-director and writer Sam Zuchero tells TODAY.com, adding the film is about \u201chow that affects you and your mentality about who you are and who your partner is.\u201d",
      "Co-director and writer Andy Zuchero adds that the film attempts to uncover the differences between how we present ourselves and who we actually are.",

D\u00e9ja and Liam\u2019s seemingly perfect life revolves around \u201cDate Night 2.0,\u201d which includes making quesadillas in onesies, kissing and snuggling with their dog while watching \u201cFriends\u201d.",
      "Buoy, AKA Me, adapts D\u00e9ja\u2019s life as the inspiration for her newfound life. She then meets Satellite, whom she gives the name \u201cIam\u201d (pronounced I am). Without his knowledge, she helps Iam become Liam based on D\u00e9ja\u2019s social media.",
      "The two build a virtual reality where they bring their characters to life.",
      "As the two interact, they begin to feel their feelings and subsequently question their emotions, interactions and choices.",
      "What follows is a couple that experiences\u00a0unrealistic expectations on their relationships. Me wants the picture-perfect life and begins to feel unsatisfied after Iam tells her that their life is fake.",
      "Overcome with what appears to be depression, Me goes off the grid and disappears for a billion years. During that time, Iam discovers that Me made up their life based on D\u00e9ja and Liam.",

I\u2019m not gonna deal. I\u2019m gonna go inward and I\u2019m gonna just close off.\u2019\u201d",
      "When Me decides to return, they continue to struggle with their identities. Iam tells Me he doesn\u2019t want to be lied to and wants to create his own identity. Additionally, Iam wants to take things slow, Me becomes obsessive with their relationship and thinks he doesn't love her.",
      "\u201cI want you and not D\u00e9ja,\u201d Iam tells Me, explaining that they are not the people who she created them to be.",

      "The film ends with them in a new home in what appears to be a bustling city. Iam asks Me what they should do for dinner and Me replies they should go out.",
      "Who do Buoy and Satellite represent?",
      "Sam and Andy Zuchero actually built real-life robots for the movie and took them to locations to show the Earth's transformation.",
      "As for what they represent, Buoy, or Me, is someone looking for a connection, while Satellite, Iam, is programmed to find and connect with a life form on Earth.",
      "Stewart tells TODAY.com that Me is \u201ca pretty naive character\u201d and  \u201csomebody who feels lonely.\u201d",
      "\u201cI play a buoy who is living in an icy ocean after humans no longer exist, and she\u2019s kind of hearing the echo of that loss and exhibiting it, but not really able to be it,\u201d Stewart explains. \u201cSo she ... desperately looks around and tries to find connection with the only other thing around her, which is this satellite.\u201d",
      "Buoy forms a \u201cnot-so-real personality\u201d in order to be looked at and liked, Stewart adds. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t feel too separate from what it feels like to try to get to know yourself to the extent that someone might like you.\u201d",
      "Stewart likens her character to a baby who has the whole internet at their fingertips, \u201cAnd all I want is to just hang out with one person. How do I make that happen?\u201d",
      "\u201cThen she tells a few lies, and then really regrets it, but then realizes that there was a lot of truth in those lies,\u201d she explains.",
      "As for Yeun, he tells TODAY.com that Satellite, Iam, is just serving a function until he meets Buoy \u201cand then all of a sudden, he becomes conscious of himself, and he\u2019s wanting to be defined.\u201d",
      "Once he\u2019s defined, Yeun says his character attempts to understand what that means. He eventually discovers that he would never have been able to define himself if it wasn\u2019t for Buoy\u2019s help. \u201cAnd so (his) journey was a mirror of her journey.\u201d",
      "What happens at the end of 'Love Me'?",
      "Andy Zuchero explains that the movie starts with humankind\u2019s extinction \u2014\u00a0\u201cThough we don\u2019t actually reveal why, we\u2019ll just say simultaneous crises.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut the movie ends with our rebirth through these two new beings, and the fact that they \u2018have all the time in the world\u2019 means that they\u2019ll continue to evolve as we\u2019ve evolved over 200,000 years, and the Earth has evolved for 5 billion,\u201d he says.",
      "Stewart, on her end, feels that at the end Buoy and Satellite have a \u201cbreathy moment\u201d where they get to relax. And with the passage of time, they will \u201ccreate a situation\u201d where they have to keep communicating and growing.",
      "\u201cIt gets to the point at the end where they\u2019re like, \u2018Hey, what should we order for dinner?\u2019 Which is kind of where we all want to get,\u201d she says, questioning what being in a good relationship looks like.",
      "As for Yeun, he brings up a quote his son Jude has been repeating: \u201cWe don\u2019t know where the wind blows.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou look at the world right now and there\u2019s a lot of stuff happening, and you just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be abject suffering, (it could be good).\u201d",
      "What is the message behind 'Love Me'?",
      "Ultimately, Sam Zuchero says \u201cLove Me\u201d is a love story about transformation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about being whatever you want to be, and not being stuck in the static, individualized state,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd not worrying about your brand itself, but just looking inward and trying to find what makes you happy.\u201d"

      "\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve worked extremely hard on is making sure my kids can have as much normalcy and privacy as possible, ensuring my personal life isn\u2019t turned into a brand,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy for celebrities to turn our lives into performance art. I have made an extreme effort to stay true to my boundaries and protect myself and my family. No amount of money is worth my peace.\u201d",

      "\"She\u2019s a natural, but I did not want Blue onstage,\" she said. \"Blue wanted it for herself. She took it seriously and she earned it. And most importantly, she had fun! We all watched her grow more and more every night before our eyes.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 25, 2024, Blue joined Beyonc\u00e9's halftime performance at the Ravens and Texans game in Houston. She stood alongside her mom during \"Texas Hold 'Em\" to close out the set of songs from \"Cowboy Carter.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 honored her daughter's guest appearance by sneaking in a small lyric change, adding: \"Then spin me in the middle, Blue, I can\u2019t read your mind.\"",
      "While Blue is the most public of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s three children, she has managed to maintain a balance between her public appearances and private life.\u00a0On Feb. 20, 2024, she was seen supporting her mom at the launch of Beyonc\u00e9's new hair care line, C\u00e9cred, in LA.

      "In his acceptance speech, he gave Blue a shoutout, saying, \u201cThank you very much. I used to say it was a sippy cup for Blue, but Blue\u2019s grown up now. She doesn\u2019t take sippy cups, and she has her own Grammys.\u201d",
      "Carter's eldest has been involved with voice work at a young age. In November 2020, Blue narrated Matthew A. Cherry\u2019s audiobook \u201cHair Love.\u201d In April 2024, Disney announced that she would voice cub Kiara, the daughter of King Simba and Queen Nala, in Disney's new live-action prequel \u201cMufasa: The Lion King.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 will also star in the project, voicing Nala.",

      "\"She\u2019s self-taught and she sounds like a concert pianist,\u201d Knowles said of Blue. \u201cShe paints, she draws, she does poetry. She\u2019s just an artistic soul.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m really, really proud of her. I can\u2019t wait until the world gets to really hear.\u201d",

      "Rumi Carter, 6",
      "Rumi Carter is the elder of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z's twins, according to a 2017 Vogue article. Like her twin brother, Sir Carter, Rumi was born on June 13, 2017.",
      "In Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2019 Netflix documentary,\u00a0\"Homecoming,\" she opened up about the \u201cextremely difficult pregnancy\" that she went through when she had Rumi and Sir.",
      "\"My body went through more than I knew it could,\u201d she said in the documentary.",

      "\"To this day my arms, shoulders, breasts, and thighs are fuller. I have a little mommy pouch, and I\u2019m in no rush to get rid of it,\" she said at the time. \"I think it\u2019s real.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's twins have since been featured in a few projects that she's worked on like her\u00a0\"Black is King\"\u00a0visual album, where they made an appearance. Rumi was also in the music video for \u201cBrown Skin Girl,\" along with her sister.",
      "Rumi also took center stage in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d album. In the singer\u2019s song \u201cProtector,\u201d Rumi is heard asking her mom, \u201cCan I hear the lullaby please?\u201d at the beginning.",
      "The song appears to be a tribute to her children, with Beyonc\u00e9 singing about motherhood.",
      "She says, \u201cI first saw your face in your father\u2019s gaze/ There\u2019s a long line of hands carryin\u2019 your name, mm/ Liftin\u2019 you up, so you will be raised/ Even though I know someday you\u2019re going to shine on your own/ I will be your projector, yeah.\u201d",
      "Sir Carter, 6",
      "Sir Carter is Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s youngest, though only by a minute, according to a 2017 Vogue article. Sir was born on  June 13, 2017, with his twin sister Rumi.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 revealed in an August 2018 interview with Vogue that she suffered from preeclampsia, a \u201cserious blood pressure condition that develops during pregnancy,\u201d according to the Cleveland Clinic. On the day she gave birth to her twins, she weighed 218 pounds.",
      "\u201cI was swollen from toxemia and had been on bed rest for over a month,\u201d she said. \u201cMy health and my babies\u2019 health were in danger, so I had an emergency C-section. We spent many weeks in the NICU. My husband was a soldier and such a strong support system for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter the C-section, my core felt different. It had been major surgery. Some of your organs are shifted temporarily and, in rare cases, removed temporarily during delivery,\u201d she added.",
      "In October 2023, the \u201c16 Carriages\u201d singer shared a rare glimpse of her twins when she released a video announcing her 2023 movie \u201cRenaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d At one point in the short, 2-minute trailer, the mom of three can be seen kissing her son, Sir. Another clip shows Beyonc\u00e9 holding Sir while on a golf cart.",
      "Why did Jay-Z name his daughters Blue Ivy and Rumi? And why Sir?",
      "In an interview that Jay-Z did with \u201cRap Radar\u201d hosts Elliott Wilson and Brian Miller that was posted on his streaming service,\u00a0Tidal, he explained how he and Beyonc\u00e9 came up with the names Rumi and Sir.",
      "\u201cRumi is our favorite poet, so it was for our daughter,\u201d\u00a0he said, per ABC News. As for Sir? \u201cSir was like, man, come out the gate. He carries himself like that. He just came out, like, Sir,\" he said.",
      "While the Carters have never explained the significance of Blue Ivy's name, fans think her middle name, Ivy, may be a reference to the couple's\u00a0favorite number, four \u2014 in Roman numerals, IV.",
      "The number is significant in their lives: Beyonc\u00e9 was born on Sept. 4, Jay-Z was born on Dec. 4 and they were married on April 4.",
      "CORRECTION: (Dec. 26, 2024, 11:17 a.m.): An earlier version of this story misstated the age of Blue Ivy Carter when she won her first Grammy Award. She was 9 years old, not 10."

To defend himself, Wes warned that he would target anyone who voted against him. His tactic didn't work and pushed the Faithfuls in the opposite direction, making them vote to banish him. \"The Challenge\" star delivered one of his signature boastful speeches before he left, calling himself \"one of the greatest reality competition players of all time.\" He added, \"I don't care about any of you. You are all chess pieces on a board. And so to all those people that have died until I got to this circle right here, I have no idea who killed them because I'm a Faithful.\""

      "\u201cI can give counseling to them, like mindfulness or meditation or breathing,\u201d he said. But often his patients also require medication, which the clinic provides for free.",
      "Thein said he sometimes struggles with anxiety himself stemming from the abuse he received from the junta.",
      "Like most of his patients, Thein\u2019s life took a turn on Feb. 1, 2021, when the Myanmar military \u2014 which has ruled the former British colony for much of its history since it gained independence in 1948 \u2014 overthrew democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Peaceful protests broke out immediately, to which the new military government responded with deadly violence.",
      "According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a nonprofit group that has documented killings and arrests since the coup, the junta has killed at least 6,000 people and arrested more than 28,000. On Friday, Myanmar state media reported that the state of emergency that has been in place since the coup had been extended for another six months, further delaying promised elections.",
      "Though the junta remains in charge, its hold on power has slipped in the face of a coordinated offensive by ethnic rebel groups that have fought the Myanmar military for decades. In the past year the government has lost control of vast swaths of territory around the country, creating instability along Myanmar\u2019s borders with Thailand, India, China and others.",
      "\u201cI want to help my friends, but I don\u2019t want to kill people,\u201d Thein said. \u201cSo I treated the wounded people or wounded soldiers.\u201d",
      "Thein was arrested in 2022 on suspicion of helping the resistance and sent to Myanmar\u2019s notorious Insein Prison.",
      "\u201cThey tortured me with a whip. I think six people beat me during the interrogation. It was really scary,\u201d Thein recalled, as he raised his hands around his head to demonstrate how he tried to protect himself.",
      "Thein was released after a year of detention. Fearing another arrest, he left his life in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city, and fled to Thailand.",
      "Mae Sot has long been a place for Burmese to seek sanctuary, but it is an uneasy refuge. It is filled with people waiting for resettlement, living with constant anguish while facing the risk of arrest and deportation.",
      "Every month, Burmese who lack the documents needed to stay in Thailand legally have to pay local police 300 baht ($9) to obtain a card that prevents them from being detained or deported, but many find this fee unaffordable.",
      "\u201cSome patients were arrested on the way to the clinic by the Thai police because they have no documents,\u201d Thein said.",
      "The clinic\u2019s founder, Cynthia Maung, was also a doctor in Myanmar before she fled in 1988 amid a crackdown by the military government on a pro-democracy uprising.",
      "\u201cI think the struggles now and back then are very similar,\u201d she said.",
      "Mental health is often neglected in Myanmar, where Thein was trained. According to the World Health Organization, as of 2019 there were only 117 psychiatrists and two mental health hospitals in the country of 54 million people.",
      "Shwe Zin Aung is one of Thein\u2019s patients and has been struggling with bipolar disorder for a decade.",
      "The 35-year-old teacher arrived in Mae Sot from Myanmar\u2019s capital city, Naypyidaw, in early December, following in her brother\u2019s footsteps. She said that in addition to free medication, the clinic provided her with a safe place to talk about her feelings.",
      "Though she said she had not personally faced any abuse from the junta, \u201cit is so frustrating to see them brutally shoot the protesters,\u201d she said.",
      "Back home, Thein and his patients had respectable careers and stable lives, but here they are stateless \u2014 as are more than half a million people in Thailand, most of them from Myanmar.",
      "Though Bangkok has not ratified the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention and does not officially recognize refugees, Thai authorities have largely tolerated the influx of people from Myanmar, even before the coup in 2021.",
      "In October, the government of Thailand said it would grant citizenship to nearly 500,000\u00a0long-term residents as well as some children born in the country in an effort to address their legal status.",
      "Though her clinic is well known in Myanmar, Maung, 65, has not been in the country for almost four decades.",
      "When she first arrived in Thailand at the age of 28, Muang assumed she would return home in a few months once the political environment stabilized. But months soon turned into years.",
      "She felt newly hopeful in November 2020, when Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy was elected to a second consecutive term in a landslide. The military coup took place within three months, shattering Maung\u2019s dreams.",
      "Among those driven out of Myanmar by the coup, she said, were psychiatrists and psychologists who came to Mae Sot and have enabled the clinic to expand its services to help others struggling with displacement.",
      "\u201cSometimes, some people feel that this way is usual,\u201d Maung said, \u201cbut this is not normal.\u201d"

Hamas had not provided the names of the first hostages it planned to free that afternoon, so Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered airstrikes to continue.",

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Few people understand what may be going through the minds of North Korean soldiers fighting and dying for Russia in the war against Ukraine. But Lee Chul Eun is one of them.",
      "Lee, 38, a North Korean defector and former soldier now living in South Korea, said it is \u201cdevastating\u201d to see troops from the reclusive, communist-ruled North being sent abroad by leader Kim Jong Un, \u201conly to then give up their youth for a land that is not even theirs but the foreign land of Russia.\u201d",
      "He is one of multiple defectors who spoke to NBC News about the training, conditions and mindset of North Korean soldiers, including their willingness to take their own lives if necessary.",
      "Lee said his former colleagues \u201care essentially just sent out to be cannon fodder on the front lines.\u201d",
      "For the first time since they arrived in Russia in the fall, North Korean soldiers have been captured alive by Ukrainian forces, with video and photos showing one man with bandages around his jawline and another with bandaged hands.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who announced the prisoners\u2019 apprehension earlier this month, said they were living proof that North Korea had entered the war, in a major escalation of the yearslong conflict.",
      "The U.S. and allies say there are more than 11,000 North Korean troops fighting in the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion in August. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has confirmed the reports.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it is not easy to capture a North Korean soldier,\u201d Ryu Sung Hyu said in an interview in the South Korean capital, Seoul.",
      "All North Korean recruits are taught a song that includes a verse about saving their last bullet for themselves to avoid capture, said Ryu, who served in the North Korean military until 2019, when he escaped to freedom in South Korea.",
      "According to South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, there was at least one recent incident in which a North Korean soldier, faced with possible capture by Ukrainian forces, tried to detonate a grenade while shouting Kim\u2019s name but was killed before he could succeed.",
      "The South Korean military said last week that North Korea is preparing to send additional troops to Russia after about 300 of its soldiers were killed and 2,700 others were injured. The high casualty rate was due to the soldiers\u2019 poor understanding of modern warfare, as well as the way they were being deployed by Russia, South Korean lawmakers said.",
      "Their willingness to fight and die for Russia could be a major factor in determining the course of the Ukraine war, as well as the level of American military aid to Ukraine under President Donald Trump, who has expressed skepticism over continued U.S. support.Kim is thought to be providing Russian President Vladimir Putin with troops and weapons in hope of receiving technical assistance with his nuclear and ballistic missile programs. His flurry of weapons testing has continued with three launches already this year, including multiple short-range ballistic missiles, a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile and strategic cruise missiles.",
      "Trump drew ire from South Korea on Tuesday after he described the reclusive regime as a \u201cnuclear power,\u201d a phrase that U.S. officials have long refrained from using, as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.",
      "Kim is sending troops to Russia for two reasons, \u201cboth of which are driven by desperation,\u201d said Ahn Chan Il, who served in the North Korean military for over a decade and defected to South Korea in 1979. The first is to earn foreign currency, which is in short supply in North Korea under United Nations sanctions imposed over its weapons programs.The deployment also provides valuable experience for the North Korean military, which has not been deployed overseas since the Vietnam War.",
      "Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council this month that fighting alongside Russia makes North Korea \u201cmore capable of waging war against its neighbors.\u201d",
      "Lee, who spent five years in the North Korean military, said the troops had been sent to Russia as mercenaries rather than soldiers, noting that they weren\u2019t wearing their uniforms. South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service has said they were given Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, along with forged identification documents.",
      "\u201cEven if they die there it does not matter, because North Korea sent them out without officially recognizing them,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey were sent there not to bring honor to the country, but to give up their lives and bring back lots of money.\u201d",
      "'No longer a part of the society'",
      "Military service is compulsory in North Korea, which has one of the world\u2019s largest standing armies. Soldiers undergo three months of basic training before being assigned to a unit, said Lee, who came to South Korea in 2016 after swimming for six hours from the North.",
      "\u201cAs soldiers,\u201d Lee said, \u201cthey are told they are individuals who are now no longer a part of the society and their families, and must follow the orders of the supreme leader,\u201d meaning Kim.",
      "They have no trouble believing this, having been indoctrinated by North Korean propaganda from childhood, said Lee.",
      "North Korean soldiers spend most of their time not actually being soldiers but working on farms and construction projects, Lee and others said.",
      "\u201cI think I only fired three bullets per year,\u201d said Lee Hyun-seung, who served in the North Korean military for more than three years. When he moved to a more elite unit, he said, \u201cwe had more like 20 bullets.\u201dAsked whether he thought the North Korean troops could help Russia win the war, Lee \u2014 whose family defected in 2014 and who now lives in the U.S. \u2014 was skeptical.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not that sure,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I know their training and I know they are not well trained.\u201d",
      "For North Korean soldiers, who receive food and clothing but are otherwise essentially unpaid, the main enemy is hunger.",
      "North Korea struggles with food shortages as Kim devotes the majority of resources to his weapons programs, meaning that, like most of the broader population, soldiers suffer from malnutrition and can even starve to death.",
      "Meals are made up mainly of plain rice, corn or potatoes, sometimes mixed with grass or even tree bark, said Lee Chun Eul.",
      "He said his feelings about North Korea changed gradually, largely due to his exposure to foreign media that finds its way into the country despite tight government controls \u2014 \u201cJames Bond\u201d was a favorite of his growing up in the 1990s. More recently, the North Korean government has been alarmed by the popularity of South Korean TV dramas, sentencing two teenagers to 12 years of hard labor for watching them.",
      "\u201cWhen I look at North Korean mercenaries sent to Russia, I wonder if they would still have joined if they had watched as much foreign media as I did in North Korea,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI also wonder if the North Korean regime and Kim Jong Un\u2019s dictatorship would still be in place.\u201d",
      "The defectors say they hope the North Korean troops fighting in Russia will take the opportunity to leave like they did.",
      "\u201cWhen North Korean workers, who have lived their entire lives trapped in a restrictive system, experience life abroad, they come to see North Korea as nothing short of a prison,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cOnce they realize what freedom could mean, it\u2019s hard to imagine they wouldn\u2019t consider breaking free to live a freer life.\u201dIn addition to finding freedom, they could provide the U.S. and others with valuable intelligence regarding the North Korean military\u2019s strategies and capabilities, which are often exaggerated by the North Korean government.",
      "Ahn and other North Koreans who defected as soldiers have offered Ukraine their assistance against the North Korean troops.",
      "\u201cHowever, rather than directly participating in the war, our focus is on psychological warfare to change the mindset of North Korean soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough platforms like YouTube or leaflets, we aim to deliver messages to the North Korean troops, urging them not to die meaningless deaths and instead seek freedom.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, they watch with heavy hearts as casualties mount among North Korean soldiers whose experiences they know only too well.",

They wanted to obliterate even their memory.\u201d",
      "Avram said researchers have started experimenting with artificial intelligence to scour testimonial documents in hope of finding names that might have been overlooked. But that technology is useless without firsthand accounts provided by the shrinking pool of survivors.",

      "Officials from the Trump administration had said earlier on Friday that one of Grenell\u2019s top aims for the visit was to secure the release of Americans detained in the country, at a time when the Trump administration has been driving a deportation and anti-gang push in the United States.",
      "Grenell did not name the six men, shown with him aboard an airplane in a photo he posted online. They were dressed in light blue outfits used by the Venezuelan prison system.",
      "\u201cWe are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens,\u201d Grenell posted on X. \u201cThey just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and they couldn\u2019t stop thanking him.\u201d",
      "Trump cheered the move in his own post, saying Grenell was bringing \u201csix hostages home from Venezuela.\u201d",
      "It is unclear exactly how many Americans were being held by Venezuela, but Venezuelan officials have spoken publicly of at least nine.",
      "Maduro\u2019s officials have accused most of them of terrorism and said some were high-level \u201cmercenaries.\u201d The Venezuelan government regularly accuses members of the opposition and foreign detainees of conspiring with the U.S. to commit terrorism. U.S. officials have always denied any plots.",
      "\u201cAmerican hostages that are being held in Venezuela ... must be released immediately,\u201d Mauricio Claver-Carone, the U.S. special\u00a0envoy\u00a0for Latin America, said earlier on Friday, adding the Grenell-Maduro meeting was \u201cnot a negotiation in exchange for anything.\u201d",
      "In late 2023, Venezuela\u2019s government released\u00a0dozens of prisoners, including 10 Americans, after months of negotiations, while the U.S. released a close ally of Maduro.",
      "Maduro told officials in an annual speech to the judiciary late on Friday evening that the meeting between him and Grenell had been positive.",
      "\u201cThere are things where we\u2019ve reached initial deals and when they are complied with, new issues will open, hopefully new deals for the good of the two countries and the region,\u201d Maduro said, adding he would be looking to see if what had been discussed with Grenell was reflected in what is communicated by the U.S. about the meeting.",
      "\u201cPresident Donald Trump, we have made a first step, hopefully it can continue,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cWe would like it to continue.\u201d",
      "Maduro and Grenell also discussed migration and sanctions at the presidential palace, the Venezuelan government said in a statement earlier on Friday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier on Friday that Grenell was also focused on ensuring 400 members of the Tren de Aragua gang in U.S. custody are returned to Venezuela.",
      "An agreement on Tren de Aragua deportations was \u201cnon-negotiable,\u201d Claver-Carone said.",
      "Venezuelan attorney general Tarek Saab said last week that the gang had been dismantled in Venezuela in 2023, but that it was willing to restart legal cooperation with the U.S. in order to extradite gang members.",
      "Since taking power on Jan. 20, Trump has kicked off a\u00a0sweeping immigration crackdown, pledging mass deportations.",
      "Some 600,000 Venezuelans in the United States were eligible for deportation reprieves granted by the previous administration, but U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she would cut the duration of the protections. She must\u00a0decide by Saturday\u00a0whether to terminate them.",
      "Grenell\u2019s visit does not mean the United States recognizes Maduro as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader, Leavitt said.",
      "The two countries have a fraught recent history marked by broken relations, sanctions and accusations of coup-plotting.",
      "But they share interest in several\u00a0pending bilateral issues, including a license allowing U.S. oil major Chevron\u00a0to operate in Venezuela.",
      "The administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden reinstated broad oil sanctions after it said Maduro failed to keep promises for a free presidential election and later\u00a0increased rewards\u00a0for the capture or conviction of leaders including Maduro, leaving Trump limited options for further penalties.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government-backed victory in the July 2024 vote is contested by the opposition, international observers and numerous countries, including the United States.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government has always rejected sanctions by the United States and others, saying they are illegitimate measures which amount to an \u201ceconomic war\u201d designed to cripple Venezuela.",
      "The Financial Times reported on Friday that Chevron is trying to protect a special U.S. license allowing it to operate in Venezuela.",
      "Chevron chief executive Mike Wirth told the newspaper the company would engage with the White House, after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the license should be reconsidered and Trump said the U.S. would likely\u00a0stop buying oil\u00a0from Venezuela."

    "summary": "The White House said Friday that President Donald Trump would impose a 25% tariff on goods coming to the U.S. from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on those from China on Saturday, a move that could drive up prices for products coming into the U.S. from those countries.",

      "The White House said Friday that President Donald Trump would impose a 25% tariff on goods coming to the U.S. from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on those from China on Saturday, a move that could drive up prices for products coming into the U.S. from those countries.",
      "Trump had said he would issue those tariffs on the first day of his presidency, then said on Inauguration Day that the tariffs would be put in place on Feb. 1. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Friday that Trump would carry through on that Feb. 1 deadline.",
      "Trump said Friday that there was nothing that the three countries could do to avoid the tariffs, which he said were in response to the import of fentanyl into the U.S. and because the U.S. has a trade deficit with the three countries. The U.S. is considered to have a trade deficit with those countries because it buys more goods and services from them than it sells to them.",
      "The tariffs could increase how much U.S. consumers and businesses pay for goods coming from Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 including electronics, toys, shoes, fresh produce, lumber and cars. Tariffs are paid by companies importing goods into the U.S., similar to a tax.",
      "While some businesses will look to source goods elsewhere, others with no alternatives will be forced to pay the fees. Companies will have to decide whether to pass these higher costs to consumers or absorb them, which would dent profits or require cuts to protect their margins. The implications could be wide-reaching across the U.S. economy, in part because American consumers and businesses imported more goods from Mexico than any other country.",
      "Trump also said he would be putting tariffs on oil and gas imports in the next several weeks as well as on computer chips, steel and aluminum, but didn't provide any details. In addition, he said he would be putting a \"tariff wall\" around pharmaceuticals to bring the industry back to the U.S.",
      "\"It'll be a tremendous amount of money for our country, tremendous amount, these are big numbers,\" Trump told reporters Friday. \"And in addition to that, and you see the power of the tariff, I mean, the tariff is good, and nobody can compete with us because we have by far the biggest piggy bank.\"",
      "When asked about the impact tariffs will have on inflation, Leavitt cited relatively low inflation during Trump's first term when he placed tariffs on billions of Chinese goods.",
      "\"President Trump is going to do everything he possibly can to cut the inflation crisis that the previous administration imposed on the American people, and he will continue to effectively utilize tariffs,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Tariffs during Trump's first term were more limited in scope than the current proposal and included a long list of exemptions and delays for certain products and industries. Economists have found those tariffs drove up prices for some imports, led to a net loss of manufacturing jobs and reduced corporate investments as a result of higher costs companies had to pay to import materials and parts.",
      "Mexico and Canada have threatened to retaliate with their own tariffs on U.S. imports, which could hurt American businesses that sell to those countries, like oil producers, farmers and manufacturers.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that he was meeting with U.S. and Canadian officials to try to prevent the tariffs from being put in place, but that Canada was prepared to respond if tariffs were enacted.",
      "\u201cIf the President does choose to implement any tariffs against Canada, we\u2019re ready with a response. A purposeful, forceful, but reasonable immediate response,\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday. \"We won\u2019t relent until tariffs are removed and, of course, everything is on the table.\u201d",
      "During Trump's first term, China placed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agriculture products, and nearly all the revenue collected by the U.S. from the tariffs on China went to payments to American farmers to offset their losses from those Chinese tariffs.",
      "The U.S. auto industry is among the most vulnerable to the tariffs on Mexico and Canada. For decades, its supply chains have been heavily intertwined with America\u2019s neighbors to the north and south. As vehicles and components cross borders multiple times during the production process, repeated 25% levies could quickly drive up vehicle costs.",
      "The U.S. also depends on agricultural products from Mexico, one of the top suppliers of tomatoes, avocados, berries and peppers. Rising food prices have been a top concern for consumers and voters, with grocery costs up around 25% over the past four years \u2014 an issue Trump hammered on the campaign trail.",
      "The tariffs on Canada could also drive up prices of oil imported from Canada and Canadian lumber,  which could drive up the cost of new homes and other construction projects.",

      "Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany\u2019s CDU/CSU conservative bloc, is keen to seize the initiative on migration policy, which has shifted sharply back into focus after an Afghan asylum seeker was arrested over\u00a0deadly stabbings\u00a0last week.",

      "Sharaa has pledged to embark on a political transition including a national conference, an inclusive government, and eventual elections, which he has said could take up to four years to hold.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s announcement did not say when the new legislative body might be picked or provide any new details for a timeline for the transition.",
      "Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, said the declaration had \u201cformalized his status as the strongman ruler.\u201d \u201cMy take is that HTS and Sharaa intend to consolidate single-party Islamist rule.\u201d",
      "HTS emerged from the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in the\u00a0Syrian civil war, until it cut ties in 2016.",
      "The declaration announced that \u201cSharaa has assumed the presidency of the country in the transitional phase\u201d and would \u201ccarry out the duties of the presidency of the\u00a0Syrian Arab Republic, and represent it in international forums.\u201d",
      "The new legislative council would carry out its tasks until a new constitution is adopted. The parliament elected under Assad last year was formally dissolved.",
      "The declaration also reiterated previous steps dissolving Assad\u2019s Baath Party and his state security apparatus and said rebel groups that fought him during 13 years of war were to be dissolved and merged into the state.",
      "The announcements came at a meeting declared \u201cThe Conference for Announcing the Victory of the\u00a0Syrian Revolution.\u201d It was attended by ministers from the interim government appointed by HTS in December and was not publicly announced ahead of time.",
      "Qatar, which backs the new administration, issued a statement after the declaration welcoming \u201cmoves to restructure the\u00a0Syrian state and boost consensus and unity among all its parties.\u201d",
      "Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center said the announcement was a raw translation of Sharaa\u2019s newfound power and military control of great parts of\u00a0Syria\u00a0including the capital.\u201d",
      "It \u201cdoes not reflect the political, religious and ethnic diversity of\u00a0Syria,\u201d he added.",
      "Apparent celebratory gunfire could be heard in central Damascus soon after the announcements."
