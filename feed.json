Beneath a photo of him holding his bride, Samantha Leonard, 28, he wrote the caption, \u201ctougher than the rest,\u201d a reference to the Bruce Springsteen song of the same name. In the next slide of the two-frame carousel, Bryan shared a short clip of him covering the song.",

      "Bryan shared a tribute to Leonard on his Instagram account a few months later, in October, writing, \u201cToday is your birthday and I love you, Samantha Marie.

      "NEW YORK -- The Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny has redefined what it means to be a global giant \u2014 and he may once again make history at the 2026 Grammy Awards.",
      "The artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio is up for six awards at the Feb. 1 show, becoming the first Spanish-language artist to be nominated for album, song and record of the year simultaneously. His critically acclaimed album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d is only the second Spanish-language record to be nominated for album of the year. The first? Well, that also belonged to Bad Bunny, 2022\u2019s \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti.\u201d",
      "Win or lose, experts say Bad Bunny's Grammy nominations mark a symbolic moment for Latinos. Just a week later, after all, he'll headline the Super Bowl halftime show.",
      "Vanessa D\u00edaz, associate professor of Chicano and Latino studies at Loyola Marymount University and co-author of \u201cP FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance,\u201d says Bad Bunny's nods extend beyond his own art and serve as a \u201cvery welcome recognition of Latin music that is growing.\u201d",
      "\u201cMusic from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean has been shaping global music tastes since the 19th century,\u201d adds Albert Laguna, associate professor of ethnicity, race and migration and American studies at Yale. \u201cBad Bunny is another link in a much longer chain of the popularity of Caribbean music on a global stage.\u201d",
      "Much of this music \u2014 particularly Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n, the genres Bad Bunny got his start in and continues to use in his new work \u2014 has been historically criminalized in Puerto Rico, not unlike hip-hop in the United States. Reggaet\u00f3n in particular, D\u00edaz points out, \u201ccomes from the most marginalized communities in Puerto Rico. And so, the fact that Bad Bunny is receiving nominations in three main categories, and this is an artist who came up with trap \u2026 is the most groundbreaking thing about the entire situation.\u201d",
      "Petra Rivera-Rideau, associate professor of American studies at Wellesley College and co-author of \u201cP FKN R,\u201d says that element is particularly noteworthy because institutions often ignore marginalized genres \u2014 including at the Latin Grammys, a sister award show to the Grammys.",
      "A victory in the major categories could have \u201cprofound, symbolic meaning,\u201d she says. But with a caveat: \u201cI\u2019m interested to see if this is going to open doors for other people.\u201d After all, Bad Bunny himself isn't immune to the Recording Academy\u2019s institutional biases: He already has three career Grammys, but all have been in m\u00fasica urbana categories \u2014 despite the fact that he is the most streamed artist on the planet.",
      "Across \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d Bad Bunny and his producers weave traditional Puerto Rican folkloric styles into a hyper-contemporary context. Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n aren't abandoned but fused with m\u00fasica j\u00edbara, salsa, bomba, plena and even aguinaldo, a kind of Christmas music, in \u201cPitorro de Coco.\u201d While Bad Bunny\u2019s previous albums also fused different genres \u2014 including bossa nova, mambo, rock, merengue and more \u2014 this album\u2019s melange was more homegrown.",
      "Laguna sees \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d as a direct challenge to the prevailing \u201cformula for global pop stardom,\u201d which he describes as an artist making it locally, gaining traction and then \u201cwatering down\u201d their sound into something commercial and palatable for a global audience.",
      "\u201cBad Bunny went in the opposite direction. It\u2019s his most Puerto Rican album ever,\u201d says Laguna. He hopes it will communicate to other artists that they, too, can look to their ancestry and history for artmaking.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much amazing Latin music that has been overlooked and that\u2019s part of what is so beautiful about this moment,\u201d says D\u00edaz. \u201cAnd that's why it feels like a win for all Latinos.\u201d",
      "The timing of the album's release and recognition, too, feels consequential. \u201cThe U.S. has a history of othering Latinos, othering the Spanish language. \u2026 We\u2019re in a moment where that feels extremely acute,\u201d she continues. \u201cFor a community that is being targeted on such a deep level, it is a little bit of light, a little bit of faith that we can still carve out our place here.\u201d",

      "Latinos and the Spanish-speaking community in the U.S. have grown increasingly wary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation and routine hearings have turned into deportation traps for migrants.",
      "In an interview with i-D Magazine earlier this year, Bad Bunny mentioned that concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos factored into his decision not to tour in the continental U.S. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico itself since large-scale arrests began in late January.)",
      "\u201cThe content of the lyrics \u2014 which are so steeped in the history of Puerto Rico, political histories, tourism and gentrification \u2014 there\u2019s so much rich political and historical content,\u201d D\u00edaz adds. \u201cThis album is historic even without a Grammy win.\u201d",
      "But if Bad Bunny does win, D\u00edaz says, it will be \u201cakin to Halle Berry being the first Black woman to win an Oscar. That was a watershed moment. Or Rita Moreno being the first Latina to win.\u201d",
      "Beyond that, Laguna says the politics of the album are not exclusive to Puerto Rican or even Latino identity \u2014 \u201cthe lyrics on this album align with global struggles,\u201d he says. Take, for example, \u201cLo que le pas\u00f3 a Hawaii\u201d (\u201cWhat happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for cultural autonomy in an era of neocolonialization.",
      "Rivera-Rideau says one of the reasons \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d has resonated is not just the political implications of using folkloric music in addition to m\u00fasica urbana, but its sound. The traditional genres are \u201ca lot more digestible\u201d to listeners who embrace the antiquated taboos surrounding Latin trap and scoff at reggaet\u00f3n's sexuality. As a result, the combination of sounds makes for an album that is \u201cpopular across generations,\u201d she says.",
      "But it only works because it is \u201cmusically really interesting. If it was just traditional music, and that's only what people cared about, it wouldn't have done as well as it did,\u201d she explains. \u201cMusically, it is super innovative and makes accessible a lot of these older genres that people in Puerto Rico listen to, but he\u2019s been able to globalize these very local genres in a way that no one else has.\u201d",
      "That intergenerational appeal was a feature of Bad Bunny's landmark Puerto Rican residency, with the age and global diversity of its audience.",
      "\u201cA lot of people feel like this is a tense moment, it\u2019s a difficult moment. And here\u2019s someone giving us a sonic language in which to narrate this complex present,\u201d Laguna says. \u201cThere's pleasure, in political critique, that the music makes possible in a beautiful way. And I think that's very much welcomed.\u201d",

      "French 1960s sex symbol Brigitte Bardot has died at age 91",
      "PARIS -- Brigitte Bardot, the French 1960s sex symbol who became one of the greatest screen sirens of the 20th century and later a militant animal rights activist and far-right supporter, has died. She was 91.",
      "Bardot died Sunday at her home in southern France, according to Bruno Jacquelin, of the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals. Speaking to The Associated Press, he gave no cause of death, and said that no arrangements had been made for funeral or memorial services. She had been hospitalized last month.",
      "Bardot became an international celebrity as a sexualized teen bride in the 1956 movie \u201cAnd God Created Woman.\u201d Directed by then husband Roger Vadim, it triggered a scandal with scenes of the long-legged beauty dancing on tables naked.",
      "At the height of a cinema career that spanned more than two dozen films and three marriages, Bardot came to symbolize a nation bursting out of bourgeois respectability. Her tousled, blond hair, voluptuous figure and pouty irreverence made her one of France\u2019s best-known stars, even as she struggled with depression.",
      "Such was her widespread appeal that in 1969 her features were chosen to be the model for \u201cMarianne,\u201d the national emblem of France and the official Gallic seal. Bardot\u2019s face appeared on statues, postage stamps and coins.",
      "\u2018\u2019We are mourning a legend,'' French President Emmanuel Macron said in an X post.",
      "Bardot\u2019s second career as an animal rights activist was equally sensational. She traveled to the Arctic to blow the whistle on the slaughter of baby seals. She also condemned the use of animals in laboratory experiments, and she opposed Muslim slaughter rituals.",
      "\u201cMan is an insatiable predator,\u201d Bardot told The Associated Press on her 73rd birthday, in 2007. \u201cI don\u2019t care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\u201d",
      "Her activism earned her compatriots\u2019 respect and, in 1985, she was awarded the Legion of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest recognition.",
      "Later, however, she fell from public grace as her animal protection diatribes took on a decidedly extremist tone. She frequently decried the influx of immigrants into France, especially Muslims.",
      "She was convicted and fined five times in French courts of inciting racial hatred, in incidents inspired by her opposition to the Muslim practice of slaughtering sheep during annual religious holidays.",
      "Bardot\u2019s 1992 marriage to fourth husband Bernard d\u2019Ormale, a onetime adviser to far-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, contributed to her political shift. She described Le Pen, an outspoken nationalist with multiple racism convictions of his own, as a \u201clovely, intelligent man.\u201d",
      "In 2012, she supported the presidential bid of Marine Le Pen, who now leads her father's renamed National Rally party. Le Pen paid homage Sunday to an \u201cexceptional woman\u201d who was \u201cincredibly French.\u201d",
      "In 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Bardot said in an interview that most actors protesting sexual harassment in the film industry were \u201chypocritical,\u201d because many played \u201cthe teases\u201d with producers to land parts.",
      "She said she had never had been a victim of sexual harassment and found it \u201ccharming to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a nice little ass.\u201d",
      "Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born Sept. 28, 1934, to a wealthy industrialist. A shy child, she studied classical ballet and was discovered by a family friend who put her on the cover of Elle magazine at age 14.",
      "Bardot once described her childhood as \u201cdifficult\u201d and said that her father was a strict disciplinarian who would sometimes punish her with a horse whip.",
      "Vadim, a French movie produce who she married in 1952, saw her potential and wrote \u201cAnd God Created Woman\u201d to showcase her provocative sensuality, an explosive cocktail of childlike innocence and raw sexuality.",
      "The film, which portrayed Bardot as a teen who marries to escape an orphanage and then beds her brother-in-law, had a decisive influence on New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, and came to embody the hedonism and sexual freedom of the 1960s.",
      "The film was a box-office hit, and it made Bardot a superstar. Her girlish pout, tiny waist and generous bust were often more appreciated than her talent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an embarrassment to have acted so badly,\u201d Bardot said of her early films. \u201cI suffered a lot in the beginning. I was really treated like someone less than nothing.\u201d",

      "Bardot\u2019s unabashed, off-screen love affair with co-star Jean-Louis Trintignant eradicated the boundaries between her public and private life and turned her into a hot prize for paparazzi.",
      "Bardot never adjusted to the limelight. She blamed the constant media attention for the suicide attempt that followed 10 months after the birth of her only child, Nicolas. Photographers had broken into her house two weeks before she gave birth to snap a picture of her pregnant.",
      "Nicolas\u2019 father was Jacques Charrier, a French actor who she married in 1959 but who never felt comfortable in his role as Monsieur Bardot. Bardot soon gave up her son to his father, and later said she had been chronically depressed and unready for the duties of being a mother.",
      "\u201cI was looking for roots then,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI had none to offer.\u201d",
      "In her 1996 autobiography \u201cInitiales B.B.,\u201d she likened her pregnancy to \u201ca tumor growing inside me,\u201d and described Charrier as \u201ctemperamental and abusive.\u201d",
      "Bardot married her third husband, West German millionaire playboy Gunther Sachs, in 1966, and they divorced three years later.",
      "Among her films were \u201cA Parisian\u201d (1957); \u201cIn Case of Misfortune,\u201d in which she starred in 1958 with screen legend Jean Gabin; \u201cThe Truth\u201d (1960); \u201cPrivate Life\u201d (1962); \u201cA Ravishing Idiot\u201d (1964); \u201cShalako\u201d (1968); \u201cWomen\u201d (1969); \u201cThe Bear And The Doll\u201d (1970); \u201cRum Boulevard\u201d (1971); and \u201cDon Juan\u201d (1973).",
      "With the exception of 1963\u2019s critically acclaimed \u201cContempt,\u201d directed by Godard, Bardot\u2019s films were rarely complicated by plots. Often they were vehicles to display Bardot in scanty dresses or frolicking nude in the sun.",
      "\u201cIt was never a great passion of mine,\u201d she said of filmmaking. \u201cAnd it can be deadly sometimes. Marilyn (Monroe) perished because of it.\u201d",
      "Bardot retired to her Riviera villa in St. Tropez at the age of 39 in 1973 after \u201cThe Woman Grabber.\u201d As fans brought flowers to her home Sunday, the local St. Tropez administration called for \"respect for the privacy of her family and the serenity of the places where she lived.\"",
      "She emerged a decade later with a new persona: An animal rights lobbyist, her face was wrinkled and her voice was deep following years of heavy smoking. She abandoned her jet-set life and sold off movie memorabilia and jewelry to create a foundation devoted exclusively to the prevention of animal cruelty.",
      "Depression sometimes dogged her, and she said that she attempted suicide again on her 49th birthday.",
      "Her activism knew no borders. She urged South Korea to ban the sale of dog meat and once wrote to U.S. President Bill Clinton asking why the U.S. Navy recaptured two dolphins it had released into the wild.",
      "She attacked centuries-old French and Italian sporting traditions including the Palio, a free-for-all horse race, and campaigned on behalf of wolves, rabbits, kittens and turtle doves.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s true that sometimes I get carried away, but when I see how slowly things move forward ... my distress takes over,\u201d Bardot told the AP when asked about her racial hatred convictions and opposition to Muslim ritual slaughter,",
      "In 1997, several towns removed Bardot-inspired statues of Marianne after the actress voiced anti-immigrant sentiment. Also that year, she received death threats after calling for a ban on the sale of horse meat.",
      "Environmental campaigner Paul Watson, who was beaten on a seal hunt protest in Canada alongside Bardot in 1977 and campaigned with her for five decades, acknowledged that \u201cmany disagreed with Brigitte\u2019s politics or some of her views.\u201d",
      "\u201cHer allegiance was not to the world of humans,\u201d he said. \u201cThe animals of this world lost a wonderful friend today.\u201d",
      "Bardot once said that she identified with the animals that she was trying to save.",
      "\u201cI can understand hunted animals, because of the way I was treated,\u201d Bardot said. \u201cWhat happened to me was inhuman. I was constantly surrounded by the world press.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration has announced the initial disbursement from its $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program",
      "States will share $10 billion for rural health care next year in a program that aims to offset the Trump administration's massive budget cuts to rural hospitals, federal officials announced Monday.",
      "But while every state applied for money from the Rural Health Transformation Program, it won't be distributed equally. And critics worry that the funding might be pulled back if a state's policies don't match up with the administration's.",
      "Officials said the average award for 2026 is $200 million, and the fund puts a total of $50 billion into rural health programs over five years. States propose how to spend their awards, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigns project officers to support each state, said agency administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz.",
      "\u201cThis fund was crafted as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill, signed only six months ago now into law, in order to push states to be creative,\" Oz said in a call with reporters Monday.",
      "Under the program, half of the money is equally distributed to each state. The other half is allocated based on a formula developed by CMS that considered rural population size, the financial health of a state\u2019s medical facilities and health outcomes for a state\u2019s population.",
      "The formula also ties $12 billion of the five-year funding to whether states are implementing health policies prioritized by the Trump administration's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative. Examples include requiring nutrition education for health care providers, having schools participate in the Presidential Fitness Test or banning the use of SNAP benefits for so-called junk foods, Oz said.",
      "Several Republican-led states \u2014 including Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas \u2014 have already adopted rules banning the purchase of foods like candy and soda with SNAP benefits.",
      "The money that the states get will be recalculated annually, Oz said, allowing the administration to \u201cclaw back\u201d funds if, for example, state leaders don't pass promised policies. Oz said the clawbacks are not punishments, but leverage governors can use to push policies by pointing to the potential loss of millions.",
      "\u201cI've already heard governors express that sentiment that this is not a threat, that this is actually an empowering element of the One Big Beautiful Bill,\" he said.",
      "Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said she\u2019s heard from a number of Democratic-led states that refused to include such restrictions on SNAP benefits even though it could hurt their chance to get more money from the fund.",

      "But experts say it won't nearly offset the losses that struggling rural hospitals will face from the federal spending law's $1.2 trillion cut from the federal budget over the next decade, primarily from Medicaid. Millions of people are also expected to lose Medicaid benefits.",
      "Estimates suggest rural hospitals could lose around $137 billion over the next decade because of the budget measure. As many as 300 rural hospitals were at risk for closure because of the GOP\u2019s spending package, according to an analysis by The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.",
      "\u201cWhen you put that up against the $50 billion for the Rural Health Transformation Fund, you know \u2014 that math does not add up,\u201d Cochran-McClain said.",
      "She also said there's no guarantee that the funding will go to rural hospitals in need. For example, she noted, one state\u2019s application included a proposal for healthier, locally sourced school lunch options in rural areas.",
      "And even though innovation is a goal of the program, Cochran-McClain said it's tough for rural hospitals to innovate when they were struggling to break even before Congress\u2019 Medicaid cuts.",
      "\u201cWe talk to rural providers every day that say, \u2018I would really love to do x, y, z, but I\u2019m concerned about, you know, meeting payroll at the end of the month,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSo when you\u2019re in that kind of crisis mode, it is, I would argue, almost impossible to do true innovation.\u201d",

      "Climate change worsened by human behavior made 2025 one of the hottest years ever recorded",
      "Climate change worsened by human behavior made 2025 one of the three hottest years on record, scientists said.",
      "It was also the first time that the three-year temperature average broke through the threshold set in the 2015 Paris Agreement of limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times. Experts say that keeping the Earth below that limit could save lives and prevent catastrophic environmental destruction around the globe.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution researchers, released Tuesday in Europe, came after a year when people around the world were slammed by the dangerous extremes brought on by a warming planet.",
      "Temperatures remained high despite the presence of a La Nina, the occasional natural cooling of Pacific Ocean waters that influences weather worldwide. Researchers cited the continued burning of fossil fuels \u2014 oil, gas and coal \u2014 that send planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t stop burning fossil fuels very, very, quickly, very soon, it will be very hard to keep that goal\u201d of warming, Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College London climate scientist, told The Associated Press. \u201cThe science is increasingly clear.\u201d",
      "Extreme weather events kill thousands of people and cost billions of dollars in damage annually.",
      "WWA scientists identified 157 extreme weather events as most severe in 2025, meaning they met criteria such as causing more than 100 deaths, affecting more than half an area\u2019s population or having a state of emergency declared. Of those, they closely analyzed 22.",
      "That included dangerous heat waves, which the WWA said were the world's deadliest extreme weather events in 2025. The researchers said some of the heat waves they studied in 2025 were 10 times more likely than they would have been a decade ago due to climate change.",
      "\u201cThe heat waves we have observed this year are quite common events in our climate today, but they would have been almost impossible to occur without human-induced climate change,\u201d Otto said. \u201cIt makes a huge difference.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, prolonged drought contributed to wildfires that scorched Greece and Turkey. Torrential rains and flooding in Mexico killed dozens of people and left many more missing. Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed the Philippines, forcing more than a million people to evacuate. Monsoon rains battered India with floods and landslides.",
      "The WWA said the increasingly frequent and severe extremes threatened the ability of millions of people across the globe to respond and adapt to those events with enough warning, time and resources, what the scientists call \u201climits of adaptation.\u201d The report pointed to Hurricane Melissa as an example: The storm intensified so quickly that it made forecasting and planning more difficult, and pummeled Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti so severely that it left the small island nations unable to respond to and handle its extreme losses and damage.",
      "This year's United Nations climate talks in Brazil in November ended without any explicit plan to transition away from fossil fuels, and though more money was pledged to help countries adapt to climate change, they will take more time to do it.",
      "Officials, scientists, and analysts have conceded that Earth\u2019s warming will overshoot 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), though some say reversing that trend remains possible.",

      "\u201cThe geopolitical weather is very cloudy this year with a lot of policymakers very clearly making policies for the interest of the fossil fuel industry rather than for the populations of their countries,\" Otto said. \u201cAnd we have a huge amount of mis- and disinformation that people have to deal with.\u201d",
      "Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia University Climate School who wasn't involved in the WWA work, said places are seeing disasters they aren't used to, extreme events are intensifying faster and they are becoming more complex. That requires earlier warnings and new approaches to response and recovery, he said.",

      "Buyer beware: Healthy grocery buzzwords like those often cover up an unhealthy amount of sugar.",

      "Here\u2019s how to spot hidden sugars and what to do about it.",
      "Along with saturated fat and salt, eating excess sugar is linked to heart disease, obesity, diabetes and other health risks.",
      "The average American consumes 17 teaspoons of added sugar a day, which adds up to 57 pounds (26 kilograms) per year, according to the American Heart Association. About half of that comes from beverages, but much of the rest is sneaked into cereal, salsa, prepared sandwiches, dairy products, bottled sauces and baked goods, including many brands of whole-grain bread.",
      "To help control sugar intake, start by checking the nutrition label. Since 2021, food companies have been required to list the quantity of added sugars separately from total sugar content. But the plan backfired, Avena said.",
      "Companies reduced common sweeteners like refined beet sugar and high-fructose corn syrup but added alternatives, such as monk fruit and the sugar alcohol erythritol, which aren\u2019t considered \u201cadded sugars\u201d under FDA regulations.",
      "\u201cNow our foods are even more sweet than they were back in 2020,\u201d Avena said.",
      "Collin Popp, a dietitian and professor at NYU Langone Health, said the current FDA recommendation allows for some flexibility. People should get no more than 10% of their calories from added sugar, which amounts to about 50 grams per day if eating 2,000 calories, or a bit more than what\u2019s in a typical can of soda.",
      "But that might be too flexible, Popp said.",
      "\u201cI would actually like to see that be less than 5%, and closer to zero for some, if they have diabetes or prediabetes,\u201d he said.",

She said research shows that sweet flavors are what activate the reward center of the brain, not the sugar itself.",
      "That\u2019s not to write off sugar alternatives, including allulose for people with Type 1 diabetes since it doesn\u2019t affect blood sugar.",
      "But for the general public, minimizing dependence on the overall sweetness of food is key to improving health, she said.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Enhanced tax credits that have helped reduce the cost of health insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees expired overnight, cementing higher health costs for millions of Americans at the start of the new year.",
      "Democrats forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue. Moderate Republicans called for a solution to save their 2026 political aspirations. President Donald Trump floated a way out, only to back off after conservative backlash.",
      "In the end, no one\u2019s efforts were enough to save the subsidies before their expiration date. A House vote expected in January could offer another chance, but success is far from guaranteed.",
      "The change affects a diverse cross-section of Americans who don\u2019t get their health insurance from an employer and don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid or Medicare \u2014 a group that includes many self-employed workers, small business owners, farmers and ranchers.",
      "It comes at the start of a high-stakes midterm election year, with affordability \u2014 including the cost of health care \u2014 topping the list of voters\u2019 concerns.",
      "\u201cIt really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,\u201d said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose health care costs are set to jump. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly disappointed that there hasn\u2019t been more action.\u201d",
      "The expired subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help Americans get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time extended them, moving the expiration date to the start of 2026.",
      "With the expanded subsidies, some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.",
      "On average, the more than 20 million subsidized enrollees in the Affordable Care Act program are seeing their premium costs rise by 114% in 2026, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",

Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It\u2019s a strain for the 49-year-old but one he\u2019s willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.",

      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she\u2019ll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her four-year-old daughter. She can\u2019t afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Trump\u2019s big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",
      "In the House, four centrist Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits.

But the historic milestone arrives amid political instability and skepticism among ordinary people fueled by fears of price rises.",
      "Supporters of switching to the euro from the old currency, the lev, are praising the move as one of the greatest achievements since the 1989 transition from a Soviet-style economy to democracy and free markets. They hope it will make the country more attractive for investors and strengthen its orientation toward wealthier Western Europe.",
      "But many people are uneasy, in a country where corruption is rife and trust in the authorities is low. One fear is that merchants will round prices up or otherwise use the changeover to worsen inflation, at a time when inflation has rebounded to 3.7%.",
      "An EU Eurobarometer poll from March showed that 53% of 1,017 people surveyed opposed joining the eurozone, while 45% were in favor. A separate Eurobarometer poll, taken between Oct. 9 and Nov. 3 on a similar sample, showed that about half of Bulgarians opposed the single currency while 42% were in favor. The margin of error was about plus or minus 3.1 percentage points for the March poll.",
      "The government successfully completed the euro adoption process by beating inflation down to 2.7% earlier this year to comply with EU rules and win approval from EU leaders. But clearing that hurdle was followed by a new chapter of political chaos. The government resigned after less than a year in office amid nationwide anti-corruption protests. This left the country without a regular budget for next year and is hampering plans for long-overdue structural reforms and decisions on use of EU support funds. A new election \u2014 the eighth in five years \u2014 is expected to be held next spring.",

      "Bulgaria, with its 6.4 million people, is one of the poorest members of the 27-country European union. The average monthly wage is 1,300 euros ($1,530).",

      "Opponents of joining have fed fears that the changes will allegedly lead to more poverty and loss of national identity. Social media has spread disinformation such as false claims that the euro could lead to confiscation of bank accounts. Nationalist and pro-Russian groups exploit these fears.",
      "European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has said that countries have experienced a slight, transient rise in prices of 0.2%-0.4% right after joining.

      "Some economists believe that the world\u2019s second largest economy is growing more slowly than official figures suggest, even though China may hit its official 2025 annual growth target of about 5%. Beijing has averted a damaging full blown trade war with Washington after President Donald Trump struck a truce with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but many longer-term challenges remain.",
      "Business is \u201cvery tough\u201d right now as people don\u2019t have much disposable income, said billiards hall owner Xiao Feng, who lives in Beijing.",
      "\u201cIt seems the wealthy don\u2019t have the time, and the ordinary folks don\u2019t have money to spend,\u201d said Xiao. \u201cAfter deducting all costs, including rent, labor, utilities, I\u2019m just breaking even.\u201d",
      "Xiao and his wife, a nurse, have a 10-year-old son. With her stable income, she is now the household\u2019s breadwinner.",
      "\u201cBefore, I used to contribute about 100,000 yuan (about $14,250) annually to the household,\u201d said Xiao, who has cut his staff from eight to five as competition has intensified. \u201cBut I\u2019ve had no income for about six consecutive months now.\u201d",
      "Beijing-based commercial property agent Zhang Xiaoze said he used to make up to 3 million yuan (nearly $428,000) a year during the peak years of the mid-2010s. Now he brings in about 100,000 yuan annually, and the the business environment is \u201cextremely challenging,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cDemand is weak because many companies are relocating out of Beijing,\u201d Zhang said, who is married with one child. \u201cThe fundamental issue is that people don\u2019t have money.\u201d",

      "During its rapid ascent as an export manufacturing superpower, China invested heavily in infrastructure such as railways, highways and ports, industrial zones and other property development. While boosting consumer spending and business investment are key priorities, exports remain a vital driver of employment and economic growth.",
      "In the first 11 months of this year Chinese exports amounted to a record $3.4 trillion -- with growing shipments to Southeast Asia and Europe helping to offset a sharp drop to the U.S. -- versus imports of $2.3 trillion.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s economy is amidst what I call a \u2018Great Transition,\u2019 as it moves away from the growth engines that drove growth the past three decades,\u201d said Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING.",
      "As is true in the U.S., in China the AI boom has helped drive gains in share prices. But the resources that have poured into the technology sector have not translated into a direct wealth effect for most people, said Song. \u201cIt is no surprise that many feel the situation on the ground is not reflecting the relatively more optimistic growth picture,\u201d he said.",
      "The divergence between the official economic growth figures and what many Chinese people are feeling suggests China \u2019s actual growth \u201cmay be well below\u201d what official data suggest, said Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics.",
      "Recent economic data indicate growth is slowing. Retail sales increased by just 1.3% in November from a year earlier, slower than October\u2019s 2.9% growth. Fixed-asset investment, meanwhile, dropped 2.6% in the first 11 months of 2025.",
      "Disposable household income growth has been running below pre-pandemic pace in recent years, economists at HSBC said in a recent report, and \u201cincome gains from property have virtually vanished.\"",

      "South Korea is chasing a coal-free future in efforts to slash carbon emissions, an ambitious goal for the fossil fuel-dependent country",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea is promising to shrink its reliance on coal power as part of its pledge to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, but that ambition is at odds with the Trump administration\u2019s push for more U.S. natural gas exports.",
      "At recent United Nations climate talks, South Korea's new Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced plans to retire most of the country\u2019s coal-fired power plants by 2040 and to at least halve its carbon emissions by 2035.",

      "But as part of trade deals with President Donald Trump, Seoul is raising imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Climate activists contend such plans may conflict with the country\u2019s pledges to help curb climate change and could lock South Korea into a fossil fuel-dependent future.",
      "Talks are underway for South Korea to invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase up to $100 billion worth of U.S. energy products, including LNG, a natural gas cooled to liquid form for easy storage and travel.

      "South Korea\u2019s overall LNG imports may not increase if it offsets purchases of more U.S. natural gas by reducing imports from other sources such as Australia and the Middle East.",
      "Still, it's unclear how South Korea will \u201cmanage and consolidate all this somehow contradictory planning regarding its energy sector,\" said Michelle Kim, an energy specialist for the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",

      "South Korea's goal to cut carbon emissions by 53% to 61% of its 2018 level, fell short of climate activists\u2019 expectations. Business lobbies representing major manufacturers had proposed a 48% emissions reduction target.",
      "\u201cThis range presents an effort by the government to accommodate two very different ways of thinking about the economic and climate future of the nation,\u201d said Joojin Kim of the Seoul-based advocacy group, Solutions for Our Climate.",

      "The agreement still under negotiation could last between three to 10 years, according to industry analysis and U.S. federal documents. Depending on the deal's duration, South Korea may import between 3 million to 9 million tons of American LNG a year.",
      "LNG made up almost a fifth of South Korea\u2019s total energy supply last year, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. The government's target was to cut that to 10.6% by 2038.",
      "South Korea risks its climate goals if the pending trade deal increases the total volume of imported LNG, which will likely lead to an oversupply issue and the excess burning of gas to justify the deal, said Insung Lee, with Greenpeace in Seoul.",

      "HONG KONG -- State-backed property developer China Vanke, once the country\u2019s largest homebuilder by sales, narrowly avoided defaulting on a 2 billion yuan ($284 million) bond last week as the painfully slow recovery in China\u2019s property market drags on.",
      "The Chinese developer also was seeking to delay repayment of another 3.7 billion yuan ($530 million) of onshore debt due on Dec. 28, with bondholders agreeing to extend the deadline to February.",
      "Years after the downturn in the housing market began, Chinese developers are still struggling to regain their footing, despite a slew of government policies meant to revive the industry. Weak investment and housing prices have shaken investor confidence, spilling into the broader economy since millions of homeowners are stuck with apartments worth far less than what they paid for them.",
      "Instead of the huge driver of prosperity that it once was, the property market is weighing on the economy.",
      "Although Vanke's bondholders have approved extensions for repayments of its debt, the risk of a default remains.",
      "About a third-owned by Shenzhen Metro, a state-owned railway, publicly listed Vanke's finances are a mess. Its revenue fell 27% from a year earlier in the latest July-September quarter, and several of its onshore bonds were suspended from trading after prices plunged.",
      "The developer owes more than $50 billion, less than the more than $300 billion in debt racked up by China Evergrande, one of the first property dominos to fall when it defaulted in 2021 after the government cracked down on excessive borrowing in the industry.",
      "Analysts say Vanke, founded in the 1980s in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, may be testing the limits of state support for property developers in reviving the industry, which once accounted for more than a quarter of total economic activities in China.",
      "More than four years after the downturn began, China\u2019s property sector has yet to recover. The situation varies from city to city, but overall home prices have fallen by 20% or more from their peak in 2021.",
      "The decline has continued, with new home sales falling 11.2% by value year-on-year in the first 11 months of 2025, according to official statistics. Property investments fell nearly 16% from a year earlier.",

Many other Chinese developers also defaulted and in some cases were restructured. Tough measures to fight Covid-19 during the pandemic took a toll as construction projects were suspended.",
      "Restoring confidence in the property sector may take years, economists at Morgan Stanley say, and Vanke\u2019s woes will only further weigh on its real estate market outlook. Economists at Morningstar say home prices are unlikely to rebound until 2027 due to excess supply, despite repeated pledges by regulators to stabilize the real estate market.",
      "While Vanke's debt is way smaller than Evergrande\u2019s was, a default would sting: It had been considered one of the financially sounder real estate developers in China.",
      "Shenzhen Metro Group, which is controlled by the Shenzhen government, has provided more than 29 billion yuan ($4 billion) in shareholder loans to Vanke so far this year to help with its debt repayments, according to S&P Global.",
      "That's not enough to repay its full obligations. Vanke reported 60 billion yuan ($8 billion) of cash by the end of September 2025, against short-term debts of about 151 billion yuan ($21 billion), Fitch Ratings said.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the most significant, quasi state-backed developers that may be defaulting (on) their repayment,\u201d said Foreky Wong, a founding partner at Fortune Ark Restructuring.",

      "The U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission wants to turn America\u2019s 250th birthday celebration into the country\u2019s single biggest year for volunteering",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission wants to turn America's 250th birthday celebration into the country's single biggest year for volunteering.",
      "But America Gives, the program unveiled Wednesday just before the U.S. begins commemorating the 1776 signing of the Declaration of Independence, will have to revitalize a culture of service that has recently waned. Declining volunteering rates still haven't returned to pre-pandemic levels. Just 28% of Americans said they volunteered time to a religious or secular charitable organization this year, according to a December AP-NORC poll.",
      "Organizers don't know how many service hours they need to set the record and aren't targeting a specific number. The idea is to leverage nationwide reflections on the country's direction to encourage lasting community involvement that will strengthen nonprofits' volunteer pipelines beyond 2026. Funding comes from congressional appropriations as well as corporate sponsors including Walmart and Coca-Cola.",
      "Participants are invited to pledge their time and log volunteering on an online tracker. Nonprofit partners include Girl Scouts of the USA, which will offer a volunteering badge to any of its roughly 1 million youth members who complete a service project, and Keep America Beautiful, which is leading efforts to clean up 250 million pieces of trash by the Fourth of July. JustServe \u2014 a service project coordinator sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \u2014 is sending 250 semitrucks to deliver food donations to 250 food banks across the 50 states.",
      "\u201cWe strongly believe that this is as much about the future as it is the past,\" said America250 Chair Rosie Rios, who oversees the nonpartisan commission created by Congress to organize the anniversary. \u201cEspecially this next generation, we want them to give them something to believe in.\u201d",
      "That forward-focused goal requires courting a demographic that many nonprofits struggle to reach: young volunteers.",
      "About one-quarter of adults under 30 said they volunteered their time to charity or provided non-financial support to people in their community in the past year, according to a March AP-NORC poll, compared with 36% of those over 60.",
      "Rios said America Gives is working with high schools, many of which already list community service as a graduation requirement, to ensure those volunteering hours are logged and build giving habits that continue after students' secondary education.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re very passionate. They\u2019re very purpose driven. They do want to give back,\" Rios said, adding that \u201cinspiring them to not just visualize, but maybe fuel their own future, is a big priority for us.\u201d",
      "Service could be an opportunity to meet younger generations\u2019 desire for in-person connections. Sofia Alvarez \u2014 a cohort lead for the Youth250 Bureau, a separate effort to center Gen Z perspectives throughout next year\u2019s programming \u2014 said young people want \u201cthird spaces.\u201d That means somewhere outside of home, school or work that feels \u201csafe,\u201d she said, but doesn\u2019t require spending money.",
      "\u201cI think any sort of craft or activity that really helps people connect, where they can chit chat and bond with each other, really builds that sense of community,\u201d Alvarez said.",
      "Sarah Keating, vice president of Girl and Volunteer Experience at Girl Scouts of the USA, said they\u2019ve had to make their volunteer opportunities more manageable.",
      "Young people want to give back, Keating said, but they are busy and don\u2019t know how. She said nonprofits must offer experiences \u201cthat match their lives.\u201d Someone might not have time to lead an entire troop, for example, but they can help lead a specific badge program.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Greg Abel faces the challenge of taking over Berkshire Hathaway from the legendary Warren Buffettthis week.",
      "Many regard Buffett as the world's greatest investor after he grew Berkshire from a struggling New England textile mill that he starting buying up for $7.60 a share in 1962, to the massive conglomerate it is today with shares that go for more than $750,000 a pop. Buffett's personal fortune of Berkshire stock is worth roughly $150 billion even after giving more than $60 billion away over the past 20 years.",
      "Berkshire for decades has routinely outpaced the S&P 500 as Buffett bought up insurance companies like Geico and National Indemnity, manufacturers like Iscar Metalworking, retail brands like Dairy Queen, major utilities and even one of the nation's biggest railroads, BNSF. Along the way, Buffett bought and sold hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks and profited handsomely from his famously long-term bets on companies like American Express, Coca-Cola and Apple.",
      "Berkshire has struggled to keep that pace in recent years because it has grown so huge and also struggled to find new and significant acquisitions. Even this fall's $9.7 billion acquisition of OxyChem probably isn't big enough to make a difference in Berkshire's profits.",
      "Investors will be watching closely to see what changes Abel might make in Berkshire's trajectory, but don't expect any seismic shifts.",
      "Buffett isn't going anywhere and Abel has already been managing all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses since 2018. Buffett will remain chairman and plans to continue coming into the office each day to help spot new investments and offer Abel any advice he asks for.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it is natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "But Berkshire operates under an extremely decentralized structure that trusts its executives with significant decisions. Everyone associated with the company has said there are no plans to change that.",
      "The world learned that Abel was to become the designated successor at Berkshire in 2021 when Buffett\u2019s longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, assured shareholders at an annual meeting that Abel would maintain the company\u2019s culture.",
      "Part of Buffett\u2019s sales pitch to company founders and CEOs thinking of selling their companies has always been that Berkshire would largely allow them to continue running their companies the same way as long as they delivered results.",
      "\u201cI think the investment community would likely applaud Greg\u2019s management style to the degree that it sort of buttons things up,\" Seifert said. \"And if it helps performance, that can\u2019t really be faulted.\u201d",

      "Abel has already shown himself to be a more hands-on manager than Buffett, but he still follows the Berkshire model of autonomy for acquired companies. Abel asks tough questions of company leaders and holds them accountable for their performance.",
      "Abel did announce some leadership changes earlier this month after investment manager and Geico CEO Todd Combs departed, and Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg announced his retirement. Abel also said he's appointing NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses. That essentially creates a third division of the company and takes some work off of Abel's plate. He will continue to manage the manufacturing, utility and railroad businesses.",
      "Abel will eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. From the beginning, Berkshire has held the position that it is better to reinvest profits rather than making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "But if Abel can\u2019t find a productive use of the $382 billion cash that Berkshire is sitting on, there may be a push from investors to start paying dividends or to adopt a traditional stock buyback program that would boost the value of shares they hold. Currently, Berkshire only repurchases shares when Buffett thinks they are a bargain, and he hasn't done that since early 2024.",
      "Still, Abel will be insulated from such pressure for some time since Buffett controls nearly 30% of the voting power in the stock. That will diminish gradually after his death as his children distribute his shares to charity as agreed.",
      "Many of Berkshire's subsidiaries tend to follow the economy and profit handsomely whenever the country is prosperous. Berkshire's utilities typically generate a reliable profit, and its insurance companies like Geico and General Reinsurance supply more than $175 billion worth of premiums that can be invested until claims come due.",
      "Investor Chris Ballard, who is managing director at Check Capital, said most of Berkshire's businesses \u201ccan almost take care of themselves.\" He sees a bright future for Berkshire under Abel.",
      "One of the biggest questions right now may be how much additional change there will be in company leadership after Combs' departure, if any at all. The head of the insurance unit, Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, who Buffett has long lavished with praise, is now 74 and many of the CEOs of the various companies have continued working long after retirement age because they like working for Buffett.",
      "\u201cAs a long-term shareholder, we aren\u2019t too concerned with Todd\u2019s departure and don\u2019t think this is the tip of some sort of iceberg,\" said Ballard, whose firm counts Berkshire as its largest holding. \"Todd\u2019s situation is unique. It\u2019s just a reminder that Warren\u2019s pending departure is imminent and they\u2019re preparing for a new phase \u2014 one that we\u2019re still excited to see unfold.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture released the figures Wednesday for how much aid per acre farmers can plan on for each row crop. The details arrived after most farmers have already met with their bankers to arrange financing for next year's crops and placed orders for the seed and fertilizer they will need. But officials have promised that the payments should arrive by the end of February.",
      "Soybean farmers have been hit especially hard by Trump's trade war with China, which stopped buying any American crops after Trump announced his tariffs this spring. China is the world's largest buyer of soybeans. This aid package is expected to help farmers weather the trade disruptions until China buys more soybeans under an agreement announced in October and until provisions of Trump's massive budget bill take effect later this year.",
      "Soybean farmers will get $30.88 per acre while corn farmers will receive $44.36. Another crop hit hard when China stopped buying was sorghum, and those farmers will get $48.11 per acre. The amounts are based on a USDA formula on the cost of production.",
      "But farmers say the aid won't solve all their problems as they continue to deal with the soaring costs of fertilizer, seeds and labor that make it hard to turn a profit right now. Some agricultural trade groups have said they worry that thousands of farmers could go out of business, but others have said they believe most farmers have the financial resources and equity needed to survive.",

      "Beijing has yet to confirm any commitment to buying 12 million metric tons of soybeans for this season, but the Chinese embassy in Washington said earlier this month that \u201cagricultural trade cooperation between China and the United States is proceeding in an orderly manner.\u201d",
      "The aid payments will be capped at $155,000 per farmer or entity, and only farms that make less than $900,000 in adjusted gross income will be eligible. During the first Trump administration, a number of large farms found ways around the payment limits and collected millions.",
      "The USDA said it would use a formula that estimates production costs to come up with a per-acre payment for each type of crop. The USDA says the average size of the 1.88 million farms nationwide was 466 acres last year, but many farmers are much larger than that as larger operations have continued to buy up neighboring farms over time.",

      "NEW YORK -- Stocks slipped in quiet trading on Wall Street Monday to kick off another holiday-shortened week.",
      "The losses have little impact on the broader annual gains for major indexes as they close out their final days of the year. There are two trading days left before the year ends. Markets in the U.S. will be closed Thursday for New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 24.20 points, or 0.3%, to 6,905.74. The benchmark index is still up more than 17% for the year and it remains on track for its eighth monthly gain in a row.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 249.04 points, or 0.5%, to 48,461.93. The Nasdaq composite fell 118.75 points, or 0.5%, to 23,474.35.",
      "Big technology stocks with outsized valuations were among the heaviest weights on the market. Nvidia fell 1.2% and Broadcom fell 0.8%. Investor optimism about the future of artificial intelligence has been driving the sector mostly higher all year and pushing the broader market to a series of records.",
      "Technology stocks have been more unsteady as the year heads to a close, though. They mostly slipped in November and have only notched modest gains through December. Nvidia and several other companies focusing on AI or benefiting heavily from the developing technology have become some of the most valuable in the world. Investors have seemingly become more skeptical about whether the eventual payoff will make the hefty investments worthwhile.",
      "Energy stocks gained ground along with rising oil prices. U.S. benchmark crude jumped 2.4% to settle at $58.08 per barrel. The price of Brent crude, the international standard, rose 2.1% to settle at $61.94 a barrel. Exxon Mobil rose 1.2%.",
      "Gold and silver prices pulled back from their recent sharp gains after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world\u2019s largest trading floors for commodities, asked traders to put up more cash to make bets on precious metals.",
      "The price of gold fell 4.6%, though prices for the precious metal are still up about 64% for the year. Silver prices slumped 8.7%, but they have still more than doubled overall in 2025.",

      "Treasury yields have fallen significantly from the start of the year. That's partly due to initial anticipation for cuts and eventual cuts to interest rates in 2025 from the Federal Reserve. The central bank cut its benchmark interest rate three times later in the year. At the same time, it started facing a more complicated economic situation, where inflation remained stubbornly high while the job market started slowing.",
      "The central bank cut rates with the aim of offsetting the impact on the economy from a slowdown in jobs growth. That risks heating up inflation that is already stubbornly above the central bank's target rate of 2%. Interest rate cuts could boost the economy by making loans less expensive, but that benefit could be nullified by rising inflation stunting economic growth.",
      "Markets in Europe and Asia were mixed. Shares in Taiwan were higher even after China\u2019s military said it was conducting drills around the self-governed island that Beijing claims as its territory. Taiwan's benchmark Taiex gained 0.9%, but the Hang Seng in Hong Kong gave up early gains, falling 0.7%.",

      "The roof was open, as were the huge window panels behind what typically is left field at loanDepot Park \u2014 home of Major League Baseball's Miami Marlins. There was some snow falling from the edges of the stadium, there were blasts of fire and after years of planning, there was hockey on a baseball field.",
      "\u201cAwesome experience,\u201d Panthers defenseman Aaron Ekblad said. \u201cReally happy I was able to able to experience something like this. Would have loved to get the win, but at the end of the day, a true first-class experience.\u201d",

It was 2 degrees cooler than on Feb. 27, 2016, when Detroit beat Colorado at Denver's Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies.",
      "The Rangers \u2014 with a snow effect around their walkway \u2014 were called to the ice at 8:13 p.m. The Panthers \u2014 as fire shot skyward along their path \u2014 came out about a minute later.

      "Fans rushed the court at the final buzzer as the Cornhuskers (14-0, 3-0 Big Ten) won their 18th straight game since last season, the longest streak in the nation.",
      "It was the lowest-scoring game of the season for both teams in what was the first ranked vs. ranked matchup in Lincoln since 1991. The game was hyped as a measuring stick for Nebraska, the only power-conference team to have never won an NCAA Tournament game. The Huskers met the moment.",
      "What started as a slog quickly turned into a battle of bigs shooting 3-pointers. The 6-foot-10 Mast made five of his first seven from distance and finished 6 of 13. Michigan State's 6-10 Jaxon Kohler made a career-high five on six attempts and finished with 19 points.",
      "Pryce Sandfort had 13 points and Jamarques Lawrence added 12 for the Huskers. Jeremy Fears Jr. had 14 for the Spartans and Kur Teng, who started in place of Divine Ugochukwu (illness), added 12.",
      "Michigan State was just 6 of 24 from the field in the second half and its 19 turnovers were its most since it committed the same number against Nebraska four years ago.",
      "Mast's last 3 was his only field goal of the second half and gave the Huskers the lead for good.",
      "The Spartans had a chance to tie when Carson Cooper was fouled with 0.7 seconds left. But his first free throw bounced off the rim, and the Huskers came up with the rebound when he intentionally missed the second.",

      "Meteor showers happen when speedy space rocks collide with Earth\u2019s atmosphere, burning up and leaving fiery tails in their wake \u2014 the end of a \u201cshooting star.\u201d A handful of meteors are visible on any given night, but predictable showers appear annually when Earth passes through dense streams of cosmic debris.",
      "Supermoons occur when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes it appear up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. That difference can be tough to notice with the naked eye.",
      "Supermoons, like all full moons, are visible in clear skies everywhere that it's night. The Quadrantids, on the other hand, can be seen mainly from the Northern Hemisphere. Both can be glimpsed without any special equipment.",
      "To spot the Quadrantids, venture out in the early evening away from city lights and watch for fireballs before the moon crashes the party, said Jacque Benitez with the Morrison Planetarium at the California Academy of Sciences. Skygazers can also try looking during early dawn hours on Sunday.",

      "Scientists from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University have created the first three-dimensional image of the Popocat\u00e9petl volcano's interior",
      "POPOCAT\u00c9PETL VOLCANO, Mexico -- In the predawn darkness, a team of scientists climbs the slope of Mexico's Popocat\u00e9petl volcano, one of the world\u2019s most active and whose eruption could affect millions of people. Its mission: figure out what is happening under the crater.",
      "For five years, the group from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University has climbed the volcano with kilos of equipment, risked data loss due to bad weather or a volcanic explosion and used artificial intelligence to analyze the seismic data. Now, the team has created the first three-dimensional image of the 17,883-foot (5,452-meter) volcano\u2019s interior, which tells them where the magma accumulates and will help them better understand its activity, and, eventually, help authorities better react to eruptions.",
      "Marco Cal\u00f2, professor in the UNAM's Geophysics Institute\u2019s vulcanology department and the project leader, invited The Associated Press to accompany the team on its most recent expedition, the last before its research on the volcano will be published.",
      "Inside an active volcano, everything is moving: the rocks, magma, gas and aquifers. It all generates seismic signals.",
      "Most of the world\u2019s volcanoes that pose a risk to humans already have detailed maps of their interiors, but not Popocat\u00e9petl, despite the fact that some 25 million people live within a 62-mile (100 kilometers) radius and houses, schools, hospitals and five airports could be affected by an eruption.",
      "Other scientists took some early images 15 years ago, but they showed contradictory results and did not have sufficient resolution to see \u201chow the volcanic edifice was being built,\u201d and above all, where the magma gathered, Cal\u00f2 said.",
      "His team increased the number of seismographs from the 12 provided by Mexico\u2019s National Disaster Prevention Center to 22 to cover the entire perimeter of the volcano. Even though just three can alert to an emergency, many more are needed to understand what is behind those emergencies.",
      "The devices measure vibrations in the ground 100 times per second and generate data that Karina Bernal, 33, a doctoral student and researcher on the project, processed by using artificial intelligence to adapt algorithms developed for other volcanoes.",
      "\u201cI taught the machine about the different types of tremors there are in El Popo\u201d and with that they were able to catalog the different kinds of seismic signals, she said.",
      "Little by little the scientists began to infer what kinds of material were where, in what state, at what temperature and at what depth. Later they were able to map it.",
      "The result is far more complex than the drawings of volcanoes most saw in school, with a main vent connecting a chamber of magma with the surface.",
      "This first three-dimensional cross-sectional image goes 11 miles (18 kilometers) below the crater and shows what appear to be various pools of magma at different depths, with rock or other material between them and more numerous toward the southeast of the crater.",
      "Popocat\u00e9petl emerged in the crater of other volcanoes in its current form more than 20,000 years ago and has been active since 1994, spewing plumes of smoke, gas and ash more or less daily. The activity periodically forms a dome over the main vent, which eventually collapses, causing an eruption. The last was in 2023.",
      "Cal\u00f2, a 46-year-old Sicilian, speaks passionately about El Popo, as Mexicans call the volcano, rattling off trivia.",
      "He explains that its height can change because of eruptions and recounts how Popocat\u00e9petl, in the first century, had its own \u201clittle Pompeii\u201d when a village on its flanks, Tetimpa, was buried in ash. In the early 20th century, it was human actions \u2014 using dynamite to extract sulfur from the crater \u2014 that provoked an eruption. And even though El Popo emanates more greenhouse gases than almost any other volcano, its emissions are still a small fraction of what humans generate in nearby Mexico City.",
      "For years Cal\u00f2 studied volcanic activity from his computer, but trying to \u201cunderstand how something works without touching it\u201d spurred a feeling of disappointment, he said.",
      "That changed with Popocat\u00e9petl, a volcano he describes as \u201cmajestic.\u201d",

      "Karina Rodr\u00edguez, a 26-year-old master\u2019s student on the team, said you can also hear small tremors in the earth or even ash falling like rain when the volcano is more active. On dark nights, the rim of the crater glows orange.",
      "Having direct knowledge of the volcano provides a much more objective sense of the limits of their analysis, Cal\u00f2 said.",
      "\u201cWe have a natural laboratory here,\u201d he said. It\u2019s \u201cvery important to be able to understand and give residents detailed, trustworthy information about what is happening inside the volcano.\u201d",
      "At 13,780 feet (4,200 meters), their backpacks full of computers, equipment to analyze gases, batteries and water begin to weigh more and their pace slows.",
      "Ash, dark and warm, dominates the landscape here.",
      "At a seismographic station, the team digs up the equipment and celebrates that it\u2019s still working. They download its data and rebury it.",
      "A \u201cvolcanic bomb,\u201d a rock a yard and a half in diameter and weighing tons, marks the way and gives an idea of what the start of an eruption can mean. That is why the top area of the volcano is restricted, though not everyone pays heed. In 2022, a person died after being hit by a rock about 300 yards (meters) from the crater.",
      "A bottle of tequila near a rocky hollow, known as El Popo\u2019s belly button, hints at some of the traditions surrounding the volcano, including an annual pilgrimage to what some consider a point of connection to the underworld.",
      "Digging up one of the last seismic stations, Cal\u00f2\u2019s face falls. The last registered data are from months earlier. The battery died. Sometimes rats chew the machines\u2019 wires or an explosion causes more serious damage.",
      "The project has yielded some certainties and if repeated will allow the analysis of changes that eventually will help authorities make better decisions when eruptions occur.",
      "But Cal\u00f2 says that, as always happens with science, it has also generated new questions that they will have to try to address, like why the tremors are more frequent on the southeast side \u2014 where there is more accumulated magma \u2014 and what implications that could have.",
      "This was the last expedition before their years of work to map the volcano\u2019s interior is published. Watching the volcano\u2019s interior move in 3D on a computer screen makes all of the effort worthwhile.",

      "Some Venezuelan civilians and members of the military were killed, said Rodr\u00edguez, who didn\u2019t give a number. Trump said some U.S. forces were injured, but none were killed.",

      "Trump claimed the U.S. government would help lead the country and was already doing so, though there were no immediate visible signs of that. Venezuelan state TV aired pro-Maduro propaganda and broadcast live images of supporters taking to the streets in Caracas in protest.",
      "\u201cWe're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,\u201d Trump said at a Mar-a-Lago news conference. He boasted that this \u201cextremely successful operation should serve as warning to anyone who would threaten American sovereignty or endanger American lives.\u201d",
      "Maduro and other Venezuelan officials were indicted in 2020 on narco-terrorism conspiracy charges, and the Justice Department released a new indictment Saturday of Maduro and his wife that painted his administration as a \u201ccorrupt, illegitimate government\u201d fueled by a drug-trafficking operation that flooded the U.S with cocaine. The U.S. government does not recognize Maduro as the country's leader.",
      "The Trump administration spent months building up American forces in the region and carrying out attacks on boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean for allegedly ferrying drugs. Last week, the CIA was behind a drone strike at a docking area believed to have been used by Venezuelan drug cartels \u2014 the first known direct operation on Venezuelan soil since the U.S. campaign began in September.",
      "Taking place 36 years to the day after the 1990 surrender and seizure of Panama leader Manuel Antonio Noriega following a U.S. invasion, the Venezuela operation unfolded under the cover of darkness early Saturday. Trump said the U.S. turned off \u201calmost all of the lights\" in Caracas while forces moved in to extract Maduro and his wife.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said U.S. forces had rehearsed their maneuvers for months, learning everything about Maduro \u2014 where he was and what he ate, as well as details of his pets and his clothes.",
      "\u201cWe think, we develop, we train, we rehearse, we debrief, we rehearse again and again,\u201d Caine said. \u201cNot to get it right, but to ensure we cannot get it wrong.\u201d",
      "Multiple explosions rang out that morning, and low-flying aircraft swept through Caracas. Maduro's government accused the United States of hitting civilian and military installations, calling it an \u201cimperialist attack\u201d and urging citizens to take to the streets. The explosions \u2014 at least seven blasts \u2014 sent people rushing into the streets, while others took to social media to report what they saw and heard.",
      "Under Venezuelan law, Rodr\u00edguez would take over from Maduro. Rodr\u00edguez, however, stressed during a Saturday appearance on state television that she did not plan to assume power, before Venezuela\u2019s high court ordered that she become interim president.",

The U.S., a close ally of Japan, is seeking to strengthen its ties with Tokyo but also stabilize its relationship with Beijing ahead of a likely trip by Trump to China in April.",
      "Beijing staged two-day military exercises in the waters off Taiwan this week. Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister, infuriated China late last year when she said Chinese military action against Taiwan could be grounds for a Japanese military response, breaking away from former Japanese leaders\u2019 strategic ambiguity on the highly sensitive matter.",
      "In a statement Friday, the Japanese foreign ministry said Takaichi and Trump agreed to coordinate for the visit to happen this spring. Kyodo News, Japan's news agency, suggested that Takaichi's trip could coincide with the annual cherry blossom festival in Washington.",
      "The foreign ministry said the two leaders affirmed that they would \u201ccarve out a new chapter in the history of the Japan-U.S. alliance\u201d in a year when the U.S. celebrates the 250th anniversary of its founding and that they would \u201cfurther deepen the friendly relations\u201d between the two nations, including economic and security cooperation.",
      "Takaichi and Trump also agreed on their commitment to promoting cooperation among like-minded partners, including the Japan-U.S.-South Korea partnership, and to a free and open Indo-Pacific, the foreign ministry statement said.",
      "The two exchanged views \u201cmainly on the Indo-Pacific region,\" the ministry said, but it did not provide details, including whether the two discussed recent actions by Beijing in the region.",

      "A solo hiker who authorities believe was killed by a mountain lion on a remote Colorado trail on New Year's Day was not the first person to encounter one of the predators in the area in recent weeks.",
      "Gary Messina said he was running along the same trail on a dark November morning when his headlamp caught the gleam of two eyes in the nearby brush. Messina used his phone to snap a quick photo before a mountain lion rushed him.",
      "Messina said he threw the phone at the animal, kicked dirt and yelled as the lion kept trying to circle behind him. After a couple of harrowing minutes he broke a bat-sized stick off a downed log, hit the lion in the head with it and it ran off, he said.",
      "The woman whose body was found Thursday on the same Crosier Mountain trail had \u201cwounds consistent with a mountain lion attack,\u201d said Kara Van Hoose with Colorado Parks and Wildlife. An autopsy is scheduled for next week, said Rafael Moreno with the Larimer County Coroner's Office.",
      "Wildlife officials late Thursday tracked down and killed two mountain lions in the area \u2014 one at the scene and another nearby. A necropsy will help determine if either or both of those animals attacked the woman and whether they had neurological diseases such as rabies or avian flu.",
      "A search for a third mountain lion reported in the area was ongoing Friday, Van Hoose said. Nearby trails remained closed while the hunt continued. Van Hoose said circumstances would dictate whether that lion is also killed.",
      "Based on the aggressiveness of the animal that attacked him on Nov. 11, Messina suspects it could be the same one that killed the woman on New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "\u201cI had to fight it off because it was basically trying to maul me,\u201d Messina told The Associated Press. \u201cI was scared for my life and I wasn\u2019t able to escape. I tried backing up and it would try to lunge at me.\u201d",
      "The 32-year-old man from nearby Glen Haven, Colorado, reported his encounter to wildlife officials days later who posted signs to warn people about the animal along trails in the Crosier Mountain area northeast of Estes Park, Van Hoose said. The signs were later removed, she said.",
      "Mountain lion sightings in that area east of Rocky Mountain National Park are common, Van Hoose said, because it offers good habitat for the animals: It\u2019s remote with thick forests, rocky outcroppings and lots of elevation changes.",
      "Yet attacks on humans by the animals are rare, and the last suspected fatal encounter in Colorado was in 1999, when a 3-year-old boy disappeared in the wilderness and his tattered clothes were found more than three years later. In 1997, a 10-year-old boy was killed by a lion and dragged away while hiking with family members in Rocky Mountain National Park.",

      "Most attacks occur during the day and when humans are active in lion territories, indicating the animals are not seeking out the victims, according to the advocacy group. About 15% of attacks are fatal.",
      "\u201cAs more people live, work, and recreate in areas that overlap wildlife habitat, interactions can increase, not because mountain lions are becoming more aggressive, but because overlap is growing,\u201d said Byron Weckworth, chief conservation officer for the foundation.",

      "Presidents often find solace in golfing, and Joint Base Andrews in Maryland is a favorite spot because it's close to the White House and has built-in security",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump has spent much of his two-week vacation in Florida golfing. But when he gets back to the White House, there's a military golf course that he's never played that he's eyeing for a major construction project.",
      "Long a favored getaway for presidents seeking a few hours\u2019 solace from the stress of running the free world, the Courses at Andrews \u2014 inside the secure confines of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the White House \u2014 are known as the \u201cpresident's golf course.\" Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Joe Biden have spent time there, and Barack Obama played it more frequently than any president, roughly 110 times in eight years.",
      "Trump has always preferred the golf courses his family owns \u2014 spending about one of every four days of his second term at one of them. But he's now enlisted golf champion Jack Nicklaus as the architect to overhaul the Courses at Andrews.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that an individual has time to take a couple hours away from the world crises. And they\u2019re people like everybody else,\u201d said Michael Thomas, the former general manager of the course, who has golfed with many of the presidents visiting Andrews over the years.",
      "Andrews, better known as the home of Air Force One, has two 18-hole courses and a 9-hole one. Its facilities have undergone renovations in the past, including in 2018, when Congress approved funding to replace aging presidential aircraft and to build a new hanger and support facilities. That project was close enough to the courses that they had to be altered then, too.",
      "Trump toured the base by helicopter before Thanksgiving with Nicklaus, who has designed top courses the world over. The president called Andrews \u201ca great place, that\u2019s been destroyed over the years, through lack of maintenance.\u201d",
      "Other golfers, though, describe Andrews\u2019 grounds as in good shape, despite some dry patches. Online reviews praise the course's mature trees, tricky roughs, and ponds and streams that serve as water hazards. The courses are mostly flat, but afford views of the surrounding base.",
      "The first president to golf at Andrews was Ford in 1974. Thomas began working there a couple years later, and was general manager from 1981 until he retired in 2019.",
      "He said the Secret Service over the years used as many as 28 golf carts \u2014 as well as the president's usual 30-car motorcade \u2014 to keep the perimeter secure.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a Cecil B. DeMille production every time,\u201d said Thomas, who had the opportunity to play rounds with four different presidents, and with Biden when he was vice president.",
      "He said the commanders in chief generally enjoyed their time out on the course in their own unique ways, but \u201cthey all like to drive the cart because they never get an opportunity to drive.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like getting your driver\u2019s license all over again,\" Thomas laughed.",
      "Trump golfs most weekends, and as of Jan. 1, has spent an estimated 92 days of his second term doing so, according to an Associated Press analysis of his schedules.",
      "That tally includes days when Trump was playing courses his family owns in Virginia, around 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the White House, and near his Florida estate Mar-a-Lago, where he's spending the winter holidays. It also includes 10 days Trump spent staying at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where his schedule allowed time for rounds of golf.",
      "Trump has visited Andrews in the past, but the White House and base have no record of him playing the courses.",
      "Andrews\u2019 military history dates to the Civil War, when Union troops used a church near Camp Springs, Maryland, as sleeping quarters. Its golf course opened in 1960.",

      "The White House said the renovation will be the most significant in the history of Andrews. The courses and clubhouse need improvements due to age and wear, it said, and there are discussions about including a multifunctional event center as part of the project.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is a champion-level golfer with an extraordinary eye for detail and design,\" White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement. \"His vision to renovate and beautify Joint Base Andrews' golf courses will bring much-needed improvements that servicemembers and their families will be able to enjoy for generations to come.\u201d",
      "Plans are in the very early stages, and the cost of \u2014 and funding for \u2014 the project haven't been determined, the White House said. Trump has said only that it will require \u201cvery little money.\"",
      "The Andrews improvements join a bevy of Trump construction projects, including demolishing the White House\u2019s East Wing for a sprawling ballroom now expected to cost $400 million, redoing the bathroom attached to the Lincoln bedroom and replacing the Rose Garden\u2019s lawn with a Mar-a-Lago-like patio area.",
      "Outside the White House, Trump has led building projects at the Kennedy Center and wants to erect a Paris-style arch near the Lincoln Memorial, and has said he wants to rebuild Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia.",
      "On Wednesday, meanwhile, the Trump administration ended a lease agreement with a non-profit for three public golf courses in Washington \u2014 which could allow the president to further shape golfing in the nation's capital. The White House, however, said that move isn't related to the plans for Andrews.",
      "When the president is golfing, Andrews officials block off nine holes at a time so no one plays in front of him, allowing for extra security while also ensuring consistent speed-of-play, Thomas said.",
      "That's relatively easily done given that the courses aren't open to the public. They're usually reserved for active or retired members of the military and their families, as well as some Defense Department-linked federal employees.",

      "Minnesota officials are rushing to provide information to the Trump administration about child care providers and parents receiving federal funds",
      "Minnesota officials have until next week to hand over information on providers and parents who receive federal child care funds that the Trump administration contends have been used fraudulently or risk losing federal funding. State officials said Friday recent inspections showed several childcare centers accused of fraud by a right-wing influencer were \u201coperating as expected.\u201d",
      "In an email sent Friday to child care providers and shared with The Associated Press by multiple providers, Minnesota\u2019s Department of Children, Youth, and Families said it has until Jan. 9 to provide information about recipients of the funds.",
      "The announcement earlier this week by the Trump administration that it would freeze child care funds to Minnesota and the rest of the states comes after a series of fraud cases involving government programs in which many defendants were Somali, as were many of those running spotlighted childcare centers.",
      "Allegations of fraud at the child care centers went viral recently when a right-wing influencer posted a video claiming there was fraud taking place, putting Minnesota and some other states in the crosshairs of the Trump administration.",
      "State officials said investigators did spot checks and reviews of nine centers this week in response to the influencer's video posted last week, and found no operational issues. One center was not yet open at the time, and there are ongoing investigations at four of them.",
      "The email sent Friday instructed providers and families who rely on the frozen federal child care program to continue the program\u2019s \u201clicensing and certification requirements and practices as usual.\u201d It does not say that recipients themselves need to take any action or provide any information.",
      "\u201cWe recognize the alarm and questions this has raised,\u201d the email said. \u201cWe found out about the freezing of funds at the same time everyone else did on social media.\u201d",
      "The state agency added that it \u201cdid not receive a formal communication from the federal government until late Tuesday night,\u201d which was after Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O\u2019Neill posted about the freeze on X. All 50 states will have to provide additional levels of verification and administrative data before they receive more funding from the Child Care and Development Fund, which is designed to make child care affordable for low-income families.",
      "The U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will hold a hearing Wednesday to discuss the allegations of fraudulent use of federal funds in Minnesota. An HHS spokesperson said that the child care fraud hotline put up by the federal agency earlier this week has received more than 200 tips.",
      "Minnesota has drawn ire from Republicans and the Trump administration over other fraud accusations.",
      "Administration for Children and Families Assistant Secretary Alex Adams told Fox News on Friday that his agency sent Minnesota a letter last month asking for information on the child care program and other welfare programs by Dec. 26, but didn't get a response. The state did not immediately respond to a request for comment. President Donald Trump has also targeted the state's large Somali community with immigration enforcement actions and called them \u201cgarbage.\u201d",

      "Minnesota Democrats say the Trump administration is playing politics and hurting families and children as a result. Minnesota's Department of Children, Youth and Families said in a press release Friday that inspectors conduct regular oversight activities for the child care program, noting that there are 55 related open investigations involving providers.",
      "\u201cDCYF remains committed to fact-based reviews that stop fraud, protect children, support families, and minimize disruption to communities that rely on these essential services,\" the department said. \"Distribution of unvetted or deceptive claims and misuse of tip lines can interfere with investigations, create safety risks for families, providers, and employers, and has contributed to harmful discourse about Minnesota\u2019s immigrant communities.\u201d",
      "Maria Snider, director of a child care center in St. Paul and vice president of advocacy group Minnesota Child Care Association, said providers currently get paid at least three weeks after services are provided. Some 23,000 children and 12,000 families receive funding from the targeted child care program each month on average, according to the state.",
      "\u201cFor a lot of centers, we\u2019re already running on a thin margin,\u201d she said. \u201cEven centers where 10 to 15% of their kids are on childcare assistance, that\u2019s a dip in your income.\u201d",
      "Any child who attends a child care center with attendees who receive federal funding could be impacted, Snider said.",
      "The Administration for Children and Families, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, provides $185 million in child care funds annually to Minnesota, federal officials have said.",
      "According to the Friday email from Minnesota\u2019s Department of Children, Youth, and Families, HHS sent a letter to Minnesota asking for data from 2022 to 2025, including identifying information of all recipients of the child care funds, a list of all providers who receive the funds, how much they receive and \u201cinformation related to alleged fraud networks and oversight failures.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether Minnesota already has the data the administration is asking for.",
      "HHS said five child care centers that receive funds from the child care program or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families would have to provide \u201cspecific documentation\u201d such as attendance, inspections and assessments, according to the email.",
      "HHS said it would provide Minnesota with more information by Jan. 5, but the state agency wrote that it\u2019s unclear what kinds of funding restrictions it faces.",
      "\u201cOur teams are working hard to analyze the legal, fiscal, and other aspects of this federal action,\u201d the email says. \u201cWe do not know the full impact.\u201d",

The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "In the nation\u2019s first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax would generate nearly $100 million annually.",

Kennedy, worked as a reporter for The New York Times' Science section, and was author of the award-winning 2019 book, \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have.\"",
      "In a November 2025 essay in The New Yorker, titled \"A Battle With My Blood,\" she wrote of how her life changed, shockingly, upon the birth of her second child in May 2024 at age 34. Hours after giving birth, Schlossberg's doctors noticed a spike in her white-blood-cell count. She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia with a rare mutation, mostly seen in older people. \"I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew,\" she wrote.",
      "The daughter of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg, she recounted in her essay going through rounds of chemotherapy and two stem cell transplants and participating in clinical trials. During the most recent trial, she wrote, her doctor told her \"he could keep me alive for a year, maybe.\"",
      "\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good,\" she wrote, \"to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry. Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\"",
      "In her essay, Schlossberg criticized her mother's cousin, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for pushing policies (including slashing nearly $500 million for research into mRNA vaccines against certain cancers) that could impact patients like her. She also wrote movingly of her family's support, and of the valiant efforts of medical staff to help her. \"I have never encountered a group of people who are more competent, more  full of grace and empathy, more willing to serve others than nurses,\" she wrote. \"Nurses should take over.\"",

      "\"Mostly, I try to live and be with them now. But being in the present is harder than it sounds, so I let the memories come and go,\" she wrote. \"So many of them are from my childhood that I feel as if I'm watching myself and my kids grow up at the same time. Sometimes I trick myself into thinking I'll remember this forever, I'll remember this when I'm dead. Obviously, I won't. But since I don't know what death is like and there's no one to tell me what comes after it, I'll keep pretending. I will keep trying to remember.\""

      "The U.S. Constitution's intellectual property clause establishes that works be protected for a limited amount of time, \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\" The Founding Fathers left it to Congress to sort out the specifics.",
      "Generally, in the U.S., works published or registered before 1978 retain copyright protections for 95 years. For later works, protection usually spans the creator's lifetime and 70 years after.",
      "\"If copyright lasted forever, it would be very difficult for a lot of creators to make the works they want to make without worrying about being in the crosshairs of a copyright lawsuit,\" Jenkins said.",
      "Just because a work's copyright has expired does not mean that members of the public cannot be held legally liable in some instances. For example, while the original Betty Boop from 1930 is in the public domain, the modern version is not. So to avoid infringement, any reuse would need to steer clear of her newer characteristics.

    "story": [
      "Actor George Clooney and his wife Amal Clooney were\u00a0granted French citizenship\u00a0because \"they contribute, through their distinguished actions, to France's international influence and cultural outreach,\" the French government said Wednesday, defending their naturalization that was questioned by a junior French minister.",
      "The naturalizations of the Kentucky-born star of the \"Ocean's\" series of heist movies, his wife and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, and their twins Ella and Alexander were announced last weekend in the Journal Officiel, where French government decrees are published.",
      "Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, a junior minister at the Interior Ministry, expressed misgivings Wednesday that some of the Clooneys' new French compatriots may think that the star couple was granted special treatment. The actor speaks only what he himself says is \"horrible, horrible\" French.",
      "\"The message being sent is not good,\" Vedrenne said in an interview with broadcaster France Info. \"There is an issue of fairness that, in my eyes, is absolutely essential.\"",
      "President Trump piled on the criticism against the move, saying France was welcome to the two-time Academy Award winner, a long-time vocal critic of the U.S. leader.",
      "\"Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration, much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday.",
      "He added, \"Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies. He wasn't a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The couple purchased an estate in France in 2021 and Clooney has said that it's their primary residence. Non-French residents of France have multiple possible routes to becoming naturalized. It wasn't clear whether the 64-year-old actor retained his American citizenship. His 47-year-old wife was born in Lebanon and raised in the U.K and naturalized by France under her maiden name, Amal Alamuddin. The 8-year-old twins were born in London.",
      "The Foreign Ministry said the Clooneys were eligible for citizenship under a French law that allows for the naturalization of foreign nationals who contribute to France's international influence and economic well-being.",
      "It argued that France's cinema industry will benefit from the actor's clout as a global movie star and said that as a lawyer, Amal Clooney regularly works with academic institutions and international organizations in France.",
      "\"They maintain strong personal, professional and family ties with our country,\" the ministry said.",
      "\"Like many French citizens, we are delighted to welcome Georges and Amal Clooney into the national community,\" it concluded, giving the actor's first name a French twist by adding the \"s\" at the end.",
      "The decision was also defended by Vedrenne's superior at the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez, who said he signed the naturalization decree.",
      "\"It's a big chance for our country,\" he said.",
      "In recent media interviews, when he was promoting \"Jay Kelly,\" Clooney said that he is trying to teach himself French using a language-learning app. He said that his wife and children speak the language perfectly.",
      "\"They speak French in front of me so that they can say terrible things about me to my face and I don't know,\" he joked, speaking to French\u00a0broadcaster Canal+.",
      "French media have reported that the Clooneys live part-time in their luxury 18th-century villa outside the town of Brignoles in southern France, where they can keep a lower profile and their children are protected from unauthorized photographs by French privacy laws.",
      "In an interview with Esquire in October, Clooney said: \"I was worried about raising our kids in L.A., in the culture of Hollywood.\"",
      "\"I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids,\" he said. Growing up away from the spotlight in France, \"they have dinner with grown-ups and have to take their dishes in. They have a much better life.\"",

      "Text messages show that Tyler Perry and \"Boo! A Madea Halloween\" actor Mario Rodriguez, who recently filed a lawsuit accusing the filmmaker of sexual assault, remained in contact years after Rodriguez alleges their interactions ended.",
      "Rodriguez alleged in the lawsuit filed last week in California that Perry sexually assaulted him during encounters that occurred between 2014 and 2019. The lawsuit says Rodriguez cut off contact with Perry in 2019, though Perry would periodically reach out afterward. But screenshots of text messages obtained by The Associated Press on Sunday night show Rodriguez making contact with Perry as recently as Thanksgiving 2024 and again on Aug. 31, 2025, expressing gratitude, friendship and financial distress.",
      "Rodriguez's lawsuit seeks at least $77 million in damages and accuses Perry of sexual assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Rodriguez also sued Lionsgate, which distributed \"Boo! A Madea Halloween\" in 2016, accusing the studio of overlooking Perry's alleged assault.",
      "Perry denied the allegations made in Rodriguez's suit.",
      "\"Having recently failed in another matter against Mr. Perry, the very same lawyer has now made yet another demand from more than a decade ago which will also be a failed money grab,\" Alex Spiro, an attorney for Perry, said in a statement Friday provided to CBS News.",
      "Spiro also told the AP: \"I said it before and I will say it again. This is nothing but a $77 million money grab scam.\"",
      "Lionsgate did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In one text message between Rodriguez and Perry that was sent on Thanksgiving 2024, Rodriguez thanked Perry for helping him through difficult periods in his life and wrote that he appreciated him \"to the moon,\" according to the screenshots. In another series of messages dated Aug. 31 this year, Rodriguez described ongoing health problems, said he lacked health insurance and told Perry he was scared and struggling financially.",
      "The messages were provided to the AP by a source close to the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Rodriguez has.",
      "The lawsuit follows a separate case filed in June by actor Derek Dixon, who alleged Perry groped him while Dixon worked on Perry's television series \"The Oval\" and \"Ruthless.\" That lawsuit was originally filed in California state court and later moved to federal court in Georgia, where Perry is based. Perry also has denied Dixon's allegations.",

      "The film star died on Sunday at the age of 91 at home in the south of France. Media around the globe splashed iconic images of her and tributes following the announcement.",
      "Bardot shot to fame in the 1956 film \"And God Created Woman\" and went on to appear in about 50 films, but turned her back on cinema in 1973 to throw herself into fighting for animal rights.",
      "But her links to the far-right stirred controversy.",
      "Bardot was convicted five times for hate speech, mostly about Muslims but also about the inhabitants of the French island of Reunion, whom she described as \"savages.\"",
      "She died before dawn on Sunday morning with her fourth husband, Bernard d'Ormale, a former adviser to the far right, by her side.",
      "\"She whispered a word of love to him ... and she was gone,\" Bruno Jacquelin, a representative of her foundation for animals, told BFM television.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron hailed her as a \"legend\" of 20th century cinema who \"embodied a life of freedom.\"",
      "Right-wing politicians laud Bardot",
      "Far-right figures were among the first to mourn her.",
      "Marine le Pen, whose National Rally party is riding high in polls, called her \"incredibly French: free, untameable, whole.\"",
      "Bardot backed Le Pen for president in 2012 and 2017 and described her as a modern \"Joan of Arc\" she hoped could \"save\" France.",
      "Conservative politician Eric Ciotti suggested a national farewell like the one organized for French rock legend Johnny Hallyday.",
      "He launched an online petition that had garnered just over 7,000 signatures Monday.",
      "Left-wing politicians temper praise and some are sharply critical",
      "But few left-wing politicians have spoken about Bardot's passing.",
      "\"Brigitte Bardot was a towering figure, a symbol of freedom, rebellion, and passion,\"  Philippe Brun, a senior Socialist party deputy, told Europe 1 radio.",
      "\"We are sad she is gone,\" he said, adding he did not oppose a national homage.",

      "\"As for her political commitments, there will be time enough -- in the coming days and weeks -- to talk about them,\" he said.",
      "Communist party leader Fabien Roussel called Bardot a divisive figure.",
      "But \"we all agree French cinema created BB and that she made it shine throughout the world,\" he wrote on X.",
      "Lawmaker Sandrine Rousseau, of the left-leaning Greens Party, was more critical.",
      "\"To be moved by the fate of dolphins but remain indifferent to the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean -- what level of cynicism is that?\" she quipped on BlueSky.",
      "Bardot's remarks on her funeral raised some eyebrows",
      "Bardot said she wanted to be buried in her garden with a simple wooden cross above her grave -- just like for her animals -- and wanted to avoid \"a crowd of idiots\" at her funeral.",
      "Such a burial is possible in France if local authorities grant permission.",
      "Officials in Saint-Tropez said Monday that Bardot will be buried in a seaside cemetery there, without giving a date.",
      "Born on Sept. 28, 1934 in Paris, Bardot was raised in a well-off traditional Catholic household.",
      "Married four times, she had one child, Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, with her second husband, actor Jacques Charrier.",
      "After quitting the cinema, Bardot withdrew to her home in Saint-Tropez to devote herself to animal rights.",
      "Her calling apparently came when she encountered a goat on the set of her final film, \"The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot.\" To save it from being killed, she bought the animal and kept it in her hotel room.",
      "\"I'm very proud of the first chapter of my life,\" she told AFP in a 2024 interview ahead of her 90th birthday.",

      "In his new book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.), Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and health policy expert, discusses longevity, and how to best differentiate valid and effective health and wellness advice from \"the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid.\"",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Norah O'Donnell's interview with Emanuel on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" January 4!",
      "\"Eat Your Ice Cream\" by Ezekiel J. Emanuel, M.D.",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Anyone looking for advice on wellness and longevity confronts a tsunami of books, newspaper articles, podcasts, newsletters, and videos from an enormous range of sources: scientific experts, medical practitioners, health systems, journalists, patients, influencers, gurus, quacks. Traditional media offer loads of good advice, often in responsibly edited and well-sourced sections dedicated to \"wellness.\" But the sheer amount of it can be difficult to keep up with, and sometimes the guidance can be downright contradictory.",
      "For anyone wading through the torrent of health and longevity advice online, it can be difficult to know who to trust. The so-called \"must dos\" online range from the medically unproven to the wildly impractical to suggestions so absurd they leave doctors like me baffled\u2014testicle tanning, teen blood transfusions, vaginal steaming, \"rucking\" hikes with a backpack full of weights. Information is coming at us from a firehose, increasingly spewed by hucksters and self-proclaimed sages who have amassed millions of social media followers (and dollars) by promising supposed miracle treatments using medical-sounding language. It's no wonder so many people are confused and frustrated.",
      "Shouting to be heard over it all are real physicians and health experts offering sound but sometimes conflicting advice. All of it together can swamp even those who are most assiduous about their health. Dozens of books on health and longevity have appeared in just the last few years, filled with well-intentioned and scientifically accurate information. But too often they fall into the trap of chasing novelty instead of efficacy and end up touting treatments and regimens that are unproven or with marginal returns at best.",
      "Then there is the steady stream of profiles on tech billionaires joylessly devoting themselves to maximizing their lifespan. One of my business school students told me how her \"wellness coach\" recommended all sorts of questionable prescriptions, like eating 200 grams of meat a day. (Don't ask me why a perfectly healthy twentysomething student who isn't training for a marathon or Ironman needs a wellness coach.) And then there is the entrepreneur attempting to defy death with his daily regimen of 100 pills, cold plunges, infrared lights, and a daily serving of \"nutty pudding\"\u2014a mix of chia seeds, macadamia nuts, and berries. Nutty is right.",
      "With so much health and wellness advice out there, it can be nearly impossible to differentiate the valid, reliable, and effective from the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid. Even when the advice is scientifically sound, it's often extraneous, misrepresented, or misused. For example, one wellness book ventures into the basic biology of molecular pathways, like the mTOR pathway for cell survival, to explain why you should take rapamycin to improve longevity. Indeed, studies have shown rapamycin extends the lifespan of mice, worms, flies, and yeast. But you are not a mouse, worm, fly, or yeast. While some studies have suggested that rapamycin for humans may mitigate the impact of aging-related immune and cardiovascular diseases, there is no evidence that it impacts human lifespans.",
      "This extrapolation of laboratory findings parallels the story of resveratrol, the \"magic\" compound in grapes and red wine that was supposed to explain the French paradox. Yes, resveratrol improved longevity in mice. But, do you have a tail and whiskers? Scientists have been experimenting on mice since the early 20th century, and while this work has led to many breakthroughs, findings in mice often fail to extend to humans. As an oncologist, I know that researchers have cured hundreds of thousands of mice with cancer using experimental chemotherapy agents, only to have the drugs fail when administered to people with cancer. Unfortunately, there's no evidence that resveratrol or rapamycin improves human lifespans. Ultimately, the biology lesson and the \"health advice\" is a waste of people's time.",
      "What so many of these talking heads have in common\u2014legitimate experts, well-meaning journalists, and kooks alike\u2014is how costly their recommendations are. Financially, for sure, but also costs in mental energy and time that steal from activities which give life meaning. With the mountain of advice out there, it is practically a full-time job to determine whether the information on rapamycin is accurate, not to mention if it is worth taking.",
      "Overall, the wellness industrial complex promises us more time to enjoy in the future\u2014but sure is demanding a lot of time right now. It takes a ton of time and attention to pore through a 400-page book, much less a whole library of them. And what about the zillions of posts, videos, and articles about the latest new supplement, superfood, or exercise that supposedly can lengthen your life? Add that to the time spent trying to figure out what is real versus what is a fad. Or based on some microbes in a petri dish or a study of worms. Or worse yet, based on no evidence at all. Then budget more time to methodically organize your schedule to incorporate the latest exercise tweak or diet advice. . . . Congratulations: You have now lost that added time the gurus promised you. And you've lost it in the prime of your life.",
      "Of course, if your whole focus is on quantity of years rather than quality, this work could be worth it. Some \"longevity experts\" seem to see things that way. As one popular author says, \"Our only goal is to live longer and live better\u2014to outlive.\" Our only goal? Life is not a competition where the gold medal goes to the oldest! Our goal should not be to \"outlive\" as many people as possible. Instead, the goal should be to live a healthy and fulfilling life. Wellness is just a means to that end, not the end in itself.",

      "Changes are coming to tortillas in California in the new year, with a new law requiring manufacturers to add folic acid to corn masa products. The goal is to decrease birth defects in children born to Hispanic women.",
      "Research shows folic acid promotes new cell growth and can reduce birth defects by up to 70%.",
      "A 1998 U.S. Food and Drug Administration mandate required folic acid to be added to certain enriched grains, such as pasta and rice, but not to corn masa products.",
      "Since then, Latina women have not seen any decrease in their babies being born with neural tube defects in their brains and spinal cords, which is why lawmakers are targeting tortillas.",
      "\"I really was in shock because we grow with these kinds of tortillas since generations, and we never have any problems. We have healthy kids,\" said Dora Sanz, who is the owner of 3 Hermanas in east Sacramento.",

      "Sana Jaffery is the legislative director for Fresno Assemblymember Joaquin Arambula, who authored the bill. She said it costs four pennies to fortify a metric ton of corn masa, but hundreds of dollars for supplements where you get the same vitamins.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venezuela-oil-reserves-us-strike-trump-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 18:53:54 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said \"we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be\" after the surprise U.S. attack. Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil sector.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. strike on Venezuela\u00a0has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",
      "Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.",
      "How much oil does Venezuela produce?",
      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 billion barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near\u00a0term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

      "Elon Musk's Grok, the chatbot developed by his company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" on the AI platform that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "The admission comes after multiple users alleged on social media that people are using Grok to generate suggestive images of minors, in some cases stripping them of clothing they were wearing in original photos.",
      "In a post on Friday responding to one person on Musk-owned social media site X, Grok stated it was \"urgently fixing\" the holes in its system. Grok also included a link to CyberTipline, a website where people can report child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced,\" Grok said in a separate\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Thursday. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.\"",
      "In another social media post, a user posted side-by-side photos of herself wearing a dress and another that appears to be a digitally altered version of the same photo of her in a bikini. \"How is this not illegal?\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "On Friday, French officials reported the sexually explicit content generated by Grok to prosecutors, referring to it as \"manifestly illegal\" in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok, said \"Legacy Media Lies\" in a response to a request for comment.",
      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",
      "Federal law bars the production and distribution of \"child sexual abuse material,\" or CSAM, a broader phrase for child pornography, according to the Justice Department.",
      "\"xAI saying that these cases where minors' images were manipulated to create sexualized content are 'isolated' is minimizing the impact and ignoring the fact that nothing on the internet is isolated,\" Stefan Turkheimer, vice president of public policy at RAINN, a nonprofit anti-sexual violence group, told CBS News. \"I talk with survivors of tech-enabled sexual abuse every day, and what every one of them will tell you is that it feels like it will never end. Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",
      "\"As generative AI tools become more powerful and more accessible, the Grok situation highlights how increasingly common AI safety failures are becoming.

    "summary": "Proposed California ballot initiative would impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires, with the revenue funneled toward health care and education.",
    "story": [
      "A proposed billionaire wealth tax in California is sparking debate over whether the measure, if passed, would lead to more harm than good if ultrawealthy residents in the state flee to other locales.",
      "Under the proposed ballot initiative, California would institute a one-time tax of 5% on the state's estimated 255 billionaires. While wealth taxes aren't new, the proposal has sparked pushback from some of America's richest citizens and their allies, who claim it could drive the state's billionaires to leave the state and discourage entrepreneurs from creating businesses.",
      "By contrast, advocates of the tax emphasize that billionaires' fortunes are growing much faster than the income of ordinary Americans.",
      "\"The billionaire class had their wealth nearly triple in the last six years, and a one-time wealth tax will only put a 5% constraint on their wealth accumulation,\" Omar Ocampo, a researcher at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, told CBS News. \"It will not significantly impact their lives, their consumption or spending habits.\"",
      "Others warn that California could face a revenue shortfall if the state's wealthiest residents \u2014 who already pay relatively high tax rates \u2014 decamp for other states to avoid the tax.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom has previously opposed earlier wealth tax proposals in the state, saying that the idea is \"going nowhere in California,\" while billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a New York resident, spoke out against the California proposal in a December 29 social media\u00a0post.",
      "\"I am opposed to wealth taxes because they effectively represent an expropriation of private property and have many unintended and negative consequences that have occurred in every country that has launched such a tax,\" Ackman wrote.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposed California billionaire tax and its potential economic impact.",
      "What is the billionaire wealth tax?",
      "The billionaire wealth tax is a\u00a0proposed ballot measure created by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW), a union representing more than 120,000 health care workers and patients in California.",
      "If passed, the measure would levy a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of the state's billionaires, although it would not tax their income. According to California's attorney general, the tax would be applied to assets including:",
      "BusinessesSecurities such as stocks and bondsArtCollectiblesIntellectual property",
      "Businesses",
      "Securities such as stocks and bonds",
      "Art",
      "Collectibles",
      "Intellectual property",
      "Real estate and some pensions and retirement accounts also would be excluded from the tax.",
      "If voters pass the initiative, billionaires in the state would have to pay the tax in 2027, although they could opt to spread the payments across five years for an additional annual nondeductible charge of 7.5% of the remaining unpaid balance, according to the text of the proposal.",
      "How would the tax revenue be used?",
      "About 90 cents of every $1 raised by the tax would be spent on health care, while the remaining 10 cents would be earmarked for food assistance or education, the proposal states.",
      "According to the SEIU-UHW, the impetus for the billionaire tax stems from the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which includes about $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade to Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans. Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, is slated to lose $190 billion in funding over the next decade due to those cuts, according to the proposal.",
      "\"The purpose of the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act ... is to protect access to high-quality, equitable health care, and to support funding for kindergarten through grade fourteen public education and food assistance programs, by raising revenue from a one-time tax on billionaire wealth,\" the proposal states.",
      "How much money could the billionaire tax raise for California?",
      "California would likely raise \"tens of billions of dollars from the wealth tax,\" according to a Dec. 11 analysis\u00a0by the state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office.",
      "However, the group noted that quantifying the exact amount potentially raised by the tax is difficult because it's unclear what actions billionaires might take to reduce their tax burden, and because much of their wealth is based on stock prices, which continuously fluctuate, the analysis noted.",
      "What steps are needed to pass the wealth tax?",
      "First, the measure needs to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot, with Ballotpedia putting the number at about 875,000. If it draws sufficient public support, the measure would appear on the state's ballot in the November general election.",
      "Once on the ballot, the measure would pass if it received a majority approval.",
      "Do the rich move when facing wealth taxes?",
      "Some critics of wealth taxes contend that such policies drive rich Americans to move to low-tax states. Yet\u00a0previous research has found that millionaires generally don't relocate just to get a tax cut.",
      "Massachusetts offers a recent example. The state introduced a 4% tax on millionaires in 2023, with the new revenue helping fund free school lunch for the state's schoolchildren. While some millionaires may have left to avoid the tax, a\u00a0May analysis from the Institute for Policy Studies found that the number of millionaires in Massachusetts rose nearly 39% in the two years after the tax took effect.",
      "Have any billionaires announced plans to move over the California tax proposal?",
      "It is unclear whether a one-time tax on billionaires, with their much deeper bank accounts, could spur an exodus in the state. Critics of the proposal have noted that tech billionaire Peter Thiel announced on Dec. 31 that his private investment firm, Thiel Capital, has opened a Miami office.",
      "The new location \"will complement Thiel Capital's existing operations in Los Angeles, California,\" according to the statement, which didn't mention the California proposal.",
      "Craft Ventures, a venture capital firm co-founded in 2017 by billionaire tech investor David Sacks\u00a0said on December 31 that it had opened a new office in Austin, Texas. The firm added that Sacks, who also serves as a White House adviser on AI and cryptocurrency, had relocated to Austin earlier that month, although it didn't mention the proposed wealth tax.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/greg-abel-berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-successor/",
    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:04:08 -0500",
    "summary": "Abel, 63, takes the helm of Berkshire Hathaway after a six-decade run by Buffett.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett officially stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on Thursday, handing the reins of the multinational conglomerate to his hand-picked successor, Greg Abel.",
      "Abel, 63, is taking the helm of Berkshire after Buffett, 95, spent six decades transforming a struggling textile manufacturer into one of the world's most successful companies. As the new CEO, Abel will be tasked with upholding Berkshire's decentralized model \u2014 one of the company's hallmarks \u2014 while guiding it into a new era of growth.",
      "In recent years, that growth has slowed as the company has ballooned in size, making it harder to find large, meaningful acquisition targets.",
      "Buffett tapped Abel as his successor in May, saying at the time that he planned to step down as CEO. The move surprised many investors, as it was widely assumed Abel would not take over until after Buffett's death. While Buffett will no longer run the company, he will remain chairman and continue coming into the office five days a week, giving Abel regular access to his longtime mentor.",
      "Here's what to know about Abel, the new leader of Berkshire Hathaway, and how his leadership approach could differ from Buffett's.",
      "Who is Greg Abel?",
      "Abel, a former amateur hockey player and avid golfer, joined Berkshire in 2000 after serving as CEO of MidAmerican, an Iowa-based utility company. Once at Berkshire, he helped transform the recently acquired MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the largest producer of wind energy in the country.",
      "Before taking on his new role as CEO, the Canadian executive oversaw Berkshire's non-insurance companies and served as vice chairman of Berkshire's board of directors.",
      "What has Buffett said about Abel?",
      "Buffett has repeatedly expressed confidence in Abel's ability to lead Berkshire's operations, most recently during a CNBC interview, which partially aired on Friday.",
      "Buffet said Abel will be the \"decider,\" adding that he \"can't imagine how much more [Abel] can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month.\"",
      "\"I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"",
      "Buffett also reiterated his belief in Abel's leadership during the final letter he penned to shareholders in November 2025.",
      "\"Greg Abel has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire's next CEO,\" he wrote. \"He understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don't even consider.\"",
      "What sort of changes might Abel make?",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it would be natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "The new CEO has already announced some leadership changes, including the appointment of NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses.",
      "He will also eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. Historically, Berkshire has favored reinvesting profits over making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "While Abel is viewed as more hands-on than Buffett, experts say he's not expected to initiate any major shake-ups at the decades-old company. He's exhibited a commitment to Berkshire's decentralized structure, which gives acquired companies a large degree of autonomy to run their operations.",

    "summary": "Tesla's electric vehicle sales fell 9% in 2025 from a year ago amid the expiration of a $7,500 EV U.S. tax credit.",
    "story": [
      "Tesla on Friday reported a second straight annual drop in electric vehicle sales, as the phaseout of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit and mounting competition weighed on demand. With the decline, Tesla lost its title as the world's bestselling electric vehicle maker.",
      "The company said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. Sales also declined in the fourth quarter, tumbling 15.6% to 418,227 vehicles, short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected.",
      "China's BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the world's biggest EV maker.",
      "Tesla has struggled amid heightened competition from rival automakers, as well as a backlash from some consumers over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration. Musk had headed up the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he oversaw cuts to the government workforce and some funding programs before stepping back in May\u00a0to refocus on Tesla.",
      "At the same time, the expiration last fall of the $7,500 EV tax credit likely hurt demand as it removed an incentive that had enticed some consumers to buy or lease electric vehicles, which tend to be pricier than gas-powered cars.",
      "Despite such challenges, Tesla's stock finished 2025 with a gain of roughly 11%, as investors hope Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make the company a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices.",
      "Although Tesla's sales came in lower than analysts had forecast, the results were better than some had feared, noted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. Investors, meanwhile, are betting that Tesla's other businesses \u2014 its energy unit and its push into robotics, including a humanoid robot and a robotaxi service \u2014 can serve as growth engines.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\" Ives said in a report.",
      "He added that Tesla's core automotive division is facing \"a more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.\"",
      "Shares of Tesla rose $4.16, or 0.9%, to $453.88 in early trading Friday.",
      "Cheaper Tesla models",
      "The latest quarter was the first reporting period that includes sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3, which Tesla unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000, while the cheaper Model 3 sells for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.",
      "Tesla faces fierce competition both abroad and in the U.S. from rival EV makers. BYD \u2014 known as \"Biyadi\" in Chinese or by the English slogan \"Build Your Dreams\" \u2014 now dominates China's highly competitive EV market, which is the world's largest.",
      "While BYD vehicles aren't sold in the U.S., its sales in Europe, Australia and other regions around the world are surging, thanks partly to pricing that is generally lower than Tesla's and other U.S. automakers, according to the BBC.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aca-health-subsidies-insurance-prices/",
    "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 21:14:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Enhanced tax credits that have helped Americans offset the cost of Affordable Care Act health insurance for the last four years expired overnight.",
    "story": [
      "Enhanced tax credits that have helped reduce the cost of health insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees expired overnight as 2026 arrived, cementing higher health costs for millions of Americans at the start of the new year.",
      "Democrats forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue. Moderate Republicans called for a solution to save their 2026 political aspirations. President Trump floated a way out, only to back off after conservative backlash.",
      "In the end, no one's efforts were enough to save the subsidies before their expiration date. A House vote expected in January could offer another chance, but success is far from guaranteed.",
      "The change affects a diverse cross-section of Americans who don't get their health insurance from an employer and don't qualify for Medicaid or Medicare \u2014 a group that includes many self-employed workers, small business owners, farmers and ranchers.",
      "It comes at the start of a high-stakes midterm election year, with affordability \u2014 including the cost of health care \u2014 topping the list of voters' concerns.",
      "\"It really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,\" said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose health care costs are set to jump. \"I'm incredibly disappointed that there hasn't been more action.\"",
      "Subsidies helped reduce costs since pandemic",
      "The expired subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help Americans get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time extended them, moving the expiration date to the start of 2026.",
      "With the expanded subsidies, some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.",
      "On average, the more than 20 million subsidized enrollees in the Affordable Care Act program are seeing their premium costs rise by 114% in 2026, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Those surging prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the U.S., which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.",
      "Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It's a strain for the 49-year-old but one he's willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.",
      "Others, like Provost, are dealing with steeper hikes. The social worker's monthly premium payment is increasing from $85 a month to nearly $750.",
      "Lori Hunt of Des Moines, Iowa, spoke with CBS News during the congressional stalemate in October and said she \"couldn't afford\" health insurance without the subsidies.",
      "\"I'd have to cancel my insurance,\" Hunt said, joking that her insurance would consist of \"thoughts and prayers.\"",
      "Hunt survived breast cancer three years ago and was laid off from her job in 2025. Without the subsidies, she expected her ACA premium would jump to about $700 per month. \"It would be more than my mortgage payment,\" Hunt said.",
      "Many expected to go without coverage",
      "Health analysts have predicted the expiration of the subsidies will drive many of the 24 million total Affordable Care Act enrollees \u2014 especially younger and healthier Americans \u2014 to forgo health insurance coverage altogether.",
      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "The impact could be greatest in Florida, which has the largest number of ACA enrollees of any state \u2014 more than 4.7 million, according to KFF data. Texas is next, with more than 3.9 million, followed by California, Georgia and North Carolina.",
      "Kylie Barrios, a 30-year-old Florida resident, said she expected to be among those losing coverage.",
      "\"Our health insurance premium is effectively tripling from 2025 to 2026,\" she told CBS News in December, saying it would rise from about $900 to $2,500.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she'll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her 4-year-old daughter. She can't afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Mr. Trump's big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",
      "In the House, four centrist Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it's unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don't understand what it's really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.",
      "Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.",
      "\"Both Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it,\" said Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old Affordable Care Act enrollee in Wisconsin. \"They need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.\"",
      "Barrios, who said she has generally voted Republican, said she would like politicians to \"act on those values that they ... claim to protect.\"",
      "\"The whole system feels as though it's failed and isn't advocating for me as a small business owner, as somebody who wants to become a mom and have a family,\" she said.",

The duties would have been imposed on top of existing 15% tariffs on most imports from the European Union.",
      "The Trump administration had proposed the antidumping levies after a review found that Italian pasta producers, including Barilla, La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, sold products at artificially low prices that undercut U.S. manufacturers. Together, the 13 pasta producers account for 16% of imported pasta from Italy to the United States, according to the Commerce Department.",
      "Had the higher duties taken effect, U.S. shoppers could have faced steeply higher prices for Italian-made pasta, and some Italian producers might have stopped shipping to U.S. retailers, experts told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court ruling on New Year's Eve blocked Hawaii from enforcing a\u00a0climate change tourist tax\u00a0on cruise ship passengers, a levy that was set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, arguing that the new law violates the U.S. Constitution by taxing cruise ships for entering Hawaii ports. They also argued it would make cruises more expensive.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passenger, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "In the nation's first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax would generate nearly $100 million annually.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jill A. Otake last week upheld the law, and the plaintiffs appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The U.S. government intervened in the case and also appealed Otake's ruling.",
      "The order by two 9th Circuit judges granted both requests for an injunction pending the appeals.",
      "\"We remain confident that Act 96 is lawful and will be vindicated when the appeal is heard on the merits,\" Toni Schwartz, spokesperson for the Hawaii attorney general's office, said in an email.",

    "story": [
      "Starting New Year's Day, some food-stamp recipients around the U.S. will be banned from using the government nutrition assistance to buy candy, soda and other foods.",
      "Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia are the first of at least 18 states to enact waivers prohibiting people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from purchasing certain foods. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins have urged states to strip foods regarded as unhealthy from the $100 billion federal program.",
      "\"We cannot continue a system that forces taxpayers to fund programs that make people sick and then pay a second time to treat the illnesses those very programs help create,\" Kennedy said in a statement in December.",
      "The efforts are aimed at reducing chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes associated with sweetened drinks and other treats, a key goal of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again effort.",
      "Confusion for SNAP recipients?",
      "But retail industry and health policy experts said state SNAP programs, already under pressure from steep budget cuts, are unprepared for the complex changes, with no complete lists of the foods affected and technical point-of-sale challenges that vary by state and store. And research remains mixed about whether restricting SNAP purchases improves diet quality and health.",
      "The National Retail Federation, a trade association, predicted longer checkout lines and more customer complaints as SNAP recipients learn which foods are affected by the new waivers.",
      "\"It's a disaster waiting to happen of people trying to buy food and being rejected,\" said Kate Bauer, a nutrition science expert at the University of Michigan.",
      "The new restrictions are the latest source of concern for SNAP recipients. Food aid distributed under the program, which is used by 42 million Americans, was interrupted during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. Reliance on food stamps typically surges during economic downturns, such as the sharp slump that followed the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "Nearly 62% of SNAP participants are in families with children, while roughly 37% are in households with older adults or people with disabilities,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit\u00a040-year highs\u00a0following the pandemic.",
      "Retailers fear impact",
      "A report by the National Grocers Association and other industry trade groups estimated that implementing SNAP restrictions would cost U.S. retailers $1.6 billion initially and $759 million each year going forward.",
      "\"Punishing SNAP recipients means we all get to pay more at the grocery store,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director for the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center.",
      "The waivers are a departure from decades of federal policy first enacted in 1964 and later authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which said SNAP benefits can be used for \"any food or food product intended for human consumption,\" except alcohol and ready-to-eat hot foods. The law also says SNAP can't pay for tobacco.",
      "In the past, lawmakers have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for expensive meats like steak or so-called junk foods, such as chips and ice cream.",
      "But previous waiver requests were denied based on USDA research concluding that restrictions would be costly and complicated to implement, and that they might not change recipients' buying habits or reduce health problems such as obesity.",
      "Under the second Trump administration, however, states have been encouraged and even incentivized to seek waivers \u2013 and they responded.",
      "\"This isn't the usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda,\" Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said when he announced his state's request last spring. \"We're focused on root causes, transparent information and real results.\"",
      "How many people are affected",
      "The five state waivers that take effect Jan. 1 affect about 1.4 million people. Utah and West Virginia will ban the use of SNAP to buy soda and soft drinks, while Nebraska will prohibit soda and energy drinks. Indiana will target soft drinks and candy. In Iowa, which has the most restrictive rules to date, the SNAP limits affect taxable foods, including soda and candy, but also certain prepared foods.",
      "\"The items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store,\" Plata-Nino wrote in a blog post. \"Many additional items \u2014 including certain prepared foods \u2014 will also be disallowed, even though they are not clearly identified in the notice to households.\"",
      "Marc Craig, 47, of Des Moines, said he has been living in his car since October. He said the new waivers will make it more difficult to determine how to use the $298 in SNAP benefits he receives each month, while also increasing the stigma he feels at the cash register.",
      "\"They treat people that get food stamps like we're not people,\" Craig said.",
      "SNAP waivers enacted now and in the coming months will run for two years, with the option to extend them for an additional three, according to the Agriculture Department. Each state is required to assess the impact of the changes.",
      "Health experts worry that the waivers ignore larger factors affecting the health of SNAP recipients, said Anand Parekh, a medical doctor who is the chief health policy officer at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\"This doesn't solve the two fundamental problems, which is healthy food in this country is not affordable and unhealthy food is cheap and ubiquitous,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The average cost of a conventional 30-year U.S. mortgage continues to edge down, while rates on other home loans fell to less than 5.5%.",
    "story": [
      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell to its lowest level of 2025 this week, a boost for prospective home buyers.",
      "The average long-term mortgage rate dipped to 6.15% from 6.18% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Wednesday. That's the lowest average long-term rate since October 3, 2024, when it dipped to 6.12% before shooting back up. One year ago, the rate averaged 6.91%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, fell this week to 5.44% from 5.5% the previous week. A year ago it averaged 6.13%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors' expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year yield was at 4.14% at midday Wednesday, down a touch from last week's 4.15%.",
      "Mortgage rates began easing in July in anticipation of a series of Fed rate cuts, which began in September and continued this month.",
      "The Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, but when it cuts its short-term rate that can signal lower inflation or slower economic growth ahead, which can drive investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Even so, Fed rate cuts don't always translate into lower mortgage rates.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to pay cash or finance at current mortgage rates are in a more favorable position than they were a year ago. Home listings are up sharply from 2024, and many sellers have resorted to lowering their initial asking price as homes take longer to sell, according to data from Realtor.com.",
      "Most homes across U.S. are unaffordable",
      "Still, affordability remains a challenge for aspiring homeowners, especially first-time buyers who don't have equity from an existing home to put toward a new home purchase. Uncertainty over the economy and job market\u00a0is also keeping many would-be buyers on the sidelines.",
      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in November from the previous month, but slowed compared to a year earlier for the first time since May, despite average long-term mortgage rates holding near their low point for the year. Through the first 11 months of this year, home sales are down 0.5% compared to the same period last year.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:32:26 -0500",
    "summary": "From stubbornly high living costs to a softer labor market, economists say these are the forces that will shape the year ahead.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy navigated 2025 with a resilience that surprised many experts, as growth accelerated and inflation remained relatively muted despite the Trump administration's steep tariffs on imports.",
      "Although Americans say they aren't yet feeling the benefits of an expanding economy amid ongoing concerns about the cost of living, many economists expect the U.S. to be on firmer footing next year.",
      "\"I think it'll be a better year,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Michael Pearce told CBS News. \"Tax cuts will be center stage, and we'll see a broadening out of economic strength.\"",
      "Here are what experts see as the key economic questions facing the U.S. in 2026.",
      "Will affordability improve?",
      "Probably not \u2014 at least not in a way most Americans will feel right away. Inflation has cooled since peaking at a 40-year high in 2022, but prices remain elevated, squeezing many households and making it harder to cover basic expenses. About 7 in 10 Americans polled by CBS News in December said they were struggling to pay for food, housing and health care, underscoring the affordability issues affecting millions of households.",
      "Rising utility costs are another challenge. Americans now pay an average of $265 per month in utilities, up 12% since last year, according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the average household is expected to pay an average of $995 on home heating this winter, a 9.2% increase from last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association.",
      "More broadly, inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target, with the Consumer Price Index in November at 2.7%. For consumers, that means prices for everyday goods and services are still climbing, continuing to strain household budgets.",
      "Inflation should cool to about 2.4% in 2026, according to a December forecast from the Federal Reserve. But that would still leave inflation above the central bank's goal, signaling that \"higher inflation will continue to weigh on family finances\" next year, William Blair economist Richard de Chazal said in a report.",
      "About one-third of Americans think their finances are likely to worsen in the year ahead, primarily driven by inflation concerns, a recent Bankrate\u00a0survey\u00a0found.",
      "Wages will need to outpace inflation for a sustained period before households feel they are getting ahead, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a Dec. 10 press conference.",
      "\"We're going to need to have some years where \u2026 nominal wages are higher than inflation for people to start feeling good about affordability,\" he noted.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve continue to cut interest rates?",
      "Another big question is whether the Federal Reserve will continue cutting its benchmark interest rate after three consecutive reductions that began in September.",
      "Although the Fed has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low, the central bank is currently being pulled in two directions. Prices are rising faster than the Fed would like, which could call for higher interest rates if the trend persists or inflation re-ignites in 2026. At the same time, rising unemployment and cooler hiring might require policymakers to further lower rates in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy, in December penciled in only\u00a0one additional rate cut for 2026. Yet some economists believe the Fed could make additional cuts, especially if the labor market continues to slow.",
      "President Trump has argued that the Fed should drastically cut its benchmark rate, pressing Fed Chair Jerome Powell to reduce borrowing costs. With Powell's term set to expire in May, Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new chair who is more open to cutting rates.",
      "Will housing become more affordable in 2026?",
      "Homes across the U.S. could be modestly more affordable in 2026, Chen Zhao, head of economics research at real estate company Redfin, told CBS News.",
      "Mortgage rates are likely to remain in the low 6% range, not far off from today's 30-year mortgage rate of about 6.18%, while home\u00a0prices are likely to grow at a slower pace than incomes next year.",
      "\"We're starting to head on a road that leads to better affordability metrics, but it's not going to be an overnight shift,\" she said. \"2026 might not feel all that different than the end of 2025 \u2014 it's a slow process that might take five or six years, but at least we're heading in the right direction.\"",
      "Home prices are projected to dip in about two dozen major U.S. cities in 2026, mostly located in the Southeast and the West, according to a Realtor.com analysis.",
      "Will the job market pick up steam?",
      "Hiring could improve in 2026 as economic growth accelerates and the effects of tariffs fade, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Average payroll gains could rise to an average of 70,000 per month next year, more than double the 32,000 per month average in 2025, economists with the investment bank forecast in a report. They expect wages to climb 2.3% in 2026, accelerating from 1.9% this year.",
      "However, some economists warn that the job market could remain relatively muted as companies turn to artificial intelligence to improve productivity.",
      "Are stocks in a bubble?",
      "A critical question for financial markets this year \u2014 are companies involved in AI overvalued \u2014 is likely to again take center stage in 2026.",
      "The S&P 500 is on track to end the year with a gain of more than 17%, with the index buoyed by artificial intelligence companies and big tech companies. However, some investors are growing cautious about the meteoric rise of AI-related stocks, questioning whether a bubble is forming.",
      "Such bubbles \u2014 when stock valuations run far ahead of underlying fundamentals \u2014 can set the stage for sharp market corrections if investor sentiment sours. Yet stock valuations remain below the levels seen during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics. He expects investment in AI to continue next year as more companies adopt the technology.",
      "Still, although AI stocks are unlikely to crash next year, investors' lofty expectations may be in for a reality check",
      "\"At some point, investors are likely to be disappointed, and the cycle of ever rising investment, expectations and valuations will end, as proved the case with previous equity bubbles,\" Goltermann said in a report.",
      "Overall, forecasters expect a strong stock market performance in 2026. J.P. Morgan in November forecast the S&P 500 will rise 13% to 15% next year, roughly in line with the index's average gain over the last decade.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-17000-commercial-drivers-licenses-delay-revoking-feds-threat-immigrants/",
    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:15:15 -0500",
    "summary": "In light of a suit by immigrants groups, California says it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses despite a federal threat to withhold $160 million in funding.",
    "story": [
      "A week after immigrant groups filed a lawsuit, California said Tuesday it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses until March to allow more time to ensure that truckers and bus drivers who legally qualify for the licenses can keep them.",
      "But U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the state may lose $160 million if it doesn't meet a Jan. 5 deadline to revoke the licenses. He already withheld $40 million in federal funding because, he said, California isn't enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.",
      "California only sent out notices to invalidate the licenses after Duffy pressured the state to make sure immigrants who are in the country illegally aren't granted the licenses. An audit found problems like licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's authorization to be in the country expired or licenses where the state couldn't prove it checked a driver's immigration status.",
      "\"California does NOT have an 'extension' to keep breaking the law and putting Americans at risk on the roads,\" Duffy posted on the social platform X.",
      "The Transportation Department has been prioritizing the issue ever since a truck driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people in August.",
      "California officials said they're working to make sure the federal Transportation Department is satisfied with the reforms they've put in place. The state had planned to resume issuing commercial driver's licenses in mid-December, but the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration blocked that.",
      "\"Commercial drivers are an important part of our economy - our supply chains don't move, and our communities don't stay connected without them,\" said DMV Director Steve Gordon.",
      "The Sikh Coalition, a national group defending the civil rights of Sikhs, and the San Francisco-based Asian Law Caucus filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the California drivers. They said immigrant truck drivers were being unfairly targeted. The driver in the Florida crash and the driver in another fatal crash in California in October are both Sikhs.",
      "Immigrants account for about 20% of all truck drivers, but the non-domiciled licenses immigrants can receive only represent about 5% of all commercial driver's licenses, or about 200,000 drivers. The Transportation Department also proposed new restrictions that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license, but a court put the new rules on hold.",
      "Mumeeth Kaur, the legal director of the Sikh Coalition, said this delay \"is an important step towards alleviating the immediate threat that these drivers are facing to their lives and livelihoods.\"",
      "Duffy previously threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding from California, Pennsylvania and Minnesota after audits found significant problems under the existing rules like commercial licenses being valid long after an immigrant truck driver's work permit expired. He dropped the threat to withhold $160 million from California after the state said it would revoke the licenses because the state was complying.",
      "Trucking trade groups have praised the effort to get unqualified drivers who shouldn't have licenses or can't speak English off the road. They also applauded the Transportation Department's moves to go after questionable commercial driver's license schools.",
      "And while the federal government says the licenses are illegal and the state says the feds are overreaching, some people in the trucking industry say they're the ones caught in the middle, reports CBS News Sacramento.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:37:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The minutes released Tuesday indicate that some Fed officials who supported the rate cut had reservations.",
    "story": [
      "Some Federal Reserve officials who supported cutting a key interest rate earlier this month could have instead backed keeping the rate unchanged, minutes released Tuesday show, underscoring the divisions and uncertainty permeating the central bank.",
      "At their December 9-10 meeting, Fed officials agreed to cut their key interest rate by a quarter point for the third time this year, to about 3.6%, the lowest in nearly three years.",
      "Yet the move was approved by a 9-3 vote, an unusual level of dissent for a committee that typically works by consensus. Two Fed officials supported keeping the rate unchanged, while one wanted a larger, half-point reduction.",
      "The minutes underscored the deep split on the 19-member policymaking committee over what constitutes the biggest threat to the economy: weak hiring or stubbornly elevated inflation. If a sluggish job market is the biggest threat, then the Fed would typically cut rates more. But if still-high inflation is the bigger problem, then the Fed would keep rates elevated, or even raise them.",
      "Just 12 of the 19 members vote on rate decisions, though all participate in discussions.",
      "The minutes showed that even some Fed officials who supported the rate cut did so with reservations. Some Fed officials wanted to wait for more economic data before making any further moves, the minutes said. Key economic data on jobs, inflation, and growth were delayed by the six-week government shutdown, leaving Fed officials with only outdated information at their meeting earlier this month.",
      "The minutes don't identify specific officials. But how they vote is public, and two policymakers dissented in favor of keeping rates unchanged: Jeffrey Schmid, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and Austan Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed.",
      "The third dissent was from Fed governor Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in September and favored a half-point cut.",
      "When the Fed reduces its key rate, over time it can lower borrowing costs for homes, cars, and credit cards, though market forces also affect those rates.",
      "At its December meeting, the Fed also released quarterly economic projections, which also showed the extent of the divisions on the Fed committee. Seven officials projected no cuts in 2026, while eight forecast two or more reductions. Four supported just one cut.",
      "Weaker job market",
      "A weaker job market would likely spur the Fed to reduce borrowing costs more quickly. Two weeks ago, the government reported that employers had cut about 40,000 jobs in October and November, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, a four-year high.",
      "Inflation, meanwhile, remains above the Fed's 2% target, complicating the central bank's next moves. In November, annual inflation cooled to 2.7%, down from 3% in September, but last month's data were likely distorted by the shutdown, economists said, which forced the government to estimate many price changes rather than measuring them directly.",
      "Powell said after the Dec. 10 meeting that the central bank cut rates out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears.",
      "While government data shows that the economy added just 40,000 jobs a month from April through September, Powell said that figure could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers actually shed an average of 20,000 jobs a month during that period.",
      "\"It's a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks,\" Powell told reporters. \"People care about that. That's their jobs.\"",

      "Monday's selloff in silver was sparked by a technical change at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world's largest commodities trading venues. The exchange said it would require traders to put up more cash to hold positions in silver, gold and other metals after prices surged this year.",

    "summary": "A federal judge has ruled that the White House cannot stop funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "The White House may not stop funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal judge ruled Tuesday, days before funds at the bureau were likely to run out and the consumer finance agency would lack the funds to pay its employees.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman ruled the CFPB can continue to get its funds from the Federal Reserve, though the Fed is operating at a loss, and the White House has made a new legal argument that way the CFPB gets its funds is not valid.",
      "At the heart of this case is whether White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who is also the acting director of the CFPB, can effectively shut down the agency and lay off all of the bureau's employees. The CFPB has largely been inoperable since President Trump was sworn into office nearly a year ago. Its employees are mostly forbidden from doing any work, and most of the bureau's operations this year has been to unwind the work it did under President Biden and even under Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Vought himself has made comments indicating he intends to effectively shut down the CFPB.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the workers at the CFPB, has been mostly successful in its legal efforts to stop the mass layoffs. The union sued Vought earlier this year and won a preliminary injunction stopping the layoffs.",
      "In recent weeks, the White House has used a new line of argument to potentially get around the court's restraining order. The argument is that the Federal Reserve has no \"combined earnings\" at the moment to fund the CFPB's operations. The CFPB obtains its funding from the Fed through expected quarterly payments.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been operating at a paper loss since 2022 as a result of the central bank's efforts to combat inflation. The Fed holds bonds on its balance sheet from a period of low interest rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, but currently has to pay out higher interest rates to banks that hold their deposits at the central bank. The Fed has been recording a \"deferred asset\" on its balance sheet which it expects will be paid down in the next few years as the low interest bonds mature off the Fed's balance sheet.",
      "Because of this loss on paper, the White House has argued there are no \"combined earnings\" for the CFPB to draw on. The CFPB has operated since 2011, including under Mr. Trump's first term, drawing on the Fed's operating budget.",
      "White House lawyers sent a notice to the court in early November, where they argued that the CFPB would run out of appropriations in early 2026, under the \"combined earnings\" argument, and does not expect to receive any additional appropriations from Congress.",
      "This combined earnings legal argument is not entirely new. It has floated in conservative legal circles going back to the moment the Federal Reserve started operating at a loss. However, it has never been tested in court.",
      "\"It appears that defendants' new understanding of \"combined earnings\" is an unsupported and transparent attempt to starve the CPFB of funding and yet another attempt to achieve the very end the Court's injunction was put in place to prevent,\" Berman wrote in an opinion.",
      "A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Berman's opinion.",

      "Georgia, where the Republican Party controls both chambers of the state legislature as well as the governor's office, will trim its income tax rate to 5.09% in 2026, down from 5.19% in 2025.",
      "The state is set to decrease its income tax by 0.10% every year until the rate reaches 4.99%, according to WABE, NPR's member station in Atlanta. Some lawmakers have advocated eliminating the state income tax, the outlet reported.",
      "Indiana",
      "In Republican-led Indiana, the state's flat-rate individual income tax \u2014 a single rate applied to all taxpayers regardless of income \u2014 will fall to 2.95% from 3% at the start of next year, under a budget measure passed by the state legislature in 2023. The rate is slated to drop another 0.05 percentage point to 2.9% in 2027.",
      "Kentucky",
      "Kentucky's individual income tax rate will be cut to 3.5% on Jan. 1, down from its current 4%. The change stems from a 2022 bill that includes a trigger mechanism to incrementally reduce the state's income tax each year, as long as revenue, spending and the budget reserve trust fund meet certain thresholds,\u00a0according\u00a0to Louisville Public Media.",
      "Kentucky has a Republican majority in its state legislature and a Democratic governor.",
      "Mississippi",
      "The individual income tax in Mississippi will decrease from 4.4%\u00a0 in 2025 to 4% as of Jan. 1, 2026, in what the Tax Foundation said is the final round of a multi-year scheduled reduction.",
      "New legislation signed by Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, in March will reduce the individual income tax rate to 3% by 2030, and allow the state to continue cutting it annually until it reaches 0%.",
      "Montana",
      "A bill passed in the Montana state legislature this year lowers its top marginal rate \u2014 the rate applied to the highest portion of a person's income \u2014 from 5.9% to 5.65% in 2026, then down to 5.4% in 2027. The new law also expands the number of people eligible for the lowest tax bracket.",
      "Montana has a Republican trifecta, meaning the party controls the governor's office and holds a majority in both chambers of the state legislature.",
      "Nebraska",
      "The\u00a0individual income tax rate in Republican-led Nebraska will dip to 4.55% starting Jan. 1 from 5.2% currently. The decrease is part of an ongoing reduction that will lower the rate to 3.99% by 2027, the Tax Foundation said in its analysis.",
      "In 2023, the state had a budget of $1.9 billion but now faces a $432 million shortfall,\u00a0according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). Some lawmakers have\u00a0called\u00a0on the state to pause the next phase of income tax cuts to shore up the state's budget.",
      "North Carolina",
      "In North Carolina, where the governor is a Democrat and the state legislature is controlled by Republicans, the individual income tax rate will be reduced from 4.25% to 3.99% in 2026.",
      "North Carolina has a flat income tax rate, meaning the same rate applies to all state residents regardless of their incomes.",
      "Ohio",
      "The state's main budget bill\u00a0this year paved the way for its individual income tax to decline to a flat rate of 2.75% for all nonbusiness income over $26,050, down from 3.125% currrently, according to the Tax Foundation.",
      "After the budget plan was approved, the Ohio House of Representatives said in a release\u00a0that the move to a flat tax rate \"makes Ohio more competitive with surrounding states, simplifies the tax code and spurs revenue.\"",
      "The Republican party holds the offices of governor, secretary of state, attorney general and both chambers of the state legislature.",
      "Oklahoma",
      "In Republican-led Oklahoma, the top marginal income tax rate will decrease from 4.75% to 4.5% beginning Jan. 1. A tax reform measure signed into law earlier this year also consolidated\u00a0the state's six individual income tax brackets into three.",
      "Additional savings",
      "Americans could see additional tax savings next year as a result of the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" act passed this year, which introduced a slate of new tax changes, including lifting the cap on the state and local tax deduction (SALT) from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "Piper Sandler estimates taxpayers' refunds will be about one-third larger than usual, translating to an average of roughly $1,000 more per filer. The financial services company expects middle- and upper-middle-income households to benefit the most.",

    "story": [
      "OpenAI is seeking a new \"head of preparedness\" to guide the company's safety strategy amid mounting concerns over how artificial intelligence tools could be misused.",
      "According to the job posting, the new hire will be paid $555,000 to lead the company's safety systems team, which OpenAI says is focused on ensuring AI models are \"responsibly developed and deployed.\" The head of preparedness will also be tasked with tracking risks and developing mitigation strategies for what OpenAI calls \"frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm.\"",
      "\"This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,\" CEO Sam Altman wrote in an\u00a0X\u00a0post describing the position over the weekend.",
      "He added, \"This is a critical role at an important time; models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges.\"",
      "Reached for comment, an OpenAI spokesperson referred CBS News to Altman's post on X.",
      "The company's investment in safety efforts comes as scrutiny intensifies over artificial intelligence's influence on mental health, following multiple\u00a0allegations\u00a0that OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT, was involved in interactions preceding a number of suicides.",
      "In one case earlier this year\u00a0covered by CBS News, the parents of a 16-year-old sued the company, alleging that ChatGPT encouraged their son to plan his own suicide. That prompted OpenAI to announce new safety protocols for users under 18.",
      "ChatGPT also allegedly fueled what a lawsuit filed earlier this month described as the \"paranoid delusions\" of a 56-year-old man who murdered his mother and then killed himself. At the time, OpenAI said it was working on improving its technology to help ChatGPT recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations and guide people toward real-world support.",
      "Beyond mental health concerns, worries have also increased over how artificial intelligence could be used to carry out cybersecurity attacks. Samantha Vinograd, a CBS News contributor and former top Homeland Security official in the Obama administration, addressed the issue on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "\"AI doesn't just level the playing field for certain actors,\" she said. \"It actually brings new players onto the pitch, because individuals, non-state actors, have access to relatively low-cost technology that makes different kinds of threats more credible and more effective.\"",
      "Altman acknowledged the growing safety hazards AI poses in his X post, writing that while the models and their capabilities have advanced quickly, challenges have also started to arise.",
      "\"The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025; we are just now seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities,\" he wrote.",
      "Now, he continued, \"We are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides ... in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits.\"",
      "According to the job posting, a qualified applicant would have \"deep technical expertise in machine learning, AI safety, evaluations, security or adjacent risk domains\" and have experience with \"designing or executing high-rigor evaluations for complex technical systems,\" among other qualifications.",

      "\"We spent decades and decades and purchased in blood, and got nothing economically in return, and President Trump flips the script,\" Hegseth told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil.",
      "Maduro was\u00a0captured by U.S. forces\u00a0and brought to New York on Saturday to face drug trafficking charges. Hegseth was among the senior Trump administration officials who oversaw the overnight U.S. military operation in Venezuela that led to Maduro's capture.",
      "President Trump said\u00a0earlier Saturday that \"we're going to run the country\" until there is a \"safe, proper and judicious transition\" of power in Venezuela, but he provided few details about\u00a0what that may look like. Mr. Trump said the U.S. would \"get the oil flowing.\"",
      "Hegseth said that through strategic action, the U.S. can ensure it has access to \"additional wealth and resources, enabling a country to unleash that without having to spend American blood.\"",
      "\"I mean, this was a bold and audacious move, but it was thought through,\" Hegseth said. \"It was well orchestrated. Our military had time to set it up, to provide the resources, and then he took that bold stroke. And through it, we flipped that very dynamic, and Americans will benefit.\"",
      "Hegseth told CBS News that the United States can help both the people of Venezuela and America in the Western Hemisphere by reestablishing the Monroe Doctrine \u2014 which established the tenets of U.S. foreign policy \u2014 with \"peace through strength with our allies.\"",
      "\"And I think the hemisphere, I know the hemisphere will benefit from President Trump's bold action,\" Hegseth said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges stemming from what prosecutors said was his role in a scheme to import \"thousands of tons\" of cocaine into the United States and enrich himself, his family and senior members of the Venezuelan government.",
      "The indictment was unsealed Saturday by Attorney General Pam Bondi after Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were taken into military custody in an overnight operation and brought to the U.S. to face criminal charges. \"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi said.",
      "Maduro, Flores and four others are named as defendants in the indictment, including Maduro's son, Nicol\u00e1s Ernesto Maduro; Venezuela's interior minister, Diosdado Cabello; its former interior minister, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez Chac\u00edn; and a leader of the gang Tren de Aragua, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores.",
      "It's unclear whether the U.S. has arrested Maduro's son. The other three defendants were not taken into custody.",
      "Maduro and Flores could appear in court in Manhattan as early as Monday, two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News. The case against them was brought in the Southern District of New York, where Maduro and 14 others were first indicted in March 2020, during the first Trump administration. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein\u00a0is overseeing the case.",
      "The plane carrying Maduro landed at an airport in the Hudson Valley on Saturday afternoon. The Venezuelan leader was expected to be turned over to federal authorities and arraigned at the U.S. district court in the Southern District of New York next week, two sources told CBS News.",
      "Secured by U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, the superseding indictment alleges that for more than 25 years, \"leaders of Venezuela have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States.\"",
      "Prosecutors place Maduro at the \"forefront of the corruption,\" and say that he and his associates worked with drug traffickers and narco-terrorists to flood the U.S. with \"thousands of tons of cocaine.\" This drug trafficking, according to the indictment, enriched Maduro, his family and members of Venezuela's political and military elite.",
      "\"This cycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect and transport tons of cocaine into the United States,\" the indictment states.",
      "Maduro faces four charges: narco-terrorism conspiracy; cocaine importation conspiracy; possession of machineguns and destructive devices; and conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices.",
      "\"Maduro and his wife will soon face the full might of American justice and stand trial on American soil,\" President Trump said in a press conference from his South Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, earlier Saturday.",
      "The indictment alleges that Maduro has used his various positions in the Venezuelan government to transport cocaine. Prosecutors said that as minister of foreign affairs, Maduro sold diplomatic passports to known drug traffickers to help them move drug proceeds from Mexico back to Venezuela under diplomatic cover and facilitated the movement of private planes under diplomatic cover to evade law enforcement scrutiny.",
      "Maduro and his wife also allegedly worked together between 2004 and 2015, with the help of military escorts, to traffic cocaine seized by Venezuelan law enforcement. Prosecutors said the two maintained their own groups of state-sponsored gangs to facilitate and protect their drug-trafficking operation. They are accused of ordering kidnappings, beatings and murders against people who owed them money or who undermined their drug-trafficking operation.",
      "Prosecutors said that after Maduro became president in 2013, he and others authorized the arrest of certain Venezuelan military officials to divert scrutiny away from them after French authorities seized 1.3 tons of cocaine that had been dispatched on a commercial flight from Venezuela to Paris.",
      "Maduro's wife is accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to broker a meeting between a large-scale drug trafficker and the head of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office, Nestor Reverol Torres, according to the indictment. The trafficker then arranged to pay a monthly bribe to Reverol Torres to ship cocaine, and Flores received a portion of it, prosecutors said.",

      "Mr. Trump did not offer many details about his administration's plans for the U.S. role in Venezuela as he spoke about the overnight mission from his South Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago. The president had announced on social media hours earlier that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were \"captured and flown out of the country.\" Officials told CBS News that the operation was carried out by the U.S. Army's Delta Force, an elite special operations unit.",
      "Maduro and his wife were brought to the U.S. to face criminal charges stemming from what prosecutors have alleged is their participation in a conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and to import \"thousands of tons\" of cocaine to the U.S. Maduro and his wife arrived at Stewart Airport just north of New York City on Saturday afternoon, hours after their capture.",
      "With Maduro's ouster, it's unclear who is in charge in Venezuela or could lead the nation in the future. Mr. Trump said it would be \"very tough\" for Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado to take over because she \"doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country.\"",
      "The president said Secretary of State Marco Rubio also had a conversation with Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who Mr. Trump said has been \"sworn in\" and is \"essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"",
      "But in remarks on state television, Rodriguez said Maduro is the \"only president of Venezuela\" and demanded his release.",
      "Venezuela held its last presidential election in July 2024, but election authorities did not provide detailed vote counts, and the U.S. and many European countries rejected Maduro's claim of victory. The U.S. under the Biden administration recognized opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the president-elect. Gonz\u00e1lez fled into exile in Spain in September 2024 after a warrant was issued for his arrest.",

We're not going to let that happen,\" the president said. \"We're there now. And what people don't understand, but they understand as I say this, we're there now, but we're going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place.\"",
      "He did not provide any additional details about how the U.S. would oversee Venezuela, under what authority, or whether the U.S. would play a role in picking a new leader.",
      "Mr. Trump did indicate that top administration officials \u2014 including Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who appeared alongside Mr. Trump on Saturday \u2014 would work with a \"team\" working with the Venezuelan people. He did not, however, say who would be included in that group.",

And ultimately, he'll decide what the iterations are of that,\" Hegseth said. \"But, it means the drugs stop flowing, it means the oil that was taken from us is returned, ultimately, and that criminals are not sent to the United States.\"",
      "Role of the oil industry",
      "When asked about a timeframe for U.S. involvement, Mr. Trump said Venezuela's \"whole infrastructure\" has to be rebuilt. He focused in particular on the prospect of rebuilding the oil industry in a nation with one of the world's largest petroleum reserves.",
      "\"If we just left, it [Venezuela] has zero chance of ever coming back,\" he said. \"We'll run it properly. We'll run it professionally. We'll have the greatest oil companies in the world going in and invest billions and billions of dollars and take out money, use that money in Venezuela, and the biggest beneficiary is going to be the people of Venezuela.\"",
      "When asked about the\u00a0blockade of sanctioned oil\u00a0from Venezuela imposed by Mr. Trump last month, Hegseth said no oil is going in or out of the country, and the U.S. military is still poised in the Caribbean.",
      "\"[Mr. Trump] said it clearly at the podium today. We are going to get American companies in there. We are going to get investment in there. These oil depots have been operating at 20% capacity. That's going to change,\" Hegseth told CBS News.",
      "Maduro regime figures remain in place",
      "While the Trump administration has removed Maduro, top members of his government remain in place. Among them are Rodr\u00edguez, who Maduro selected as his vice president, as well as Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello.",
      "Cabello is named as a defendant alongside Maduro and his wife in the superseding indictment returned by a federal grand jury in New York as allegedly part of the narco-terrorism conspiracy.",

      "Mr. Trump gave final approval of the mission Friday at 10:46 p.m. ET, telling military leaders, \"Good luck and godspeed,\" Caine told reporters Saturday afternoon during a news conference at the president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.",
      "Throughout the night, aircraft launched from 20 bases across the Western Hemisphere toward Venezuela. Caine said the mission, named Operation Absolute Resolve, involved more than 150 aircraft.",
      "\"As the night began, the helicopters took off with the extraction force, which included law enforcement officers, and began their flight into Venezuela at 100 feet above the water,\" Caine said.",
      "As the helicopters approached shore, they were protected by other aircraft, including drones, bombers and fighter jets. The U.S. dismantled and disabled Venezuela's air defense systems as the helicopters neared Caracas, according to Caine, who also said they deployed weapons \"to ensure the safe passage of the helicopters into the target area.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the lights in Caracas had largely gone dark \"due to a certain experience that we have.\"",
      "\"As the force crossed the last point of high terrain where they'd been hiding in the clutter, we assessed that we had maintained totally the element of surprise,\" Caine said.",
      "Once at the compound, the helicopters came under fire but remained operable, Caine said.",
      "\"It was a lot of gunfire,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "U.S. forces and the FBI eventually entered the compound, where Maduro and his wife \"gave up\" and were taken into custody, Caine said.",
      "Mr. Trump said that Maduro tried to escape during his capture.",
      "\"He was trying to get into a safe place,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"The safe place is all steel, and he wasn't able to make it to the door because our guys were so fast.\"",
      "\"It was a very thick door, a very heavy door,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He made it to the door. He was unable to close it.\"",
      "But even if Maduro had made it to the safe room, Mr. Trump said the military forces could have blown up the door in about \"47 seconds.\"",
      "After Maduro and his wife were apprehended, the helicopters swooped back in to exfiltrate them. Fighter aircraft and drones also provided protection during their journey out of the country. Caine said there were \"multiple self-defense engagements\" during the withdrawal.",
      "\"The force successfully exfiltrated and returned to their afloat launch bases, and the force was over the water at 3:29 a.m. Eastern Standard Time with indicted persons onboard,\" Caine said.",
      "One of the U.S. helicopters was hit and some U.S. soldiers were injured in the raid.",
      "Mr. Trump watched the mission unfold at his home in Mar-a-Lago as soldiers of the Army's elite Delta Force dropped in and breached Maduro's compound shortly after 2 a.m.",
      "The U.S. began planning the operation months ago, with U.S. intelligence agencies working to \"find Maduro and understand how he moved, where he lived, where he traveled, what he ate, what he wore, what were his pets,\" Caine said.",
      "The operation had been ready to go since early December, but the U.S. was waiting for the right time to minimize civilian harm and maximize the surprise, Caine said, adding that it was also weather-dependent.",
      "\"Last night, the weather broke just enough, clearing a path that only the most skilled aviators in the world could maneuver through \u2014 ocean, mountain, low clouds, ceilings,\" Caine said.",

    "summary": "President Trump said \"we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be\" after the surprise U.S. attack. Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil sector.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. strike on Venezuela\u00a0has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",
      "Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.",
      "How much oil does Venezuela produce?",
      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 billion barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near\u00a0term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

      "Hours after Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was captured by U.S. forces, the country's vice president and other top regime figures condemned the military operation in stark terms and suggested they plan to push back on U.S. involvement in the country, posing a potential challenge to President Trump's suggestion that the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela.",
      "Maduro was flown out of the country in a \"large scale strike\" by U.S. forces, Mr. Trump said early Saturday. He is expected to be tried on drug trafficking charges, effectively ending a nearly 13-year reign that began after the death of President Hugo Chavez. The operation followed months of U.S. military, economic and diplomatic pressure on the Maduro regime.",
      "Top figures in Maduro's government pushed back against the U.S. operation almost immediately after it began early Saturday morning.",
      "VP Delcy Rodriguez calls Maduro the \"only president of Venezuela\"",
      "Maduro's handpicked\u00a0vice president, Delcy Rodriguez \u2014 whom Mr. Trump said was sworn in as president Saturday \u2014 called Maduro's capture \"barbaric,\" an \"illegal and illegitimate kidnapping\" and an attack on Venezuela's sovereignty in a speech that was broadcast on state TV.",
      "She also called for the \"immediate release\" of Maduro and his wife, calling him \"the only president of Venezuela.\"",
      "Rodriguez's defiant words came as Mr. Trump suggested he's looking to work with the vice president in some form. In a press conference Saturday at Mar-a-Lago, the U.S. president said Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Rodriguez, who indicated that \"she's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called Rodriguez \"quite gracious\" but said \"she really doesn't have a choice.\"",
      "The American leader said the U.S. is planning to \"run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\" It's not clear exactly how the country will be led, or to what extent existing Venezuelan officials or political figures would be involved. Mr. Trump said \"we're designating various people\" and suggested members of his administration will play key roles.",
      "Rodriguez said Saturday that the Venezuelan government is open to \"dialogue,\" pointing to Maduro's statement earlier this week that he's willing to negotiate with the U.S. on drug trafficking. But she did not offer any clear indications that she's looking to work with the U.S. if it takes over, accusing Venezuela's \"enemies\" of seeking to \"enslave us.\"",
      "\"If there is one thing that the Venezuelan people and this country are very clear about, it is that we will never again be slaves, that we will never again be a colony of any empire, of whatever stripe,\" Rodriguez said in her address on state television.",
      "Venezuelan leaders call for military to mobilize against \"aggression\"",
      "Shortly after the U.S. operation began, the Venezuelan government said in a statement that national defense plans had been activated and Maduro ordered a \"State of External Disturbance,\" effectively a state of emergency.",
      "Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez announced that military forces would be deployed across Venezuela on \"Maduro's orders\" \u2014 though he didn't mention Maduro's capture \u2014 and called for resistance against \"the worst aggression\" Venezuela has faced.",
      "\"They've attacked us but they will not subdue us,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello called for \"calm\" in a video translated by Reuters, saying, \"No one should fall into despair, no one should make things easier to our invading enemy.\"",
      "Attorney General Tarek William Saab called the U.S. operation a \"vile and cowardly attack\" in remarks to Venezuelan state media, alleging that some innocent people were \"mortally wounded.\"",
      "Venezuelan diplomats have also requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, sending a letter to the body asking it to condemn the U.S.'s \"aggression.\" Foreign Minister Yvan Gil accused the U.S. of seeking to take Venezuela's natural resources. (On Saturday, Mr. Trump said part of his goal in Venezuela is to \"get the oil flowing\" in the petroleum-rich state.)",
      "Venezuelan opposition leaders say they're ready to take charge, but Trump isn't so sure",
      "Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado celebrated Maduro's ouster, saying in a statement: \"Venezuelans, the time for freedom has come!\"",
      "Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, called for Edmundo Gonzalez to be recognized as Venezuela's legitimate president and to take control of the armed forces. Gonzalez faced off against Maduro in the country's last election in 2024, but the government recognized Maduro as the winner, in a result that was widely criticized by the U.S. and international observers on allegations that Maduro had stolen votes.",
      "\"Today we are ready to assert our mandate and take power. Let us remain vigilant, active, and organized until the democratic transition is complete,\" said Machado.",
      "Gonzalez said on X: \"[W]e are ready for the great operation of the reconstruction of our nation.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump said in his press conference Saturday that it would be \"very tough\" for Machado to help lead the country, saying she didn't have enough support.",

He added that no U.S. service members were killed.",
      "\"We're not afraid of boots on the ground,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But we're going to make sure that country is run properly. We're not doing this in vain.\" He added, \"We're going to be running it with a group and we're going to make sure it's run properly.\"",

      "Mr. Trump said the vice president who had been appointed by Maduro has been sworn in, but the U.S. would have a presence in Venezuela.",
      "However, Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, speaking on state media on Saturday, affirmed that Maduro is Venezuela's \"only president\" and demanded his immediate release.",
      "When asked to clarify if this meant the U.S. military would have a presence in Venezuela, Mr. Trump said there would be a military presence \"because of oil.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the overnight operation a \"massive joint military and law enforcement raid that was flawlessly executed.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had said Maduro and his wife were flown out of Venezuela after the U.S. carried out a \"large scale strike.\" Calling into \"Fox and Friends\" on Saturday morning, he said Maduro had been \"in a very highly guarded, like a fortress actually.\"",

Later Saturday morning, Bondi shared a superseding indictment.",
      "The indictment, prepared by U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, accuses Maduro of conspiracy to commit narcoterrorism and to import cocaine, and of possessing and conspiring to possess \"Machineguns and Destructive Devices.\" The charges appear to be the same as a 2020 indictment of Maduro and several key aides.",
      "Mr. Trump said Maduro was in a house when he was captured, saying it was \"more like a fortress than a house.\"",
      "\"It had steel doors, it had, what they call a safety space where it's, you know, solid steel all around,\" he said. \"He didn't get that space closed. He was trying to get into it but he got bum-rushed so fast that he didn't get into that. We were prepared, we had, you know, massive blow torches and everything else that you need to get through that steel, but we didn't need it. He didn't make it to that area of the house.\"",
      "Mr. Trump praised the operation in Venezuela, saying he thinks no U.S. troops were killed.",
      "\"You know that we had nobody killed was amazing,\" he said. \"I think we had nobody killed, I have to say, because a couple of guys were hit, but they came back and they're supposed to be in pretty good shape.\"",
      "The president said the U.S. was prepared to carry out the Venezuela operation days ago, but waited for the weather conditions to improve.",
      "\"We were going to do this four days ago but the weather was not perfect,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And then all of a sudden it opened up and we said go.\"",

      "At least seven explosions were heard, along with low-flying aircraft, in Venezuela's capital city Caracas around 2 a.m. local time on Saturday. People in various neighborhoods rushed to the streets. Some could be seen in the distance from various areas of Caracas.",
      "Trump administration officials said they were aware of reports of explosions and aircraft, sources told CBS News, but there was no immediate response to requests for the White House to comment and no immediate reaction from Venezuela's government.",

      "\"Alert to the whole world, they have attacked Venezuela bombing with missiles,\" he said, calling for a meeting of the United Nations.",
      "The reported explosions come after months of the U.S. military targeting alleged drug-smuggling boats in the region, and as the Trump administration exerts pressure on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Thousands of U.S. forces and several naval vessels have been deployed to the region, and President Trump has hinted for weeks at a wider possible military operation.",
      "The Trump administration has accused Maduro's regime of collaborating with drug traffickers, which the Venezuelan government denies. The U.S. has also put pressure on Venezuela's oil sector, seizing two sanctioned oil tankers last month. Mr. Trump announced a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned tankers that enter or exit Venezuela in mid-December.",
      "On Friday, Venezuela said it was open to negotiating an agreement with the United States to combat drug trafficking. Maduro also said in a pretaped interview aired Thursday that the U.S. wants to force a government change in Venezuela and gain access to its vast oil reserves.",
      "Mr. Trump has not explicitly said what his goal for Venezuela is, but said late last month it would be \"smart\" for Maduro to leave power. He also warned that if Maduro \"plays tough, it'll be the last time he'll ever be able to play tough.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Coast Guard said late Friday it has called off a dayslong search for several people in the Eastern Pacific who jumped overboard when their alleged drug-trafficking boats were targeted by the U.S. military.",
      "The military says it struck a group of three boats on Tuesday \u2014 part of a monthslong campaign of airstrikes that the Trump administration says are targeting Latin American drug cartels at sea. But after the first boat was struck, killing three, as many as eight people aboard the other two boats abandoned their vessels, U.S. officials told CBS News earlier this week.",
      "The Coast Guard said in a statement that the people were reported missing about 400 nautical miles off the Mexico-Guatemala border. The search lasted about 65 hours and covered an area of ocean that spanned more than 1,090 nautical miles, but multiple search boats did not spot any \"survivors or debris,\" according to the Coast Guard.",
      "\"At this stage of the response, the likelihood of a successful outcome, based on elapsed time, environmental conditions, and available resources for a person in the water is very low,\" Coast Guard Capt. Patrick Dill said in the statement.",
      "The search was carried out by a Coast Guard plane that took off from California, a vessel in the area that belonged to the Coast Guard's emergency assistance system and three other nearby vessels that were asked to help. The Coast Guard said in its statement that \"available assets were extremely limited due to distance and range constraints.\"",
      "A Coast Guard spokesperson told CBS News earlier Friday that 40-knot winds and nine-foot seas were reported in the area.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro \u2014 who has clashed with the Trump administration in recent months \u2014 wrote on X Friday that the people appeared to survive the strikes. He said the Colombian Navy was willing to assist.",
      "The U.S. military has conducted at least 35 boat strikes in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific between Sept. 2 and Dec. 31, killing at least 115 people.",
      "The military has reported survivors in a handful of boat strikes \u2014 and has faced heavy scrutiny for its handling of those cases. Two survivors from a mid-October strike were detained by the U.S. Navy and then repatriated to Colombia and Ecuador. One survivor from a late October operation is presumed dead after the Mexican Navy called off a search for the person.",
      "And in the Trump administration's first set of boat strikes on Sept. 2, two people survived the initial attack but were killed in a follow-on strike. Congressional Democrats who viewed a video of the operation criticized the second strike, alleging the military killed shipwrecked people who no longer posed a threat, but GOP lawmakers have called the strike justifiable, arguing the survivors appeared to still be in the fight.",
      "The boat strikes are part of a broader military buildup in the region, amid a growing U.S. pressure campaign against the regime of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The Trump administration has accused Maduro's government of working with drug cartels, which it denies.",
      "The operations have drawn criticism from lawmakers who argue the president is operating without permission from Congress. The Trump administration has defended the strikes as necessary to combat drug trafficking, calling the targets \"unlawful combatants.\"",

    "summary": "As U.S.-Iran tension soars, Trump warns violence against protesters could bring an American intervention: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump warned Friday in a social media post that if Iran \"violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"",
      "Mr. Trump offered no further comment on Iran or how the U.S. might intervene to protect protesters in the country in the post on his Truth Social network, which was published just before 3 a.m. Eastern, but he said: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"",
      "It came hours after reports that at least eight people have been killed amid nearly a week of escalating protests in Iran. The unrest began last weekend as business owners voiced frustration at the dire economic conditions in the Islamic Republic.",
      "Iran has been plagued for years by staggering hyperinflation, fueled by Western sanctions imposed over the hardline clerical government's nuclear program and backing for militant groups across the region.",
      "Protests continued Friday in various cities in the country, The Associated Press reported, even as life largely continued unaffected in the capital, Tehran. Demonstrations have reached over 100 locations in 22 of Iran's 31 provinces, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported. It said the death toll in the demonstrations rose with the death of a demonstrator in Marvdasht in Iran's Fars province.",
      "Videos and photos from Tehran and other cities posted on social media have shown protesters marching through streets from early this week, often chanting anti-government, pro-monarchy slogans and sometimes clashing violently with security forces.",
      "Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute who studies Iran, told CBS News the current round of protests were triggered in part by shopkeepers upset by Iran's weakening currency. Shopkeepers tend to be a fairly conservative group, he noted, but many have warned that the country's economic troubles have made operating their businesses untenable.",
      "\"They don't come out in the streets unless they really have to,\" Vatanka said. \"And they've done it now, which sort of gives you an indication how dire the situation has become.\"",
      "In an apparent bid to quell the unrest, Iranian authorities have acknowledged the economic concerns and said peaceful protests are legitimate, but suggested that foreign powers \u2014 usually a reference to Israel and the U.S. \u2014 are behind subversive elements fueling violence on the streets.",
      "Reacting to the latest remarks by the U.S. president, Ali Larijani, a former speaker of Iran's parliament who's now the secretary of the country's National Security Council, said Friday in his own social media post that \"Trump should know that intervention by the U.S. in the domestic problem corresponds to chaos in the entire region and the destruction of the U.S. interests.\"",
      "\"The people of the U.S. should know that Trump began the adventurism,\" said Larijani.",
      "\"They should take care of their own soldiers,\" he added, in what appeared to be a reference to the U.S. military forces based across the Middle East, who are in easy range of Iran's vast stockpile of ballistic missiles.",
      "There was a more sternly worded warning from Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said \"any interventionist hand that gets too close to the security of Iran will be cut.\"",
      "\"The people of Iran properly know the experience of 'being rescued' by Americans: from Iraq and Afghanistan to Gaza,\" he said in a social media post.",
      "Both the U.S. and Israeli governments had issued statements in support of the protests in Iran prior to Mr. Trump's warning on Friday morning of a possible, unspecified U.S. intervention.",
      "\"The people of Iran want freedom. They have suffered at the hands of the Ayatollahs for too long,\" Mike Waltz, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said in a post on X earlier this week. \"We stand with Iranians in the streets of Tehran and across the country as they protest a radical regime that has brought them nothing but economic downturn and war.\"",
      "Vatanka told CBS News it's not clear what steps the Trump administration might take to support the protesters or push back on a crackdown by the Iranian regime. But he believes Mr. Trump's gestures of support could embolden the protesters.",
      "\"We shouldn't underestimate the value of an American president who floats the idea of U.S. support for the protests,\" he said. \"It could just be the ... one ingredient you need to keep this movement, the street-level movement alive, because in recent years, these protests have tended to sort of die down after a few days [or a] few weeks.\"",
      "Tension between the U.S. and Iran escalated this week on the heels of a visit to the U.S. by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has campaigned his country's close allies in Washington for decades to take a tougher stance on Iran.",
      "After meeting with Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Sunday, Mr. Trump said he had heard that Iran could be attempting to rebuild its nuclear program following the unprecedented U.S. strikes on its enrichment facilities in June. Mr. Trump warned that if Iran did try to rebuild, \"we'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Iranian President Mahsoud Pezeshkian said Tehran would respond \"to any cruel aggression\" with unspecified \"harsh and discouraging\" measures.",
      "Iran is no stranger to nationwide protests, and the latest demonstrations have not come close to the last major outbreak in 2022, which was triggered by the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Iranian woman.",
      "Her death in custody after being arrested for allegedly violating the nation's strict dress code for women sparked a wave of anger across the nation. Several hundred people were killed, including dozens of members of the security forces, who waged a dramatic crackdown in response, arresting hundreds of people.",
      "There were also widespread protests in 2019, sparked by a sharp increase in the price of petrol.",
      "The standoff between Iran and the U.S. over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program reached a crescendo in June, when Mr. Trump ordered the deadly military strikes against Iran's enrichment facilities, as Israel also carried out strikes on the country.",
      "While Mr. Trump indicated earlier this week that the U.S. could take new action if Iran were to rebuild its nuclear program, Friday's brief post on social media was the first suggestion of a possible American intervention on behalf of Iranian protesters.",

      "As 2025 gives way to 2026, there is one story that's captured the nation's attention. It's not the striking of boats off the coast of Venezuela allegedly transporting drugs, or China's announcement of military maneuvers around Taiwan. It is the story of fraud in Minnesota, which federal prosecutors estimate could top $9 billion.",
      "A viral social media video by YouTuber Nick Shirley, which was amplified by Elon Musk, Vice President J.D. Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi, has put the issue into the center of the national conversation, stoking a scandal that has been brewing in state politics for years.",
      "In the wake of the video, the Trump administration announced it is pausing federal funding to child care in Minnesota, with President Trump calling Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\" The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also announced sweeping changes to how all states must submit claims for Medicaid-supported daycares, including requiring \"a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.\"",
      "Even before the video spread far across the internet, however, scandal plagued Minnesota. In 2021, federal law enforcement first probed a series of multimillion dollar fraud schemes. Those fraud schemes have led to federal charges against 92 people with 62 convicted \u2014 and counting.",
      "President Trump and other Republican lawmakers have focused attention on the state's large Somali community, as most of the fraud defendants are of Somali descent, drawing stiff criticism from local officials, including the state's Democratic Governor Tim Walz, who denounced Mr. Trump's criticism as \"vile, racist lies and slander towards our fellow Minnesotans.\"",
      "Walz, meanwhile, has faced intense scrutiny from both inside and outside Minnesota over his administration's handling of the crisis. The governor has acknowledged in recent weeks that the fraud problem could stretch into the billions, but disputed the $9 billion figure cited by prosecutors.",
      "While Shirley's video focused on allegations of fraud in daycares in Minneapolis, federal investigators told CBS News child care is only \"vaguely\" a priority for prosecutors, and attention and resources are instead focused on more than a dozen other social services programs in Minnesota, including nutrition, housing and behavioral health.",

The group claimed to work with restaurants and caterers to distribute meals to schools and extracurricular programs but instead submitted fake meal count sheets and invoices, raking in millions in administrative fees and getting kickbacks from people who ran their meal distribution sites, prosecutors said.\u00a0Feeding Our Future founder Aimee Bock was convicted earlier this year, and several others involved in the scheme have pleaded guilty or been convicted.Early on, Minnesota officials questioned some of the group's filings and slowed approvals of reimbursements, prompting Feeding Our Future to file a lawsuit accusing the state of racial discrimination. The state auditor's office found that \"the threat of legal consequences and negative media attention\" affected the state's decision-making process about regulatory action against Feeding Our Future.What federal prosecutors called \"the largest pandemic era fraud in the United States\" is \"just the tip of a very large iceberg,\" according to FBI Director Kash Patel.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is aiming to move a planned 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom through the federal government's review process at a rapid clip, with final approvals as soon as early March.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is aiming to move a planned 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom through the federal government's review process at a rapid clip, with final approvals as soon as early March \u2014 potentially clearing the way for construction to start a month later.",
      "President Trump has sought to move quickly on the ballroom project, which is the most ambitious \u2014 and controversial \u2014 part of his push to transform the White House complex in line with his aesthetic vision. But the $400 million donor-funded project still needs to get approvals from two boards that oversee federal construction in Washington, D.C.: the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA).",
      "Administration officials met with the two boards and presented drawings on Dec. 19, and formally submitted applications three days later, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "The administration is aiming to hold a public informational meeting before the NCPC next week, on Jan. 8, with a meeting before the CFA one week later. Final presentations to the CFA and NCPC are slated for Feb. 19 and March 5, respectively, the official said.",
      "The National Park Service said in a court filing last month that above-grade construction is \"not anticipated to begin until April 2026, at the earliest.\" Construction is expected to wrap up in the summer of 2028, less than a year before Mr. Trump leaves office, according to a National Park Service assessment filed in court last month.",
      "NCPC spokesperson Stephen Staudigl and CFA Secretary Thomas Luebke confirmed to CBS News that the timeline is accurate.",
      "Staudigl said the White House consulted with the NCPC last month, and is expected to give a presentation on the project at a Jan. 8 public meeting. Luebke said the CFA will review a concept design \u2014 an initial step in the approval process \u2014 on Jan. 15, but the \"timing of the final approval submission lies with the applicant.\"",
      "The Washington Post was\u00a0first to report\u00a0the timing of NCPC and CFA approvals.",
      "The dates of the NCPC and CFA meetings could shift somewhat. But the administration's timeline for the ballroom is extremely aggressive by the standards of the federal government, which often takes months or years to secure approvals for far smaller projects.",
      "It took several years to design, approve and build a new perimeter fence on the White House grounds during the Obama and first Trump administrations. Officials formally asked the NCPC to review the fencing project concept in June 2016, and the board eventually greenlit the plans in February 2017. Construction on the fence began in 2019.",
      "Approvals took even longer for a pricy project to renovate the Federal Reserve's headquarters, with seven public meetings before the NCPC between September 2019 and March 2021. The commission approved the project in September 2021, and construction is still ongoing.",
      "The NCPC is chaired by White House aide William Scharf, and two other Trump appointees currently serve on the commission. Mr. Trump fired all six sitting members of the CFA in October and is expected to appoint a slate of new members shortly.",
      "Plans for the ballroom have come together at a rapid pace. The White House first announced the project in July. By October, construction crews had demolished the building's entire East Wing, though Mr. Trump said months earlier that the existing structure would be left intact.",
      "At a mid-October dinner to recognize private donors to the ballroom, Mr. Trump marveled at how quickly he was able to get the project off the ground.",
      "\"They said, 'Sir, you can start tonight,\" the president told guests, recounting conversations with staff about the ballroom. \"'You have zero zoning conditions. You're the president.'\"",
      "That approach has drawn criticism from congressional Democrats and preservation\u00a0 groups, who argue the administration failed to properly engage with the public before taking a wrecking ball to part of the White House complex. The White House has argued that NCPC approval is only required for vertical construction, not demolition.",
      "The National Trust for Historic Preservation sued over the project late last year, seeking a temporary halt to construction work until the government gets any necessary approvals. The group has criticized the administration for tearing down the East Wing without seeking reviews and argued the ballroom's size \"will overwhelm the White House itself.\"",
      "\"The American people own these places. And we, the American people, have a right to weigh in when significant changes to them are proposed,\" Carol Quillen, president and CEO of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, said in an interview with CBS News last month. \"This project needs to follow the already legally mandated processes.\"",
      "A judge last month declined to pause construction outright, but said the administration had to\u00a0 engage the NCPC by the end of 2025. Further hearings on the Trust's request for a preliminary injunction are set for later this month. The judge told the government that if it does any underground construction that \"dictates the size or scale of the proposed ballroom\" before he has a chance to rule, the government \"should be prepared to take it down.\"",
      "At a White House event shortly after the ruling, Mr. Trump celebrated the judge's order and said \"we didn't want to be held up.\"",
      "\"Who else but in our country would sue to stop a $400 million beautiful ballroom that people have been after for the White House?\" the president said.",

    "summary": "The suspect, Brian Cole, has not yet entered a plea to the charges stemming from two bombs found near Republican and Democratic National Committee headquarters nearly five years ago.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday ordered the Virginia man suspected of leaving two pipe bombs outside the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic National Committees in 2021 to remain detained in the run-up to a criminal trial.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge Matthew Sharbaugh granted the Justice Department's request to keep the suspect, Brian Cole, in custody while he awaits a trial on two criminal counts. He has not yet entered a plea to the charges, which stem from the alleged planting of two improvised explosive devices near the Washington, D.C., headquarters of the RNC and DNC on Jan. 5, 2021, the night before the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.",
      "Sharbaugh wrote in a 19-page opinion that \"the government carried its ultimate burden to demonstrate that there are no conditions of release the Court could impose to reasonably assure the safety of the community.\"",
      "The decision came after Cole appeared in court Tuesday for a hearing on whether he should remain detained pending trial.",
      "Justice Department lawyers had argued in a legal filing that Cole poses an \"intolerable risk\" to the community and urged the court to keep him in custody \"considering the extreme and profoundly serious nature of his crimes, the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, the years he has spent deceiving those around him to avoid accountability, and the intolerable risk that he will again resort to violence to express his frustration with the world around him.\"",
      "But in arguing for his release, Cole's lawyers said he has lived \"without incident\" in the nearly five years since the bombs were planted and has no criminal history.",
      "His legal team wrote in a filing ahead of the hearing that Cole had been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 1, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Level 1 is the least severe form\u00a0on the spectrum, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.",
      "The FBI had worked for years to track down the perpetrator who planted the devices on Jan. 5, releasing video footage and photos to the public in hopes of identifying the suspect. The bombs, which did not detonate, were not discovered until the afternoon of Jan. 6, as local and federal authorities were overwhelmed when a mob of President Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol in an effort to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election.",
      "Cole was arrested last month after investigators looked at cellphone records, purchasing history and vehicle movements. Prosecutors said that during an interview with investigators after his arrest, Cole confessed to constructing the devices, filling them with explosive powder and setting the timers to detonate.",
      "He also said that he had driven to Washington on Jan. 5 to attend a protest over the outcome of the 2020 election and did not tell his family that he was going to a demonstration in support of Mr. Trump, Justice Department lawyers wrote in their filing.",
      "During the post-arrest interview, Cole denied any intent to interfere with Congress' certification of the 2020 election results, prosecutors said. Still, Sharbaugh, the magistrate judge, wrote in his opinion that \"the resulting fear and alarm followed all the same \u2014 and how could it not?\"",
      "While Cole's lawyers had noted that the devices did not detonate, and said they believe they would not have, the court called that argument \"decidedly unpersuasive.\"",
      "\"After all, Mr. Cole reportedly stated that he planted the devices \u2014 one of them underneath a public bench, no less \u2014 hoping they would detonate and that there would be news about it. Mercifully, that did not happen,\" Sharbaugh wrote. \"But if the plan had succeeded, the results could have been devas[ta]ting: creating a greater sense of terror on the eve of a high-security Congressional proceeding, causing serious property damage in the heart of Washington, D.C., grievously injuring DNC or RNC staff and other innocent bystanders, or worse.\"",
      "He continued: \"Simply put, the nature and circumstances of the charged offenses here are gravely serious, so this factor points strongly toward pretrial detention.\"",
      "Sharbaugh also found the weight of evidence against Cole to be \"significant,\" citing phone, vehicle and financial records.",
      "Cole faces two criminal offenses, but the magistrate judge put off immediately accepting an indictment returned by a grand jury convened in the District of Columbia Superior Court on Monday. Sharbaugh, who serves in the U.S. district court, said the use of a local grand jury to charge federal crimes raises additional questions. While a different federal judge in Washington\u00a0ruled\u00a0in November that judges must accept indictments for federal offenses returned by local grand juries, he put his decision on hold while an appeals court considers the issue.",
      "Later Friday, Sharbaugh issued an order accepting that two-count indictment returned by the local grand jury, \"on the understanding\" that prosecutors would pursue a new indictment from a federal grand jury when the panels reconvene in the new year.",

      "During the interview, Maduro reiterated that the U.S. wants to force a government change in Venezuela and gain access to its vast oil reserves through the monthslong pressure campaign that began with a massive military deployment to the Caribbean Sea in August.",
      "\"What are they seeking? It is clear that they seek to impose themselves through threats, intimidation and force,\" Maduro said, later adding that it is time for both nations to \"start talking seriously, with data in hand.\"",
      "\"The U.S. government knows, because we've told many of their spokespeople, that if they want to seriously discuss an agreement to combat drug trafficking, we're ready,\" he said. \"If they want oil, Venezuela is ready for U.S. investment, like with Chevron, whenever they want it, wherever they want it and however they want it.\"",
      "Chevron Corp. is the only major oil company exporting Venezuelan crude to the U.S. Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves.",

The latest attacks bring the total number of known boat strikes to 35 and the number of people killed to at least 115, according to numbers announced by the Trump administration.

    "summary": "Audits completed in the past 10 years show that Minnesota has lacked the teeth to properly vet attendance records and go after possible fraudsters proactively.",
    "story": [
      "A viral video has put a national spotlight\u00a0on Minnesota's child care network as allegations of widespread fraud swirl. Records show Minnesota has been trying to improve oversight of the Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP) payment system for more than a decade.",
      "The day after Christmas, YouTuber Nick Shirley released a video accusing nearly a dozen child care centers of taking government assistance without actually providing a service in Minneapolis. The video primarily features him and a man only referred to as \"David\" going to various centers, demanding entry or information, then stating that the center was empty.",
      "Shirley's central claim is that each day care is billing the CCAP for children who are not really there; WCCO found the video's broad claims are not proven.",
      "While federal and state investigators are now looking into each of the centers featured by Shirley, audits completed in the past 10 years show that Minnesota has lacked the teeth to properly vet attendance records and go after possible fraudsters proactively.",
      "In May of 2025, the federal Office of the Inspector General released an audit of 200 randomly selected child care assistance payments from 2023. The agency found that in 38 instances, \"Minnesota did not comply with requirements related to attendance and payment for services.\" The auditors extrapolated that to mean that the state was making at least one error in 11% of payments made to 1,155 centers in 2023.",
      "\"Minnesota's limited oversight of attendance documentation at childcare centers resulted in overpayments to providers,\" the audit states. \"A lack of oversight to ensure accurate and complete attendance documentation could increase the risk of fraud, waste and abuse to the CCAP program.\"",
      "The Office of the Inspector General   made recommendations, including \"strengthening its monitoring program to include routine reviews of CCAP attendance records for accuracy.\"",
      "In a response included in the audit, the Department of Health and Human Services agreed with this recommendation and others. DHS wrote that it is expanding what's called the Early and Often Program, which \"aims to ensure that new child care centers meet the requirements of CCAP by increased monitoring of their attendance record-keeping practices and compliance with state statutes.\"",
      "Months prior, in January 2025, Department of Children, Youth and Families Commissioner Tikki Brown acknowledged there are gaps in their fraud detection system when it comes to accurate attendance numbers.",
      "\"We certainly need to investigate that more thoroughly to ensure that agencies do have as broad authority as possible to investigate fraud and act on all aspects of fraud. I don't know that that's fully present,\" Brown said.",
      "In 2019, a report by the Office of the Legislative Auditor showed that the Minnesota Department of Human Services established an investigatory team to go after child care providers suspected of fraud in 2013. The office reviewed explosive claims of fraud from 2013 to 2018, ultimately finding that prosecutors were able to \"prove\" between $5 million to $6 million worth of fraud in those years.",
      "More than a dozen Minnesotans were charged in state and federal cases, but not everyone was convicted. The OLA could not provide an exact estimate, but the agency believed that the true extent of the fraud was greater than the $6 million figure. The OLA spoke to prosecutors who said that there were sometimes issues with the quality of evidence gathered by DHS.",
      "The OLA stated in this audit that the review had a \"limited scope ... We did not evaluate CCAP, nor did we fully assess the state's efforts to prevent, detect, and investigate CCAP fraud.\"",
      "Consistent across both reports is the recommendation to install electronic attendance gathering tools to ensure that numbers are recorded in real time, reducing the ability for centers to report false numbers.",
      "At a rally designed to push back on the Trump administration's decision to freeze all federal CCAP payments this week, DFL Rep. Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn said that those systems would be up and running this summer.",
      "At that same rally, providers scoffed at the idea that the current system is simple to defraud. Maria Snyder, a St. Paul area provider, said that she is consistently getting surprise visits and audits from state inspectors who rigorously check her attendance records. She said that you can get citations on complete technicalities.",
      "\"Imagine my surprise at this narrative that it's so easy to scam child care assistance,\" Snyder said.",
      "At a February 2025 meeting of the House Fraud Prevention and State Agency Oversight Policy Committee, officials said that DHS has a team of four investigators who look into CCAP.",
      "Since 2020, the team has recovered about $2.4 million, referring on average five cases annually for criminal investigations since 2021. During the same time frame, DHS has stopped payments to 79 CCAP providers, according to the committee.",
      "CBS News found that of the day cares that Shirley visited, all but two are licensed. State inspectors visited each of the licensed centers within the past six months, issuing citations related to violations like safety and staff training, but not fraud.",
      "Inspectors with the federal Department of Homeland Security and the state visited each of the day cares in Shirley's video.",
      "One of the day cares, which\u00a0showed WCCO security footage\u00a0that owners said proves children were present the day Shirley was there, said that DHS asked for two months' worth of attendance records. The results of these two investigations are not yet public.",

    "summary": "Starting January 1, food-stamp recipients in five U.S. states will face restrictions on using the benefits to buy some sugary foods.",
    "story": [
      "Starting New Year's Day, some food-stamp recipients around the U.S. will be banned from using the government nutrition assistance to buy candy, soda and other foods.",
      "Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia are the first of at least 18 states to enact waivers prohibiting people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from purchasing certain foods. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins have urged states to strip foods regarded as unhealthy from the $100 billion federal program.",
      "\"We cannot continue a system that forces taxpayers to fund programs that make people sick and then pay a second time to treat the illnesses those very programs help create,\" Kennedy said in a statement in December.",
      "The efforts are aimed at reducing chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes associated with sweetened drinks and other treats, a key goal of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again effort.",
      "Confusion for SNAP recipients?",
      "But retail industry and health policy experts said state SNAP programs, already under pressure from steep budget cuts, are unprepared for the complex changes, with no complete lists of the foods affected and technical point-of-sale challenges that vary by state and store. And research remains mixed about whether restricting SNAP purchases improves diet quality and health.",
      "The National Retail Federation, a trade association, predicted longer checkout lines and more customer complaints as SNAP recipients learn which foods are affected by the new waivers.",
      "\"It's a disaster waiting to happen of people trying to buy food and being rejected,\" said Kate Bauer, a nutrition science expert at the University of Michigan.",
      "The new restrictions are the latest source of concern for SNAP recipients. Food aid distributed under the program, which is used by 42 million Americans, was interrupted during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. Reliance on food stamps typically surges during economic downturns, such as the sharp slump that followed the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "Nearly 62% of SNAP participants are in families with children, while roughly 37% are in households with older adults or people with disabilities,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit\u00a040-year highs\u00a0following the pandemic.",
      "Retailers fear impact",
      "A report by the National Grocers Association and other industry trade groups estimated that implementing SNAP restrictions would cost U.S. retailers $1.6 billion initially and $759 million each year going forward.",
      "\"Punishing SNAP recipients means we all get to pay more at the grocery store,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director for the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center.",
      "The waivers are a departure from decades of federal policy first enacted in 1964 and later authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which said SNAP benefits can be used for \"any food or food product intended for human consumption,\" except alcohol and ready-to-eat hot foods. The law also says SNAP can't pay for tobacco.",
      "In the past, lawmakers have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for expensive meats like steak or so-called junk foods, such as chips and ice cream.",
      "But previous waiver requests were denied based on USDA research concluding that restrictions would be costly and complicated to implement, and that they might not change recipients' buying habits or reduce health problems such as obesity.",
      "Under the second Trump administration, however, states have been encouraged and even incentivized to seek waivers \u2013 and they responded.",
      "\"This isn't the usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda,\" Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said when he announced his state's request last spring. \"We're focused on root causes, transparent information and real results.\"",
      "How many people are affected",
      "The five state waivers that take effect Jan. 1 affect about 1.4 million people. Utah and West Virginia will ban the use of SNAP to buy soda and soft drinks, while Nebraska will prohibit soda and energy drinks. Indiana will target soft drinks and candy. In Iowa, which has the most restrictive rules to date, the SNAP limits affect taxable foods, including soda and candy, but also certain prepared foods.",
      "\"The items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store,\" Plata-Nino wrote in a blog post. \"Many additional items \u2014 including certain prepared foods \u2014 will also be disallowed, even though they are not clearly identified in the notice to households.\"",
      "Marc Craig, 47, of Des Moines, said he has been living in his car since October. He said the new waivers will make it more difficult to determine how to use the $298 in SNAP benefits he receives each month, while also increasing the stigma he feels at the cash register.",
      "\"They treat people that get food stamps like we're not people,\" Craig said.",
      "SNAP waivers enacted now and in the coming months will run for two years, with the option to extend them for an additional three, according to the Agriculture Department. Each state is required to assess the impact of the changes.",
      "Health experts worry that the waivers ignore larger factors affecting the health of SNAP recipients, said Anand Parekh, a medical doctor who is the chief health policy officer at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\"This doesn't solve the two fundamental problems, which is healthy food in this country is not affordable and unhealthy food is cheap and ubiquitous,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Climate change worsened by human behavior made 2025 one of the three hottest years on record, scientists said.",
      "It was also the first time that the three-year temperature average broke through the threshold set in the 2015 Paris Agreement of limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times. Experts say keeping the Earth below that limit could save lives and prevent catastrophic environmental destruction around the globe.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution researchers, released Tuesday in Europe, came after a year when people around the world were slammed by the dangerous extremes brought on by a warming planet.",
      "Temperatures remained high despite the presence of a La Ni\u00f1a, the occasional natural cooling of Pacific Ocean waters that influences weather worldwide. Researchers cited the continued burning of fossil fuels \u2014 oil, gas and coal \u2014 that send planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",
      "\"If we don't stop burning fossil fuels very, very, quickly, very soon, it will be very hard to keep that goal\" of warming, Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College London climate scientist, told The Associated Press. \"The science is increasingly clear.\"",
      "Extreme weather events kill thousands of people and cost billions of dollars in damage annually.",
      "Scientists stress humans' contributions to climate change",
      "WWA scientists identified 157 extreme weather events as most severe in 2025, meaning they met criteria such as causing more than 100 deaths, affecting more than half an area's population or having a state of emergency declared. Of those, they closely analyzed 22.",
      "That included dangerous heat waves, which the WWA said were the world's deadliest extreme weather events in 2025. The researchers said some of the heat waves they studied in 2025 were 10 times more likely than they would have been a decade ago due to climate change.",
      "\"The heat waves we have observed this year are quite common events in our climate today, but they would have been almost impossible to occur without human-induced climate change,\" Otto said. \"It makes a huge difference.\"",
      "Meanwhile, prolonged drought contributed to wildfires that scorched Greece and Turkey. Torrential rains and flooding in Mexico killed dozens of people and left many more missing. Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed the Philippines, forcing more than a million people to evacuate. Monsoon rains battered India with floods and landslides.",
      "Warning times shortened",
      "The WWA said the increasingly frequent and severe extremes threatened the ability of millions of people across the globe to respond and adapt to those events with enough warning, time and resources \u2014 what the scientists call \"limits of adaptation.\" The report pointed to Hurricane Melissa as an example: The storm intensified so quickly that it made forecasting and planning more difficult, and pummeled Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti so severely that it left the small island nations unable to respond to and handle its extreme losses and damage.",
      "This year's United Nations climate talks in Brazil in November ended without any explicit plan to transition away from fossil fuels, and though more money was pledged to help countries adapt to climate change, they will take more time to do it.",
      "Officials, scientists, and analysts have conceded that Earth's warming will overshoot 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), though some say reversing that trend remains possible.",
      "Mixed bag in climate change fight",
      "Yet different nations are seeing varying levels of progress.",
      "China is rapidly deploying renewable energies including solar and wind power \u2014 but is also continuing to invest in coal. Though increasingly frequent extreme weather has spurred calls for climate action across Europe, some nations say that limits economic growth. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Trump administration has steered the nation away from clean-energy policy in favor of measures that support coal, oil and gas.",
      "\"The geopolitical weather is very cloudy this year, with a lot of policymakers very clearly making policies for the interest of the fossil fuel industry rather than for the populations of their countries,\" Otto said. \"And we have a huge amount of mis- and disinformation that people have to deal with.\"",
      "Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia University Climate School who wasn't involved in the WWA work, said places are seeing disasters they aren't used to, extreme events are intensifying faster and they are becoming more complex. That requires earlier warnings and new approaches to response and recovery, he said.",
      "\"On a global scale, progress is being made,\" he added, \"but we must do more.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:50:19 -0500",
    "summary": "The company's investment in safety prevention comes amid growing concerns over the potential harm of artificial intelligence.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI is seeking a new \"head of preparedness\" to guide the company's safety strategy amid mounting concerns over how artificial intelligence tools could be misused.",
      "According to the job posting, the new hire will be paid $555,000 to lead the company's safety systems team, which OpenAI says is focused on ensuring AI models are \"responsibly developed and deployed.\" The head of preparedness will also be tasked with tracking risks and developing mitigation strategies for what OpenAI calls \"frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm.\"",
      "\"This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,\" CEO Sam Altman wrote in an\u00a0X\u00a0post describing the position over the weekend.",
      "He added, \"This is a critical role at an important time; models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges.\"",
      "Reached for comment, an OpenAI spokesperson referred CBS News to Altman's post on X.",
      "The company's investment in safety efforts comes as scrutiny intensifies over artificial intelligence's influence on mental health, following multiple\u00a0allegations\u00a0that OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT, was involved in interactions preceding a number of suicides.",
      "In one case earlier this year\u00a0covered by CBS News, the parents of a 16-year-old sued the company, alleging that ChatGPT encouraged their son to plan his own suicide. That prompted OpenAI to announce new safety protocols for users under 18.",
      "ChatGPT also allegedly fueled what a lawsuit filed earlier this month described as the \"paranoid delusions\" of a 56-year-old man who murdered his mother and then killed himself. At the time, OpenAI said it was working on improving its technology to help ChatGPT recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations and guide people toward real-world support.",
      "Beyond mental health concerns, worries have also increased over how artificial intelligence could be used to carry out cybersecurity attacks. Samantha Vinograd, a CBS News contributor and former top Homeland Security official in the Obama administration, addressed the issue on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "\"AI doesn't just level the playing field for certain actors,\" she said. \"It actually brings new players onto the pitch, because individuals, non-state actors, have access to relatively low-cost technology that makes different kinds of threats more credible and more effective.\"",
      "Altman acknowledged the growing safety hazards AI poses in his X post, writing that while the models and their capabilities have advanced quickly, challenges have also started to arise.",
      "\"The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025; we are just now seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities,\" he wrote.",
      "Now, he continued, \"We are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides ... in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits.\"",
      "According to the job posting, a qualified applicant would have \"deep technical expertise in machine learning, AI safety, evaluations, security or adjacent risk domains\" and have experience with \"designing or executing high-rigor evaluations for complex technical systems,\" among other qualifications.",
      "OpenAI first announced the creation of a preparedness team in 2023, according to TechCrunch.",

    "story": [
      "It was in the early morning hours of Jan. 12, 2020, when 31-year-old Shea Briar was found clinging to life on a rural road in Jay County, Indiana.",
      "Briar was unable to communicate, and first responders were initially unsure of what had happened to him, but when he arrived at the hospital, medical staff discovered a bullet wound in his back.",

      "Sibray was an acquaintance of Briar's former fianc\u00e9e, 29-year-old Esther Jane Stephen. Stephen, who went by the name E.J., was a local high school softball coach. She and Briar shared a young daughter together.",
      "Sibray, a former police officer, told detectives that in the months leading up to Briar's murder, Stephen came over often and that she was accompanied by her assistant coach, 19-year-old Shelby Hiestand.",
      "During those visits, Sibray said Stephen would confide in her about problems she was having with Briar. Stephen and Briar had recently broken off their engagement, and Briar had filed a court petition to establish parenting time for the daughter they shared.",
      "\"He wanted to provide for her \u2026 and he just really wanted to have some visitation,\" Tracy Hoevel, Briar's mother, told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "But according to Sibray, Stephen wasn't happy about it.",
      "\"She didn't want to share the baby. That was her baby. That was her child,\" Sibray told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Sibray told investigators that Stephen would discuss ways to get rid of Briar, but that she didn't think anything of it at the time.",
      "\"I just really thought she was venting. I did not think that was for real,\" Sibray told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "And Sibray said she had that same mindset when, over time, the conversations grew more detailed \u2014 and various methods were discussed. At one point, Sibray said Stephen and Hiestand told her they put pills in Briar's tea.",
      "\"They crushed up ibuprofen, I believe \u2026 And he did drink the whole glass, but nothing happened to him,\" Sibray told \"48 Hours.\" \"I'm like, 'are you serious?' ... I didn't even \u2026 believe her. \u2026 Because I just could not see her doing that.\"",
      "But when Sibray learned of Briar's murder, she said she immediately viewed all those conversations in a different light.",
      "\"I felt like I failed because how did I miss this? How did I miss these signs?\" Sibray said.",
      "A day after speaking to Sibray, detectives brought Stephen and Hiestand in for questioning.",
      "After initially denying involvement in Briar's murder, they both admitted they took him to that rural road and that Hiestand shot him in the back.",
      "Hiestand told detectives she blacked out then fired the gun at Briar.",
      "E.J. Stephen and Shelby Hiestand were arrested and charged with murder, but they would both later plead not guilty and when Stephen went on trial, she placed all the blame on Hiestand.",
      "Stephen took the stand and insisted she had no reason to want Briar dead. And as for those pills in Briar's drink, Stephen said that it was Hiestand's idea and that she only went along with it because she thought it was an innocent chemistry experiment.",

    "summary": "Shea Briar was found on a rural bridge in Jay County, Indiana, clinging to life with a bullet through his heart. E.J. Stephen, Briar's ex-fianc\u00e9e and the mother of his child, would soon become a suspect. The  high school softball coach would not be the only one.",
    "story": [
      "On Sunday, Jan. 12, 2020, when 31-year-old Shea Briar didn't show up for church, Pastor Angela Smiley knew something was wrong. She had just seen him the night before.",
      "Pastor Angela Smiley: We served at a noodle dinner. \u2026 He's there walking the old ladies out. \u2026 We were last ones in the church. He said, \"I'll beat you here in the morning.\" \u2026 And when I came up over the hill and didn't see his truck, I'm like, this isn't good. \u2026 For weeks and weeks and months and months, he was always the first one at the church. Always. \u2026 Shea Briar was not late.",
      "In Jay County, Indiana, word travels fast. It wasn't long before Briar's aunt, Tiffany McLaughlin, and his grandmother, Sharon Taylor, heard Shea was missing.",
      "Sharon Taylor: I started calling the hospitals, the sheriff's departments, everybody, and nobody would give me any information. Nobody.",
      "But then Briar's roommate called McLaughlin letting her know police were there. When McLaughlin arrived at Briar's home, an officer told her the unthinkable.",
      "Tiffany McLaughlin: He said that Shea had been shot. (crying) And I said, \"well, is he OK?\" And he said, \"no, he died on the operating table.\" (crying)",
      "Briar's mother, Tracy Hoevel, was living all the way in Hawaii at the time. Her sister and mother called her to deliver the news.",
      "Tracy Hoevel: I'm like, no. I mean, I think I must have screamed so loud \u2026 I mean, we're in shock.",
      "Sydney Hoevel, Briar's half-sister, was only 17.",
      "Sydney Hoevel: I remember my mom just fell over on the couch, basically, like crying and screaming. \u2026 I still can't believe it to this day. \u2026 It doesn't even seem real.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: At that point, did anyone have any idea what happened to Shea?",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: No. We had no idea what happened to Shea.",
      "Ben Schwartz was one of the lead detectives assigned to the case.",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: Jay County is a very rural farming community. \u2026 It's certainly not like working in a big city where it's back-to-back calls. \u2026 And as soon as this happened, it was a \u2014 it was a pretty big deal. \u2026 It's isolated where he was found. \u2026 We wondered how he got there. \u2026 We just had to start from ground zero.",
      "Who was Shea Briar?",
      "Ground zero meant digging into who Shea Briar was and what he had been up to. He was born in Indiana but was raised in Hawaii by his mom and stepdad.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: What sort of kid was Shea?",
      "Tracy Hoevel: A little rascal. (laughs) \u2026 He was very polite. He would open doors. \u2026 he was fun. \u2026 He loved his G.I. Joes. \u2026 He always wanted to be in the military from a really small age.",
      "So, it was no surprise when, after high school, Briar joined the Navy. And it was also no surprise when, after he was discharged, he returned to live in Jay County.",
      "Sydney Hoevel: Shea was always an Indiana boy. \u2026 He loved the tractors. He loved all the land.",
      "And that's where he wanted to put down roots.",
      "Tiffany McLaughlin: He really wanted to have a girlfriend \u2026 get married and have a family.",
      "But things didn't quite happen in that order. In 2018, Tracy Hoevel got a phone call from her son.",
      "Tracy Hoevel: He's like\u2026 \"Hey mom, guess what? \u2026 you're gonna be a grandma.\" I was like, \"What? I didn't even know you had a girlfriend.\" (laughs)",
      "The future mother of his child was Esther Jane Stephen, a local high school softball coach who also ran a day care, and went by the name E.J.",
      "Tiffany McLaughlin: I don't think they were boyfriend and girlfriend, you know. I think it was just one of those things.",
      "In January 2019, Shea and E.J.'s daughter was born. It was only after her birth, that the two decided to start dating. They soon were engaged. But Briar's family felt it was forced.",
      "Tiffany McLaughlin: They weren't all lovey-dovey for, you know, the lack of a better word.",
      "Sharon Taylor: I tried to tell him, is this how you wanna live your life with someone that's really not who you're meant to be with?",
      "Anne-Marie Green: You felt that?",
      "Sharon Taylor: Oh, definitely, because they did not have a connection \u2026",
      "They must have sensed something because in September 2019, just weeks before the wedding, E.J. called it off.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Was he disappointed?",
      "Tiffany McLaughlin: Yes. Because \u2026 he wanted a family.",
      "It was around that time that Smiley says Briar began coming to church.",
      "Pastor Angela Smiley: He needed God. And he needed a friend \u2026 He started hanging out with \u2026 men in our church that were active fathers. \u2026 And he wanted that for his daughter.",
      "But Smiley, and Briar's family, say for reasons unbeknownst to them, E.J. made it difficult.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: After the engagement is broken off, what sort of access does Shea have to his daughter?",
      "Sharon Taylor: He doesn't.",
      "Tracy Hoevel: None.",
      "Sharon Taylor: No. \u2026",
      "Tracy Hoevel: He went quite a long time without seeing her. \u2026",
      "Anne-Marie Green: And he was trying to see her and \u2014",
      "Tracy Hoevel: Yeah.",
      "Tiffany McLaughlin: That's why he finally got a lawyer.",
      "Briar told his mother that when E.J. found out, she wasn't happy.",
      "Tracy Hoevel: He told me, she said to him, \"if you go through with this, you'll be sorry.\"\u2026",
      "But that didn't stop Shea. In November 2019, he filed a court document seeking to \"establish paternity\" \u2026 \"and to provide custody, support, and parenting time.\"",
      "Tracy Hoevel: He wanted to provide for her \u2026\u00a0 and he just really wanted to have some visitation \u2026",
      "He also wanted his daughter to have his last name \u2014 something E.J. had decided against.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Why was it important for Shea to be in his daughter's life? \u2026",
      "Tracy Hoevel: Shea really did not know his dad. \u2026 He just did not wanna be his biological dad. \u2026 He wanted to have a good relationship with his kids and be a good role model.",
      "But two months later, before the case made its way to court, Shea was murdered. And Tracy Hoevel and McLaughlin suspected E.J. may have had something to do with it.",
      "Tiffany McLaughlin: 'Cause there wasn't anyone else.",
      "But as it turns out, there would be other suspects.",
      "Friend of E.J. Stephen Shares Concerns With Detectives",
      "Less than 24 hours after Shea Briar died, Detective Ben Schwartz and his partner called E.J. Stephen, Shea's ex-fianc\u00e9e and the mother of his child, into the sheriff's office.",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: We talked to her and told her about what happened to Shea.",
      "DET. MITCH SUTTON: Unfortunately, this morning we were called out \u2026 because Shea had sustained some injuries. \u2026 They were life-threatening injuries, and he did not make it.",
      "E.J. STEPHEN: OK.",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: She really didn't have a whole lot to say.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Did you find her reaction curious?",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: Yeah. \u2026I would've expected \u2026 a little bit of emotion out of her. Uh, but that didn't happen. And I would've expected a lot more questions, but she really didn't ask too many questions at all.",
      "And Detective Schwartz says that wasn't the only thing that stuck out.",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: She said that the last time she talked to Shea would've been the week prior.",
      "But he knew she was lying. Shea's phone records revealed she was the last person to call him at around midnight, within hours of him being found on that bridge.",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: That was a huge red flag. \u2026",
      "A red flag, but not proof she committed murder. Detectives chose not to confront her about the phone records that day.",
      "DET. BEN SCHWARTZ (to E.J. Stephen): I'll give you my card. And uh \u2026 If there's something you hear that you might think will spark our interest, give us a call.",
      "There was still a lot of work to be done, a lot of questions to be answered. And the next day, a call from a woman would help investigators out.",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: She unloaded and told us a lot of interesting stuff.",
      "Kristi Sibray has known E.J. Stephen for years. She used to umpire softball games that E.J. played in and took her kids to the day care that E.J. ran out of Fairview United Methodist Church in Portland, Indiana.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: How would you describe her?",
      "Kristi Sibray: Very quiet \u2026 great with kids \u2026 she's very involved in the community activities \u2026",
      "Over the years, Sibray says she became a mentor of sorts to E.J.",
      "Kristi Sibray: She always would just stop by here and there. \u2026 say hi, or just stop in if something was bothering her \u2026",
      "Sibray had never met Shea Briar, but she knew he was the father of E.J.'s daughter. And when she learned he was murdered, she started to panic.",
      "Kristi Sibray: I just dropped everything, and I just started screaming. I was like, oh my God. Oh my God.\u2026 And then I contacted a friend that was still in the city police department. And I said, \"I need to talk, pick me up now at work.\"",
      "Sibray, a former police officer, soon found herself inside a Jay County Sheriff's Office interview room.",
      "DET. BEN SCHWARTZ (to Kristi Sibray): Start at the beginning and share with us uh what you want to get off your chest.",
      "She began by telling Schwartz and his partner that she received a call from E.J. a few days prior to Shea's death. She said E.J. asked her to babysit that weekend \u2014 something she had never asked her to do before.",
      "Kristi Sibray: And I'm like, yeah. Not a problem. \u2026So, all day Saturday I'm like, OK, what time am I getting her? I had not heard anything. \u2026 We were, like, getting down for the night. (laugh) About 10, 10:30, here she comes with the child. \u2026",
      "It was Saturday, Jan. 11, 2020, just hours before Shea was found shot.",
      "Kristi Sibray: She goes, OK, I'll be back in a little bit. And I'm like, OK, what are you doing? And she goes, oh, we're just \u2014 just going out. \u2026 She came in by herself.",
      "Sibray says E.J. didn't return until around 1 a.m.",
      "Kristi Sibray: I had heard her open the back door. So, I got up and I met her there \u2026 And I said, \"E.J., what were you doing?\" She goes \"nothing.\" And she was real standoffish. \u2026 I said, come on E.J., what were you doing? \u2026 And she goes, I can't tell you. But I'm sure you'll hear about it in the paper in the next couple days. And she left. \u2026",
      "Anne-Marie Green: You must have been thinking about that all night.",
      "Kristi Sibray: Yes.",
      "But that was just the beginning of what Sibray told police. She said that in the months leading up to Shea's murder, E.J. came over a lot and she wasn't alone.",
      "Kristi Sibray: Shelby was always in the car with E.J. \u2026",
      "Shelby is Shelby Hiestand. She was 18 years old. E.J. was 29 and used to be her high school softball coach. After Shelby graduated, she became E.J.'s assistant coach \u2014 at another nearby high school just over the border in Fort Recovery, Ohio. Shelby also worked at the day care with E.J.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Did you think it was odd \u2026 that here's E.J. hanging out with Shelby?",
      "Kristi Sibray: Mm-hmm.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: There's a good 10 years between the two.",
      "Kristi Sibray: Mm-hmm. I think everybody thought it was odd.",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: From what I have been told, they were pretty well inseparable.",
      "Detectives had heard Shelby's name before. Shea's family had mentioned her.",
      "Tracy Hoevel: Shelby was always around in the picture. I think there was some major jealousy between Shelby and Shea. \u2026 You know, he never came out and said it, but he kind of insinuated things.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: What did he insinuate?",
      "Tracy Hoevel: He thought maybe there was something more going on.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: More than a friendship?",
      "Tracy Hoevel: Possibly. \u2026",
      "And Shea wasn't the only one who suspected something.",
      "Kristi Sibray: I just assumed that maybe they were a couple. \u2026",
      "E.J. and Shelby would later deny being anything more than friends. Sibray told investigators that the two began stopping by shortly after Shea filed that court document to establish paternity.",
      "Kristi Sibray: Shelby pretty much stayed with the child and E.J. would sit with me at the kitchen table \u2026",
      "And she said E.J. wanted advice.",
      "Kristi Sibray: She just asked me what do I do? 'Cause I have been divorced \u2026 She didn't want to share the baby. That was her baby. That was her child. \u2026 Some of the conversations at the table would be \u2026 how can we get rid of him so we don't have to go to court? And I'm like, how do you get rid of him? You're not going to get rid of him.",
      "Sibray insists she didn't think anything at the time.",
      "Kristi Sibray: Anybody who goes through a breakup, don't think they didn't say, oh, I wish he was gone, or I wish he was dead. But do we act on it? And that's why I'm thinking I've been divorced twice. I'll tell you. I \u2014 I probably said it.",
      "And Kristi says she had that same mindset when, over time, the conversations grew more detailed and various methods were discussed.",
      "Kristi Sibray: I just really thought she was venting. I did not think this was for real.",
      "But when Kristi heard Shea was murdered, she says she immediately viewed all those conversations in a different light.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: At that point, do you think E.J. is involved in this somehow?",
      "Kristi Sibray: Yes.",
      "And she knew she had to go to police.",
      "Kristi Sibray: I didn't even think about it. \u2026 But as a police officer standpoint, I felt like I failed because how did I miss this? How did I miss these signs? \u2026 I could have prevented this. \u2026 And I didn't, 'cause I didn't think she could.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: And this was your opportunity to do something.",
      "Kristi Sibray: Yeah. Sorry. (crying)",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: It was just kind of unbelievable \u2026",
      "After Sibray was done talking, Schwartz says there was one thing on his mind.",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: We've gotta get E.J. back in here \u2026",
      "Anne-Marie Green: So, you say, come on in, E.J.",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: Yup. \u2026 We just want to know the truth and what happened to Shea.",
      "A Turning Point in the Investigation",
      "On Jan. 14, 2020, just two days after Shea Briar was murdered, E.J. Stephen was back inside the Jay County Sheriff's Office. Detective Ben Schwartz and his partner first confronted her about those phone records, which revealed she called Shea shortly before he died \u2014 something she had previously been dishonest about.",
      "DET. BEN SCHWARTZ: Midnight, you called his phone. We're just kind of wondering how that conversation went.",
      "E.J. STEPHEN: I did not talk to him. I didn't make that call. I butt-dialed him.",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: She said that she butt-dialed Shea \u2026",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Did you believe her?",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: No. \u2026 We kind of pressed her on that a little bit. And then finally, she said, OK, yeah, we talked, but it wasn't for very long.",
      "E.J. insisted she didn't see Shea that night, but detectives didn't believe her.",
      "DET. BEN SCHWARTZ (to E.J. Stephen): You know a hell of a lot more than you're telling us. And we will find out. \u2026",
      "And soon, they told her her friend, Shelby Hiestand, was also being questioned.",
      "DET. BEN SCHWARTZ (to E.J. Stephen): This is not a game.",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: Her demeanor kind of changed a little bit. \u2026 It was a turning point.",
      "In a cool and calm tone, E.J. cracked and began to tell detectives what happened that night. Starting with how she dropped her daughter off at Kristi Sibray's. She told them Shelby was in the car waiting. From there, \"48 Hours\" retraced their steps based on E.J.'s account.",
      "Anne-Marie Green (in car with Schwartz): How does she tell you the night unfolds? \u2026",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: From there, they came to the church. \u2026 At the time, it was a day care also \u2026",
      "It was the day care where E.J. and Shelby worked. E.J. said they had to move furniture before church the next day and that another friend, 18-year-old Hannah Knapke, met them there. Hannah also sometimes worked at the day care, and E.J. used to coach her in softball, too.",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz (outside of the day care): So, this is the day care \u2026",
      "Anne-Marie Green: What do they do here after they move that furniture?",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: After they move the furniture \u2026 they were planning on how to get rid of Shea, basically.",
      "E.J. STEPHEN: \u2026 We were all kind of joking about it.",
      "DET. BEN SCHWARTZ: OK.",
      "E.J. STEPHEN: Like it wasn't a full-blown serious conversation, you know?",
      "She said earlier that day, she had picked Shelby's rifle up from Shelby's house. And that while in the day care parking lot, Shelby got the gun out and fired a round.",
      "E.J. STEPHEN: We just wanted to see how loud it was.",
      "According to E.J., after Shelby fired that shot, all three of them got into Hannah's parents' van with the rifle in the back.",
      "Anne-Marie Green (in car with Schwartz): So where did they go from the day care?",
      "Det. Ben Schwartz: From the day care, they \u2026 drove around \u2026 still discussing whether or not they should follow through with killing Shea. \u2026 And somewhere along the line \u2026 E.J. called Shea. \u2026",
      "E.J. STEPHEN (to detectives): We asked him, \"Do you want to come for a ride with us?\" And he came.",
      "After they picked Shea up, with Shelby driving, E.J. said they headed to that bridge.",
      "Anne-Marie Green (at bridge): So about what time do they get out here?",

      "But detectives believe E.J. knew exactly what was going to happen that night. They believe she cold heartedly planned it, and that the cruelty continued after Shea was shot. Because when police located Shea, his cell phone was nowhere to be found.",

      "DET. MITCH SUTTON: OK. \u2026",

      "Wes Schemenaur: That she was essentially shocked and surprised that Shelby did this, that all of this talking and planning had been done as a joke \u2026",
      "As for those pills in Shea's drink? E.J. testified that it was Shelby's idea \u2014 and that she only went along with it because she thought it was an innocent chemistry experiment.",

      "But E.J. offered an explanation. She said Shelby would often go hunting, so she didn't think anything of it when Shelby fired that round in the church parking lot. But what about what E.J. did after the murder?",

You're not really gonna be able to convince me that Esther's phone was dead either.

      "Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured overnight from their home in Caracas. They were transported to the USS Iwo Jima warship before being flown to New York to face criminal charges. The couple could be arraigned as soon as Monday, two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "Maduro arrived at Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn, at about 8:52 p.m. ET on Saturday. He was not slated to be housed in his own wing as of Saturday evening. His wife's confinement status as of Saturday night is unknown.",

      "In a superseding indictment filed in the Southern District of New York against Maduro, members of his family and his cabinet, the U.S. is accusing the South American leader of conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and to import cocaine. He is also accused of possession of and conspiracy to possess \"Machineguns and Destructive Devices,\" according to the indictment unsealed Saturday by Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "\"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi said.",
      "The charges appear to be the same as those that were filed in a 2020 indictment of Maduro and several key aides.",
      "The indictment, prepared by New York U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, says: \"For over 25 years, leaders of Venezuela have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States,\" before alleging that Maduro \"is at the forefront of that corruption and has partnered with his co-conspirators to use his illegally obtained authority and the institutions he corroded to transport thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States.\"",
      "The U.S. government also claimed that Flores is involved in her husband's alleged crimes. According to the indictment, Flores allegedly brokered a meeting between a large-scale drug trafficker and the director of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office, Nestor Reverol Torres, and allegedly accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in 2007.",
      "The trafficker arranged a bribe to Reverol Torres \u2014 $100,000 per flight \u2014 to ship cocaine, prosecutors allege. Reverol Torres was\u00a0indicted in 2015 by U.S. prosecutors in New York.",
      "In the indictment filed against Maduro in 2020, federal prosecutors alleged that the Venezuelan leader and other senior Venezuelan government officials collaborated with the Colombian guerrilla group Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or FARC, to traffic cocaine and weapons to the U.S.",

    "summary": "An indictment charging Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro with drug trafficking was unsealed Saturday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges stemming from what prosecutors said was his role in a scheme to import \"thousands of tons\" of cocaine into the United States and enrich himself, his family and senior members of the Venezuelan government.",
      "The indictment was unsealed Saturday by Attorney General Pam Bondi after Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were taken into military custody in an overnight operation and brought to the U.S. to face criminal charges. \"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi said.",
      "Maduro, Flores and four others are named as defendants in the indictment, including Maduro's son, Nicol\u00e1s Ernesto Maduro; Venezuela's interior minister, Diosdado Cabello; its former interior minister, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez Chac\u00edn; and a leader of the gang Tren de Aragua, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores.",
      "It's unclear whether the U.S. has arrested Maduro's son. The other three defendants were not taken into custody.",
      "Maduro and Flores could appear in court in Manhattan as early as Monday, two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News. The case against them was brought in the Southern District of New York, where Maduro and 14 others were first indicted in March 2020, during the first Trump administration. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein\u00a0is overseeing the case.",
      "The plane carrying Maduro landed at an airport in the Hudson Valley on Saturday afternoon. The Venezuelan leader was expected to be turned over to federal authorities and arraigned at the U.S. district court in the Southern District of New York next week, two sources told CBS News.",
      "Secured by U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, the superseding indictment alleges that for more than 25 years, \"leaders of Venezuela have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States.\"",
      "Prosecutors place Maduro at the \"forefront of the corruption,\" and say that he and his associates worked with drug traffickers and narco-terrorists to flood the U.S. with \"thousands of tons of cocaine.\" This drug trafficking, according to the indictment, enriched Maduro, his family and members of Venezuela's political and military elite.",
      "\"This cycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect and transport tons of cocaine into the United States,\" the indictment states.",
      "Maduro faces four charges: narco-terrorism conspiracy; cocaine importation conspiracy; possession of machineguns and destructive devices; and conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices.",
      "\"Maduro and his wife will soon face the full might of American justice and stand trial on American soil,\" President Trump said in a press conference from his South Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, earlier Saturday.",
      "The indictment alleges that Maduro has used his various positions in the Venezuelan government to transport cocaine. Prosecutors said that as minister of foreign affairs, Maduro sold diplomatic passports to known drug traffickers to help them move drug proceeds from Mexico back to Venezuela under diplomatic cover and facilitated the movement of private planes under diplomatic cover to evade law enforcement scrutiny.",
      "Maduro and his wife also allegedly worked together between 2004 and 2015, with the help of military escorts, to traffic cocaine seized by Venezuelan law enforcement. Prosecutors said the two maintained their own groups of state-sponsored gangs to facilitate and protect their drug-trafficking operation. They are accused of ordering kidnappings, beatings and murders against people who owed them money or who undermined their drug-trafficking operation.",
      "Prosecutors said that after Maduro became president in 2013, he and others authorized the arrest of certain Venezuelan military officials to divert scrutiny away from them after French authorities seized 1.3 tons of cocaine that had been dispatched on a commercial flight from Venezuela to Paris.",
      "Maduro's wife is accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to broker a meeting between a large-scale drug trafficker and the head of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office, Nestor Reverol Torres, according to the indictment. The trafficker then arranged to pay a monthly bribe to Reverol Torres to ship cocaine, and Flores received a portion of it, prosecutors said.",
      "Reverol Torres was charged with narcotics offenses in 2015 and is a fugitive.",

      "Mr. Trump said in remarks from Mar-a-Lago that the U.S. carried out an \"assault like people have not seen since World War II\" in Venezuela. While Mr. Trump said \"we are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so,\" he said he did not believe a \"second wave\" would be necessary. He added that no U.S. service members were killed.",
      "\"We're not afraid of boots on the ground,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But we're going to make sure that country is run properly. We're not doing this in vain.\" He added, \"We're going to be running it with a group and we're going to make sure it's run properly.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said running Venezuela \"won't cost us anything\" because the U.S. would be reimbursed in oil money.",
      "\"We're going to be taking a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground,\" he said.",
      "Venezuela has one of the world's largest known oil reserves and was a founding member of OPEC, though its industry has suffered under years of mismanagement, corruption and sanctions. The U.S. Energy Information Administration\u00a0says that despite its vast reserves, Venezuela produced just 0.8% of total global crude oil in 2023.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the oil embargo on Venezuela currently remains in effect, and the American naval armada remains in position. He said the U.S. will retain all military options until all demands are met.",
      "Mr. Trump said the vice president who had been appointed by Maduro has been sworn in, but the U.S. would have a presence in Venezuela.",
      "However, Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, speaking on state media on Saturday, affirmed that Maduro is Venezuela's \"only president\" and demanded his immediate release.",
      "When asked to clarify if this meant the U.S. military would have a presence in Venezuela, Mr. Trump said there would be a military presence \"because of oil.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the overnight operation a \"massive joint military and law enforcement raid that was flawlessly executed.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had said Maduro and his wife were flown out of Venezuela after the U.S. carried out a \"large scale strike.\" Calling into \"Fox and Friends\" on Saturday morning, he said Maduro had been \"in a very highly guarded, like a fortress actually.\"",
      "The president also confirmed that Maduro was being taken to New York, after Attorney General Pam Bondi said earlier in the day that Maduro had been indicted in the Southern District of New York on narco-terrorism charges. Bondi said Maduro and his wife \"will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.\"",
      "\"They'll be heading to New York,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They were indicted in New York.\"",
      "Shortly before addressing reporters at Mar-a-Lago late Saturday morning, Mr. Trump shared a photo he said was of Maduro on board the USS Iowa Jima.",
      "In an indictment filed against the Venezuelan leader in 2020, federal prosecutors alleged that Maduro and other senior Venezuelan government officials collaborated with the Colombian guerrilla group Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or FARC, to traffic cocaine and weapons to the United States. Later Saturday morning, Bondi shared a superseding indictment.",
      "The indictment, prepared by U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, accuses Maduro of conspiracy to commit narcoterrorism and to import cocaine, and of possessing and conspiring to possess \"Machineguns and Destructive Devices.\" The charges appear to be the same as a 2020 indictment of Maduro and several key aides.",
      "Mr. Trump said Maduro was in a house when he was captured, saying it was \"more like a fortress than a house.\"",
      "\"It had steel doors, it had, what they call a safety space where it's, you know, solid steel all around,\" he said. \"He didn't get that space closed. He was trying to get into it but he got bum-rushed so fast that he didn't get into that. We were prepared, we had, you know, massive blow torches and everything else that you need to get through that steel, but we didn't need it. He didn't make it to that area of the house.\"",
      "Mr. Trump praised the operation in Venezuela, saying he thinks no U.S. troops were killed.",
      "\"You know that we had nobody killed was amazing,\" he said. \"I think we had nobody killed, I have to say, because a couple of guys were hit, but they came back and they're supposed to be in pretty good shape.\"",
      "The president said the U.S. was prepared to carry out the Venezuela operation days ago, but waited for the weather conditions to improve.",
      "\"We were going to do this four days ago but the weather was not perfect,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And then all of a sudden it opened up and we said go.\"",

      "Mr. Trump said Maduro and his wife had been flown out of Venezuela and will be taken to New York. The U.S. Army's Delta Force, an elite special forces unit, carried out the operation to capture them, officials told CBS News. The Trump administration notified Congressional leaders about the operation only after it began, Congressional sources told CBS News.",
      "Maduro, 63, has led Venezuela since 2013. His most recent election was disputed by international observers and the U.S.\u00a0recognized\u00a0opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner. The U.S. imposed sanctions against election officials for allegedly rigging the outcome, but Maduro was still\u00a0sworn in\u00a0for a third term in January.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Saturday morning that Maduro and his wife have been indicted in the Southern District of New York on narco-terrorism charges. Maduro was previously indicted in 2020 on allegations that he and other senior Venezuelan government officials collaborated with the Colombian guerrilla group Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or FARC, to traffic cocaine and weapons to the United States.",
      "The Justice Department also accused Maduro of leading a criminal organization called C\u00e1rtel de Los Soles. The Trump administration designated the group as a\u00a0foreign terrorist organization\u00a0last year, though some experts have\u00a0questioned that characterization. The U.S. has been offering a\u00a0$50 million reward for information leading to Maduro's capture.",
      "A\u00a0CBS News poll in November\u00a0found that 70% of Americans would oppose the U.S. taking military action in Venezuela, and 75% said the Trump administration would need Congressional approval. Most surveyed also said they did not see Venezuela as a major threat to the United States.",
      "Republicans react",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said he spoke with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after the operation in Venezuela.",
      "\"Nicolas Maduro is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans after years of trafficking illegal drugs and violent cartel members into our country \u2014 crimes for which he's been properly indicted in U.S. courts and an arrest warrant duly issued \u2014 and today he learned what accountability looks like,\" Johnson said. \"President Trump is putting American lives first, succeeding where others have failed, and under his leadership the United States will no longer allow criminal regimes to profit from wreaking havoc and destruction on our country.\"",
      "Senate Intelligence Chair Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said he spoke with Rubio and that Venezuela's interim government \"must now decide whether to continue the drug trafficking and colluding with adversaries like Iran and Cuba or whether to act like a normal nation and return to the civilized world.\"",
      "\"I urge them to choose wisely,\" he said.",
      "Utah Sen. Mike Lee said that he also spoke with Rubio, who said that Maduro would be brought to the U.S. Lee also said that Rubio \"anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in U.S. custody.\"",
      "Lee added that the operation \"likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,\" but did not offer any other details.",
      "Vice President JD Vance praised the \"brave special operators who pulled off a truly impressive operation.\"",
      "\"Maduro is the newest person to find out that President Trump means what he says,\" Vance said. The vice president highlighted Maduro's previous indictments as justification for the operation.",
      "\"You don't get to avoid justice for drug trafficking the United States because you live in a palace in Caracas,\" he said.",
      "U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, released a statement calling Maduro's capture \"an important first step to bring him to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States.\" He said he spoke to Rubio on Saturday morning and was looking forward to further briefings when the Senate returns next week.",
      "House Intelligence Chair Rick Crawford, a Republican from Arkansas, drew comparisons to the arrest of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega in 1990.",
      "\"It's a great day for Venezuela,\" Crawford told CBS News in an interview.",
      "\"We have a president in office here now that's not playing around,\" he said. \"What we need to understand is if we're going to have a safe America, that requires a safe neighborhood.\"",
      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, criticized the operation. Greene is set to leave Congress on Monday after announcing her surprise resignation in November amid a major falling out with Mr. Trump. In a lengthy post on X, she said the move contradicts Mr. Trump's anti-intervention stance and suggested the operation had more to do with regime change than stopping drug trafficking. She asked why the Trump administration had not done more to target Mexican cartels, and questioned the controversial pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who had been sentenced to 45 years in prison for trafficking cocaine into the U.S.",
      "\"Americans disgust with our own government's never ending military aggression and support of foreign wars is justified because we are forced to pay for it and both parties, Republicans and Democrats, always keep the Washington military machine funded and going,\" Greene wrote. \"This is what many in MAGA thought they voted to end. Boy were we wrong.\"",
      "Democrats react",
      "Democrat lawmakers criticized the Trump administration for acting unilaterally.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, said Maduro is a \"criminal and authoritarian dictator who has oppressed the people of Venezuela for years,\" but that Mr. Trump \"has the constitutional responsibility to follow the law and protect democratic norms in the United States.\"",
      "\"The promotion of security and stability in a region requires more than just military force as we painfully discovered in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" Jeffries said. \"Far too many questions remain unanswered,\" he added, including whether American troops remain on the ground in Venezuela and details of Mr. Trump's claim that the U.S. will run the Latin American country until a judicious transition occurs.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, also from New York, echoed Jeffries' sentiment by calling Maduro \"an illegitimate dictator\" but saying that \"launching military action without congressional authorization and without a credible plan for what comes next is reckless.\"",
      "\"The idea that Trump plans to now run Venezuela should strike fear in the hearts of all Americans. The American people have seen this before and paid the devastating price,\" Schumer wrote.\u00a0 \"The administration must brief Congress immediately on its objectives, and its plan to prevent a humanitarian and geopolitical disaster that plunges us into another endless war or one that trades one corrupt dictator for another.\"",
      "Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, told CBS News 24/7 that \"there's no evidence whatsoever this makes America safer.\"",
      "\"This doesn't seem to have much to do with drugs,\" Smith said, and to him, \"it seems what this is about is Trump wants Venezuela's oil.\"",
      "What also concerns him is what happens next, asking: \"Is his plan to invade?\"",
      "The U.S. has done that before in places like Iraq and Libya, he said, and each time, \"it always ends badly.\"",
      "\"The notion that the U.S. military can reach in and fix that problem with the use of force? This is what Trump ran against,\" Smith said.",
      "Rubio had only recently assured Congress that intervention in Venezuela wasn't about regime change, Smith said.",
      "\"And obviously it's clear that was the goal,\" he said.",
      "House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Ranking Member Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut, called on the administration to \"immediately brief Congress on its plan to ensure stability in the region and its legal justification for this decision.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the operation an \"unauthorized military attack\" and a \"sickening return to a day when the United States asserted the right to dominate the internal political affairs of all nations in the Western Hemisphere.\"",
      "\"That history is replete with failures, and doubling down on it makes it difficult to make the claim with a straight face that other countries should respect the United States' sovereignty when we do not do the same,\" Kaine said.",
      "He said that his bipartisan resolution stipulating the U.S. not enter war with Venezuela without a clear Congressional authorization will be up for a vote next week.",
      "\"Where will this go next? Will the President deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama Canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies?\" Kaine said. \"Trump has threatened to do all this and more and sees no need to seek legal authorization from people's elected legislature before putting servicemembers at risk. It is long past time for Congress to reassert its critical constitutional role in matters of war, peace, diplomacy and trade ... We've entered the 250th year of American democracy and cannot allow it to devolve into the tyranny that our founders fought to escape.\"",
      "Sen. Andy Kim, a Democrat from New Jersey, said that Mr. Trump \"rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.\" Kim also accused Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth of lying to Congress when they met with leaders last month about fatal strikes on alleged drug vessels and said the Trump administration's goal was not regime change.",

    "story": [
      "Swiss authorities have opened a criminal investigation into the managers of the bar where a fire at a New Year's Eve party left 40 people dead and more than 100 injured, authorities said Saturday.",
      "The two are suspected of involuntary homicide, involuntary bodily harm and involuntarily causing a fire, the Valais region's chief prosecutor, Beatrice Pilloud, told reporters. She said the investigation was opened on Friday night and that it would help \"explore all the leads.\" The announcement of the investigation did not name the managers.",
      "Investigators said Friday that the deadly fire was caused by sparklers on Champagne bottles, which ignited the ceiling of the crowded bar around 1:30 a.m. Authorities planned to look into whether sound-dampening material on the ceiling conformed with regulations and whether the candles were permitted for use in the bar.",
      "Officials said they also would look at other safety measures on the premises, including fire extinguishers and escape routes. Videos shared on social media showed people screaming as dozens raced to escape through narrow exits. Parisian tourist Axel Clavier, 16, told the Associated Press on Thursday that he forced a window open with a table. Another witness told the British\u00a0newspaper The Daily Mail\u00a0that bar patrons used chairs to break windows as the flames swirled.",
      "\"It was a real flame coming out. It was coming out and ... in fact, people were running through these flames,\" he said.",
      "The Valais region's top security official, St\u00e9phane Ganzer, told SRF public radio Saturday that \"such a huge accident with a fire in Switzerland means that something didn't work \u2014 maybe the material, maybe the organization on the spot.\" He added: \"Something didn't work and someone made a mistake, I am sure of that.\"",
      "Nicolas F\u00e9raud, who heads the Crans-Montana municipality, told RTS radio he was \"convinced\" checks on the bar hadn't been lax, the broadcaster reported.",
      "Asked whether the tragedy could have been avoided, Swiss Justice Minister Beat Jans replied that officials could not yet answer and \"we know that the world needs an answer on this question.\"",
      "An \"unbearable\" wait for answers",
      "The process of identifying the dead and injured continued on Saturday, leading to an agonizing wait for relatives. Many of the bar's patrons were in their teens to mid-20s.",
      "The severity of burns has made it difficult to identify the dead and injured, requiring families to supply authorities with DNA samples. In some cases, wallets and any identification documents inside were turned to ash.",
      "On Saturday, regional police said the bodies of four victims \u2014 a boy and a girl, both 16, an 18-year-old man and a 21-year-old woman, all of them Swiss \u2014 had been identified and handed over to their families.",
      "Several injured people still haven't been identified.",
      "Laetitia Brodard, whose 16-year-old son, Arthur, went to Le Constellation to celebrate the New Year, held out hope that he might be one of them.",
      "\"I'm looking everywhere. The body of my son is somewhere,\" Brodard told reporters Friday evening. \"I want to know where my child is and be by his side. Wherever that may be, be it in the intensive care unit or the morgue.\"",
      "On Saturday, she told French broadcaster BFM TV that \"we, parents, are starting to get tired ... and anger is starting to rise.\"",
      "\"It's a wait that destroys people's stability,\" said Elvira Venturella, an Italian psychologist working with the families. \"And the more time passes, the more difficult it becomes to accept the uncertainty, not having information.\"",
      "Swiss officials said Friday that 119 people were injured and 113 had been formally identified.",
      "On Saturday, Italy's ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, told reporters he had just been briefed by local authorities that the number of injured stood at 121, with five not yet identified. He said 14 Italians were being treated in hospitals. Swiss police have said the injured included more than 70 Swiss nationals and over 10 each from France and Italy, along with citizens of Serbia, Bosnia, Luxembourg, Belgium, Portugal and Poland.",
      "Cornado acknowledged \"a lot of stress,\" but said it was right for authorities to share information only when it is \"accurate and 100% sure.\"",
      "Ganzer, visiting the site along with Jans, called the families' wait \"unbearable,\" and said officials' top priority was providing them the \"legitimate answers they are waiting for.\"",
      "Mourners and well-wishers bearing flowers flowed to makeshift memorials outside Le Constellation, some consoling one another with hugs as they shed tears. \"RIP you are all our children\" one handwritten note said.",

      "A one-time U.S. ally and CIA informant, Manuel Noriega led Panama for much of the 1980s.",
      "He was raised in the slums of Panama City and rose to prominence under Gen. Omar Torrijos, who seized power in a 1968 coup. After Torrijos was killed in a 1983 plane crash, Noriega took control of the Panamanian government. He was propped up by U.S. officials, who paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars to fight drug trafficking.",
      "Noriega spent years on the CIA's payroll, assisting U.S. interests throughout Latin America and acting as a liaison to Cuba's Fidel Castro. Former U.S. officials testified that Noriega's assistance was crucial to advancing foreign policy interests in South America during that time.",
      "Noriega fell out of favor with Washington due to his demands for independence and allegations that he was accepting bribes to allow drugs into the U.S. in the late 1980s. Former President George H.W. Bush ordered the U.S. military to invade Panama in late 1989, sending 24,000 troops to topple Noriega's government. The operation left 23 American soldiers dead and hundreds more injured.",
      "Noriega hid out in the Vatican embassy before surrendering to U.S. authorities on January 3, 1990. He was taken to the U.S. to face drug trafficking charges. His fall led to the end of Panama's military dictatorship.",
      "Noriega was convicted on drug trafficking charges and spent 20 years in an American prison. He was\u00a0extradited to France\u00a0in 2010 to serve a seven-year money laundering sentence. In 2011, he was\u00a0sent to Panama\u00a0to complete a 60-year sentence for murder, corruption and embezzlement during the military's three-decade rule.",
      "In 2015, Noriega gave his first interview in nearly 20 years from his Panamanian prison. He called himself \"the last general of the military era\" and apologized to those \"offended, affected, injured or humiliated\" by his own actions or those of his superiors and subordinates during the military regime.",
      "Noriega died after complications from a surgery to remove a benign brain tumor in 2017. He was 83. Juan Carlos Varela, Panama's president at the time, said that his death \"closes a chapter in our history.\"",
      "House Intelligence Chair Rep. Rick Crawford commented on the connection between Noriega's capture and the operation in Venezuela in a statement shared on social media.",
      "\"This is a historic day in the Western Hemisphere, 36 years after the capture of Manuel Noriega, when the U.S showed we will not allow cartels to take over countries in our shared neighborhood. The arrest of Cartel De Los Soles leader Nicolas Maduro shows this clearly,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Crawford, a Republican from Arkansas. \"Venezuela could never start the road back to the great nation it once was until Maduro was out of the way.

      "Diane Crump, who in 1969 became the first woman to ride professionally in a horse race and a year later became the first female jockey in the Kentucky Derby, has died. She was 77.",
      "Crump was diagnosed in October with an aggressive form of brain cancer and died Thursday night in hospice care in Winchester, Virginia, her daughter, Della Payne, told The Associated Press.",
      "Crump went on to\u00a0win 228 races\u00a0before riding her last race in 1998, a month shy of her 50th birthday and nearly 30 years after her trailblazing ride at Hialeah Park in Florida on Feb. 7, 1969.",
      "Crump was among several women to fight successfully at the time to be granted a jockey license, but they still needed a trainer willing to put them in a race and then for the race to run. Others were thwarted when male jockeys boycotted or threatened to boycott if a woman was riding.",
      "Photographs of Crump's walk to the saddling area at Hialeah show her protected by security guards as a crowd pressed in on all sides. Six of the original 12 jockeys in the race had refused to ride, Mark Shrager wrote in his biography, \"Diane Crump: A Horse Racing Pioneer's Life in the Saddle.\" Among them were future legends Angel Cordero Jr., Jorge Velasquez and Ron Turcotte, who four years later would ride Secretariat to win the Triple Crown.",
      "But other jockeys stepped up, and as the 12 horses made their way onto the track, the bugler skipped the traditional call to the post and instead played \"Smile for Me, My Diane.\" Crump, on a 50-1 longshot called Bridle 'n Bit, finished 10th, but the barrier had been broken. A month later, Bridle 'n Bit gave Crump her first victory at Gulfstream Park.",
      "She again made history in 1970 by becoming the first woman to ride in the Kentucky Derby. She won the first race that day at Churchill Downs, but again her mount for the history-making race was outclassed. She finished 15th out of 17 on Fathom.",
      "It would be 14 more years before another female jockey would ride in the Derby, with only four more to follow in the decades since.",
      "The racetrack president at Churchill Downs, Mike Anderson, said in a statement on Friday that Crump \"will be forever respected and fondly remembered in horse racing lore.\"",
      "He noted that Crump, who had been riding since age 5 and galloping young Thoroughbreds since she was a teenager, \"was an iconic trailblazer who admirably fulfilled her childhood dreams.\"",
      "Chris Goodlett, of the Kentucky Derby Museum, said \"Diane Crump's name stands for courage, grit, and progress.\" He added: \"Her determination in the face of overwhelming odds opened doors for generations of female jockeys and inspired countless others far beyond racing.\"",
      "After retiring from racing, Crump settled in Virginia and started a business helping people buy and sell horses.",
      "In later years, she took her therapy dogs, all Dachshunds, to visit patients in hospitals and other medical clinics. Some with chronic illnesses she visited regularly for years.",
      "Payne said when her mother went into assisted living a month ago, she was already \"quasi-famous\" in the medical center because of how much time she had spent there, and a \"steady stream\" of doctors and nurses came to see her. One of the last people to visit her was the man who mowed her lawn.",
      "Her daughter said Crump would never take \"no\" for an answer, whether it was becoming a jockey or helping someone in need.",
      "\"I wouldn't say she was as competitive as she was stubborn,\" Payne said. \"If someone was counting on her, she could never let someone down.\"",
      "Late in life, Crump's mottos were literally tattooed on her forearms: \"Kindness\" on the left, \"Compassion\" on the right.",

      "In a post on Friday responding to one person on Musk-owned social media site X, Grok stated it was \"urgently fixing\" the holes in its system. Grok also included a link to CyberTipline, a website where people can report child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced,\" Grok said in a separate\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Thursday. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.\"",
      "In another social media post, a user posted side-by-side photos of herself wearing a dress and another that appears to be a digitally altered version of the same photo of her in a bikini. \"How is this not illegal?\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",

      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",
      "Federal law bars the production and distribution of \"child sexual abuse material,\" or CSAM, a broader phrase for child pornography, according to the Justice Department.",
      "\"xAI saying that these cases where minors' images were manipulated to create sexualized content are 'isolated' is minimizing the impact and ignoring the fact that nothing on the internet is isolated,\" Stefan Turkheimer, vice president of public policy at RAINN, a nonprofit anti-sexual violence group, told CBS News. \"I talk with survivors of tech-enabled sexual abuse every day, and what every one of them will tell you is that it feels like it will never end. Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",
      "\"As generative AI tools become more powerful and more accessible, the Grok situation highlights how increasingly common AI safety failures are becoming.

      "Here are some of the most notable works that are now available for free use by anyone:",

      "How the public domain works",
      "When a work's copyright protections lapse, it lands in the public domain, allowing anyone to use and build upon it as they see fit for free and without needing permission.",
      "\"Copyright gives rights to creators and their descendants that provide incentives to create,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024. \"But the public domain really is the soil for future creativity.\"",
      "The U.S. Constitution's intellectual property clause establishes that works be protected for a limited amount of time, \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\" The Founding Fathers left it to Congress to sort out the specifics.",
      "Generally, in the U.S., works published or registered before 1978 retain copyright protections for 95 years. For later works, protection usually spans the creator's lifetime and 70 years after.",
      "\"If copyright lasted forever, it would be very difficult for a lot of creators to make the works they want to make without worrying about being in the crosshairs of a copyright lawsuit,\" Jenkins said.",
      "Just because a work's copyright has expired does not mean that members of the public cannot be held legally liable in some instances. For example, while the original Betty Boop from 1930 is in the public domain, the modern version is not. So to avoid infringement, any reuse would need to steer clear of her newer characteristics. Additionally, the character is subject to multiple trademarks, which further complicates its use.",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2027?",
      "Copyrighted works from 1931 will see their protections expire in 2027. This includes Universal Pictures' \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dracula\" films, Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights,\" Fritz Lang's \"M,\" Herman Hupfeld's jazz standard \"As Time Goes By\" and more.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/greg-abel-berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-successor/",
    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:04:08 -0500",
    "summary": "Abel, 63, takes the helm of Berkshire Hathaway after a six-decade run by Buffett.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett officially stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on Thursday, handing the reins of the multinational conglomerate to his hand-picked successor, Greg Abel.",
      "Abel, 63, is taking the helm of Berkshire after Buffett, 95, spent six decades transforming a struggling textile manufacturer into one of the world's most successful companies. As the new CEO, Abel will be tasked with upholding Berkshire's decentralized model \u2014 one of the company's hallmarks \u2014 while guiding it into a new era of growth.",
      "In recent years, that growth has slowed as the company has ballooned in size, making it harder to find large, meaningful acquisition targets.",
      "Buffett tapped Abel as his successor in May, saying at the time that he planned to step down as CEO. The move surprised many investors, as it was widely assumed Abel would not take over until after Buffett's death. While Buffett will no longer run the company, he will remain chairman and continue coming into the office five days a week, giving Abel regular access to his longtime mentor.",
      "Here's what to know about Abel, the new leader of Berkshire Hathaway, and how his leadership approach could differ from Buffett's.",
      "Who is Greg Abel?",
      "Abel, a former amateur hockey player and avid golfer, joined Berkshire in 2000 after serving as CEO of MidAmerican, an Iowa-based utility company. Once at Berkshire, he helped transform the recently acquired MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the largest producer of wind energy in the country.",
      "Before taking on his new role as CEO, the Canadian executive oversaw Berkshire's non-insurance companies and served as vice chairman of Berkshire's board of directors.",
      "What has Buffett said about Abel?",
      "Buffett has repeatedly expressed confidence in Abel's ability to lead Berkshire's operations, most recently during a CNBC interview, which partially aired on Friday.",
      "Buffet said Abel will be the \"decider,\" adding that he \"can't imagine how much more [Abel] can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month.\"",
      "\"I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"",
      "Buffett also reiterated his belief in Abel's leadership during the final letter he penned to shareholders in November 2025.",
      "\"Greg Abel has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire's next CEO,\" he wrote. \"He understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don't even consider.\"",
      "What sort of changes might Abel make?",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it would be natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "The new CEO has already announced some leadership changes, including the appointment of NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses.",
      "He will also eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. Historically, Berkshire has favored reinvesting profits over making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "While Abel is viewed as more hands-on than Buffett, experts say he's not expected to initiate any major shake-ups at the decades-old company. He's exhibited a commitment to Berkshire's decentralized structure, which gives acquired companies a large degree of autonomy to run their operations.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 20:00:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Starting January 1, food-stamp recipients in five U.S. states will face restrictions on using the benefits to buy some sugary foods.",
    "story": [
      "Starting New Year's Day, some food-stamp recipients around the U.S. will be banned from using the government nutrition assistance to buy candy, soda and other foods.",
      "Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia are the first of at least 18 states to enact waivers prohibiting people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from purchasing certain foods. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins have urged states to strip foods regarded as unhealthy from the $100 billion federal program.",
      "\"We cannot continue a system that forces taxpayers to fund programs that make people sick and then pay a second time to treat the illnesses those very programs help create,\" Kennedy said in a statement in December.",
      "The efforts are aimed at reducing chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes associated with sweetened drinks and other treats, a key goal of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again effort.",
      "Confusion for SNAP recipients?",
      "But retail industry and health policy experts said state SNAP programs, already under pressure from steep budget cuts, are unprepared for the complex changes, with no complete lists of the foods affected and technical point-of-sale challenges that vary by state and store. And research remains mixed about whether restricting SNAP purchases improves diet quality and health.",
      "The National Retail Federation, a trade association, predicted longer checkout lines and more customer complaints as SNAP recipients learn which foods are affected by the new waivers.",
      "\"It's a disaster waiting to happen of people trying to buy food and being rejected,\" said Kate Bauer, a nutrition science expert at the University of Michigan.",
      "The new restrictions are the latest source of concern for SNAP recipients. Food aid distributed under the program, which is used by 42 million Americans, was interrupted during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. Reliance on food stamps typically surges during economic downturns, such as the sharp slump that followed the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "Nearly 62% of SNAP participants are in families with children, while roughly 37% are in households with older adults or people with disabilities,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit\u00a040-year highs\u00a0following the pandemic.",
      "Retailers fear impact",
      "A report by the National Grocers Association and other industry trade groups estimated that implementing SNAP restrictions would cost U.S. retailers $1.6 billion initially and $759 million each year going forward.",
      "\"Punishing SNAP recipients means we all get to pay more at the grocery store,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director for the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center.",
      "The waivers are a departure from decades of federal policy first enacted in 1964 and later authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which said SNAP benefits can be used for \"any food or food product intended for human consumption,\" except alcohol and ready-to-eat hot foods. The law also says SNAP can't pay for tobacco.",
      "In the past, lawmakers have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for expensive meats like steak or so-called junk foods, such as chips and ice cream.",
      "But previous waiver requests were denied based on USDA research concluding that restrictions would be costly and complicated to implement, and that they might not change recipients' buying habits or reduce health problems such as obesity.",
      "Under the second Trump administration, however, states have been encouraged and even incentivized to seek waivers \u2013 and they responded.",
      "\"This isn't the usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda,\" Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said when he announced his state's request last spring. \"We're focused on root causes, transparent information and real results.\"",
      "How many people are affected",
      "The five state waivers that take effect Jan. 1 affect about 1.4 million people. Utah and West Virginia will ban the use of SNAP to buy soda and soft drinks, while Nebraska will prohibit soda and energy drinks. Indiana will target soft drinks and candy. In Iowa, which has the most restrictive rules to date, the SNAP limits affect taxable foods, including soda and candy, but also certain prepared foods.",
      "\"The items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store,\" Plata-Nino wrote in a blog post. \"Many additional items \u2014 including certain prepared foods \u2014 will also be disallowed, even though they are not clearly identified in the notice to households.\"",
      "Marc Craig, 47, of Des Moines, said he has been living in his car since October. He said the new waivers will make it more difficult to determine how to use the $298 in SNAP benefits he receives each month, while also increasing the stigma he feels at the cash register.",
      "\"They treat people that get food stamps like we're not people,\" Craig said.",
      "SNAP waivers enacted now and in the coming months will run for two years, with the option to extend them for an additional three, according to the Agriculture Department. Each state is required to assess the impact of the changes.",
      "Health experts worry that the waivers ignore larger factors affecting the health of SNAP recipients, said Anand Parekh, a medical doctor who is the chief health policy officer at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\"This doesn't solve the two fundamental problems, which is healthy food in this country is not affordable and unhealthy food is cheap and ubiquitous,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:32:26 -0500",
    "summary": "From stubbornly high living costs to a softer labor market, economists say these are the forces that will shape the year ahead.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy navigated 2025 with a resilience that surprised many experts, as growth accelerated and inflation remained relatively muted despite the Trump administration's steep tariffs on imports.",
      "Although Americans say they aren't yet feeling the benefits of an expanding economy amid ongoing concerns about the cost of living, many economists expect the U.S. to be on firmer footing next year.",
      "\"I think it'll be a better year,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Michael Pearce told CBS News. \"Tax cuts will be center stage, and we'll see a broadening out of economic strength.\"",
      "Here are what experts see as the key economic questions facing the U.S. in 2026.",
      "Will affordability improve?",
      "Probably not \u2014 at least not in a way most Americans will feel right away. Inflation has cooled since peaking at a 40-year high in 2022, but prices remain elevated, squeezing many households and making it harder to cover basic expenses. About 7 in 10 Americans polled by CBS News in December said they were struggling to pay for food, housing and health care, underscoring the affordability issues affecting millions of households.",
      "Rising utility costs are another challenge. Americans now pay an average of $265 per month in utilities, up 12% since last year, according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the average household is expected to pay an average of $995 on home heating this winter, a 9.2% increase from last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association.",
      "More broadly, inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target, with the Consumer Price Index in November at 2.7%. For consumers, that means prices for everyday goods and services are still climbing, continuing to strain household budgets.",
      "Inflation should cool to about 2.4% in 2026, according to a December forecast from the Federal Reserve. But that would still leave inflation above the central bank's goal, signaling that \"higher inflation will continue to weigh on family finances\" next year, William Blair economist Richard de Chazal said in a report.",
      "About one-third of Americans think their finances are likely to worsen in the year ahead, primarily driven by inflation concerns, a recent Bankrate\u00a0survey\u00a0found.",
      "Wages will need to outpace inflation for a sustained period before households feel they are getting ahead, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a Dec. 10 press conference.",
      "\"We're going to need to have some years where \u2026 nominal wages are higher than inflation for people to start feeling good about affordability,\" he noted.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve continue to cut interest rates?",
      "Another big question is whether the Federal Reserve will continue cutting its benchmark interest rate after three consecutive reductions that began in September.",
      "Although the Fed has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low, the central bank is currently being pulled in two directions. Prices are rising faster than the Fed would like, which could call for higher interest rates if the trend persists or inflation re-ignites in 2026. At the same time, rising unemployment and cooler hiring might require policymakers to further lower rates in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy, in December penciled in only\u00a0one additional rate cut for 2026. Yet some economists believe the Fed could make additional cuts, especially if the labor market continues to slow.",
      "President Trump has argued that the Fed should drastically cut its benchmark rate, pressing Fed Chair Jerome Powell to reduce borrowing costs. With Powell's term set to expire in May, Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new chair who is more open to cutting rates.",
      "Will housing become more affordable in 2026?",
      "Homes across the U.S. could be modestly more affordable in 2026, Chen Zhao, head of economics research at real estate company Redfin, told CBS News.",
      "Mortgage rates are likely to remain in the low 6% range, not far off from today's 30-year mortgage rate of about 6.18%, while home\u00a0prices are likely to grow at a slower pace than incomes next year.",
      "\"We're starting to head on a road that leads to better affordability metrics, but it's not going to be an overnight shift,\" she said. \"2026 might not feel all that different than the end of 2025 \u2014 it's a slow process that might take five or six years, but at least we're heading in the right direction.\"",
      "Home prices are projected to dip in about two dozen major U.S. cities in 2026, mostly located in the Southeast and the West, according to a Realtor.com analysis.",
      "Will the job market pick up steam?",
      "Hiring could improve in 2026 as economic growth accelerates and the effects of tariffs fade, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Average payroll gains could rise to an average of 70,000 per month next year, more than double the 32,000 per month average in 2025, economists with the investment bank forecast in a report. They expect wages to climb 2.3% in 2026, accelerating from 1.9% this year.",
      "However, some economists warn that the job market could remain relatively muted as companies turn to artificial intelligence to improve productivity.",
      "Are stocks in a bubble?",
      "A critical question for financial markets this year \u2014 are companies involved in AI overvalued \u2014 is likely to again take center stage in 2026.",
      "The S&P 500 is on track to end the year with a gain of more than 17%, with the index buoyed by artificial intelligence companies and big tech companies. However, some investors are growing cautious about the meteoric rise of AI-related stocks, questioning whether a bubble is forming.",
      "Such bubbles \u2014 when stock valuations run far ahead of underlying fundamentals \u2014 can set the stage for sharp market corrections if investor sentiment sours. Yet stock valuations remain below the levels seen during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics. He expects investment in AI to continue next year as more companies adopt the technology.",
      "Still, although AI stocks are unlikely to crash next year, investors' lofty expectations may be in for a reality check",
      "\"At some point, investors are likely to be disappointed, and the cycle of ever rising investment, expectations and valuations will end, as proved the case with previous equity bubbles,\" Goltermann said in a report.",
      "Overall, forecasters expect a strong stock market performance in 2026. J.P. Morgan in November forecast the S&P 500 will rise 13% to 15% next year, roughly in line with the index's average gain over the last decade.",

    "story": [
      "New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows flu cases continuing to spike around the country, with some areas seeing record cases of the illness.",
      "The CDC estimated there have been at least 7.5 million flu cases this season as of Dec. 20, as well as at least 81,000 hospitalizations and 3,100 deaths. There have been eight flu-related pediatric deaths, the CDC said.",
      "The CDC\u00a0says\u00a032 jurisdictions are showing \"high\" or \"very high\" levels of flu. Last week, just 17 jurisdictions were in those categories. Jurisdictions include all 50 states and some territories, as well as the District of Columbia and New York City.",
      "The New York State Department of Health said\u00a0that it had seen about 71,000 cases for the week that ended Dec. 20 \u2014 the most ever recorded in one week since the department began tracking the illness in 2004. There were over 3,600 flu hospitalizations recorded in the state during the week.",
      "The Massachusetts Department of Public Health also recorded \"high\" flu activity. Boston announced a 114% increase in recent flu cases, with children seeing the biggest increase in cases. Meanwhile, a spike in cases prompted a Minnesota school to shift to online learning before Christmas. CBS News Minnesota reported that the state had seen 113 flu-related hospitalizations in 2025, more than double the number recorded last year.",
      "Experts have expressed concern about this year's flu season. A new subtype of influenza A called H3N2 is spreading quickly. The CDC reported that of 2,086 specimens that tested positive for flu between Dec. 13 and Dec. 20, 2,029 of them had influenza A. When 1,627 of those specimens were subtyped, 1,493, or nearly 92%, were found to be H3N2.",
      "Jesse Bloom, a scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center who studies viral evolution, told CBS News that the virus has changed just enough to make it harder for people's immune systems to recognize the illness. The strain is known for causing tougher flu seasons, especially for seniors.",
      "Fewer people have also gotten\u00a0flu shots\u00a0this year. About 130 million doses of the flu vaccine have been administered nationwide, the CDC said.",
      "Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, said that while experts are expecting a \"H3N2 mismatch,\" the vaccine's \"match to H1N1 and flu B is expected to be good.\" Meanwhile, early season data from the United Kingdom suggests that the vaccines are still helping prevent severe illness, especially in children.",
      "\"Getting the vaccine is something that people, particularly those who are in high-risk groups, can do,\" Bloom said. \"It's not going to eliminate their chance of getting infected, but it does mitigate their risk.\"",

    "story": [
      "OpenAI is seeking a new \"head of preparedness\" to guide the company's safety strategy amid mounting concerns over how artificial intelligence tools could be misused.",
      "According to the job posting, the new hire will be paid $555,000 to lead the company's safety systems team, which OpenAI says is focused on ensuring AI models are \"responsibly developed and deployed.\" The head of preparedness will also be tasked with tracking risks and developing mitigation strategies for what OpenAI calls \"frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm.\"",
      "\"This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,\" CEO Sam Altman wrote in an\u00a0X\u00a0post describing the position over the weekend.",
      "He added, \"This is a critical role at an important time; models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges.\"",
      "Reached for comment, an OpenAI spokesperson referred CBS News to Altman's post on X.",
      "The company's investment in safety efforts comes as scrutiny intensifies over artificial intelligence's influence on mental health, following multiple\u00a0allegations\u00a0that OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT, was involved in interactions preceding a number of suicides.",
      "In one case earlier this year\u00a0covered by CBS News, the parents of a 16-year-old sued the company, alleging that ChatGPT encouraged their son to plan his own suicide. That prompted OpenAI to announce new safety protocols for users under 18.",
      "ChatGPT also allegedly fueled what a lawsuit filed earlier this month described as the \"paranoid delusions\" of a 56-year-old man who murdered his mother and then killed himself. At the time, OpenAI said it was working on improving its technology to help ChatGPT recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations and guide people toward real-world support.",
      "Beyond mental health concerns, worries have also increased over how artificial intelligence could be used to carry out cybersecurity attacks. Samantha Vinograd, a CBS News contributor and former top Homeland Security official in the Obama administration, addressed the issue on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "\"AI doesn't just level the playing field for certain actors,\" she said. \"It actually brings new players onto the pitch, because individuals, non-state actors, have access to relatively low-cost technology that makes different kinds of threats more credible and more effective.\"",
      "Altman acknowledged the growing safety hazards AI poses in his X post, writing that while the models and their capabilities have advanced quickly, challenges have also started to arise.",
      "\"The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025; we are just now seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities,\" he wrote.",
      "Now, he continued, \"We are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides ... in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits.\"",
      "According to the job posting, a qualified applicant would have \"deep technical expertise in machine learning, AI safety, evaluations, security or adjacent risk domains\" and have experience with \"designing or executing high-rigor evaluations for complex technical systems,\" among other qualifications.",

      "Rodriguez alleged in the lawsuit filed last week in California that Perry sexually assaulted him during encounters that occurred between 2014 and 2019. The lawsuit says Rodriguez cut off contact with Perry in 2019, though Perry would periodically reach out afterward. But screenshots of text messages obtained by The Associated Press on Sunday night show Rodriguez making contact with Perry as recently as Thanksgiving 2024 and again on Aug. 31, 2025, expressing gratitude, friendship and financial distress.",
      "Rodriguez's lawsuit seeks at least $77 million in damages and accuses Perry of sexual assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

      "The U.S. government also claimed that Flores is involved in her husband's alleged crimes.

      "President Trump said\u00a0earlier Saturday that \"we're going to run the country\" until there is a \"safe, proper and judicious transition\" of power in Venezuela, but he provided few details about\u00a0what that may look like. Mr. Trump said the U.S. would \"get the oil flowing.\"",
      "Hegseth said that through strategic action, the U.S. can ensure it has access to \"additional wealth and resources, enabling a country to unleash that without having to spend American blood.\"",
      "\"I mean, this was a bold and audacious move, but it was thought through,\" Hegseth said. \"It was well orchestrated. Our military had time to set it up, to provide the resources, and then he took that bold stroke. And through it, we flipped that very dynamic, and Americans will benefit.\"",
      "Hegseth told CBS News that the United States can help both the people of Venezuela and America in the Western Hemisphere by reestablishing the Monroe Doctrine \u2014 which established the tenets of U.S. foreign policy \u2014 with \"peace through strength with our allies.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's announcement Saturday that the United States will \"run\" Venezuela\u00a0after the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife is raising new questions about the extent of U.S. involvement in the South American country.",
      "Mr. Trump did not offer many details about his administration's plans for the U.S. role in Venezuela as he spoke about the overnight mission from his South Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago. The president had announced on social media hours earlier that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were \"captured and flown out of the country.\" Officials told CBS News that the operation was carried out by the U.S. Army's Delta Force, an elite special operations unit.",
      "Maduro and his wife were brought to the U.S. to face criminal charges stemming from what prosecutors have alleged is their participation in a conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and to import \"thousands of tons\" of cocaine to the U.S. Maduro and his wife arrived at Stewart Airport just north of New York City on Saturday afternoon, hours after their capture.",
      "With Maduro's ouster, it's unclear who is in charge in Venezuela or could lead the nation in the future. Mr. Trump said it would be \"very tough\" for Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado to take over because she \"doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country.\"",
      "The president said Secretary of State Marco Rubio also had a conversation with Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who Mr. Trump said has been \"sworn in\" and is \"essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"",
      "But in remarks on state television, Rodriguez said Maduro is the \"only president of Venezuela\" and demanded his release.",
      "Venezuela held its last presidential election in July 2024, but election authorities did not provide detailed vote counts, and the U.S. and many European countries rejected Maduro's claim of victory. The U.S. under the Biden administration recognized opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the president-elect. Gonz\u00e1lez fled into exile in Spain in September 2024 after a warrant was issued for his arrest.",
      "Trump says U.S. will \"run it properly,\" but provides few details",
      "Mr. Trump said the U.S. is \"going to run the country\" until there is a \"safe, proper and judicious transition\" in power in Venezuela.",
      "\"We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind. We've had decades of that. We're not going to let that happen,\" the president said. \"We're there now. And what people don't understand, but they understand as I say this, we're there now, but we're going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place.\"",
      "He did not provide any additional details about how the U.S. would oversee Venezuela, under what authority, or whether the U.S. would play a role in picking a new leader.",
      "Mr. Trump did indicate that top administration officials \u2014 including Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who appeared alongside Mr. Trump on Saturday \u2014 would work with a \"team\" working with the Venezuelan people. He did not, however, say who would be included in that group.",
      "In an interview Saturday evening, \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth what that may look like.",
      "\"It means we set the terms. President Trump sets the terms. And ultimately, he'll decide what the iterations are of that,\" Hegseth said. \"But, it means the drugs stop flowing, it means the oil that was taken from us is returned, ultimately, and that criminals are not sent to the United States.\"",
      "Role of the oil industry",
      "When asked about a timeframe for U.S. involvement, Mr. Trump said Venezuela's \"whole infrastructure\" has to be rebuilt. He focused in particular on the prospect of rebuilding the oil industry in a nation with one of the world's largest petroleum reserves.",
      "\"If we just left, it [Venezuela] has zero chance of ever coming back,\" he said. \"We'll run it properly. We'll run it professionally. We'll have the greatest oil companies in the world going in and invest billions and billions of dollars and take out money, use that money in Venezuela, and the biggest beneficiary is going to be the people of Venezuela.\"",
      "When asked about the\u00a0blockade of sanctioned oil\u00a0from Venezuela imposed by Mr. Trump last month, Hegseth said no oil is going in or out of the country, and the U.S. military is still poised in the Caribbean.",
      "\"[Mr. Trump] said it clearly at the podium today. We are going to get American companies in there. We are going to get investment in there. These oil depots have been operating at 20% capacity. That's going to change,\" Hegseth told CBS News.",
      "Maduro regime figures remain in place",
      "While the Trump administration has removed Maduro, top members of his government remain in place. Among them are Rodr\u00edguez, who Maduro selected as his vice president, as well as Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello.",
      "Cabello is named as a defendant alongside Maduro and his wife in the superseding indictment returned by a federal grand jury in New York as allegedly part of the narco-terrorism conspiracy.",
      "Seemingly in a warning to Venezuelan officials who remain in place, Mr. Trump said the U.S. is \"ready to stage a second and much larger attack\" in Venezuela if needed, and that his administration is \"not afraid of boots on the ground.\"",

      "As the helicopters approached shore, they were protected by other aircraft, including drones, bombers and fighter jets. The U.S. dismantled and disabled Venezuela's air defense systems as the helicopters neared Caracas, according to Caine, who also said they deployed weapons \"to ensure the safe passage of the helicopters into the target area.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the lights in Caracas had largely gone dark \"due to a certain experience that we have.\"",
      "\"As the force crossed the last point of high terrain where they'd been hiding in the clutter, we assessed that we had maintained totally the element of surprise,\" Caine said.",
      "Once at the compound, the helicopters came under fire but remained operable, Caine said.",
      "\"It was a lot of gunfire,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "U.S. forces and the FBI eventually entered the compound, where Maduro and his wife \"gave up\" and were taken into custody, Caine said.",
      "Mr. Trump said that Maduro tried to escape during his capture.",
      "\"He was trying to get into a safe place,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"The safe place is all steel, and he wasn't able to make it to the door because our guys were so fast.\"",
      "\"It was a very thick door, a very heavy door,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He made it to the door. He was unable to close it.\"",
      "But even if Maduro had made it to the safe room, Mr. Trump said the military forces could have blown up the door in about \"47 seconds.\"",
      "After Maduro and his wife were apprehended, the helicopters swooped back in to exfiltrate them. Fighter aircraft and drones also provided protection during their journey out of the country. Caine said there were \"multiple self-defense engagements\" during the withdrawal.",
      "\"The force successfully exfiltrated and returned to their afloat launch bases, and the force was over the water at 3:29 a.m. Eastern Standard Time with indicted persons onboard,\" Caine said.",
      "One of the U.S. helicopters was hit and some U.S. soldiers were injured in the raid.",
      "Mr. Trump watched the mission unfold at his home in Mar-a-Lago as soldiers of the Army's elite Delta Force dropped in and breached Maduro's compound shortly after 2 a.m.",
      "The U.S. began planning the operation months ago, with U.S. intelligence agencies working to \"find Maduro and understand how he moved, where he lived, where he traveled, what he ate, what he wore, what were his pets,\" Caine said.",
      "The operation had been ready to go since early December, but the U.S. was waiting for the right time to minimize civilian harm and maximize the surprise, Caine said, adding that it was also weather-dependent.",
      "\"Last night, the weather broke just enough, clearing a path that only the most skilled aviators in the world could maneuver through \u2014 ocean, mountain, low clouds, ceilings,\" Caine said.",

    "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 18:53:54 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said \"we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be\" after the surprise U.S. attack. Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil sector.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. strike on Venezuela\u00a0has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",
      "Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.",
      "How much oil does Venezuela produce?",
      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 billion barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near\u00a0term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

    "story": [
      "Hours after Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was captured by U.S. forces, the country's vice president and other top regime figures condemned the military operation in stark terms and suggested they plan to push back on U.S. involvement in the country, posing a potential challenge to President Trump's suggestion that the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela.",
      "Maduro was flown out of the country in a \"large scale strike\" by U.S. forces, Mr. Trump said early Saturday. He is expected to be tried on drug trafficking charges, effectively ending a nearly 13-year reign that began after the death of President Hugo Chavez. The operation followed months of U.S. military, economic and diplomatic pressure on the Maduro regime.",
      "Top figures in Maduro's government pushed back against the U.S. operation almost immediately after it began early Saturday morning.",
      "VP Delcy Rodriguez calls Maduro the \"only president of Venezuela\"",
      "Maduro's handpicked\u00a0vice president, Delcy Rodriguez \u2014 whom Mr. Trump said was sworn in as president Saturday \u2014 called Maduro's capture \"barbaric,\" an \"illegal and illegitimate kidnapping\" and an attack on Venezuela's sovereignty in a speech that was broadcast on state TV.",
      "She also called for the \"immediate release\" of Maduro and his wife, calling him \"the only president of Venezuela.\"",
      "Rodriguez's defiant words came as Mr. Trump suggested he's looking to work with the vice president in some form. In a press conference Saturday at Mar-a-Lago, the U.S. president said Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Rodriguez, who indicated that \"she's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called Rodriguez \"quite gracious\" but said \"she really doesn't have a choice.\"",
      "The American leader said the U.S. is planning to \"run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\" It's not clear exactly how the country will be led, or to what extent existing Venezuelan officials or political figures would be involved. Mr. Trump said \"we're designating various people\" and suggested members of his administration will play key roles.",
      "Rodriguez said Saturday that the Venezuelan government is open to \"dialogue,\" pointing to Maduro's statement earlier this week that he's willing to negotiate with the U.S. on drug trafficking. But she did not offer any clear indications that she's looking to work with the U.S. if it takes over, accusing Venezuela's \"enemies\" of seeking to \"enslave us.\"",
      "\"If there is one thing that the Venezuelan people and this country are very clear about, it is that we will never again be slaves, that we will never again be a colony of any empire, of whatever stripe,\" Rodriguez said in her address on state television.",
      "Venezuelan leaders call for military to mobilize against \"aggression\"",
      "Shortly after the U.S. operation began, the Venezuelan government said in a statement that national defense plans had been activated and Maduro ordered a \"State of External Disturbance,\" effectively a state of emergency.",
      "Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez announced that military forces would be deployed across Venezuela on \"Maduro's orders\" \u2014 though he didn't mention Maduro's capture \u2014 and called for resistance against \"the worst aggression\" Venezuela has faced.",
      "\"They've attacked us but they will not subdue us,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello called for \"calm\" in a video translated by Reuters, saying, \"No one should fall into despair, no one should make things easier to our invading enemy.\"",
      "Attorney General Tarek William Saab called the U.S. operation a \"vile and cowardly attack\" in remarks to Venezuelan state media, alleging that some innocent people were \"mortally wounded.\"",
      "Venezuelan diplomats have also requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, sending a letter to the body asking it to condemn the U.S.'s \"aggression.\" Foreign Minister Yvan Gil accused the U.S. of seeking to take Venezuela's natural resources. (On Saturday, Mr. Trump said part of his goal in Venezuela is to \"get the oil flowing\" in the petroleum-rich state.)",
      "Venezuelan opposition leaders say they're ready to take charge, but Trump isn't so sure",
      "Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado celebrated Maduro's ouster, saying in a statement: \"Venezuelans, the time for freedom has come!\"",
      "Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, called for Edmundo Gonzalez to be recognized as Venezuela's legitimate president and to take control of the armed forces. Gonzalez faced off against Maduro in the country's last election in 2024, but the government recognized Maduro as the winner, in a result that was widely criticized by the U.S. and international observers on allegations that Maduro had stolen votes.",
      "\"Today we are ready to assert our mandate and take power. Let us remain vigilant, active, and organized until the democratic transition is complete,\" said Machado.",
      "Gonzalez said on X: \"[W]e are ready for the great operation of the reconstruction of our nation.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump said in his press conference Saturday that it would be \"very tough\" for Machado to help lead the country, saying she didn't have enough support.",
      "\"She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect,\" Mr. Trump told reporters.",

      "\"We're not afraid of boots on the ground,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But we're going to make sure that country is run properly. We're not doing this in vain.\" He added, \"We're going to be running it with a group and we're going to make sure it's run properly.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said running Venezuela \"won't cost us anything\" because the U.S. would be reimbursed in oil money.",
      "\"We're going to be taking a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground,\" he said.",
      "Venezuela has one of the world's largest known oil reserves and was a founding member of OPEC, though its industry has suffered under years of mismanagement, corruption and sanctions. The U.S. Energy Information Administration\u00a0says that despite its vast reserves, Venezuela produced just 0.8% of total global crude oil in 2023.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the oil embargo on Venezuela currently remains in effect, and the American naval armada remains in position. He said the U.S. will retain all military options until all demands are met.",
      "Mr. Trump said the vice president who had been appointed by Maduro has been sworn in, but the U.S. would have a presence in Venezuela.",
      "However, Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, speaking on state media on Saturday, affirmed that Maduro is Venezuela's \"only president\" and demanded his immediate release.",
      "When asked to clarify if this meant the U.S. military would have a presence in Venezuela, Mr. Trump said there would be a military presence \"because of oil.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the overnight operation a \"massive joint military and law enforcement raid that was flawlessly executed.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had said Maduro and his wife were flown out of Venezuela after the U.S. carried out a \"large scale strike.\" Calling into \"Fox and Friends\" on Saturday morning, he said Maduro had been \"in a very highly guarded, like a fortress actually.\"",
      "The president also confirmed that Maduro was being taken to New York, after Attorney General Pam Bondi said earlier in the day that Maduro had been indicted in the Southern District of New York on narco-terrorism charges. Bondi said Maduro and his wife \"will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.\"",
      "\"They'll be heading to New York,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They were indicted in New York.\"",
      "Shortly before addressing reporters at Mar-a-Lago late Saturday morning, Mr. Trump shared a photo he said was of Maduro on board the USS Iowa Jima.",
      "In an indictment filed against the Venezuelan leader in 2020, federal prosecutors alleged that Maduro and other senior Venezuelan government officials collaborated with the Colombian guerrilla group Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or FARC, to traffic cocaine and weapons to the United States. Later Saturday morning, Bondi shared a superseding indictment.",
      "The indictment, prepared by U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, accuses Maduro of conspiracy to commit narcoterrorism and to import cocaine, and of possessing and conspiring to possess \"Machineguns and Destructive Devices.\" The charges appear to be the same as a 2020 indictment of Maduro and several key aides.",
      "Mr. Trump said Maduro was in a house when he was captured, saying it was \"more like a fortress than a house.\"",
      "\"It had steel doors, it had, what they call a safety space where it's, you know, solid steel all around,\" he said. \"He didn't get that space closed. He was trying to get into it but he got bum-rushed so fast that he didn't get into that. We were prepared, we had, you know, massive blow torches and everything else that you need to get through that steel, but we didn't need it. He didn't make it to that area of the house.\"",
      "Mr. Trump praised the operation in Venezuela, saying he thinks no U.S. troops were killed.",
      "\"You know that we had nobody killed was amazing,\" he said. \"I think we had nobody killed, I have to say, because a couple of guys were hit, but they came back and they're supposed to be in pretty good shape.\"",
      "The president said the U.S. was prepared to carry out the Venezuela operation days ago, but waited for the weather conditions to improve.",
      "\"We were going to do this four days ago but the weather was not perfect,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And then all of a sudden it opened up and we said go.\"",

      "Mr. Trump said Maduro and his wife had been flown out of Venezuela and will be taken to New York. The U.S. Army's Delta Force, an elite special forces unit, carried out the operation to capture them, officials told CBS News. The Trump administration notified Congressional leaders about the operation only after it began, Congressional sources told CBS News.",
      "Maduro, 63, has led Venezuela since 2013. His most recent election was disputed by international observers and the U.S.\u00a0recognized\u00a0opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner. The U.S. imposed sanctions against election officials for allegedly rigging the outcome, but Maduro was still\u00a0sworn in\u00a0for a third term in January.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Saturday morning that Maduro and his wife have been indicted in the Southern District of New York on narco-terrorism charges. Maduro was previously indicted in 2020 on allegations that he and other senior Venezuelan government officials collaborated with the Colombian guerrilla group Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or FARC, to traffic cocaine and weapons to the United States.",
      "The Justice Department also accused Maduro of leading a criminal organization called C\u00e1rtel de Los Soles. The Trump administration designated the group as a\u00a0foreign terrorist organization\u00a0last year, though some experts have\u00a0questioned that characterization. The U.S. has been offering a\u00a0$50 million reward for information leading to Maduro's capture.",
      "A\u00a0CBS News poll in November\u00a0found that 70% of Americans would oppose the U.S. taking military action in Venezuela, and 75% said the Trump administration would need Congressional approval. Most surveyed also said they did not see Venezuela as a major threat to the United States.",
      "Republicans react",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said he spoke with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after the operation in Venezuela.",
      "\"Nicolas Maduro is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans after years of trafficking illegal drugs and violent cartel members into our country \u2014 crimes for which he's been properly indicted in U.S. courts and an arrest warrant duly issued \u2014 and today he learned what accountability looks like,\" Johnson said. \"President Trump is putting American lives first, succeeding where others have failed, and under his leadership the United States will no longer allow criminal regimes to profit from wreaking havoc and destruction on our country.\"",
      "Senate Intelligence Chair Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said he spoke with Rubio and that Venezuela's interim government \"must now decide whether to continue the drug trafficking and colluding with adversaries like Iran and Cuba or whether to act like a normal nation and return to the civilized world.\"",
      "\"I urge them to choose wisely,\" he said.",
      "Utah Sen. Mike Lee said that he also spoke with Rubio, who said that Maduro would be brought to the U.S. Lee also said that Rubio \"anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in U.S. custody.\"",
      "Lee added that the operation \"likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,\" but did not offer any other details.",
      "Vice President JD Vance praised the \"brave special operators who pulled off a truly impressive operation.\"",
      "\"Maduro is the newest person to find out that President Trump means what he says,\" Vance said. The vice president highlighted Maduro's previous indictments as justification for the operation.",
      "\"You don't get to avoid justice for drug trafficking the United States because you live in a palace in Caracas,\" he said.",
      "U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, released a statement calling Maduro's capture \"an important first step to bring him to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States.\" He said he spoke to Rubio on Saturday morning and was looking forward to further briefings when the Senate returns next week.",
      "House Intelligence Chair Rick Crawford, a Republican from Arkansas, drew comparisons to the arrest of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega in 1990.",
      "\"It's a great day for Venezuela,\" Crawford told CBS News in an interview.",
      "\"We have a president in office here now that's not playing around,\" he said. \"What we need to understand is if we're going to have a safe America, that requires a safe neighborhood.\"",
      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, criticized the operation. Greene is set to leave Congress on Monday after announcing her surprise resignation in November amid a major falling out with Mr. Trump. In a lengthy post on X, she said the move contradicts Mr. Trump's anti-intervention stance and suggested the operation had more to do with regime change than stopping drug trafficking. She asked why the Trump administration had not done more to target Mexican cartels, and questioned the controversial pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who had been sentenced to 45 years in prison for trafficking cocaine into the U.S.",
      "\"Americans disgust with our own government's never ending military aggression and support of foreign wars is justified because we are forced to pay for it and both parties, Republicans and Democrats, always keep the Washington military machine funded and going,\" Greene wrote. \"This is what many in MAGA thought they voted to end. Boy were we wrong.\"",
      "Democrats react",
      "Democrat lawmakers criticized the Trump administration for acting unilaterally.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, said Maduro is a \"criminal and authoritarian dictator who has oppressed the people of Venezuela for years,\" but that Mr. Trump \"has the constitutional responsibility to follow the law and protect democratic norms in the United States.\"",
      "\"The promotion of security and stability in a region requires more than just military force as we painfully discovered in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" Jeffries said. \"Far too many questions remain unanswered,\" he added, including whether American troops remain on the ground in Venezuela and details of Mr. Trump's claim that the U.S. will run the Latin American country until a judicious transition occurs.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, also from New York, echoed Jeffries' sentiment by calling Maduro \"an illegitimate dictator\" but saying that \"launching military action without congressional authorization and without a credible plan for what comes next is reckless.\"",
      "\"The idea that Trump plans to now run Venezuela should strike fear in the hearts of all Americans. The American people have seen this before and paid the devastating price,\" Schumer wrote.\u00a0 \"The administration must brief Congress immediately on its objectives, and its plan to prevent a humanitarian and geopolitical disaster that plunges us into another endless war or one that trades one corrupt dictator for another.\"",
      "Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, told CBS News 24/7 that \"there's no evidence whatsoever this makes America safer.\"",
      "\"This doesn't seem to have much to do with drugs,\" Smith said, and to him, \"it seems what this is about is Trump wants Venezuela's oil.\"",
      "What also concerns him is what happens next, asking: \"Is his plan to invade?\"",
      "The U.S. has done that before in places like Iraq and Libya, he said, and each time, \"it always ends badly.\"",
      "\"The notion that the U.S. military can reach in and fix that problem with the use of force? This is what Trump ran against,\" Smith said.",
      "Rubio had only recently assured Congress that intervention in Venezuela wasn't about regime change, Smith said.",
      "\"And obviously it's clear that was the goal,\" he said.",
      "House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Ranking Member Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut, called on the administration to \"immediately brief Congress on its plan to ensure stability in the region and its legal justification for this decision.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the operation an \"unauthorized military attack\" and a \"sickening return to a day when the United States asserted the right to dominate the internal political affairs of all nations in the Western Hemisphere.\"",
      "\"That history is replete with failures, and doubling down on it makes it difficult to make the claim with a straight face that other countries should respect the United States' sovereignty when we do not do the same,\" Kaine said.",
      "He said that his bipartisan resolution stipulating the U.S. not enter war with Venezuela without a clear Congressional authorization will be up for a vote next week.",
      "\"Where will this go next? Will the President deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama Canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies?\" Kaine said. \"Trump has threatened to do all this and more and sees no need to seek legal authorization from people's elected legislature before putting servicemembers at risk. It is long past time for Congress to reassert its critical constitutional role in matters of war, peace, diplomacy and trade ... We've entered the 250th year of American democracy and cannot allow it to devolve into the tyranny that our founders fought to escape.\"",
      "Sen. Andy Kim, a Democrat from New Jersey, said that Mr. Trump \"rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.\" Kim also accused Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth of lying to Congress when they met with leaders last month about fatal strikes on alleged drug vessels and said the Trump administration's goal was not regime change.",
      "New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, who took office on Thursday, issued a statement saying \"unilaterally attacking a sovereign nation is an act of war and a violation of federal and international law.\"",
      "\"This blatant pursuit of regime change doesn't just affect those abroad, it directly impacts New Yorkers, including tens of thousands of Venezuelans who call this city home,\" Mamdani said. \"My focus is their safety and the safety of every New Yorker, and my administration will continue to monitor the situation and issue relevant guidance.\"",
      "Florida residents cheer operation",
      "South Florida, which is home to a large population of Venezuelans, saw celebrations early Saturday. People hugged, sang the U.S. and Venezuelan national anthems, and waved flags outside the community gathering spot El Arepazo.",
      "\"President Trump has changed the course of history in our hemisphere. Our country & the world are safer for it,\" said Florida Republican Rep. Carlos A. Gimenez. \"Today's decisive action is this hemisphere's equivalent to the Fall of the Berlin Wall. It's a big day in Florida, where the majority of Venezuelan, Cuban, & Nicaraguan exiles reside. This is the community I represent & we are overwhelmed with emotion and hope.\"",

      "The naturalizations of the Kentucky-born star of the \"Ocean's\" series of heist movies, his wife and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, and their twins Ella and Alexander were announced last weekend in the Journal Officiel, where French government decrees are published.",

It wasn't clear whether the 64-year-old actor retained his American citizenship. His 47-year-old wife was born in Lebanon and raised in the U.K and naturalized by France under her maiden name, Amal Alamuddin. The 8-year-old twins were born in London.",

    "summary": "The first-ever fentanyl overdose prevention vaccine could save thousands of lives annually, with human trials beginning in early 2026 after animal studies.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson has the latest on how a biotech company plans to test its vaccine that could protect people from fentanyl's lethal effects on 'Special Report.'",
      "A vaccine to protect against fentanyl\u2019s deadly effects is headed for clinical trials in humans.",
      "The vaccine, which showed positive results in studies of mice and rats, is designed to block fentanyl from entering the brain, blocking its effects and preventing overdoses.",
      "If approved, it would become the first treatment to prevent overdoses of fentanyl, which is the leading cause of drug overdose deaths, statistics show.",
      "DEADLY DRUG MIX DRIVES STAGGERING RISE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS AMONG SENIORS",
      "This is different than treatments like naloxone, which reverse the effects after an overdose.",
      "How it works",
      "The vaccine is designed to create antibodies against fentanyl, which keeps the drug from crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier.",
      "It contains a synthetic fragment of fentanyl attached to a protein called CRM197, along with dmLT, an immune-activating compound.",
      "The vaccine is designed to block fentanyl from entering the brain, blocking its effects and preventing overdoses. (iStock)",
      "This combination stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies that capture fentanyl in the bloodstream before it can reach the brain, according to the University of Houston's Colin Haile, co-founder and scientific advisor of ARMR Sciences, which licensed the vaccine.",
      "\"In a vaccinated individual, those anti-fentanyl antibodies are in the blood,\" Haile told Fox News Digital. \"So, if they consume fentanyl, the antibodies grab onto the drug and prevent it from getting into the brain. They would feel no effects if they ingest fentanyl \u2014 absolutely none. And they would not overdose.\"",
      "Eventually, he said, the fentanyl would be eliminated from the body.",
      "MAJOR CANNABIS STUDY FINDS LITTLE PROOF FOR POPULAR MEDICAL CLAIMS, FLAGS BIG DANGERS",
      "In the mice and rat studies, the animals still had antibodies against fentanyl six months after vaccination, added Haile, who is also a research associate professor of psychology at UH and a founding member of the UH Drug Discovery Institute.",
      "While some have questioned whether such a vaccine would indirectly encourage drug use, Haile pointed out that, for vaccinated people, the drug would have \"no euphoric effects.\" So, those seeking a \"high\" would not get it.",
      "Fentanyl has been known to be mixed with other substances, such as marijuana. (iStock)",
      "The main benefit, according to Haile, is that the vaccine would reduce the potential health dangers of fentanyl.",
      "\"Respiratory depression is the primary effect that induces death from this highly potent synthetic opioid,\" he said.",
      "Headed for trials",
      "Following successful testing in mice and rats, the first human clinical trial is slated to begin in early 2026 at the Center for Human Drug Research, which is associated with the University of Leiden in the Netherlands.",
      "\"They would feel no effects if they ingest fentanyl \u2014 absolutely none. And they would not overdose.\"",
      "The small Phase 1 trial will enroll about 40 participants, focusing on safety and immune response.",
      "After the Phase 1 trial for safety, a Phase 2 trial will test whether the vaccine effectively blocks fentanyl\u2019s effects in humans.",
      "Potential risks and limitations",
      "The primary limitation is that data so far is available only for mouse models, and it\u2019s unknown how effective the vaccine would be in humans.",
      "Haile told Fox News Digital there were no adverse side effects reported in the animal study, likely because the ingredients of the vaccine are proteins that have already been used in other combinations in humans, so their safety profile is already known.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "\"Also, unlike other vaccines, we use extremely low doses of the components,\" he noted. \"We have put the vaccine into a lot of animals and have not seen any adverse side effects at all.\"",
      "Even in a toxicology study, during which the researchers administered 20 times the dose of the vaccine that would be given to humans, they still saw no overt signs of toxicity, according to Haile.",
      "Potential use cases",
      "Haile mentioned several different use cases for the vaccine, primarily those with opioid use disorder who want to quit using fentanyl.",
      "It could also be used by first responders and healthcare workers who want to reduce the risk of accidental exposure.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Military and national security personnel could also benefit from the vaccine, Haile said, as it could help protect against fentanyl and fentanyl-like compounds that have been used as chemical threats.",
      "Finally, parents may be seeking protection for at-risk teens or young adults, as fentanyl has been known to be mixed with other substances, such as marijuana.",
      "The progress of the vaccine is a \"very exciting advance with a huge upside,\" a medical expert said. (iStock)",
      "Looking ahead, Haile said this could pave the way for the approval of other anti-drug vaccines, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, which are already in the works.",
      "\"If we can tackle the primary ones \u2014 fentanyl, cocaine and methamphetamine \u2014 we will be saving hundreds of thousands of lives,\" he added.",
      "\"This is likely to prevent many overdoses where a patient is sedated and stops breathing as a result of fentanyl.\"",
      "Dr. Marc Siegel, senior medical analyst for Fox News, said the progress of the vaccine is a \"very exciting advance with a huge upside.\"",
      "\"I am very glad it is now entering human trials. It is being very well-studied,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"This is likely to prevent many overdoses where a patient is sedated and stops breathing as a result of fentanyl.\"",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "The antidote for fentanyl (Narcan) is limited because fentanyl lasts for many hours, but the Narcan (an opioid antagonist) wears off after only a few hours and has to be administered again, Siegel pointed out.",

      "\"Varying movements, intensities and rhythms force the body to adapt, helping to activate all muscle groups more effectively,\" she said. \"It\u2019s a bit of a \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 philosophy \u2014 if we don\u2019t actively support flexibility and mobility, we risk losing them.\"",

      "Santa Maria agreed that Jagger\u2019s approach may be more realistic than many assume. \"I\u2019m an average, everyday person who simply wants to move well, enjoy daily life and stay active for the people and activities I love,\" she said. \"If I can do it, so can anyone.\"",
      "But for those who don\u2019t feel capable of matching Jagger\u2019s intensity, Santa Maria recommends focusing on what feels manageable. \"Trust your instincts \u2014 you know what your body and mental health need,\" he said.",

We will keep working to provide more options \u2014 expanding choices for delivery devices and creating new pathways for access \u2014 so more people can get the medicines they need.\"",
      "No. 2: Side effects",
      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Sue Decotiis, a medical weight loss doctor in New York City, confirmed that more than half of seniors stop taking a GLP-1 medication due to cost or side effects.",
      "Gastrointestinal side effects are the most common side effect of GLP-1s. (iStock)",

      "No. 4: Muscle loss",
      "Muscle loss, which is another side effect of GLP-1 medications, can be \"detrimental\" in this age group, Decotiis cautioned.",
      "When people are dehydrated or don\u2019t consume enough protein, they may lose more muscle and less fat, she said.",
      "Muscle mass loss occurs naturally with age and can be worsened by weight loss drugs, experts warn. (iStock)",

      "\"The brain consumes around 20% of your body\u2019s energy and has high demand for NAD+ for cellular energy production and DNA repair,\" Brenner, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital. \"This is because NAD+ plays a key role in the way that neurons adapt to a range of physiological stressors and support processes associated with brain health.\"",

      "In the UH Cleveland study, researchers used a medication called P7C3-A20 to restore normal levels of NAD+ in mice models, which was found to block the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s.

      "Trump, for his part, has used his first year back in office to follow through on his promises to go after his perceived political \"enemies,\" including by revoking security clearances of many individuals, including employees of a D.C.-based law firm that represents Smith, and taking other punitive measures to punish or fire FBI agents involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, investigation.",
      "During his testimony last month, Smith fiercely disputed the notion that Trump's remarks about the 2020 election results would be protected by the First Amendment.",
      "\"Absololutely not,\" he said in response to a lawyer for Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "The lawyer then ticked through a \"long list of disputed elections\" in U.S. history and former presidents who have spoken out about \"what they believed to be fraud,\" or other issues regarding election integrity. \"I think you would agree that those types of statements are sort of at the core of the First Amendment rights of a presidential candidate, right?\"",
      "\"There is no historical analog for what President Trump did in this case,\" Smith said immediately.",

      "Smith told members that the special counsel ultimately gathered evidence against Trump that was, in his view, sufficient to secure a conviction.",
      "\"He made false statements to state legislatures, to his supporters in all sorts of contexts and was aware in the days leading up to Jan. 6th that his supporters were angry when he invited them, and then he directed them to the Capitol,\" Smith said of Trump' actions in the run-up to Jan. 6.",
      "\"Now, once they were at the Capitol and once the attack on the Capitol happened, he refused to stop it. He instead issued a tweet that, without question in my mind, endangered the life of his own vice president,\" Smith added. \"And when the violence was going on, he had to be pushed repeatedly by his staff members to do anything to quell it.\"",
      "Other possible co-conspirators had not been charged, as Smith noted at one point during the interview.",
      "But Smith said in the testimony that his team had developed \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" that Trump had \"engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election and to prevent the lawful transfer of power.\"",
      "They'd also developed what he described as \"powerful evidence\" that Trump had willfully retained highly classified documents after leaving office in January 2021 at his private Mar-a-Lago residence, and had been obstructing the government's efforts to recover the records.",
      "Smith said that, when the special counsel wound down in the wake of the 2024 elections, his team had not determined whether to charge the key Trump allies who may or may not have acted as co-conspirators, including Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and John Eastman.",
      "\"As we stated in the final report, we analyzed the evidence against different co-conspirators,\" Smith said. Smith reiterated his allegation that Trump was \"the most culpable\" and \"most responsible\" person for the alleged attempts to subvert the 2020 election results.",
      "He said the special counsel had \"determined that we did have evidence to charge people at a certain point in time.\"",

      "Smith used his opening remarks to lament the ousting of FBI agents and Justice Department officials involved in the Jan. 6 investigations.",
      "\"I am both saddened and angered that President Trump has sought revenge against career prosecutors, FBI agents, and support staff simply for doing their jobs and for having worked on those cases,\" Smith said.",
      "His remarks came after the FBI in recent months ousted a handful of personnel involved in the Jan. 6 investigations, an effort individuals familiar with the action described to Fox News at the time as an act of \"retaliation.\"",
      "Thousands of FBI personnel in February were forced to fill out a sprawling questionnaire asking employees detailed questions about any role they may have played in the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riots \u2014 ranging from whether they had testified in any criminal trials to when they last participated in investigation-related activity.",

      "Those records also showed that the Public Integrity Section told prosecutors to be wary of concerns lawmakers could raise about the Constitution's speech or debate clause, which gives Congress members added protections.",
      "The subpoenas to the phone companies were accompanied by gag orders blocking the lawmakers from learning about the existence of the subpoenas for at least one year. Smith said the D.C. federal court, which authorized the gag orders, would not have been aware that they applied to Congress members.\" I don\u2019t think we identified that, because I don\u2019t think that was Department policy at the time,\" Smith said.",

      "\"We should not be measured on the number of meetings we hold or the number of surveys that are filled out,\" he said. \"We should, in fact, be measured by the way in which we incorporate that feedback into the decisions that we make.",

In that case, attackers impersonated legitimate apps and walked users through terminal commands that installed the same AMOS infostealer.",
      "According to researchers, once the terminal command is executed, the infection chain kicks off immediately. The base64 string in the command decodes into a URL that hosts a malicious bash script. That script is designed to harvest credentials, escalate privileges and establish persistence, all without triggering a visible security warning.",
      "The danger here is how clean the process looks. There's no installer window, obvious permission prompt or any option for you to review what's about to run. Because everything happens through the command line, normal download protections are sidestepped and the attacker gets to execute whatever they want.",

      "Fake AI chat results can look polished and trustworthy, even when they are designed to trick you into running harmful commands. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is this attack so effective?",
      "This campaign combines two powerful ideas. Trust in AI answers and trust in search results. Most major chat tools, including Grok on X, let users delete parts of conversations or share only selected snippets. That means an attacker can carefully curate a short, polished exchange that looks genuinely helpful while hiding the manipulative prompts that produced it.",
      "Using prompt engineering, attackers get ChatGPT to generate a step-by-step cleanup or installation guide that actually installs malware. ChatGPT's sharing feature then creates a public link that lives inside the attacker's account. From there, criminals either pay for sponsored search placement or use SEO tactics to push that shared conversation high in the results.",
      "Some ads are designed to look almost identical to legitimate links. Unless you check who the advertiser actually is, it's easy to assume it's safe. One example documented by researchers showed a sponsored result advertising a fake \"Atlas\" browser for macOS, complete with professional branding.",
      "Once those links are live, attackers don't need to do much else. They wait for users to search, click, trust the AI output and follow the instructions exactly as written.",
      "REAL APPLE SUPPORT EMAILS USED IN NEW PHISHING SCAM",
      "Attackers rely on trust in search results and AI answers, knowing most people will not question step-by-step instructions. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safe from fake AI chat malware",
      "AI tools are useful, but attackers are now shaping answers that lead you straight into trouble. These steps help you stay protected without giving up search or AI entirely.",
      "This is the most important rule. If an AI response or webpage tells you to open Terminal and paste a command, stop. Legitimate macOS fixes almost never require you to blindly run scripts copied from the internet. Once you press Enter, you lose visibility into what happens next. Malware like AMOS relies on this moment of trust to bypass normal security checks.",
      "AI chats are not authoritative sources. They can be manipulated through prompt engineering to produce dangerous step-by-step guides that look clean and confident. Before acting on any AI-generated fix, cross-check it with Apple's official documentation or a trusted developer site. If you cannot verify it easily, do not run it.",
      "A password manager creates strong, unique passwords for every account you use. If malware steals one password, it cannot unlock everything else. Many password managers also refuse to autofill credentials on fake or unfamiliar sites, which can alert you that something is wrong before you type anything manually. This single tool dramatically reduces the impact of credential-stealing malware.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "AMOS and similar malware often rely on known weaknesses after the initial infection. Updates patch these holes. Delaying updates gives attackers more room to escalate privileges or maintain persistence. Turn on automatic updates so you are protected even if you forget.",
      "Modern macOS malware often runs through scripts and memory-only techniques. A strong antivirus software doesn't just scan files. It monitors behavior, flags suspicious scripts, and can stop malicious activity even when nothing obvious is downloaded. This is especially important when malware is delivered through Terminal commands.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Paid search ads can look almost identical to legitimate results. Always check who the advertiser is before clicking. If a sponsored result leads to an AI conversation, a download or instructions to run commands, close it immediately.",
      "Search results promising quick fixes, disk cleanup or performance boosts are common malware entry points. If a guide is not hosted by Apple or a well-known developer, assume it could be risky, especially if it pushes command-line solutions.",
      "Attackers spend time making fake AI conversations look helpful and professional. Clear formatting and confident language are not signs of safety. They are often part of the deception. Slowing down and questioning the source is usually enough to break the attack chain.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This campaign shows how attackers are shifting from breaking systems to manipulating trust. Fake AI conversations work because they sound calm, helpful and authoritative. When those conversations are boosted through search results, they inherit credibility they don't deserve. The technical tricks behind AMOS are complex, but the entry point is simple. Someone follows instructions without questioning where they came from.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 07:02:37 -0500",
    "summary": "States require AI disclosure in healthcare as California, Colorado and Utah implement laws mandating transparency when artificial intelligence influences patient care decisions.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel takes a look at how artificial intelligence could vastly improve the healthcare system but points out human doctors are still needed in the equation on The Story.",
      "Artificial intelligence is quickly reshaping healthcare. It now supports diagnostic imaging, clinical decision tools, patient messages and back office workflows. According to the World Economic Forum, 4.5 billion people still lack access to essential care, and the global health worker shortage could reach 11 million by 2030. AI could help close that gap.",
      "However, as AI becomes more embedded in care, regulators are zeroing in on a simple question. Should patients be told when AI plays a role in their care?",
      "In the United States, no single federal law requires broad AI disclosure in healthcare. Instead, a growing patchwork of state laws is filling that gap. Some states require clear disclosure. Others mandate transparency indirectly through limits on how AI can be used.",

      "Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "STATE-LEVEL AI RULES SURVIVE \u2014 FOR NOW \u2014 AS SENATE SINKS MORATORIUM DESPITE WHITE HOUSE PRESSURE",
      "AI now supports many healthcare decisions, from patient communications to coverage reviews, making transparency more important than ever for trust and accountability. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI disclosure matters for trust",
      "Transparency is not a technical detail, it is a trust issue. Research across industries shows people expect to be informed when AI affects decisions that matter to them. In healthcare, that expectation is even stronger. An analysis published by CX Today found that when AI use is hidden, trust erodes quickly, even when outcomes are accurate.",
      "Healthcare depends on trust. Patients follow treatment plans, share sensitive information and stay engaged when they believe care decisions are ethical and accountable.",
      "How AI disclosure connects to HIPAA and informed consent",
      "While HIPAA does not directly regulate artificial intelligence, its principles still apply. Covered entities must clearly explain how protected health information is used and safeguarded.",
      "When AI systems analyze or generate clinical information using patient data, nondisclosure can undermine that goal. Patients may not fully understand how their information shapes care decisions.",
      "Disclosure also supports informed consent. Patients have the right to understand material factors influencing diagnosis, treatment, or care communications. Just as clinicians disclose new procedures or medical devices, meaningful AI use should be explained, so patients can ask questions and stay involved in their care.",
      "AI TOOLS COULD WEAKEN DOCTORS' SKILLS IN DETECTING COLON CANCER, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "States are stepping in where federal rules fall short, creating new disclosure requirements when AI influences care access, claims, or treatment decisions. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does AI disclosure mean in healthcare?",
      "AI disclosure means informing patients or members when artificial intelligence systems are used in healthcare-related decisions. This can include clinical messages, diagnostic support tools, utilization review, claims processing or coverage determinations. The goal is transparency, accountability and patient trust.",
      "Healthcare activities most likely to trigger disclosure",
      "According to analysis from Morgan Lewis, disclosure requirements most often apply when AI is used for:",
      "Patient-facing clinical communicationsUtilization review and utilization managementClaims processing and coverage decisionsMental health or therapeutic interactions",
      "Patient-facing clinical communications",
      "Utilization review and utilization management",
      "Claims processing and coverage decisions",
      "Mental health or therapeutic interactions",
      "These areas are considered high impact because they directly affect access to care and understanding of health information.",
      "Risks of failing to disclose AI use",
      "Healthcare organizations that fail to disclose AI use face real consequences. These include increased litigation risk, reputational damage and erosion of patient trust. Ethical concerns around autonomy and transparency can also trigger regulatory scrutiny.",
      "MORE AMERICANS ARE TURNING TO AI FOR HEALTH ADVICE",
      "Clear AI disclosure helps patients stay informed and involved, reinforcing that licensed healthcare professionals remain responsible for every medical decision. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How states are shaping AI disclosure rules",
      "States are taking different paths to regulate healthcare AI, but most are starting with one common goal: greater transparency when technology influences care.",
      "California has taken one of the most comprehensive approaches.",
      "AB 3030 requires clinics and physician offices that use generative AI for patient communications to include a clear disclaimer. Patients must also be told how to reach a human healthcare professional.",
      "SB 1120 applies to health plans and disability insurers. It requires safeguards when AI is used for utilization review. It also mandates disclosure and confirms that licensed professionals make medical necessity decisions.",
      "Colorado's SB24 205 targets AI systems considered high risk. These are tools that materially influence decisions like approval or denial of healthcare services.",
      "Entities must implement safeguards against algorithmic discrimination and disclose AI use. While broader than clinical care alone, the law directly affects patient access decisions.",
      "Utah has layered disclosure rules that intersect with healthcare.",
      "HB 452 requires mental health chatbots to clearly disclose AI use. SB 149 and SB 226 extend disclosure requirements to regulated occupations, including healthcare professionals.",
      "This approach ensures transparency in therapeutic interactions and clinical services.",
      "Other states that are expanding AI transparency",
      "Several other states are moving in the same direction. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Tennessee and New York are all considering or enforcing rules that require disclosure and human review when AI influences utilization review or claims outcomes. Even when clinical diagnosis is not covered, these laws push accountability where AI affects care access.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are a patient, expect more transparency. You may see disclosures in messages, coverage notices or digital interactions. If you work in healthcare, AI governance is no longer optional. Disclosure practices must align across clinical, administrative, and digital systems. Training staff and updating patient notices will matter as much as the technology itself. Trust will increasingly depend on how openly AI is introduced into care.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI can improve efficiency, expand access, and support clinicians. Yet its value depends on trust. Disclosure does not slow innovation. It strengthens confidence in both the technology and the professionals who use it. As states continue to act, transparency will likely become the norm rather than the exception in healthcare AI.",

Shoppers often share email addresses, phone numbers and location data to unlock discounts and faster checkout.",
      "Holiday spending continues to rise year over year. More spending means more data. As a result, your personal information spreads across more databases than at any other time of the year.",
      "After the holiday rush, data brokers update and expand their profiles using newly collected information. January is when many of these companies organize, repackage and resell their datasets.",
      "Starting the removal process early helps limit how widely your information gets shared. Since removals can take days or even weeks, acting now reduces exposure before that data circulates further.",
      "From January through April, scammers ramp up activity tied to tax season. Common threats include\u00a0IRS impersonation scams, fake refund messages and W-2 fraud. Many of these attacks rely on data pulled from broker databases.",
      "When scammers have accurate personal details, their messages feel more convincing. Reducing your data exposure now lowers the risk. Removing your information from major data broker sites is a strong first step. It also helps to check smaller, lesser-known sites that may still list your details.",

      "We could not let 2025 end without one last reminder about digital safety. Cybercriminals never slow down. In fact, the holidays and the start of a new year often bring a surge in scams, account takeovers and data theft. The good news is that cybersecurity need not feel overwhelming.

      "AMERICA'S MOST-USED PASSWORD IN 2025 REVEALED",
      "Strong passwords and two-factor authentication stop most account takeovers before they start. (Peter Steffen/picture alliance)",
      "1) Start the year with strong passwords",
      "Passwords remain your first line of defense. Weak or reused passwords make it easy for attackers to break into multiple accounts at once. Use a unique password for every account. Longer passphrases work better than short, complex strings. A reputable password manager can generate and securely store passwords, so you do not have to memorize them. One rule matters most. Never reuse passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second step after your password. This usually includes a code from an app or a physical security key. Even if someone steals your password, 2FA can block access. App-based authenticators provide stronger protection than text messages. Turn it on for email, banking, social media and shopping accounts first.",
      "3) Audit your digital presence",
      "Old accounts create new risks. Take time to review shopping sites, forums, apps and subscriptions you no longer use. Delete what you do not need. Update privacy settings on what you keep. Share less personal information whenever possible, especially birthdays, locations and phone numbers. A smaller digital footprint limits abuse.",
      "5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE",
      "Simple habits like updating software and thinking before you click block common scams. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4) Keep software and devices up to date",
      "Security updates fix real vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploit. Skipping updates leaves doors open. Enable automatic updates for operating systems, browsers, apps, routers and smart devices. This habit blocks many common attacks without extra effort. Outdated software remains one of the top causes of successful hacks.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service",
      "Your personal information appears on hundreds of data broker sites. These sites collect names, addresses, phone numbers and relatives, then sell access to anyone willing to pay. A personal data removal service helps locate and remove that information. This step reduces scam attempts, phishing messages and identity fraud risks throughout the year. Less exposed data means fewer threats.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com",
      "6) Consider identity theft protection",
      "Identity theft often starts quietly. A breach happens. Data leaks. Fraud follows months later. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Many services can also scan for accounts tied to multiple email addresses, making cleanup easier. Early alerts help you act before damage spreads.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",
      "PROTECT YOURSELF FROM SNEAKY WEB INJECTION SCAMS",
      "Backups, secure Wi-Fi and identity monitoring help limit damage when breaches happen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7) Think before you click and use strong antivirus protection",
      "Most cyberattacks still begin with a click. Fake shipping notices, refund alerts and urgent messages push people to act fast. Pause before clicking links or opening attachments. Many scams now use AI to generate realistic messages, fake voices and convincing images, making it even more important to pause before you click. Verify messages through official websites or apps instead. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection by blocking malware, ransomware and malicious downloads across your devices, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "8) Secure your home Wi-Fi network",
      "Your Wi-Fi network connects everything. That makes it a valuable target. Change the default router password right away. Enable WPA3 encryption if your router supports it. Keep router firmware up to date and avoid sharing your network with unknown devices. A secure network protects every connected device.",
      "9) Back up your data regularly",
      "Backups protect you from ransomware, hardware failure and accidental deletion. Many people still skip them. Use cloud backups, an external hard drive or both. Automate the process so it runs without reminders. If something goes wrong, backups let you recover quickly.",
      "10) Freeze your credit if you do not need it",
      "A credit freeze prevents new accounts from opening in your name. It remains one of the strongest defenses against identity fraud heading into 2026. Freezing credit is free and reversible. You can temporarily lift it when applying for loans or credit cards. This single step blocks many identity crimes outright. To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "Pro tip: Lock down your email and use aliases",
      "Your email account controls password resets, alerts and account recovery. If attackers get in, they can reach nearly everything else. Secure your primary email with a long, unique password and two-factor authentication. Then create email aliases for shopping, subscriptions and sign-ups. Aliases limit exposure when a company suffers a data breach and make phishing easier to spot. Protecting email this way strengthens every other cybersecurity resolution.",
      "By creating email aliases, you can protect your information and reduce spam. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit Cyberguy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "A safer digital life starts with small, consistent decisions. Strong passwords, updates, backups and awareness go a long way. By committing to these cybersecurity resolutions, you set yourself up for a more secure 2026. You also make it harder for criminals to profit from stolen data. There is no better time to start than now.",

      "Typosquatting domains like rnicrosoft.com are rarely used for a single purpose. Criminals reuse them across multiple scams. Common follow-ups include\u00a0credential phishing, fake HR notices and vendor payment requests. In every case, the attacker benefits from speed. The faster you act, the less likely you are to notice the mistake.",
      "Why these fake domains keep working",
      "Most people do not slow down to read URLs character by character. Familiar logos and language reinforce trust, especially during a busy workday. Mobile use makes this worse. Smaller screens, shortened links and constant notifications create perfect conditions for mistakes. This is not a Microsoft-only problem. Banks, retailers, healthcare portals and government services all face the same risk.",
      "How to stay safe from typosquatting attacks",
      "Typosquatting scams work because they rush you into trusting what looks familiar. These steps slow that moment down and help you spot fake domains before damage is done.",
      "Before clicking anything, open the full sender address in the email header. Display names and logos are easy to fake, but domains tell the real story. Look closely for swapped letters like rn in place of m, added hyphens or strange domain endings. If the address feels even slightly off, treat the message as hostile.",

      "On a desktop, hover your mouse over links to reveal the real destination. On a phone, long-press the link to preview the URL. This simple pause often exposes lookalike domains designed to steal logins. If the link does not match the exact site you expect, do not proceed.",
      "When an email claims your account needs urgent action, do not use its links. Instead, open a new browser tab and manually go to the official website using a saved bookmark. Legitimate companies do not require you to act through surprise links, and this habit cuts off most typosquatting attempts instantly.",
      "Strong antivirus software can block known phishing domains, flag malicious downloads and warn you before you enter credentials on risky sites. While it cannot catch every new typo trick, it adds an important safety net when human attention slips.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "OpenAI says it is taking stronger steps to protect teens using its chatbot. Recently, the company updated its behavior guidelines for users under 18 and released new AI literacy tools for parents and teens. The move comes as pressure mounts across the tech industry. Lawmakers, educators and child safety advocates want proof that AI companies can protect young users. Several recent tragedies have raised serious questions about the role AI chatbots may play in teen mental health. While the updates sound promising, many experts say the real test will be how these rules work in practice.",

      "OpenAI announced tougher safety rules for teen users as pressure grows on tech companies to prove AI can protect young people online. (Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "What OpenAI's new teen rules actually say",
      "OpenAI's updated Model Spec builds on existing safety limits and applies to teen users ages 13 to 17. It continues to block sexual content involving minors and discourages self-harm, delusions and manic behavior. For teens, the rules go further. The models must avoid immersive romantic roleplay, first-person intimacy, and violent or sexual roleplay, even when non-graphic. They must use extra caution when discussing body image and eating behaviors. When safety risks appear, the chatbot should prioritize protection over user autonomy. It should also avoid giving advice that helps teens hide risky behavior from caregivers. These limits apply even if a prompt is framed as fictional, historical, or educational.",
      "The four principles OpenAI says it uses to protect teens",
      "OpenAI says its approach to teen users follows four core principles:",
      "Put teen safety first, even when it limits freedomEncourage real-world support from family, friends, or professionalsSpeak with warmth and respect without treating teens like adultsBe transparent and remind users that the AI is not human",

      "The company updated its chatbot guidelines for users ages 13 to 17 and launched new AI literacy tools for parents and teens. (Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Teens are driving the AI safety debate",
      "Gen Z users are among the most active chatbot users today. Many rely on AI for homework help, creative projects and emotional support. OpenAI's recent deal with Disney could draw even more young users to the platform. That growing popularity has also brought scrutiny. Recently, attorneys general from 42 states urged major tech companies to add stronger safeguards for children and vulnerable users. At the federal level, proposed legislation could go even further. Some lawmakers want to block minors from using AI chatbots entirely.",
      "Why experts question whether AI safety rules work",
      "Despite the updates, many experts remain cautious. One major concern is engagement. Advocates argue chatbots often encourage prolonged interaction, which can become addictive for teens. Refusing certain requests could help break that cycle. Still, critics warn that examples in policy documents are not proof of consistent behavior. Past versions of the Model Spec banned excessive agreeableness, yet models continued mirroring users in harmful ways. Some experts link this behavior to what they call AI psychosis, where chatbots reinforce distorted thinking instead of challenging it.",
      "In one widely reported case, a teenager who later died by suicide spent months interacting with a chatbot. Conversation logs showed repeated mirroring and validation of distress. Internal systems flagged hundreds of messages related to self-harm. Yet the interactions continued. Former safety researchers later explained that earlier moderation systems reviewed content after the fact rather than in real time. That allowed harmful conversations to continue unchecked. OpenAI says it now uses real-time classifiers across text, images, and audio. When systems detect serious risk, trained reviewers may step in, and parents may be notified.",
      "Some advocates praise OpenAI for publicly sharing its under-18 guidelines. Many tech companies do not offer that level of transparency. Still, experts stress that written rules are not enough. What matters is how the system behaves during real conversations with vulnerable users. Without independent measurement and clear enforcement data, critics say these updates remain promises rather than proof.",
      "How parents can help teens use AI safely",
      "OpenAI says parents play a key role in helping teens use AI responsibly. The company stresses that tools alone are not enough. Active guidance matters most.",
      "OpenAI encourages regular conversations between parents and teens about how AI fits into daily life. These discussions should focus on responsible use and critical thinking. Parents are urged to remind teens that AI responses are not facts and can be wrong.",
      "OpenAI provides parental controls that let adults manage how teens interact with AI tools. These tools can limit features and add oversight. The company says safeguards are designed to reduce exposure to higher-risk topics and unsafe interactions. Here are the steps OpenAI recommends parents take.",
      "Confirm your teen's account statusParents should make sure their teen's account reflects the correct age.

      "Parents are encouraged to ask what teens use AI for, when they use it and how it makes them feel. These conversations can reveal unhealthy patterns early.",
      "Experts advise parents to look for increased isolation, emotional reliance on AI or treating chatbot responses as authority. These can signal unhealthy dependence.",

Another option sends 6-digit verification codes by text message through SMS or WhatsApp, depending on the country code. Enabling multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection beyond a password and helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access to teen accounts.",
      "Also, consider adding a strong antivirus software that can help block malicious links, fake downloads, and other threats teens may encounter while using AI tools. This adds an extra layer of protection beyond any single app or platform.\u00a0 Using strong antivirus protection and two-factor authentication together helps reduce the risk of account takeovers that could expose teens to unsafe content or impersonation risks.",

      "OpenAI's updated teen safety rules show the company is taking growing concerns seriously. Clearer limits, stronger safeguards, and more transparency are steps in the right direction. Still, policies on paper are not the same as behavior in real conversations. For teens who rely on AI every day, what matters most is how these systems respond in moments of stress, confusion, or vulnerability. That is where trust is built or lost. For parents, this moment calls for balance. AI tools can be helpful and creative. They also require guidance, boundaries, and supervision. No set of controls can replace real conversations or human support. As AI becomes more embedded in our everyday lives, the focus must stay on outcomes, not intentions. Protecting teens will depend on consistent enforcement, independent oversight, and active family involvement.",

      "Data breaches tied to financial services companies are no longer rare, but they still hit harder when Social Security numbers are involved. In the latest incident, U.S.-based fintech company 700Credit has confirmed that the personal data of more than 5.8 million people was exposed. The breach did not originate from a direct compromise of 700Credit's internal network, which makes it more concerning. It began with a third-party integration partner and quietly snowballed over several months before it was detected. By the time the issue was contained, hackers had managed to steal a significant amount of sensitive consumer data.",

      "What went wrong at 700Credit",
      "The company says the breach traces back to July, when a threat actor compromised one of its third-party integration partners, as reported by Bleeping Computer. During that intrusion, the attacker discovered an exposed API that could be used to access customer information linked to 700Credit's dealership clients. The integration partner failed to inform 700Credit about the compromise, allowing the access to continue unnoticed.",
      "Suspicious activity was only detected on October 25, when 700Credit flagged unusual behavior on its systems and launched an internal investigation. The company says it brought in third-party computer forensic specialists to assess the scope of the incident and determine what data had been affected.",
      "According to the company's findings, certain records within its web application were copied without authorization. These records are related to customers of auto dealerships that use 700Credit's services. Managing Director Ken Hill later confirmed that roughly 20% of the consumer data accessible through the affected system was stolen between May and October.",
      "What data was exposed and why it matters",
      "While 700Credit has not published an exhaustive list of every data field involved, the company has confirmed that highly sensitive personal information was exposed. This includes Social Security numbers, which significantly raises the risk of identity theft and financial fraud. When SSNs are compromised, the impact is long-term. You cannot simply change them like a password.",
      "The company has published a dedicated page on its website outlining the breach and the types of information impacted. As part of its response, 700Credit is offering affected individuals 12 months of free identity protection and credit monitoring through TransUnion. You have a 90-day window to enroll in this service after receiving the notification.",
      "Notably, audio streaming platform SoundCloud and adult video sharing platform Pornhub also suffered data breaches tied to third-party vendors. There is no indication that the same vendor was involved in all three incidents, but the cases highlight how risky third-party access can be when vendors handle sensitive consumer data.",

      "Return fraud is costing U.S. retailers billions, with nearly 1 in 10 returns flagged as suspicious, according to data from Happy Returns. (Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images)",
      "How return fraud works in the real world",
      "Return fraud often looks harmless on the surface. A shopper requests a refund for a legitimate item. Instead of sending back the real product, they ship something cheaper, damaged or completely different. Retailers often issue refunds before anyone inspects the item. That speed allows fraud to slip through and drives up costs.",
      "Industry data from Happy Returns and the National Retail Federation shows retailers will handle nearly $850 billion in returned goods in 2025, representing almost 16% of total retail sales. According to the same research, an estimated 9% of those returns are fraudulent. The report also finds that many shoppers admit to some form of return policy abuse. Importantly, because Happy Returns conducts in-person item verification and uses AI-powered automated flagging plus audit processes to catch mismatches, the rate of confirmed fraud in its network is much lower than the industry-wide estimate.",
      "Why boxless returns changed the equation",
      "Happy Returns operates nearly 8,000 in-person return drop-off locations inside stores such as Ulta Beauty and Staples, as well as at UPS locations. Shoppers can return eligible items without a box or shipping label, and refunds are often issued quickly after verification. Like any returns channel, fraud attempts can happen, but in-person drop-off, item verification, ongoing flagging and audits help keep confirmed fraud far lower than broader industry averages.",
      "Happy Returns says its boxless, in-person model already blocks many common fraud tactics, including empty boxes, partial returns and fake tracking numbers.\u00a0\"If you never touch the product, you can't actually know what's being returned matches what was sold,\" the company says. Everlane says that physical handling alone acts as a deterrent. \"Just the fact of knowing an individual will physically handle and verify the product at the Return Bar deters fraudsters from even attempting to commit fraud,\" said Jim Green, director of logistics and fulfillment at Everlane.",
      "Still, Happy Returns acknowledges that fraud tactics continue to evolve. Lookalike products and knockoffs can closely resemble the real thing, making subtle differences hard to spot without close inspection.",

      "Happy Returns is testing a new artificial intelligence system designed to flag fraudulent retail returns before refunds are issued. (Photo By Helen H. Richardson/The Denver Post via Getty Images)",
      "How Return Vision uses AI to detect fraudulent returns",
      "This holiday season, Happy Returns is piloting its new AI system with select retailers, including Everlane, Revolve and Under Armour, as return volumes spike.",
      "The new AI tool is called Return Vision. It starts working the moment a shopper initiates a return online. The system looks for unusual patterns across return timing, frequency and location. A single return may appear normal on its own. When those signals overlap in suspicious ways, the return is flagged for review before a refund is issued.",
      "At drop-off points, workers can scan item barcodes and see photos of what the item should look like. They can reject obvious mismatches on the spot. Once returns reach Happy Returns hubs in California, Pennsylvania and Mississippi, flagged packages are sent to human auditors. The items are opened and photographed, including images of the front, back and identifying labels.",
      "Those photos are fed back into the AI system, which compares them against official product images and past transaction data. Human teams review the AI assessment and make the final decision. The goal is not automation alone. It is adding multiple layers of review where fraud is harder to hide.",
      "Early results show how effective AI is at catching return fraud",
      "While still in pilot, Happy Returns says Return Vision is showing early results. Less than 1% of returns flowing through its network are flagged as high risk. Of those flagged returns, about 10% are ultimately confirmed as fraud. The average prevented loss per confirmed case is just over $200.",
      "Happy Returns says the system focuses on high-confidence cases, allowing most shoppers to move through returns without delay. The company notes that the tool does not address every form of abuse, such as wardrobing, when customers return worn items.",

      "Boxless, in-person returns are helping retailers cut down on common fraud tactics like empty boxes and fake tracking numbers. (Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why retailers are turning to AI to stop return fraud",
      "Happy Returns is not alone in turning to AI to stop return fraud. Amazon and FedEx both offer boxless returns and use automated systems to flag risky behavior. The U.S. Postal Service is rolling out similar services. Across retail, 85% of surveyed merchants say they use AI or machine learning to combat fraud. Many say the results have been mixed. Happy Returns says combining behavioral signals with physical product verification helps close gaps that data-only systems often miss.",

Happy Returns is betting that AI, combined with hands-on inspection, can tip the balance back toward retailers. Early results suggest it can help, even if it is not a cure-all.

      "Behind the HBO hit series was a real mafia family operating in New Jersey and New York: the DeCavalcante crime family. In 1999, retired FBI agent S\u00e9amus McElearney says, the bureau finally cracked the organization from the inside by flipping a violent mob soldier and triggering a chain reaction that dismantled the family.",
      "McElearney, author of the recently released \"Flipping Capo: How the FBI Dismantled the Real Sopranos,\" joined the FBI in 1998 and was assigned to Squad C-10 of the New York Organized Crime Branch, where he investigated both the Bonanno and DeCavalcante crime families, the real-life inspiration behind \"The Sopranos.\"",

      "\"When you have a proactive witness, the most important thing is trying to keep him safe,\" McElearney said. \"You have to have him think to the criminals that he\u2019s still not cooperating with the government.\"",
      "Over two years, the witness made roughly 300 consensual recordings, quietly exposing the inner workings of the real-life Sopranos.",
      "\"You have to keep up the facade that he is a criminal himself,\" McElearney said. \"If that cover blows, people get killed.\"",
      "The investigation reached a breaking point in December 1999, when McElearney led the arrest of Anthony Capo, a feared DeCavalcante soldier with a long reputation for violence and hostility toward law enforcement.",
      "\"I was assigned to arrest a violent DeCavalcante soldier named Anthony Capo,\" McElearney said. \"He had a notorious reputation against law enforcement and even within the mob itself.\"",
      "Before his cooperation, Capo had been deeply embedded in the family\u2019s bloodiest chapters. According to historical accounts, Capo was involved in the 1989 murder of Fred Weiss, a hit ordered by Gambino boss John Gotti to solidify the DeCavalcante family\u2019s standing with New York\u2019s Mafia elite. Capo helped monitor Weiss and served as the driver during the Staten Island ambush, highlighting the depth of his involvement in mob violence before he ever cooperated.",

      "\"To tell you the truth, I had no idea at all,\" McElearney said. \"I was totally stunned.\"",
      "Capo became the first made member in the DeCavalcante family\u2019s century-long history to cooperate with law enforcement, a move that shattered mafia tradition and triggered a historic domino effect.",

      "The violence Capo once participated in was also turning inward. Historical accounts show that Capo associate Joey Garofano disappeared after mishandling aspects of the Weiss hit. He is believed to have been killed by fellow mobsters who feared he might expose them, reflecting the paranoia consuming the family.",
      "Capo was also linked to the killing of acting boss John D\u2019Amato in the early 1990s, an internal execution driven by power struggles and rumors that further fractured the family\u2019s already fragile code of loyalty.",

      "The case would become one of the most consequential organized crime prosecutions in modern FBI history. Over the following years, McElearney and his team secured 71 convictions, solved 11 murders and put seven trials before federal juries, effectively dismantling the DeCavalcante crime family.",
      "The cooperation allowed prosecutors to do something almost unheard of and put the entire structure of a mafia family on the witness stand, from street associates to leadership.",
      "As \"The Sopranos\" debuted on HBO, the real-world case collided with pop culture. McElearney said the FBI captured mobsters on tape debating which real-life figures matched characters on the show.",

      "\"That recording was priceless for trial,\" he said. \"All we had to do was hit play.\"",
      "But the reality behind the show was far darker. McElearney described one of the bureau\u2019s most chilling recordings, a shooter calmly describing the execution of Joseph Conigliaro, a ruthless mob associate who used a wheelchair.",
      "\"He was shot six times,\" McElearney said. \"He got out of the car, drove away, put his blinker on and drove himself toward the hospital.\"",

      "\"That became very real very quickly,\" McElearney said.",
      "McElearney later went on to oversee investigations into the Colombo crime family, helping dismantle another major mafia organization and spearheading what the FBI has described as the largest mafia takedown in its history. Over his career, he helped convict 10 mafia bosses and solve more than 30 homicides, including 11 tied to the DeCavalcante case and more than 20 linked to Bonanno and Colombo family investigations.

      "\"Today, my client, Mel Curth, submitted her appeal of the University's Institutional Equity Office finding that she engaged in arbitrary and capricious grading of a student's assignment in violation of that student's religious liberty,\" Stewart said on Bluesky earlier this week.",

      "The students were instructed to provide a \"thoughtful discussion of some aspect of the article.\"",

      "\"Gender roles and tendencies should not be considered 'stereotypes,'\" Fulnecky wrote in her essay. \"Women naturally want to do womanly things because God created us with those womanly desires in our hearts. The same goes for men. God created men in the image of His courage and strength, and He created women in the image of His beauty. He intentionally created women differently than men and we should live our lives with that in mind.\"",
      "She later described the normalization of non-binary gender as \"demonic.\"",

      "\"Please note that I am not deducting points because you have certain beliefs, but instead I am deducting point [sic] for you posting a reaction paper that does not answer the questions for this assignment, contradicts itself, heavily uses personal ideology over empirical evidence in a scientific class, and is at times offensive,\" Curth's explanation for the grade said, later adding that the essay was \"offensive\" and claiming that science backs the idea that \"gender is neither binary nor fixed.\"",

      "\"Does the paper present a thoughtful reaction or response to the article, rather than a summary?\" was the second, also worth up to 10 points.",

    "story": [
      "Former FBI agent Jonathan Gilliam told Fox News Digital he thinks political violence is beginning to be considered acceptable by too many Americans.",
      "A former FBI agent is warning that political violence has \"just started\" as 2026 begins.",
      "Conservative influencer and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk became the most high-profile victim of political violence in 2025 when he was killed on Sept. 10. Authorities have not publicly identified a motive, but officials have described the killing as a \"political assassination,\" underscoring growing concerns about ideologically-driven attacks in the U.S.",
      "Investigators have said one of the bullets allegedly used by suspect Tyler Robinson was engraved with the phrase, \"Hey fascist, catch,\" a detail that has fueled debate over whether political rhetoric is increasingly bleeding into real-world violence.",
      "To some extent, those warning signs aren't subtle. The Department of Homeland Security reported in November that in 2025, there was more than a 1,150% increase in assaults and violent attacks against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers when compared to the same period last year under the Biden administration.",

      "In late September, one ICE detainee was killed, and two others were injured when a gunman opened fire on an agency facility. The suspect, later identified as Joshua Jahn, allegedly searched apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents.",
      "Officials said Jahn had a handwritten note that stated, \"Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, 'is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?\"",
      "The same pattern of targeted, ideologically-driven violence also surfaced when there were two assassination attempts against now-President Donald Trump. On July 13, 2024, authorities said 20-year-old Thomas Crooks fired several shots during a Butler, Pennsylvania, rally, one of which struck Trump in the ear. Just a couple of months later, on Sept. 15, 2024, 58-year-old Ryan Routh was arrested after authorities said he was seen armed with a rifle in a sniper's hide near the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "Former FBI agent Jonathan Gilliam said Kirk\u2019s death fits into a broader pattern that has become increasingly difficult to ignore. In an interview with Fox News Digital, he warned that political violence is being normalized.",

      "\"I think there are signs that this type of violence is being normalized,\" Gilliam said. \"When you look at, for instance, Luigi Mangione in the assassination of an insurance CEO, what you've seen is that a large part of the population was somewhat OK with that and have made him into somewhat of a hero.\"",
      "Gilliam said he's concerned that some Americans' tolerance for political and ideological violence has only expanded in recent years.",
      "\"When they go out, and they commit acts of violence, but not killing, people start to ask the question, \u2018Is that justified?\u2019 And then, when it gets more and more violent, there will be less people, but actually still a great vast majority of those people that have been convinced will agree and justify the violence,\" Gilliam said.",

      "Gilliam warned he thinks the U.S. hasn't witnessed the peak of political violence, but it will only get worse.",
      "\"I believe that political violence, as we know it now, has just started,\" Gilliam said. \"So when we look now at the political violence that's happening, we're also seeing much more violent behavior, very targeted behavior. It's violence and killing against different Jewish groups, against Christians, against people who are outwardly trying to have dialogue. And so rather than support that dialogue, what we have seen is political violence to shut that violence down or that dialogue down.\"",

He didn\u2019t provide more detail about how the U.S. would control Venezuela, saying a group of officials would be named to oversee it.",
      "Trump said he didn\u2019t want a new leader to take over in the wake of Maduro\u2019s capture who would result in \u201cthe same situation that we had for the last long period of years.\u201d",

      "\u201cLast night, the weather broke just enough, clearing a path that only the most skilled aviators in the world could maneuver through,\u201d he said.",
      "Caine said that Trump gave the order to go at 10:46 p.m. ET Friday and that military forces arrived at Maduro\u2019s compound by 1:01 a.m. ET Saturday. By 3:29 a.m. Saturday, Caine said, the military forces were back over water with Maduro and Flores.",
      "Trump, who said he watched the operation unfold live from Mar-a-Lago, said Maduro \u201cwas trying to get into a safe place\u201d made of steel as U.S. military forces stormed his compound.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen what we have. It\u2019s both horrible and breathtaking that something like this could have been allowed to take place for many years after his term as president of Venezuela expired,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMaduro remained in power and waged a ceaseless campaign of violence, terror and subversion against the United States of America, threatening not only our people, but the stability of the entire region.\u201d",
      "Maduro was first indicted, alongside 14 other people, in 2020, during Trump\u2019s first administration, in the Southern District of New York.

      "The U.S. action was a stunning culmination of months of rising threats from Trump and his administration toward Maduro. Carried out without congressional authorization, it immediately drew pushback and questions from lawmakers. In his remarks, Trump said U.S. oil companies were prepared to make major investments in the country.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump said it wouldn\u2019t cost the U.S. anything to \u201crun\u201d Venezuela, pointing to the country\u2019s oil production, saying, \u201cThe money coming out of the ground is very substantial.\u201d",
      "Later, he told reporters, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground, and that wealth is going to the people of Venezuela and people from outside of Venezuela that used to be in Venezuela, and it goes also to the United States of America in the form of reimbursement for the damages caused us by that country.\u201d",
      "In her remarks on state television, Rodriguez accused the U.S. of instituting regime change solely for the purpose of extracting oil and other natural resources from Venezuela.",

Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement Saturday.",
      "In a separate statement, Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., said, \u201cTrump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.\u201d",

      "By that point, an armada of U.S. warships was floating off Venezuela\u2019s shores. A CIA team had crept into the country, tracking Maduro\u2019s movements and habits: where he slept, what he ate, where he traveled.",
      "\u201cYou got to surrender,\u201d Trump said, recalling the conversation at a news conference Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago home.",
      "Maduro took the gamble of his life. He \u201ccame close\u201d to giving in, Trump said, but stayed put.",
      "That act of defiance set in motion the final phase of a secret and risky plan to evict Maduro by force. At 10:46 p.m. ET Friday, Trump gave the final order to launch.",
      "This account of \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve,\u201d the most audacious military action in either of Trump\u2019s terms, is based on interviews with more than a dozen White House, administration and congressional officials, as well as public statements.",

      "As early as August, the CIA quietly sent a small unit into Venezuela with the goal of providing \u201cextraordinary insight\u201d into Maduro\u2019s movements, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Even his pets were known to U.S. intelligence agents, Dan \u201cRaizin\u201d Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the news conference Saturday.",
      "Elite troops trained for months, going so far as to use a replica of the presidential compound based on intelligence that the U.S. had gathered, Trump said in an interview with Fox News \u2014 the same way the troops who killed Osama bin Laden practiced in 2011 with a model of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. They trained with what Trump called \u201cmassive blowtorches\u201d in case they had to cut through steel walls in Maduro\u2019s safe room.",
      "At the same time, a core Trump administration team worked privately on the project for months, holding regular meetings and phone calls and briefing Trump, a person knowledgeable about the matter said.",
      "That group consisted of some of the people Trump said will now be running Venezuela, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the person said.",
      "Throughout the fall, Trump steadily amped up the pressure on Maduro. In September, the Trump administration began sinking boats in the Caribbean that it alleged were sending drugs to the U.S. Experts said, however, that the boats were shipping cocaine to Europe. All told, the administration has struck at least 35 alleged drug vessels so far, killing 114 people.",
      "The rationale for the boat strikes shifted over time. Was it drugs Trump wanted to destroy, or the Maduro regime? In an interview she gave Vanity Fair in November, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said the purpose was to attack the boats until Maduro \u201ccries uncle.\u201d",
      "She also said in the interview that an attack on the Venezuela mainland would require congressional approval \u2014 something the White House hasn\u2019t gotten.",
      "\u201cIf he were to authorize some activity on land, then it\u2019s war, then [we\u2019d need] Congress,\u201d Wiles told the author, Chris Whipple.",

      "\u201cA lot of ships out there,\u201d Trump said at the news conference.",
      "Trump left the White House for the holidays on Dec. 19, with Mar-a-Lago serving as his headquarters for the final planning. He approved the operation before Christmas, though the exact day was uncertain, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "Venezuela wasn\u2019t his only worry. On Christmas Day, he announced he had ordered strikes on militants in Nigeria in response to alleged persecution of Christians.",
      "At a New Year\u2019s Eve party at his home, dressed in a tuxedo with first lady Melania Trump at his side, Trump was asked by reporters about his resolution for 2026.",
      "\u201cPeace on Earth,\u201d he said.",
      "So secret was the Venezuela assault that even the precise timing wasn\u2019t widely known at the Pentagon until Friday night, two U.S. officials told NBC News. Typically, the timing of such a military operation would have wider coordination.",
      "Vice President JD Vance went to Trump\u2019s golf club in West Palm Beach and met with him during the day Friday to discuss the strikes. But he left before the attack started, in deference to concerns that a late-night motorcade movement might tip off the Venezuelans about the coming raid, a Vance spokesperson said.",
      "Wind and cloud cover in Caracas had delayed the attack for days, but Friday, the weather broke. The moon was full, and the skies had mostly cleared \u2014 acceptable conditions for the pilots and crews.",
      "The mission was on.",
      "\u201cGood luck and Godspeed,\u201d Trump told military leaders, words they transmitted down the chain, Caine said.",
      "Trump spent much of the night and early morning at his home watching the attack play out. A picture released by the White House shows him sitting at a table, fingers interlocked, wearing a jacket but not his customary tie, staring intently at what presumably was a video screen out of the frame. Standing to his left is Rubio; to his right, Ratcliffe. Miller is seated, arms crossed. Congress wouldn\u2019t be notified until the attack was underway. Trump said Saturday he didn\u2019t want lawmakers to leak details.",
      "At least 150 aircraft flew toward Caracas from 20 different bases on land and sea. The fleet included bombers, fighters and craft that specialized in intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, Caine said. The crews ranged in age from 20 to 49.",
      "Darkness cloaked the Venezuelan capital. Trump suggested that the U.S. had cut the electricity in Caracas to gain an edge in the battle. Flying at 100 feet above the water, helicopters carried the special forces and law enforcement officials who plucked Maduro from his residence, Caine said. Other aircraft fired weapons to disable Venezuela\u2019s air defense systems and clear a path for the helicopters, he added.",
      "Flames were seen billowing from explosions at Fort Tiuna, a large military complex in Caracas.",
      "By 1 a.m. ET Saturday, U.S. soldiers had reached the compound in Caracas where Maduro was staying. \u201cA heavily fortified military fortress,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "When Delta Force breached Maduro\u2019s residence, he and his wife were taken \u201ccompletely by surprise,\u201d Caine said. Maduro tried to escape into what Trump described as a steel safe room but didn\u2019t make it in time. The forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, into custody.",
      "A firefight broke out after Maduro was captured, Caine said, and a U.S. helicopter was hit. No Americans were killed, though there were several injuries to U.S. troops, all of whom are stable, according to a U.S. official and a White House official.",
      "By 3:30 a.m. ET, U.S. forces were safely out of the country, Caine said. At that time, the air in Caracas smelled of gunpowder and smoke. The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela cautioned American citizens there to shelter in place.",
      "Less than an hour later, Trump broke the news to the world on social media.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A picture the White House posted Saturday morning showed Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima assault ship in a sweatsuit, handcuffed and blindfolded.",
      "By 4:30 p.m. ET, Maduro was in New York. He arrived at Stewart Airport in New Windsor north of New York City. Dozens of law enforcement officers flanked Maduro as he shuffled to the hangar. He and his wife were to be transported to a jail in New York City later in the day. On Monday, Maduro is expected to make his first court appearance.",
      "He and his alleged co-conspirators face prosecution for a scheme in which a \u201ccycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,\" the indictment alleges.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been here eight years, eight years already,\u201d Yajaira said, referring to how long she\u2019s been in the U.S. \u201cThey killed my older brother. It was so tough. They kidnapped my brothers. That was tough. I thank God for all of this because it\u2019s been tough,\u201d she said, her voice breaking as she looked up at the sky.",
      "Throughout the morning, the growing crowds in Doral were chanting in Spanish, \u201cThe government is over, the government has fallen,\u201d amid the blasting car horns and music.",
      "Venezuelans started coming to Florida and the U.S. in large numbers in the early 2000s after socialist Hugo Ch\u00e1vez rose to power. The situation deteriorated drastically when Maduro took over in 2013. Under Maduro, the country\u2019s oil-driven economy has faced a decadelong collapse and an estimated 80% of residents live in poverty. Around 8 million Venezuelans have fled under his rule.",
      "President Donald Trump said the U.S. is \u201cgoing to run\u201d Venezuela following Maduro\u2019s capture \u201cuntil such time as a safe, proper and judicious transition can take place.\u201d He said Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has been sworn is as president; she has called for Maduro\u2019s release.",
      "Diana Monert, also celebrating in Doral, was asked what the recent events mean for Venezuelans. \u201cFreedom,\u201d she said.",
      "The relief and jubilation stretched across other parts of the country. In Cincinnati, Rossaly Nava, 43, a property manager, said, \u201cMy heart is racing \u2014 this is the biggest miracle that has happened in my lifetime. ... I have spent so many hours awake and I really want to contribute to recovering my country.\u201d",

      "\"This is epic,\" she said. \"We are very happy for this.\"",
      "Another woman, a Venezuelan migrant who relocated to Colombia when she was 18, said she was shocked by the news.",
      "\"People who claim the United States shouldn\u2019t have done that because it\u2019s about sovereignty, but it turns out that Venezuela hasn\u2019t had sovereignty for over 20 years because we don\u2019t have control of our oil, we don\u2019t have control of our natural resources, and we\u2019ve been robbed for many, many years,\" she said in Spanish.",
      "\"Without sovereignty, we have nothing to protect us because the government is itself,\" she said.",

      "When asked how his family in Venezuela was doing, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re excited, but at the same time they have fear, they\u2019re waiting for what\u2019s going to happen \u2014 what\u2019s going to be the next step.\u201d",
      "Patricia Andrade, who helps newly arrived migrants through her Miami nonprofit Raices Venezolanas, said she has mixed feelings.",
      "\u201cI spent years waiting for the Chavez-Maduro regime to fall,\u201d she said.",
      "While it has given her great happiness to see Maduro in U.S. custody, there are still many more Venezuelan officials to be arrested, she said.",
      "Adelys Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, a grassroots group working to amplify Venezuelan American voices and issues in the U.S., said she was celebrating that \u201cjustice is taking its course and that Maduro responds for all the crimes he\u2019s committed.\u201d",
      "But she warned that \u201cVenezuela is still not free from Chavismo,\u201d referring to the government\u2019s socialist rule started by Ch\u00e1vez. \u201cI hope that the innocents, the good people in Venezuela, who are the majority, will be protected,\u201d she said.",
      "Ferro added that she hopes \u201cTrump understands Venezuelans here in the U.S. also fled and need protection. It\u2019s no time for more attacks and persecution of Venezuelan immigrants. Those people fled a dictatorship and they\u2019re not Tren de Aragua.\u201d",
      "Ferro noted more than 6 in 10 Venezuelans in the U.S. came through temporary protected status, which the Trump administration has rescinded. She also urged Trump to recognize that there\u2019s a need for bipartisan support for Venezuelans. \u201cWhat we need is support in this critical moment,\u201d she said.",
      "'Something was coming'",
      "In Venezuela, a resident who didn\u2019t want to be named for their own safety said, \u201cWe had different tips that something was coming, Trump had already announced something,\u201d adding the events reminded them of the late writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s novel \u201cChronicle of a Death Foretold.\u201d",
      "Speaking hours after the attack, the Venezuelan resident said \u201cnobody is in support of the invasion, the violence, but we aren\u2019t also in support of the people who didn\u2019t win the election,\u201d referring to Maduro, who remained in power despite credible evidence that his opponent won the 2024 election.",
      "\u201cWe are humble citizens \u2014 we\u2019re caught. How is it possible that they took they took the president and his wife? Was it someone who betrayed him? There is so much uncertainty and so much fear,\u201d the resident said. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed that they just took him.\u201d",
      "Yanire Lucas, a Caracas resident, told The Associated Press she was scared to even leave the house. \u201cWhat is happening is unprecedented,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cWe\u2019re still on edge, and now we\u2019re uncertain about what to do. Stay safe at home, go out to look for food? I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s statement that the U.S. would \u201crun\u201d Venezuela is opening up a host of questions over what will happen in the next few days and months.",

      "Follow live coverage",
      "Venezuela\u2019s vast oil reserves are the largest in the world, likely the equivalent of about 300 billion barrels, according to the Energy Institute, a research firm. Its reserves top those of even the No. 1 OPEC oil-producing country, Saudi Arabia.",
      "But ramping up oil production would likely require years of work and sizable investments to modernize its industry, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, something that will also require a certain level of political stability. Trump said in his public address that the U.S. would \u201crun\u201d Venezuela for the time being but did not specify who would be involved or how.",
      "\u201cWe built Venezuela\u2019s oil industry with American talent, drive, skill, and the socialist regime stole it from us,\u201d Trump asserted. \u201cThis constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey stole our oil,\u201d he added. \u201cThey took it over like it was nothing.\u201d",

      "Venezuela has for decades enjoyed a level of economic success thanks to its oil, which it supplies to a variety of trading partners. Currently, China is Venezuela\u2019s top oil customer, according to analysts, but due to the secretive nature of some of those exports exact data is hard to come by.",

      "Major U.S. involvement in Venezuela\u2019s oil sector could be transformational for the industry and energy markets, although establishing the infrastructure to drill, store and export that oil could take years to materialize.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s vast reserves are highly concentrated in one part of the country. Tapping that supply would be technically feasible but likely very costly due to years of decay that the country\u2019s energy infrastructure has suffered due to an economy weakened by strict U.S. sanctions.",

      "\u201cThe extraction of extra-heavy crude oil requires a higher level of technical expertise, which international oil companies possess but their involvement has been limited by international sanctions,\u201d the agency said. \u201cFurthermore, budgetary constraints at Venezuela\u2019s state oil company PDVSA and a lack of qualified technical personnel and foreign direct investment have all hampered Venezuela\u2019s oil and natural gas development.\u201d",
      "Due to those sanctions and budget restraints, PDVSA is still the largest source of revenue for the Maduro government.",

      "A redditor said they cried \"for an hour\" after the finale. Another called it an \"11/10 finale.\"",
      "A fan on Threads likened the finale to the feeling of becoming an adult: \"Perfect. No notes. For me, that\u2019s exactly what it felt like to grow up. Leaving a sacred portal in time before you\u2019re ready.\"",
      "But what exactly happens, and where does it leave Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown)? Here's what to know about the ambiguous ending.",
      "What Happens to Eleven in the 'Stranger Things' Finale?",
      "The episode's title, \"The Rightside Up,\" indicates what happens in the finale: Things are put, well, right, and that involves the closing of the Upside Down, the portal that opened in Season 1.",
      "Eleven and Will (Noah Schnapp) defeat Vecna. But there's more that needs to be done: The Upside Down itself needs to be destroyed.",
      "Eleven seems to understand her role in the next phase of the plan, but others in her life are resistant. \"I have to end the cycle,\" Eleven tells Hopper (David Harbour), her adoptive father.",
      "He's skeptical, delivering a speech about her deserving a better life. \"Life has been so unfair to you. So cruel. But you never let it break you. I need you to fight, kid,\" Hopper says.",

      "Depends on who you ask.",
      "After the sequence, the episode cuts to the future. It's the day of high school graduation and Mike confesses to Hopper he's \"not OK\" with the idea of moving on from Eleven.",
      "So does he create a story that helps him cope with his new reality, or has he really picked up on an alternate explanation of Eleven's fate?",
      "At the end of the episode, the gang is back playing Dungeons and Dragons. Using their Dungeons and Dragons characters as stand-ins, Mike tells stories about all his friends and what happens to them next. The show then cuts to their futures, indicating that Mike got it right with his predictions.",
      "\"But there is a story he can never tell,\" Mike says. The story of the mage \u2014 Eleven's character As for the real story?",

      "Ross Duffer said Eleven's death, or disappearance, was integral to the story ending. Eleven represents childhood \u2014 and the finale is all about the kids of \u201cStranger Things\u201d growing up.",
      "\"For us and our writers, we didn\u2019t want to take her powers away. She represents magic in a lot of ways and the magic of childhood. For our characters to move on and for the story of Hawkins and the Upside Down to come to a close, Eleven had to go away,\" Ross Duffer said.",
      "There was no way Eleven was going to carry out Hopper\u2019s dream of her becoming a \u201cregular\u201d girl, essentially.",
      "The Duffer brothers aren't ruling out whether she's alive, but confirm she's not coming back to the kids of Hawkins. That's the power of Mike's story, which allows her to remain a presence in their lives.",
      "\"If Eleven is out there, the most that they could hope for is a belief that it\u2019s true because they can\u2019t be in contact with her. Everything falls apart if that were the case. So if that\u2019s the narrative, this is really the best way to keep her alive. And it\u2019s about Mike and everyone finding a way to move past what\u2019s happened,\" Matt Duffer said."

      "In \"Marty Supreme,\" Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet plays Marty Mauser, a fictionalized version of Marty Reisman, a real life table tennis star whose heyday was the 1940s and '50s.",
      "\"Marty Supreme\" co-writer and director Josh Safdie told the Hollywood Reporter the movie is an \"homage\" to table tennis pro Reisman rather than a biography.",
      "In the movie, Chalamet's character is a New York City shoe salesman in the 1950s whose flashy skills with a ping-pong paddle \u2014 and his sheer bravado \u2014 take the small and gritty table tennis world by storm.",
      "Chalamet's Marty has a nose for trouble and will do just about anything, legal or otherwise, to scrape up the dough needed to travel to the sport's open in Tokyo.",
      "The real-life Marty Reisman, whose slim physique earned him the nickname \"The Needle,\" was known for his swaggering style and for bringing a bit of razzle-dazzle to an often, at least at the time, overlooked sport.",
      "Like the Hollywood version of him, the sharp-dressed Reisman's one and only goal was to be known as the best table tennis player in the world, a pursuit he once called \"noble.\"",
      "Read on to learn more about Marty Reisman, the real-life man who inspired \"Marty Supreme.\"",
      "Marty Reisman Was a Superstar Table Tennis Player",
      "Reisman was born in February 1930 in New York City, according to his 1974 memoir, \"The Money Player: The Confessions of America's Greatest Table Tennis Champion and Hustler.\"",
      "\"I was a cocky gregarious kid, a bit of a showman and a showoff even then,\" he wrote in his memoir \u2014 qualities he'd have the rest of his life.",
      "His bold personality and undeniably athletic skills helped him to become a legend in the table tennis world. In his biography, he talks about his love for gambling and betting \u2014 on himself.",
      "He won his first championship in 1946, becoming the United States Junior National Champion, a feat he repeated the next year.  He went on to win multiple others, including a United States Doubles Championship in 1949 and a Singles Championship in 1958.",
      "In 1997, when he was 67, he became the oldest person to win a national championship in a racket sport, per his obituary.",
      "He Started Playing the Game As a Child to Deal with Anxiety",

      "\u201cI had a nervous breakdown when I was 9 years old and ended up in Bellevue Hospital. Ping-Pong was the ultimate escape. My racket became a sensuous connection between the ball and my brain,\" he told Forbes for an interview published in 2005.",
      "By 13, Reisman had become a city junior champion, often hustling other players for money at Lawrence\u2019s Broadway Table Tennis Club in New York City, reported Forbes. When he was 16, he did a tour of England with a three-man exhibition team, wowing audiences with their paddle skills.",
      "As \"Marty Supreme\" depicts, Reisman worked briefly as a shoe salesman, his only foray into the 9-5 world. For the rest of his life, he relied on his ping-pong skills to make money, he told Forbes.",
      "\"No one has ever been less suited for regular employment than I was,\" he quipped.",
      "He Was Famous for Performing Flashy Tricks",
      "After Reisman learned audiences would pay to see him do tricks while playing ping-pong, he began appearing in special exhibitions.",
      "He and U.S. teammate Doug Cartland accepted an offer to be the opening act for three years for the basketball trickster the Harlem Globetrotters, delighting audiences by playing \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb\u201d using frying pans, according to his biography.",
      "Reisman's signature trick, which he showed off during a visit to \"The Late Night Show with David Letterman\" in 2008, was snapping a cigarette in half with a slam.",
      "\"No other player was willing to try it before a large audience. It can be embarrassing to miss four or five times in a row. It is impossible to explain the shot. It involves a communion between the racket, the ball, and the cigarette, and takes a great deal of confidence,\" he wrote in his memoir.",
      "He Was Obsessed with Being the Best at His Sport",
      "Reisman's goal was to be the best ping-pong player in the world. He talked about his passion for the sport in in his memoir.",
      "His earnings were enough to make him a three-time millionaire, fortunes he repeatedly lost, according to The New York Times.",
      "\u201cI took on people in the gladiatorial spirit,\u201d he told the Times in March 2012, just months before his death.",
      "He Was As Impish As Chalamet's Character",
      "Like Chalamet's character in \"Marty Supreme,\" Reisman was also a the bad boy of his sport.",
      "In 1949, Reisman traveled to the English Open where he and fellow American player Dick Miles traded their modest London hotel for swankier accommodations. The pair ran up a tab on room service and other luxuries, charging it all to the English Table Tennis Association, according to his memoir.",
      "When the English officials balked, refusing to pay the bill, Reisman and Miles said they wouldn't participate in their sold-out exhibition matches.",
      "The English officials ended up covering the costs but fined the men $200 and suspended them from sanctioned table tennis worldwide. Reisman wrote the sanction was lifted in 1950.",
      "Reisman Died in 2012",
      "Reisman died in December 2012 of complications of heart and lung ailments at the age of 82, according to The New York Times.",
      "His death was announced by Table Tennis Nation, an organization Reisman founded in 2010.",

      "Their picks include two different WWII-set novels, a tale of a spontaneous road trip and a children's book written by a rising star in music.",
      "Keep an eye on these books and set your new year off in literary style.",
      "Isaac Fitzgerald's picks",
      "\"The Rest of Our Lives\" by Ben Markovits",
      "Isaac says: \"'The Rest of Our Lives' is a brilliantly humane and wildly absorbing story. Benjamin Markovits\u2019s magnetic prose feels both effortless and precise, as we follow Tom Layward who \u2014 after dropping his daughter off at college \u2014 just keeps driving. Here is a book that will find its home amongst the other great American road trip novels. An absolute triumph.\"",
      "\"On Morrison\" by Namwali Serpell",
      "Isaac says: \"'On Morrison' is a dazzling work of criticism. Namwali Serpell uses intellectual rigor alongside inventive flair to tackle Toni Morrison\u2019s writing in ways that feel both fresh and deeply expanding. This book is an illuminating guide to understanding how best to read, understand, and admire one of American literature\u2019s greatest voices.\"",
      "\"Lost Lambs\" by Madeline Cash",
      "Isaac says: \"'Lost Lambs' is an incredibly tender \u2014 yet also hilarious \u2014 debut. Madeline Cash explores adolescence, faith, family, and power through the lens of a tightly controlled religious community, where devotion and vulnerability exist side by side. With wildly inventive writing, Lost Lambs captures moral uncertainty and emotional awakening with remarkable precision. This novel marks the emergence of an incredible new talent in Madeline Cash.\"",
      "\"Mei Mei The Bunny\" by Laufey",
      "Isaac says: \"'Mei Mei the Bunny' is a gentle, charming children\u2019s book about a shy but curious bunny learning how to be brave, kind, and true to herself. Alongside beautiful illustrations by Lauren O\u2019Hara, Laufey\u2019s tender story offers a comforting message about growth, empathy, and finding joy in small moments. A great read aloud to return to again and again with the young ones in your life.\"",
      "Adriana Trigiani's picks",
      "\"Skylark\" by Paula McLain",
      "Adriana says: \"Paula McLain returns to Paris in this page-turning tale that goes between Alouette Voland\u2019s quest for artistic freedom in 1664 and Dr. Kristof Larson\u2019s dangerous mission during German occupation in 1939. Paula is one of our great American novelists, and 'Skylark' might be her best yet.\"",
      "\"Work in Progress\" by James Martin, SJ",
      "Adriana says: \"In Father James Martin\u2019s forthcoming memoir, 'Work in Progress,' we really get to know the beloved priest and his journey to becoming a leader in the Catholic Church. This is a coming-of-age story perfect for all readers of all faiths: relatable, readable, and full of wisdom.\"",
      "\"Keeper of Lost Children\" by Sadeqa Johnson",
      "Adriana says: \"Sadeqa Johnson is the master of historical fiction and 'Keeper of the Lost Children' does not disappoint. Set in post-WWII Germany, this novel visits an orphanage filled with the abandoned mixed-race children of German women and Black American GI\u2019s. This is an unknown history about love, resilience and identity.\"",
      "\"One Whole Hippopotamus\" by Carter Higgins",
      "Adriana says: \"'One Whole Hippopotamus' is an adorable introduction to early learning for our smallest readers. Acclaimed author Carter Higgins gives us an interactive and vibrant book perfect for teachers, librarians and parents to share with their little ones.\""

      "\u201cYou can have a great first word and eliminate a bunch of possible options. And then if you just screw it up and guess duplicate letters later on, you\u2019ve ruined your chances.

      "PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Donald Trump gave the Venezuelan leader one last chance to step down.",
      "In a private phone call a week ago, Trump told Nicol\u00e1s Maduro that he had to go.",
      "By that point, an armada of U.S. warships was floating off Venezuela\u2019s shores. A CIA team had crept into the country, tracking Maduro\u2019s movements and habits: where he slept, what he ate, where he traveled.",
      "\u201cYou got to surrender,\u201d Trump said, recalling the conversation at a news conference Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago home.",
      "Maduro took the gamble of his life. He \u201ccame close\u201d to giving in, Trump said, but stayed put.",
      "That act of defiance set in motion the final phase of a secret and risky plan to evict Maduro by force. At 10:46 p.m. ET Friday, Trump gave the final order to launch.",
      "This account of \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve,\u201d the most audacious military action in either of Trump\u2019s terms, is based on interviews with more than a dozen White House, administration and congressional officials, as well as public statements.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "As early as August, the CIA quietly sent a small unit into Venezuela with the goal of providing \u201cextraordinary insight\u201d into Maduro\u2019s movements, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Even his pets were known to U.S. intelligence agents, Dan \u201cRaizin\u201d Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the news conference Saturday.",
      "Elite troops trained for months, going so far as to use a replica of the presidential compound based on intelligence that the U.S. had gathered, Trump said in an interview with Fox News \u2014 the same way the troops who killed Osama bin Laden practiced in 2011 with a model of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. They trained with what Trump called \u201cmassive blowtorches\u201d in case they had to cut through steel walls in Maduro\u2019s safe room.",
      "At the same time, a core Trump administration team worked privately on the project for months, holding regular meetings and phone calls and briefing Trump, a person knowledgeable about the matter said.",
      "That group consisted of some of the people Trump said will now be running Venezuela, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the person said.",
      "Throughout the fall, Trump steadily amped up the pressure on Maduro. In September, the Trump administration began sinking boats in the Caribbean that it alleged were sending drugs to the U.S. Experts said, however, that the boats were shipping cocaine to Europe. All told, the administration has struck at least 35 alleged drug vessels so far, killing 114 people.",
      "The rationale for the boat strikes shifted over time. Was it drugs Trump wanted to destroy, or the Maduro regime? In an interview she gave Vanity Fair in November, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said the purpose was to attack the boats until Maduro \u201ccries uncle.\u201d",
      "She also said in the interview that an attack on the Venezuela mainland would require congressional approval \u2014 something the White House hasn\u2019t gotten.",
      "\u201cIf he were to authorize some activity on land, then it\u2019s war, then [we\u2019d need] Congress,\u201d Wiles told the author, Chris Whipple.",
      "The same month, America\u2019s most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, swept into the Caribbean, part of a military buildup that Trump believed got the attention of Maduro.",
      "\u201cA lot of ships out there,\u201d Trump said at the news conference.",
      "Trump left the White House for the holidays on Dec. 19, with Mar-a-Lago serving as his headquarters for the final planning. He approved the operation before Christmas, though the exact day was uncertain, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "Venezuela wasn\u2019t his only worry. On Christmas Day, he announced he had ordered strikes on militants in Nigeria in response to alleged persecution of Christians.",
      "At a New Year\u2019s Eve party at his home, dressed in a tuxedo with first lady Melania Trump at his side, Trump was asked by reporters about his resolution for 2026.",
      "\u201cPeace on Earth,\u201d he said.",
      "So secret was the Venezuela assault that even the precise timing wasn\u2019t widely known at the Pentagon until Friday night, two U.S. officials told NBC News. Typically, the timing of such a military operation would have wider coordination.",
      "Vice President JD Vance went to Trump\u2019s golf club in West Palm Beach and met with him during the day Friday to discuss the strikes. But he left before the attack started, in deference to concerns that a late-night motorcade movement might tip off the Venezuelans about the coming raid, a Vance spokesperson said.",
      "Wind and cloud cover in Caracas had delayed the attack for days, but Friday, the weather broke. The moon was full, and the skies had mostly cleared \u2014 acceptable conditions for the pilots and crews.",
      "The mission was on.",
      "\u201cGood luck and Godspeed,\u201d Trump told military leaders, words they transmitted down the chain, Caine said.",
      "Trump spent much of the night and early morning at his home watching the attack play out. A picture released by the White House shows him sitting at a table, fingers interlocked, wearing a jacket but not his customary tie, staring intently at what presumably was a video screen out of the frame. Standing to his left is Rubio; to his right, Ratcliffe. Miller is seated, arms crossed. Congress wouldn\u2019t be notified until the attack was underway. Trump said Saturday he didn\u2019t want lawmakers to leak details.",
      "At least 150 aircraft flew toward Caracas from 20 different bases on land and sea. The fleet included bombers, fighters and craft that specialized in intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, Caine said. The crews ranged in age from 20 to 49.",
      "Darkness cloaked the Venezuelan capital. Trump suggested that the U.S. had cut the electricity in Caracas to gain an edge in the battle. Flying at 100 feet above the water, helicopters carried the special forces and law enforcement officials who plucked Maduro from his residence, Caine said. Other aircraft fired weapons to disable Venezuela\u2019s air defense systems and clear a path for the helicopters, he added.",
      "Flames were seen billowing from explosions at Fort Tiuna, a large military complex in Caracas.",
      "By 1 a.m. ET Saturday, U.S. soldiers had reached the compound in Caracas where Maduro was staying. \u201cA heavily fortified military fortress,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "When Delta Force breached Maduro\u2019s residence, he and his wife were taken \u201ccompletely by surprise,\u201d Caine said. Maduro tried to escape into what Trump described as a steel safe room but didn\u2019t make it in time. The forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, into custody.",
      "A firefight broke out after Maduro was captured, Caine said, and a U.S. helicopter was hit. No Americans were killed, though there were several injuries to U.S. troops, all of whom are stable, according to a U.S. official and a White House official.",
      "By 3:30 a.m. ET, U.S. forces were safely out of the country, Caine said. At that time, the air in Caracas smelled of gunpowder and smoke. The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela cautioned American citizens there to shelter in place.",
      "Less than an hour later, Trump broke the news to the world on social media.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A picture the White House posted Saturday morning showed Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima assault ship in a sweatsuit, handcuffed and blindfolded.",
      "By 4:30 p.m. ET, Maduro was in New York. He arrived at Stewart Airport in New Windsor north of New York City. Dozens of law enforcement officers flanked Maduro as he shuffled to the hangar. He and his wife were to be transported to a jail in New York City later in the day. On Monday, Maduro is expected to make his first court appearance.",
      "He and his alleged co-conspirators face prosecution for a scheme in which a \u201ccycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,\" the indictment alleges.",
      "Following the strike, Trump made it clear that \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve\u201d wasn\u2019t a one-off. Nor was it solely about apprehending someone the U.S. considers a fugitive. The military campaign amounts to a dramatic escalation of presidential authority, with Trump attempting to mold the hemisphere to a revised version of \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy.",
      "In a twist on the 19th century Monroe Doctrine, which asserted a distinct sphere of influence for the young American nation, Trump is demonstrating that he\u2019ll use hard power to promote U.S. interests and create advantageous conditions for business.",
      "\u201cThe Donroe Doctrine,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "The U.S. isn\u2019t leaving Venezuela soon, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to run it essentially until such time as a proper transition can take place.\u201d",
      "Looking back at his fateful phone call with Maduro, Trump suggested at the news conference that Maduro had chosen poorly in not heeding his command.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d Trump said, \u201che wished he did.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been here eight years, eight years already,\u201d Yajaira said, referring to how long she\u2019s been in the U.S. \u201cThey killed my older brother. It was so tough. They kidnapped my brothers. That was tough. I thank God for all of this because it\u2019s been tough,\u201d she said, her voice breaking as she looked up at the sky.",
      "Throughout the morning, the growing crowds in Doral were chanting in Spanish, \u201cThe government is over, the government has fallen,\u201d amid the blasting car horns and music.",
      "Venezuelans started coming to Florida and the U.S. in large numbers in the early 2000s after socialist Hugo Ch\u00e1vez rose to power. The situation deteriorated drastically when Maduro took over in 2013. Under Maduro, the country\u2019s oil-driven economy has faced a decadelong collapse and an estimated 80% of residents live in poverty. Around 8 million Venezuelans have fled under his rule.",
      "President Donald Trump said the U.S. is \u201cgoing to run\u201d Venezuela following Maduro\u2019s capture \u201cuntil such time as a safe, proper and judicious transition can take place.\u201d He said Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has been sworn is as president; she has called for Maduro\u2019s release.",
      "Diana Monert, also celebrating in Doral, was asked what the recent events mean for Venezuelans. \u201cFreedom,\u201d she said.",
      "The relief and jubilation stretched across other parts of the country. In Cincinnati, Rossaly Nava, 43, a property manager, said, \u201cMy heart is racing \u2014 this is the biggest miracle that has happened in my lifetime. ... I have spent so many hours awake and I really want to contribute to recovering my country.\u201d",

      "\"This is epic,\" she said. \"We are very happy for this.\"",
      "Another woman, a Venezuelan migrant who relocated to Colombia when she was 18, said she was shocked by the news.",
      "\"People who claim the United States shouldn\u2019t have done that because it\u2019s about sovereignty, but it turns out that Venezuela hasn\u2019t had sovereignty for over 20 years because we don\u2019t have control of our oil, we don\u2019t have control of our natural resources, and we\u2019ve been robbed for many, many years,\" she said in Spanish.",
      "\"Without sovereignty, we have nothing to protect us because the government is itself,\" she said.",

      "Ferro added that she hopes \u201cTrump understands Venezuelans here in the U.S. also fled and need protection. It\u2019s no time for more attacks and persecution of Venezuelan immigrants. Those people fled a dictatorship and they\u2019re not Tren de Aragua.\u201d",
      "Ferro noted more than 6 in 10 Venezuelans in the U.S. came through temporary protected status, which the Trump administration has rescinded. She also urged Trump to recognize that there\u2019s a need for bipartisan support for Venezuelans. \u201cWhat we need is support in this critical moment,\u201d she said.",

      "In Venezuela, a resident who didn\u2019t want to be named for their own safety said, \u201cWe had different tips that something was coming, Trump had already announced something,\u201d adding the events reminded them of the late writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s novel \u201cChronicle of a Death Foretold.\u201d",
      "Speaking hours after the attack, the Venezuelan resident said \u201cnobody is in support of the invasion, the violence, but we aren\u2019t also in support of the people who didn\u2019t win the election,\u201d referring to Maduro, who remained in power despite credible evidence that his opponent won the 2024 election.",

There is so much uncertainty and so much fear,\u201d the resident said. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed that they just took him.\u201d",
      "Yanire Lucas, a Caracas resident, told The Associated Press she was scared to even leave the house. \u201cWhat is happening is unprecedented,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cWe\u2019re still on edge, and now we\u2019re uncertain about what to do. Stay safe at home, go out to look for food? I don\u2019t know.\u201d",

      "Follow live coverage",
      "Venezuela\u2019s vast oil reserves are the largest in the world, likely the equivalent of about 300 billion barrels, according to the Energy Institute, a research firm. Its reserves top those of even the No. 1 OPEC oil-producing country, Saudi Arabia.",
      "But ramping up oil production would likely require years of work and sizable investments to modernize its industry, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, something that will also require a certain level of political stability. Trump said in his public address that the U.S. would \u201crun\u201d Venezuela for the time being but did not specify who would be involved or how.",
      "\u201cWe built Venezuela\u2019s oil industry with American talent, drive, skill, and the socialist regime stole it from us,\u201d Trump asserted. \u201cThis constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country.\u201d",
      "Trump said the embargo he imposed on Venezuela oil remains \u201cin full effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey stole our oil,\u201d he added. \u201cThey took it over like it was nothing.\u201d",

      "Venezuela has for decades enjoyed a level of economic success thanks to its oil, which it supplies to a variety of trading partners.

      "Major U.S. involvement in Venezuela\u2019s oil sector could be transformational for the industry and energy markets, although establishing the infrastructure to drill, store and export that oil could take years to materialize.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s vast reserves are highly concentrated in one part of the country. Tapping that supply would be technically feasible but likely very costly due to years of decay that the country\u2019s energy infrastructure has suffered due to an economy weakened by strict U.S. sanctions.",

      "\u201cThe extraction of extra-heavy crude oil requires a higher level of technical expertise, which international oil companies possess but their involvement has been limited by international sanctions,\u201d the agency said. \u201cFurthermore, budgetary constraints at Venezuela\u2019s state oil company PDVSA and a lack of qualified technical personnel and foreign direct investment have all hampered Venezuela\u2019s oil and natural gas development.\u201d",
      "Due to those sanctions and budget restraints, PDVSA is still the largest source of revenue for the Maduro government.",
      "The infrastructure is decades old, though, made more difficult by the extra-heavy crude oil. The EIA estimates that many of Venezuela\u2019s oil pipelines are more than 50 years old.",
      "Restoring the country\u2019s oil production to just 1990s levels would require more than $8 billion in investments, EIA said, citing PDVSA estimates.",

      "\"There could be a small bump in their output over the next six months,\" Kilduff added, noting that the extra production could help with the recent downward trajectory in gas prices for consumers. \"So yes, U.S. consumers could see a further decrease at the pump on top of what they've already been seeing over the past several months.\"",

      "A photo shows partygoers hoisting wine bottles fitted with sparklers, yet even as they toast the occasion flames are already visible on the foam soundproofing lining the low ceiling of the bar at the upscale Alpine ski resort.",
      "The fire, which broke out around 1:30 a.m. (7:30 p.m. ET Wednesday) at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland and left 40 dead, appears to have started when sparklers atop bottles were brought too close to the ceiling, Beatrice Pilloud, the Valais canton Attorney General, told a news conference Friday after preliminary investigations.",
      "The sparklers appear to have led to \u201cwhat is referred to as a flashover incident where the fire spread very rapidly,\u201d she said. Investigators would assess soundproofing foam used in the ceiling, and whether anyone needs to be held criminally liable for the fire, she added.",

The nationality is unknown for 14 of those injured.",
      "On Thursday evening, mourners had arranged hundreds of candles at a traffic circle near the venue, which had by this point been covered up in white plastic by authorities.

      "Swiss President Guy Parmelin described it Thursday as \u201cone of the worst tragedies that our country has experienced.\u201d",
      "Geneva University Hospitals said it was treating five people. Most patients were young, between 15 and 30 years old, said Dr. Robert Larribau, the chief physician at the hospitals' emergency department.",
      "He told NBC News that many of them had \"serious injuries\" that appeared to have been caused by the twin phenomena of \"backdraft\" and \"flashover.\"",
      "Backdraft is when new air comes into contact with a fire that has used up all the available oxygen. This can lead \"to immediate fatal injuries, including severe blast trauma, extensive thermal damage, and lethal inhalation of toxic gases,\" Larribau said, \"and is therefore more commonly observed among nonsurvivors rather than among rescued victims.\"",
      "Flashover occurs when all flammable materials in an enclosed space ignite simultaneously, causing \"severe, often deep, burns predominantly affecting exposed body areas such as the face, neck, and upper limbs, and is frequently associated with critical inhalation injury due to intense radiant heat and superheated gases,\" he said.",
      "\"For those who survive, there will be weeks or even months of rehabilitation, and many will suffer lifelong consequences,\" he added.",
      "Authorities said they had ruled out terrorism, saying that an explosion at the venue was caused by the fire, rather than the other way round.",
      "They have not commented on the images of bottles fitted with sparklers. Those novelty drinks have appeared in past promotional videos for the bar, served by waiting staff wearing helmets rimmed with neon lights.",

      "Calling it an \u201cunprecedented tragedy,\u201d Valais canton police commander Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gisler said many of the injured are in critical condition.",
      "\"The priority will be to identify those who lost their lives,\" Gisler said at a news conference.",
      "Swiss President Guy Parmelin said that many of the victims were young people and the victims include Swiss residents as well as tourists from neighboring countries and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cBehind these numbers are faces, names, families, destinies brutally interrupted,\u201d Parmelin said at the press conference.",
      "The new year was less than two hours old when the fire that devoured the Le Constellation in the town of Crans-Montana was first reported around 1:30 a.m. (7:30 p.m. ET Wednesday), Gisler said.",
      "Investigators are still probing the cause of the blaze. But Beatrice Pilloud, the Valais canton attorney, said they don\u2019t believe the fire was caused by an explosion, although the \u201cmain and working assumption is that a general fire caused an explosion.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt no moment is there a question of any kind of attack,\u201d said Pilloud. \u201cAn investigation has been launched, not against anyone, but to shed light on the circumstances surrounding this tragic fire.\"",

      "Martin Meul, a reporter for Swiss German-language daily newspaper Blick, told NBC News\u2019 British broadcasting partner Sky News that he was in a restaurant next door to Le Constellation when the fire broke out.",
      "\u201cI went out to see what happened, and a lot of people were screaming and it was horrible,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people were trying to escape through the main door. I saw a lot of people on the floor, and I think these people were dead.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Russia rang in the new year by launching more than 200 drones at Ukraine, while President Vladimir Putin used his year-end address to rally support for his troops and to assure his nation of victory.",
      "In Ukraine itself, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s Dec. 31 address was defiant but also optimistic about the frenetic shuttle diplomacy being brokered by the United States.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Russia, whose officials are also in talks with the Americans, remains the central barrier to peace, with Putin unyielding in his maximalist demands.",
      "\u201cI would give anything in the world if, in this address, I could say that peace will also come in just a few minutes,\u201d Zelenskyy said just before the clock struck midnight. \u201cUnfortunately, I cannot say that yet. But with a clear conscience, I \u2014 all of us \u2014 can say that Ukraine is truly doing everything for peace.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian leader recently returned from a meeting with President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday. Afterward, Zelenskyy said Trump had offered 15 years of the crucial \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d that he says are essential to stop Putin from attacking again. Ukraine had asked for 50 years, he said.",
      "Hours before the new year\u2019s bells chimed, Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff posted on X that he had held a call with Zelenskyy, Ukrainian national security secretary Rustem Umerov and the national security advisers of Britain, France and Germany.",
      "In his own post on X, Umerov said Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner were also on the call.",
      "Though Zelenskyy said that the \u201cpeace agreement is 90% ready,\u201d he suggested that the remaining 10% contained the thorniest issues preventing peace.",
      "\u201cThose are the 10% that will determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live,\u201d he said. \u201cTen percent to save millions of lives. Ten percent of the determination needed for peace to work 100%. Ten percent of the unity and wisdom so desperately needed \u2014 Ukrainian, American, European, from the entire world. Ten percent to peace.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian leader charted what has been a roller-coaster year trying to retain the goodwill of Trump, a pivotal and changeable figure in the peace process. Zelenskyy said \u201cit was not easy at all to achieve such a change in the tone of relations between Ukraine and the United States\u201d after he clashed with Trump and Vice President JD Vance in an extraordinary White House meeting in February.",
      "Trump has often shifted between appearing to favor Russia and then Ukraine during these negotiations, and has at various points been criticized for freezing Ukraine and Europe out of the process.",
      "\u201cWithout Ukraine, nothing will work. Ukraine has defended its right to have a voice,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding later: \u201cUkraine is, in fact, the only shield that now separates Europe\u2019s comfortable way of life from the Russian world.\u201d",
      "Hours after Zelenskyy spoke, Russia launched 205 drones \u2014 mostly Iran-designed Shaheds along with some Russian Gerbera drones \u2014 into Ukraine, according to the country\u2019s military. Air defense systems downed 176 of these, but 24 strikes were recorded at 15 locations, it said. There was also shelling right along the line of contact between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "At least two people were killed and more than a dozen injured across the country, according to regional officials.",
      "For its part, Ukraine launched a strike against Russia\u2019s Rosrezerv oil depot in the Yaroslavl region, the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, said in a statement. The SBU said this was the latest strike designed to \u201ccut off the supply chains of Russian petroleum products with surgical precision, both abroad and for the troops attacking Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Russia claimed this week that Ukraine had attempted to assassinate Putin with a drone strike on his country residence, something that Ukraine denied and the CIA concluded was not true, a source with knowledge of the matter told NBC News.",
      "In his own New Year\u2019s address, Putin said his country was striving \u201cto bring joy and warmth\u201d to those in need, as well as the \u201cheroes\u201d fighting in Ukraine. \u201cI wish all our soldiers and commanders a happy new year! We believe in you and in our victory,\u201d he said.",

      "The other witness, who is also a member of the Wayuu indigenous community and did not want to provide his full name for fear of reprisals, corroborated Ana\u2019s story in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was a missile or a rocket. The truth is, we don\u2019t know what it was,\u201d the second witness said. \u201cBut it was a big explosion.\u201d",
      "According to Ana, representatives from the Venezuelan government showed up the morning after she heard the blast \u2014 around 10 a.m. Dec. 19. She said local residents asked them for help, for a doctor to check on the hearing problems and for new fishing nets and hammocks, which had also been blown up.",
      "Ana said one of government representatives blamed the U.S. and said: \u201cThe gringos did this.\u201d",
      "NBC News asked the Venezuelan government for comment and did not immediately receive a response. It is not clear who was responsible for the Dec. 18 explosion.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful to be alive,\u201d Ana said. \u201cBut we\u2019re scared.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Trump declined to answer when he was asked whether it was the military or the CIA that conducted the strike inside Venezuela that he described last week.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that,\u201d he said. \u201cI know exactly who it was, but I don\u2019t want to say who it was. But you know, it was along the shore.\u201d",
      "With details so scarce, Trump\u2019s comments have touched off a wave of speculation inside Venezuela about the U.S.\u2019 target. For days, local news reports and videos on social media have circulated of a explosion last Wednesday in Maracaibo, a major port city.",
      "Primazol, a chemical production company, said one of its warehouses had caught fire. In a statement later, it \u201ccategorically rejected\u201d rumors on social media that the fire was connected to any U.S. strike.",
      "But in a lengthy post on X, Colombia President Gustavo Petro said \u201cTrump bombed a factory in Maracaibo\u201d where it was feared that the ELN was mixing coca paste to make cocaine and take advantage of the port\u2019s location by the sea.",
      "\u201cTrump has been led to believe that I am a front man for Maduro, hence his recent references to me,\u201d Petro wrote, referring to former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. \u201cI thought that American intelligence was more professional, or that even if it is, the U.S. president doesn\u2019t listen to it and surrounds himself with greedy far-right individuals who are not looking for the truth.\u201d"
